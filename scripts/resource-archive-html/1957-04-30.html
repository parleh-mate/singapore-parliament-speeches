<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on

Amendment to Question (29th April, 1957),



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly-

<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

when  we  adjourned  yesterday  afternoon  I   was

dealing with paragraph 30 of the Report, a  clause

which the Colonial Office has imposed upon us as a

condition  of the agreement arrived at,  a  clause

which forbids persons known to have taken part  in

subversive  activities from  taking  part  in  the

first   election.  Sir,  this  condition   clearly

reveals  an absolute ignorance, if I may  say  so,

Sir,  of  the  understanding on the  part  of  the

Colonial Office of the nature of nationalism  that

exists  today in this part of the world.  In  this

part  of  the  world,  Sir,  nationalism  is  very

sensitive.    People   who   are   fighting    for

independence  do  not like an imposition  of  this

nature.  It may be, Sir, and I believe it  is  so,

that we ourselves might



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1856</b></font><br><br>



like  to  make it a condition that those  who  are

known  to have taken part in subversive activities

should  not be allowed to take part in  the  first

election,  but we do not like such a condition  to

be  imposed, if I may say so again, Sir, as if  it

comes from above.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday I was enumerating the changes

which   will  be  brought  about  when   the   new

constitution comes into force, and my  next  point

is found in paragraph 36 which reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her Majesty's Government to have the conduct of

external  defence and external relations, provided

that  the  Government of the State  of  Singapore,

acting   with   the   assent  of   Her   Majesty's

Government,  shall have the power to initiate  and

conduct  matters  concerning  trade  and  cultural

relations with other countries."



<br><br>This is a new thing, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next new thing, Sir, is this consultative

machinery.  There will be continuous  consultation

between  the Government of the State of  Singapore

and  the  Government of the United Kingdom,  which

Committee  will  meet at least  once  a  month  to

discuss  any  matters affecting Singapore  arising

from  the  United  Kingdom's responsibilities  for

external affairs or defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we already have the Public Service

Commission, and this will continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judiciary, Sir, will remain independent, as

it  is now, and this is most essential because  we

have  been taught and we know that justice  should

not  only be done, but should be seen to be  done;

and therefore the independence of the judiciary is

of   vital  importance  to  the  independence   of

Singapore  which is, I hope, coming  in  the  near

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing, Sir, which is most important and

which   is  entirely  new,  is  the  question   of

citizenship.  For  the first  time,  Sir,  in  the

history  of Singapore, the aliens will be given  a

chance to take part in the administration of  this

territory.  For  a  long  time,  Sir,  mostly  the

Chinese  have been treated as aliens, and  when  a

large  group  of  people  living  here  have  been

treated  as aliens, they will remain aliens,  Sir.

So this is one of the wisest moves which have been

made recently and achieved. These



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1857</b></font><br><br>



aliens, now being given the right to take part  in

the  administration of the country, will certainly

be  able in the near future to identify themselves

entirely with this country and forget the  country

of their origin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, I should not finish my speech and

sit down without congratulating the Chief Minister

and  his  delegation for the unity with which  the

team  had  worked in London, a unity  which  I  am

proud  to  say  the  Labour  Front  Bulletin   has

described  "as amounting to military  discipline".

Sir,  I  extend my congratulations  to  the  Chief

Minister and his delegation.



<br><br>10.10 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  had intended, when this session  began - it

seems  a  long  time ago - to speak on the  original

motion,  and  observing how the  debate  developed

following  the amendment moved by the  Member  for

Cairnhill,  I  determined  I  would  hold  to   my

intention, feeling that to speak on the  amendment

would  be  rather  like intervening  in  a  family

squabble. Since then much ground has been covered.

Members  have  reminisced over  events  that  have

taken place during the past year, stirring up some

sediment in doing so, and drawing back the curtain

to  reveal secrets hitherto concealed. We have had

lectures  on  constitutional law and on  geography

and  on political economy. So now, Sir, I am still

speaking  on  the amendment, because  I  fear  the

terms of the original motion are so limited that I

might  easily stray into irrelevancies, if ever  I

had the opportunity of speaking on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Nominated Independent, I have not a great

deal to contribute to this debate, and in any case

there  can be very little left to say.  I  do  not

think  I  am very greatly interested in  attacking

the  Member  for Cairnhill - not that he  could  not

take  it - but I feel the House has had  enough  for

the  time  being of contumely. One has  frequently

heard  the  expression  "the  cut  and  thrust  of

debate",  but  figures of speech relating  to  the

fencing art would be too refined to describe  what

we  have listened to here these last few days. One

would have to go to the circus



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1858</b></font><br><br>



ring  or  the  theatrical burlesque  to  find  the

appropriate metaphor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt, Sir, if this debate has done us very

much  good, and my sympathies are with  the  Chief

Minister when he expressed his sadness of heart at

the  way it had developed. I can also imagine  the

serene politicians of the Federation looking  down

their  noses at the political turmoil of Singapore

and washing their hands of us. And speaking of the

Federation, while there is something  to  be  said

for the logicality of union, I should have thought

that  we were entitled to more consideration  than

coming  in as just the eleventh State, as I  think

was suggested by the Member for Tanjong Pagar,  if

I  am  not mistaken. The prosperity of this island

is  not  one  hundred per cent  dependent  on  the

Federation,  nor  is  the entrepot  trade,  though

perhaps  declining, entirely due to a geographical

accident. It relies greatly on the genius  of  the

local    merchants,   particularly   the   Chinese

merchants, in anticipating markets in the adjacent

and  contiguous  territories. Our rubber  and  tin

markets,  our  port facilities,  our  services  in

banking  and  insurance - these various points  were

mentioned  yesterday by the Hon, the Minister  for

Communications and Works (Mr Francis  Thomas) - are

highly developed and we have a lot to offer a  co-operative partner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the immediate implementation of the

new  constitution as called for in the  amendment,

or  even its speedy implementation, I have just  a

word to say. I - we have had a lot of Vitamin "I" in

the last few days - I, with a consistency worthy  of

the  Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar,  who  is  always

reminding  the  House of his consistency  and  his

elephantine  memory - I  mean,  the  elephant  never

forgets - I have always been against this territory

achieving independence too quickly and would  have

liked to see the Rendel Constitution run its four-year  course. Ironically enough, in spite  of  the

efforts  of  Parties  in this Assembly,  beginning

almost  before  they  had studied  their  Standing

Orders or read the Singapore Order in Council,  to

throw it out, it looks as if it will run tiga suku

of its course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Ampat suku.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> As a matter of fact, my own

sojourn in this country is limited and I doubt  if

I  could  afford  to retire here even  if  I  were

willing to risk a ducking in the sea; but I  think

the Rendel Constitution may yet see me out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my own position in this Assembly is becoming

increasingly anachronistic. On the first day I sat

in  this  House  I  was  reminded  that  Nominated

Members  speak only for themselves.  Later  I  was

reminded  by  the  Member  for  Cairnhill  that  I

represented  capital interests and that  Sir  John

Nicoll  had  so appointed me. Sir John  Nicoll  in

point  of  fact  never said so, nor  have  British

capital  interests ever approached me to speak  on

their   behalf  in  this  House - very  wisely,   I

apprehend.  However, Sir, I wish I had  a  mandate

today  to speak for British capital interests,  or

even   for   the   British  European  Association.

Nevertheless,  Sir,  I  will  tell  you  what  the

European  business  community  think  about,   the

result  of  the All-Party Delegation's mission  to

London.  They  think  that  the  Hon. the   Chief

Minister,  who has led this delegation,  and  whom

they  regard  as  a  first-class  negotiator,  has

brought  back the bacon. They also think that  the

Chief  Minister has brought stability to Singapore

following a certain loss of confidence last  year,

and that he is the best man to cement and maintain

friendly relations with the Federation Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think I have any enemies in the

House, not real enemies - I am scarcely important or

significant enough to incur any serious degree  of

inimicality - but  if anyone feels slightly  hostile

towards  me, I would remind him that, in spite  of

efforts  to  acquire a manly tan, my skin  remains

recalcitrantly  white,  and  my  outlook  slightly

colonial.  I cannot, Sir, shout merdeka because  I

cannot   possibly  feel  that  way.  But   I   can

understand  how  the  local-born  feel  and  I  am

absolutely  convinced that the bulk of  the  local

population are very satisfied with the  result  of

the  London talks, if indeed the ovation given  to

the   returning  delegates  on  the   padang   was

something  less  than  conquering  Caesar  got  on

returning to Rome, it was,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1860</b></font><br><br>



I   think,  because  the  result  was  a  foregone

conclusion and the people were already  inured  to

the idea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, Sir, I must oppose the

amendment.



<br><br>10.18 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

when I came here last Wednesday I thought that the

sitting  was going to finish in a day, or  at  the

very  most in two days, but it dragged on  and  on

and  on,  hence we are still here today. In  fact,

where the original motion was concerned, there was

not much to say about it, or there should not have

been  so many Members speaking on it, had  it  not

been  for  the amendment moved by the  Member  for

Cairnhill, and that part which started the  debate

has  made us so bored because we have been  forced

to  sit  here  for  one whole  week  listening  to

unnecessary speeches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Report itself, Sir, it was accepted by the

whole  Assembly  and  it was  a  mandate  of  this

Assembly  as a result of the All-Party  Conference

where Independents were not included, as they  are

considered no man's baby. However, Sir, although I

am  an Independent and I was not consulted - but  in

the interests of the country and the people - I gave

my blessing to the delegation which left here very

shortly  after  the sitting on the 5th  of  March,

because I expected that the delegation would bring

back what the people of Singapore wanted. I do not

see  much to discuss about the Report, though many

Members  have spoken about it. In fact, I  had  no

intention of speaking at all had it been  approved

on  the  first or second day of the session.  From

what  I  have  heard  of the speeches,  some  were

relevant and others were not, so I feel that it is

not  necessary for me to touch on the Report  now.

On  the  question  of  irrelevance,  most  of  the

speeches  were  in fact directed at  the  ex-Chief

Minister, the Member for Cairnhill. They were  not

centred  on  the motion itself. As you might  have

heard, Sir, all those speeches were concerned with

what happened at the ex-Chief Minister's flat, and

what  happened  during last year's  delegation  to

London. What has all this to do with-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, are we having a post-mortem on the speeches made in the House?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It appears to me that the hon.

Member  is  imagining that he is in this particular

Chair.  I  think  the  question  of  relevance   or

irrelevance is a matter for the Chair and  not  for

the hon. Member.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, I will not touch on the

question  of irrelevance then. The attack  directed

at  the ex-Chief Minister, however justified it may

be,  is uncalled for, because I believe that he was

very  sincere in his fight for merdeka.  He  fought

hard  in the interests of the people and the colony

of  Singapore and I cannot see why all this  attack

should be directed at him. He failed, and it is not

that  Mr  David Marshall failed. It is  the  whole

delegation that failed last year and all Parties in

this Assembly should accept responsibility for that

failure and not Mr David Marshall alone.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I expect the hon. Member

means the Member for Cairnhill?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Yes, Sir, I was referring to

Mr   David  Marshall  as  leader  of  last  year's

delegation  and  I am referring to the  Member  for

Cairnhill,  Sir. Now, as a result of that  failure,

unfortunately,  Sir, the Member  for  Cairnhill  is

suffering  from mental strain - a number of  speakers

had said so - and what I am afraid, Sir, is that this

mental  strain is a real torture to him,  and  with

all  this attack launched against him, it  will  be

unfortunate if it lands him into hospital.  Instead

of  maybe losing the Member for Cairnhill in a  by-election, I am afraid that we may find him a member

in Woodbridge Hospital. If there had been an attack

on  the  ex-Chief Minister, Sir, I thought that  it

should  have  come  from the ex-Labour  Fronters - my

colleagues  the Member for Kampong  Kapor  and  the

Member  for Farrer Park and I myself - as we  had  to

Cairnhill-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was under the impression

that  the  hon.  Member understood  the  difference

between relevance and irrelevance. I must hold  now

that  what  the hon. Member is saying is completely

irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am sorry, Sir. I will try to

confine myself to the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a Chinese saying, and I will quote

it  in  Chinese since we are going to  have  multi-lingualism in the Assembly:



<br><br><div align="center"><i>"Nan say hoo kee boh hoo toh."</i></div>



<br><br>I  will try and interpret this in English. It means

that  "human  nature  always helps  those  who  are

prosperous and progressive and suppresses those who

are  suffering  from poverty and are down-trodden."

Why  then,  Sir, now that the ex-Chief Minister  is

down  should we all direct our attack against  him?

Can we not give him a chance?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He asked for it!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Oh, no, not because he asked

for it.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have already ruled that what the

hon.  Member is saying up to now is irrelevant.  If

he  wishes to speak on the amendment, he may do so,

but let us not have any more irrelevancies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir. I will

confine  myself to the amendment now. What I  could

see  is just a clash between two personalities.  It

is  not  concerned at all with the original motion,

because, arising out of this amendment, a challenge

has  been thrown out and accepted. Why then  should

we  argue  on  the amendment when  it  is  a  clash

between two personalities? Let us confine ourselves

to the original motion itself rather than argue and

argue.  I am quite happy that about 70 per cent  of

the  Members  have spoken and I think  we  are  not

going to waste too much time now and I do hope that

we can finish this morning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the amendment itself I will now declare my

stand - I am not in the least concerned at  all.  As

to the original



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1863</b></font><br><br>



motion,  a mandate was given and I stick  to  that

mandate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the words proposed to be left

out, be left out."

<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Would the Chair explain to the

affected by the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Well, Mr Speaker, Sir, I was

seeking your indulgence in that matter because the

second  part of the motion might be deemed  to  be

deleted  when,  in putting the Question,  you  say

"all the words in (1) are deleted". People may not

understand  that the words in (2) of the  original

motion are not affected.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is the hon. Member's point? I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1864</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>10.35 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  should say that the proposal  for  a  new

constitution  which  the  Merdeka  Delegation  has

brought  back with them is an improvement  on  the

present Rendel Constitution. Although it does  not

make  Singapore  an independent  sovereign  State,

nevertheless it is designed to confer on Singapore

full   internal   self-government,   leaving   the

responsibility  for external affairs  and  defence

still  in the hands of the British Government.  It

was  made  clear, Sir, by all Parties  before  the

Merdeka  Delegation  went to London  that  merdeka

could  not be achieved by the delegation,  but  at

the  most the delegation could only hope for  full

internal self-government. That was the task  which

the  delegation set itself and the measure of  its

success must be gauged against this objective. All

Parties  are now agreed that it is absurd to  talk

of a sovereign State of Singapore existing side by

side with an independent Federation of Malaya  and

entirely separate from it. Circumstances, however,

beyond the control of the people of Singapore have

made  the  merger of Singapore with the Federation

of  Malaya impossible at present. We have now  had

time,  Sir,  to  study  the  proposals  which  the

delegation has brought back. The House  has  heard

all  that has been said during the past few  days,

and  there is not much for me to add to  what  has

been said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in one of the paragraphs of the Report, it

is stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The task of the Conference was to agree upon the

provisions  to  be embodied in a new  Constitution

for Singapore."



<br><br>The operative words, Sir, I need hardly point, are

"to  agree". Unfortunately, there is in  the  same

Report  a  declaration by the Secretary  of  State

that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". . .persons known to have been engaged in

subversive  activity should not  be  eligible  for

election to the first Legislative Assembly of  the

new State of Singapore."



<br><br>That  is  to be a condition precedent to  the  new

constitution which Her Majesty's Government  would

have  to  impose. Sir, it is obvious that this  is

designed to exclude from this Assembly leaders of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1865</b></font><br><br>



the trade union movement, like the Member for Bukit

Timah (Mr Lim Ching Siong) and his friends who are

now being detained under the Preservation of Public

Security   Ordinance.  Without   such   restrictive

conditions,  popular leaders have been  elected  to

Assemblies  and  Parliaments while  serving  prison

sentences.  Sir,  the first Prime Minister  of  the

State  of  Ghana  was  elected  by  the  Convention

People's  Party when he was in prison and at  least

two  Members of Parliament representing  the  Irish

Nationalist  Movement  were  returned  in   similar

circumstances. Of course, these two were  prevented

from  taking  their  seats.  The  Members  of   the

delegation have recorded their opposition  to  this

departure from normal democratic practice and  have

protested against the unilateral imposition of this

condition by the Secretary of State. They also told

the  Secretary of State that they would not  accede

to this condition. As stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The task of the Conference was to agree upon the

provisions to be embodied in a new Constitution for

Singapore...".



<br><br>I do not see, Sir, how the Secretary of State could

have taken it upon himself to impose this condition

on  the  Singapore  delegation and  so  make  it  a

condition  precedent to the acceptance of  the  new

constitution by the Legislative Assembly. It is not

the  Secretary of State but the people of Singapore

through their elected representatives who will have

to  work the new constitution. It is only right and

proper  therefore that the elected  representatives

of  the  people  in  the  new Legislative  Assembly

should  be  given the chance to work or to  operate

this new constitution. Furthermore, Sir, it is  not

as if the Secretary of State was, under the present

proposal,   powerless  to  deal   with   cases   of

subversion. The British Government have the  power,

in   the   last   resort,  to  suspend   this   new

constitution should the need arise and short of the

suspension of the constitution, Sir, there is to be

a Security Council with which the Government of the

Federation  of  Malaya  will  be  associated.  This

Council,  Sir, is competent to deal  with  our  own

domestic  problems when such problems do arise.  As

the British Government has ample powers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1866</b></font><br><br>



to  deal with subversion, why should this condition

be further imposed on the Singapore delegation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a Member closely associated with the

civilian employees of the Armed Services, I am sure

that the House will understand the great importance

I  attach to the matters discussed in London by the

Chief   Minister  with  Her  Majesty's  Government.

Although  these matters were not directly connected

with  the  merdeka  talks,  the  locally  recruited

civilian  employees are concerned over  two  urgent

issues  discussed.  One, the  question  of  current

redundancies  caused by the defence cuts  following

the  debacle  of Britain's intervention  in  Egypt.

Two, their future when later constitutional changes

affect  defence and the Armed Services. I therefore

urge  the  Singapore Government to use  their  good

offices   to  hasten  the  establishment   of   the

Tripartite Consultative Committee which was  agreed

to  in  London  and  I  trust the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister will see to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.



<br><br>10.42 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, I

rise  to  support  the motion. The People's  Action

Party supports this motion because it means (1)  we

accept the constitution; (2) without paragraph  30;

and (3) , with proper Singapore citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment moved by the Member for Cairnhill

and  supported only by the Member for  Changi  (Mr

Lim   Cher  Kheng)  meant  (1)  they  accepted  the

constitution albeit with regret; (2) with paragraph

30; and (3) without proper citizenship.

statements at their face value. We know that it  is

not  impossible to twist and turn anything to  mean

anything  that  is convenient for the  moment.  The

stand taken by my Party has been challenged by  the

Member for Cairnhill. I would like to make it clear

that  this is an issue between the stand  taken  by

the Member for Cairnhill and the stand taken by the

People's  Action  Party.  Charges  have  been  made

publicly   and   a  challenge  has  been   accepted

publicly.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the hon. Member is

going back on the amendment. I am not quite certain

but I would ask him to try to keep strictly now  to

the terms of the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Very much so, Sir. Our stand in

supporting this motion is as I have stated  it.  We

have  been accused of a lot of other things because

we  took  that  stand. We will vindicate  both  our

honour  and  the correctness of our  stand  in  the

constituency  for  which  I  am  the  Member.   Mr

Speaker, Sir, if those who have made these  charges

choose  to  forget their challenge, the people  can

draw their own conclusions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Chairman,

Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 13, line 11 to page 14, line 11, to leave

out all the words after "office" to the end, and

insert-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"or who is employed in clerical work

complementary  or  supervisory  to  the  work  of

workmen   within  the  meaning  of   the   Labour

Ordinance  except persons employed  in  positions

of   management  workmen  or  domestic   servants

within  the meaning of the Labour Ordinance  1955

or  any other class of persons which the Minister

may from time to time by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1869</b></font><br><br>



notification  in the Gazette declare  not  to  be

clerks  for  the purposes of this  Ordinance  and

includes such employees of the Government or  Her

Britannic  Majesty's  Government  in  the  United

Kingdom    or   such   categories   classes    or

descriptions thereof as may from time to time  be

declared by the Governor by notification  in  the

Gazette  to  be clerks for the purposes  of  this

Ordinance or any Part or section thereof."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purport, Sir, of the deletion is to delete

all  reference to a wage ceiling and all  reference

to a distinction of clerks and a division of clerks

into  three categories: those from $500 and  under,

those   who  are  industrial  and  those  who   are

otherwise,    and   to   put    them    into    one

category - clerks. I would, however, point out,  Sir,

that  there  are other ceilings. I have  sought  in

this insertion to bring together the definitions of

"clerk"  and "industrial clerk" into the  one  word

"clerk"  and I have combined both of them  and  the

ceilings, Sir, that are left are "persons  employed

in  positions of management" and they are  excluded

from  the definition of "clerk". Also, all  workmen

within the meaning of the Labour Ordinance and  all

domestic  servants.  There are these  ceilings  and

also,  Sir,  you  will notice  that  there  is  the

additional  ceiling  that Government  servants  and

those  in  Her  Britannic Majesty's employment  are

excluded  otherwise than by express declaration  by

the Minister and furthermore, Sir, the Minister has

power to exclude specifically any class of persons.

You  might think it odd, Sir, that i should support

this provision which is incorporated there but I do

recognise  that  this  is a  new  Bill  and  a  new

departure in that we seek to give protection  to  a

group  of people who have had no protection  before

and  in the working out of the law, there might  be

anomalies of a character which might require urgent

attention. I think, therefore, Sir, that perhaps it

is  not  unreasonable, as a temporary  measure,  to

give  the Minister these somewhat extensive  powers

of  exclusion and inclusion but I think that it  is

wholly illogical and absolutely unnecessary to make

a division of three classes in respect of what is a

clerk.  Sir,  this  division has been  resisted  by

employees as well as by employers and, if I might



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1870</b></font><br><br>



draw the attention of the House, you will see,  for

example,   the  representations  of  the  Singapore

Clerical and Administrative Workers' Union  at  the

top  of  page  4  of  the Report before  you  being

Sessional Paper No. L.A. 2 of 1957 which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is suggested that the words 'whose salary' is

not  more than five hundred dollars, per mensem  or

such  other sum as may from, time to time be  fixed

by the Minister by notification in the Gazette and,

subject  to  such salary limits,' be deleted  from

the  interpretation as it is felt that all  persons

clerically employed should come within the  meaning

of  and  benefit by the Ordinance otherwise  clerks

drawing  salaries exceeding $500 would not be  able

to   claim   the   privileges  contained   in   the

Ordinance."



<br><br>That  is  one union, Sir. Then if you will look  at

page  38  of  Appendix  I,  the  Confederation   of

Singapore Chinese Engineering Tradesmen Branch  No.

8 wrote saying:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our interpretation of the contents of United

Engineers' letter is that they will adhere strictly

to   the   provisions  of  the  Clerks   Employment

Ordinance,  when passed, and, in its present  form,

apart  from  giving  no  protection  whatsoever  to

clerical workers drawing more than $500 per  month,

it provides less benefits than currently enjoyed by

U.E. workers who would be classified as 'Industrial

Clerks' under the Ordinance, in that they would  be

allowed one week annual leave against two weeks now

enjoyed  by  them,  and they would  work  44  hours

weekly, instead of 40 hours at present."

will  also  find it in Appendix IV, Sir, column  1,

where   Mr  Siow  Tiong  Choon  of  the  Singapore

Administrative  and Clerical Workers'  Union  right

through questions 1, 2, 3 and 4 resists strenuously

this division of $500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be suggested to you by the Minister

that  in  certain  types  of industrial  employment

where the worker is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1871</b></font><br><br>



doing more than 39 hours, is working 44 hours, the

person  who works with him in a clerical  capacity

should  also  be required to work that  number  of

hours.  I  say,  Sir,  that a  clerk  is  a  clerk

wherever  he  is  employed, and that  the  maximum

number  of  hours in this instance  should  be  as

indicated for a clerk. In fact, Sir, this point is

supported by the employers themselves. If you look

at  page  6  of the Report, paragraph 2  (about  a

third down the paragraph), the Singapore Employers

Federation say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". . .Unfortunately, however such a distinction

between the two categories of clerks will also, be

impossible to operate in practice because in  many

factories  and  workshops  it  will  be  extremely

difficult to draw a dividing line between the  two

classes,  and  there will be  a  large  number  of

borderline  cases,  the  exact  classification  of

which  will  give rise to considerable  difficulty

and  probably disputes between employers  and  the

staff  concerned, in addition it is the custom  of

many members of this Federation to transfer clerks

from   time  to  time  from  their  factories   or

workshops  to  their office staff  or  vice  versa

especially for training purposes and to  have  two

different sets of conditions of work, particularly

in regard to working hours, will obviously lead to

very considerable complications indeed."



<br><br>This is stated by the Singapore European Employers

Federation,  Sir. You will notice  that  they  are

definitely  against the two classifications.  They

continue:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It appears to the Federation that these

difficulties  could be easily  surmounted  if  the

Ordinance  merely  stipulated  the  one   set   of

conditions for all clerks, particularly in  regard

to  working hours, these being the same  as  those

provided  for  industrial clerks  in  the  present

Bill."



<br><br>Quite   naturally,  they  want   to   reduce   the

conditions  for  everybody to the lowest  minimum,

that  is,  to make all of them work 44 hours.  But

they say distinctly that this question of dividing

the clerks into two groups is impracticable; and I

would  say this to you, Mr Chairman, that I  know

of  no  such division in any other country in  the

world.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Member contending then that

his  amendment  is  connected with  amendments  in

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1872</b></font><br><br>



amendment will affect all his other amendments in respect of industrial clerks?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Yes, indeed, Sir. You will see,

Sir, that my amendment deletes all mention of  the

$500 ceiling and all mention of industrial clerks,

and  it  combines the definitions of both "clerks"

and  "industrial  clerks" into a single  group  of

workers to be known as "clerks" with a single  set

of  minimum conditions of service. This  amendment

goes to the root not only of the $500 ceiling, but

also  to  the division into industrial clerks  and

clerks. If this amendment fails, Sir, then all the

consequential  amendments will fail,  because  the

question  of industrial clerks is now incorporated

in  this particular amendment. If we take up  this

division, then everything else must succeed and we

have  one set of clerks. So it is vital, Sir, that

this  House  understands  the  objections  to  the

division  between clerks and industrial clerks  on

the  part of employees as well as on the  part  of

employers. So whom are we seeking to please?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you will look at page 11 of the Report,

the employers, who had legal advice on this matter

and who were assisted in the presentation of their

case,  said this in their memorandum, in paragraph

4:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One of the most important sections of industry

which  will be adversely affected by the  proposed

division  of clerks is general transport which  is

so  vital to the existence and development of  the

Island  and in support of this we would quote  the

following extract from a letter received from  the

Singapore Traction Co. Ltd."



<br><br>This is what the letter quoted says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'We have two departments in which it will be

very difficult to differentiate between "clerks"

and "Industrial Clerks". These departments are-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(1) Traffic Department, in which the work

varies from clerks keeping personnel records and

preparing duty lists ("clerical" work), to time

clerks and depot clerks whose work is connected

with the operational side of the business and

who are therefore "industrial" clerks,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'These clerks work together in the same office

and on occasions must assist each other. There  is

also  a large body of clerks in between these  two

extremes  whose daily work is connected with  both

and whom it would be very difficult to divide into

"clerks' and "industrial clerks".'"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1873</b></font><br><br>



Now, you see, Sir. The letter continues:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" '(2) Engineering Department, in which the

clerks'     work    varies    from    time-keeping

("industrial" clerks), to costing ("clerks"),  and

covers   all  intermediate  work.  It   would   be

practically  impossible to divide these  into  the

proposed  categories  without  disorganising   the

work.'"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the suggestion of the Government, Sir, meets

with  the favour of nobody. The employers  say  it

will disorganise their work and the employees  say

it is utterly unfair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you continue on page 11, Sir, you will read

the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Another important industry which has stated it

will  experience  considerable difficulty  is  the

motor industry, as will be seen from the following

extract from a letter received from Borneo  Motors

Ltd.:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We give below two examples of our

difficulty in practising a distinction in  working

hours: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(1) In our Stores Department, we have Stock

Control  clerks, Sales Counter clerks and Workshop

Counter  Issue  clerks.  A  Stock  Control   clerk

records the receipts and issue of spare parts. His

work  is closely related to that of the other  two

categories of clerks, but is not complementary  or

supervisory  to  the work of our  workmen  in  the

Repair Shop. The work of a Sales Counter clerk  is

also not complementary or supervisory, as he sells

spare  parts  over the Counter to  the  public.  A

Workshop Counter Issue clerk issues spare parts to

the  Workshop for the repair of vehicles  and  is,

therefore, an industrial clerk within the  meaning

of  the  Ordinance. All these three categories  of

clerks now work the same number of hours. It  will

be  difficult  to  make a distinction  in  working

hours as their work is closely related and in  the

case  of  Sales Counter clerk and Workshop Counter

Issue clerk, very similar. The fact that the Sales

Counter clerk serves the public is not good reason

why  he  should work shorter hours than the  clerk

who serves the Workshop.' "



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn to page 12, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" '(2) In our Workshop, we have Bill clerks and

Time   clerks.   The  latter  do   clerical   work

complementary or supervisory to the  work  of  our

workmen  and  are  industrial  clerks  within  the

meaning  of the Ordinance. Bill clerks are  office

clerks and not industrial clerks but their work is

nevertheless closely related to that of  the  Time

clerks. Before a Bill clerk closes a job he has to

refer  to  the  Time clerk for the time  spent  by

workmen on the job and he has also to refer to the

Workshop Counter Issue clerk for the spares issued

to  the job. At present, the clerks work the  same

hours  and it will be difficult to treat the  Bill

clerk  as an office clerk and a Time clerk  as  an

industrial clerk.' "



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1874</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further down, Sir, we have the Singapore Cold

Storage letter:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'(a) Bulk Stores Clerks, Orchard Road work in

close  connection with the shops whose staff under

the new Bill are on a 44-hour week. Although these

clerks  do  not  work  in  the  shops  and   serve

customers, they are in a way very similar to shop-assistants.  Issues of groceries, tin  provisions,

etc, are constantly made so long as the shops  are

open  and  a 39-hour week will entail overtime  to

these clerks with unavoidable complaints from shop-assistants.'"



<br><br>Quite right. And I say, with respect to you,  Sir,

that  what  we should provide is an inducement  to

reduce  the working hours of the industrial clerks

and, if necessary, to take on more employees,  and

thus, to some extent, meet the growing urgency  of

the unemployment problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I will read the third last

paragraph  of the employers' memorandum,  on  page

12:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If time permitted, many more such examples

could be cited but the Federation feels that those

given  above  will  be  sufficient  to  show  that

genuine  difficulty  will  arise.  The  Federation

appreciates  that  on the occasion  when  previous

legislation    on   this   subject    was    under

consideration, employers may generally have  taken

the view that the division between ordinary clerks

and  those employed in industry was workable,  but

it  is convinced that this was due mainly to their

natural  alarm at the proposal of a  39-hour  week

for  all clerks. Now that an opportunity has  been

given  for more careful examination of the  matter

the  difficulties and dangers attendant  upon  the

proposal-"



<br><br>that is, the proposal to divide them into clerks

and industrial clerks-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"as set out above have been appreciated."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I have already read to you the

objection of the employees appearing at column  37

of  Annexe I. Nobody wants this distinction  which

divides  clerks into three categories: one earning

above  $500 having no protection at all;  one  who

has  a 39-hour week, 14 days annual leave, and  13

days public holidays; and finally the poor second-class  clerk who has a 44-hour working week,  only

seven   days  annual  leave  and  11  days  public

holidays.  Sir,  the Hon. the Chief  Minister  has

indicated  that  the division into  those  earning

under  $500 and those earning over $500 is because

those earning over $500 can protect themselves and

can brief lawyers. Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1875</b></font><br><br>



I  do not know how that is logical; it seems to be

a  non  sequitur, and I would merely add this  (if

there is any merit to it) that the Minister is  in

charge  of  an Ordinance which provides  for  free

legal aid, and that, if that Ordinance is actively

and   honestly  implemented,  the  people  of  the

country - not only those earning more than $500  but

the  people who need it - will be able to have  free

legal  aid,  man, woman and child. I  know  of  no

express  intention on the part  of  the  Hon. the

Chief  Minister to repeal that Ordinance  and,  in

the  circumstances, it seems to  me  illogical  to

provide  for a division at $500 on the  assumption

that  those  earning  more than  that  figure  can

afford  to  pay for legal aid. Sir,  I  say  that,

under the provisions of the Ordinance which he has

the responsibility of administering, those earning

less than $500 can also have access to lawyers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say, Sir, that this division is unjust. It

will cause a great deal of heart-burning to people

doing  the  same  work.  It  will  encourage   the

employers to a great deal of litigation  in  order

to   press  clerks  into  the  industrial   clerks

category.  It is not wanted by the employers,  who

say that it will disrupt work. It is not wanted by

the employees. And I say to this House that if  it

accepts  my amendment, these distinctions will  be

wiped  away, but it leaves power to the  Minister,

in  genuine cases where there is need to make  the

distinction, to take specific groups  out  of  the

definition  of  "clerk".  That  power  should   be

exercised  very  sparingly, Sir,  and  I  have  no

doubt, I hope, it will be exercised sparingly;  in

any event, if there are complaints, this House can

hear about them. But the main thing to remember is

this:  If  it  is  suggested that there  are  some

industries which require that their clerks  should

work  the  same hours as their industrial workers,

the answer is two-fold: one, employ more clerks or

pay  the  clerks for over-time; and two, apply  to

the Minister for special exemption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do plead with this House, even though the

amendment  may come from me, to consider  it  with

impartiality  and with a sense  of  justice  to  a

group of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1876</b></font><br><br>



people  who  have  not  been articulate,  who  are

extremely timid, but who are, Sir, worthy  of  our

honest  and sincere efforts in assisting  them  to

get the protection they need.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It has been moved, as an amendment

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested by the hon. Mover that

amendments of the Member for Cairnhill?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I think you have got them all,

Sir.



<br><br>11.18 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Mr Chairman, Sir, ever since I became

Minister for Labour and Welfare, I have exerted  a

lot  of effort to try to introduce legislation  to

protect  clerical  workers. I started  life  as  a

clerk  and by profession am still a clerk,  and  I

think  I  will  die a clerk too.  The  Member  for

Cairnhill said there is a lot of heartburning over

this division of clerical workers. I would like to

assure this House that there has been a lot of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1877</b></font><br><br>



heart-searching  in me, a clerk,  as  to  what  is

right and what is not right, what is fair and what

is  not fair, in this Bill designed to protect the

class of workers from which I am proud to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, let me explain the ceiling

salary of $500 in so far as the interpretation  of

clerks  is  concerned. It is  felt  that  clerical

workers, industrial or office, drawing under  $500

are  in need of special protection. The protection

afforded them under this Bill only relates,  shall

we  say,  to contracts of service - annual holidays,

sick leave and one or two other things - but it does

also  provide to such clerks the free services  of

the  Labour Court in settling disputes with  their

employers. Surely, Sir, employers will not wish to

deny to their senior clerks what they have granted

to those of their employees drawing below $500. We

all  know  that  men  in senior  appointments  are

better  treated  and  are, in fact,  given  better

conditions of employment. What this Bill seeks  to

give to clerical employees are therefore only  the

minimum  provisions;  workers'  organisations  can

strive  to  improve  them  and  thus  make   their

organisations live and active ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to industrial clerks, Sir, I have

given  the  matter very serious  thought.  It  was

considered very carefully by the Select Committee,

and we came to the unanimous conclusion that there

should   be  this  distinction,  not  because   we

consider industrial clerks to be a lower grade  of

clerks,  but because we feel that they should,  by

the very nature of their employment, be classified

in  the  Statute Book with the workmen  with  whom

they  closely  work. The Member for Cairnhill  has

pointed  out that the term "industrial clerk"  has

been opposed by employees and employers alike.  As

far  as  the  employers are concerned, Sir,  their

objections  are  not because  they  want  to  give

industrial clerks a 39-hour week or 14 days annual

leave a year - it is because they feel that if there

is  this  classification in the Clerks  Employment

Bill,  it  will  be  necessary for  them  to  give

improved conditions to those of their employees at

present  working  as  industrial  clerks  but  who

should  have been classified as office clerks.  It

is suggested that their best way out is to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1878</b></font><br><br>



give  a 44-hour week to all clerical workers.  The

employees also objected to the classification  but

they, quite rightly, demand that there should be a

39-hour week for all clerks. Members of the Select

Committee  very carefully considered this  and  we

decided as we have. This Bill, Sir, as I say,  has

also  been considered by the Labour Advisory Board

on  which  employers and employees are  adequately

represented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the other points raised was on the

limitation  of  $500. On this,  I  would  like  to

assure  the House that if, say, after six  months'

operation  of the law, I should find it  necessary

to  raise the limit to, say, $600 or even $700,  I

will definitely introduce amending legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill also touched on the

Legal  Aid and Advice Ordinance. He said  that  if

Government    really   actively    and    honestly

implemented it, then all clerks - in fact, I  should

say  every individual in Singapore - would have  the

benefit  of this law. What the degree of  activity

is,    Sir,    is   a   question   of   individual

interpretation.  I  say  that  we  have   actively

pursued  this matter and to suggest that  we  have

not  honestly implemented it is something I cannot

accept.  The  difficulty which the  Government  is

encountering  today arises from the opposition  of

the  Bar  Committee  to certain  sections  in  the

Ordinance, and this opposition was because of  the

way  the Bill received its Second Reading in  this

House. The Bar Committee, however, assured  me  of

their  co-operation in working the Ordinance,  but

because  of  the  heavy pressure of  work  on  me,

particularly on the constitutional issue,  I  have

not yet been able to hold further discussions with

the  Bar  Committee.  Now that the  constitutional

issue  has been settled, I will take the  earliest

opportunity  to hold further talks  with  the  Bar

Committee and to do my best to see that the law is

implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore object to the amendment.



<br><br>11.29 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Chairman, I was not

on  the Select Committee in the Second Session  of

this  Assembly, but I was on the Select  Committee

on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>



this  Bill  in  the  First Session.  As  you  will

remember,   Sir,   this  Bill   has   been   given

consideration by two Select Committees, and on the

Select Committee in the First Session we did  give

very  considerable thought to this problem,  as  I

have  no doubt the Select Committee of the  Second

Session  did also; and we appear to have  come  to

the same conclusions. I therefore think it can  be

said  that this knotty problem has been given very

wide consideration by a large number of Members in

this  House, and they have come to this conclusion

that  this distinction or classification does meet

with the wishes of the majority.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I rise to

support the amendment. Why should we draw  a  line

between clerks, Sir? If a Bill is to be introduced

to  protect  the  interests  of  and  improve  the

working  conditions of clerks, let  us  cover  all

clerks.  Why divide them into those earning  below

$500  a  month and those above $500 and industrial

clerks?

I  do  not think that what their particular income

is  should come into the question. The question is

whether  we  are  to introduce a Bill  to  protect

clerks  and,  if  so, it should cover  all  clerks

irrespective  of what income they draw,  with  the

exception, of course, of those who are covered  in

the  amendment which says "except persons employed

in  positions  of management workmen  or  domestic

servants   within  the  meaning  of   the   Labour

Ordinance  1955.". Mr Chairman,  Sir,  the  Chief

Minister says that it is a question of the  nature

of  employment that is involved. I may agree to  a

certain  extent. It is the nature  of  employment.

But  why  then  penalise or  victimise  the  store

clerks,  tally clerks and so on? Why not  classify

an accounts clerk as an industrial clerk then? Why

not  classify a solicitor's clerk as an industrial

clerk  then? There are so many types of clerks.  A

clerk  working in a solicitor's firm  is  entirely

different from one working in a bank, and a  clerk

working  in  a  bank is quite different  from  one

working  in an insurance company. Why not separate

all  clerks  and  have all sorts of classification

rather  than industrial and non-industrial clerks?

If we do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1880</b></font><br><br>



not  classify the clerks in different  categories,

the  question  of  industrial  and  non-industrial

clerks  will  not arise, and every clerk  will  be

given  the  chance  of  learning  other  types  of

clerical work found in commercial firms. If I am a

clerk and I confine myself to a particular job,  I

will  not  be  able  to know  what  another  clerk

working  in  another capacity is  doing.  Even  in

government service we find clerks transferred from

one  department to another. Why do  they  transfer

the  clerks from one department to another? It  is

to  enable  them to acquaint themselves  with  the

nature  of  the  employment covered  by  the  word

"clerk".  If we are going to have a dividing  line

between      industrial     and     non-industrial

clerks - calling  them tally clerks,  store  clerks,

accounts  clerks, how then are we going to  effect

that transfer?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of leave, Sir, is not a clerk a

human  being? Is not an industrial clerk  a  human

being?  Are  they not the same? Are they  born  of

different  categories? Why  then  should  a  clerk

enjoy 14 days' leave and an industrial clerk  only

seven  days? If an ordinary clerk has to work  for

365  days in a year, the industrial clerk also has

to  work that number of days. So why should  there

be this difference in leave?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to draw the attention of the

Member  for Cairnhill to the question of holidays.

He  said that a clerk is entitled to 13 days' paid

holiday,  as  covered  in  page  36,  whereas   an

industrial clerk gets only 11 days (page  37).  He

is   wrong  on  this  issue.  According  to   this

Schedule, the clerk is allowed 16 days and not  13

days - five days more than an industrial clerk. Does

it  necessarily mean that an industrial clerk does

not  enjoy holidays? [Interruption.] As a Chinese,

I  would  say that most Chinese enjoy at least  15

days during Chinese New Year and not a day or two.

Under  Schedule A we see "Chinese New  Year's  Day

and the following day", but under Schedule B it is

only  "Chinese New Year's Day". Why the difference

of  one  more day? Is not the person coming  under

Schedule B a Chinese? Is he not entitled to  enjoy

another  extra  day during Chinese New  Year?  Why

then bar him out? Let us treat all human beings as

equals.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1881</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now coming to protection. The Minister for

Labour and Welfare said that this Bill is to  give

special  protection  to those  whose  incomes  are

below  $500.  He has said earlier  that  it  is  a

question of the nature of employment. I would  say

that  it  is  the  nature of his living  which  is

involved.  The  way of living  of  a  clerk  whose

income is $300 is entirely different from that  of

a clerk whose income is $500, and if a clerk earns

more  than $500, then his standard of living would

be  higher.  That leaves him with  no  balance  of

money out of his monthly income. He has no savings

at  all.  If  that  be  the case,  then  why  give

protection only to those clerks earning less  than

$500  if the clerks in a higher income group  also

have  no savings out of their monthly income? Then

let us give protection to all clerks, irrespective

of  $500  or above, or below. Where legal  aid  is

concerned, it is not because those who  draw  $500

could  not  afford  and those drawing  above  $500

could  afford.  As  the Minister  has  said,  some

employers  might try and give better treatment  to

those   drawing  $500.  I  doubt  there  is   much

discrimination there. If a clerk draws above $500,

his  status is such that he warrants that  special

treatment, not because he draws above $500; and if

his   income  is  below  $500,  he  is  given  the

treatment  that he deserves. So why  differentiate

between the clerks? I fully support the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Chairman,

Sir,  it is extraordinary, the poverty of argument

in  defence. The Member for Tanglin, who is always

worth listening to even if one disagrees with him,

has  just one argument. "Gentlemen," he says,  "we

have  discussed this at length in Select Committee

and  we came to this conclusion after considerable

deliberation."  But the arguments which  convinced

that  Select Committee seem a top secret from this

House,  and  this House may not know,  Sir,  apart

from  reading  the  Report, what  those  arguments

were.  Nor  did  the Member for  Tanglin  seek  to

enlighten this House on the weighty reasons  which

no  doubt  existed - or did they exist? - which  made

him  decide  that  there should be  this  division

between a clerk and an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1882</b></font><br><br>



industrial  clerk. The Minister  for  Labour  and

Welfare puts in an emotional plea. He says, "I  am

still  a clerk." And the assumption is that, being

a clerk, he would naturally want only good for the

clerks.  Let me remind him that it is not  unknown

that  people get into office in order to help  the

poor  and  remain in office in order to serve  the

rich.  An  illustrious patron of those  gentlemen,

Sir,  is  the late Mr Ramsay MacDonald,  who  got

into  power  by  support of the trade  unions  and

remained   in  power  in  order  to  support   big

business. The Minister says, "I am still a clerk."

I do not understand how a Minister can be a clerk,

unless  one understands the definition of a  clerk

as  being a man who carries out the wishes of  his

bosses.   Sir,   that   emotional   argument   has

absolutely no weight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Minister says, "If $500 is too low, I

will  put it to $600; I will put it to $700."  But

he  has not answered the simple question: Why  any

salary  ceiling  at all? Why? I have  two  clerks.

They both get more than $500. Why should they  not

have the benefit of the protection of this Bill? I

do  apologise, Mr Chairman, Sir. I misled you  in

saying  that  a  clerk gets 13 days'  holiday.  In

fact,  the  Member for Queenstown is  correct.  He

gets  16 days, but his poor brother doing the same

work,  dubbed an industrial clerk, gets  11  days'

public  holiday. Why? Sir, I do ask this House  to

reconsider this question. At one time,  Sir,  this

House  was afraid during election time of becoming

nothing but a committee of the Chinese Chamber  of

Commerce  because  of the Democratic  Party.  Now,

Sir, it looks like we are becoming a committee  of

the  Singapore Chamber of Commerce if  we  are  to

accept  what  the  Singapore Employers  Federation

asks.  I have omitted - it was pointed out to  me - to

read the second last paragraph of their memorandum

on page 12:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are therefore directed to express the hope

that  the Select Committee will see their  way  to

accept  the proposed change in the Bill so  as  to

make the 44-hour week standard for all clerks. If,

however, this is not so, then the Federation would

reiterate   what   is  stated  in   its   original

memorandum  namely that the existing  division  of

clerks should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1883</b></font><br><br>



retained,  difficult as it may be  to  operate,  in

preference to a 39-hour standard week."



<br><br>So  we  are  going to carry out the wishes  of  the

Singapore Employers Federation; or are we going  to

give the protection which these clerks seek?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the Member for Serangoon, in the name

of   the  Progressive  Party  at  that  time,   who

introduced  a  Bill - it was not perhaps appropriate,

let   us   put   it  no  higher  than  that - seeking

gallantly,  urgently, to protect these  workers.  I

appeal  to  all Members of this House, irrespective

of   party   affiliation,  to  realise  that   this

distinction  is  not  merely  unworkable,  as   the

employers  state, but it is utterly unfair  to  the

employees,  and  not one single argument  has  been

adduced  in  this House, apart from  the  Whip,  to

suggest  that  there is logic or  justice  in  this

distinction which the employers want.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> Sir, this Bill is an attempt to

confer  benefits,  and the complaint  is  that  the

benefits  to be conferred are insufficient.  It  is

not  a Bill to reduce benefits. It is to confer the

minimum benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in answer to the Member for Cairnhill about

this  $500  more or less, if a clerk  getting  less

than  $500,  is  to receive all the benefits  which

this  Bill,  when it becomes law, will confer  upon

him,   can  you  imagine,  Mr  Chairman,  a  clerk

receiving more than $500 will also not be  entitled

to  the  benefits, or even more? It would, I think,

be  a  most unjust and ridiculous office management

if   clerks  receiving  less  than  $500  get  some

benefits and those receiving more than $500 do  not

get the same benefits, if not more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, Sir - reference has been made to

the  letter  by the Singapore Employers Federation.

Sir,  these are employers and if they do  have  the

interests  of their clerks at heart, may I  suggest

to them, Mr Chairman, that in case of doubts, they

give  the  benefit of the doubts in favour  of  the

clerks so that the doubts which they raise in their

letter, will no longer remain doubts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I had

insinuations?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If an hon. Member passes

expect to receive similar insinuations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Thank you, Mr Chairman, Sir.

As  I  was saying, Sir, because of the insinuations

that  could  only have come from a man  emotionally

unstrung,  I  think the best way is to ignore  such

emotion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I would like to reply to the

Minister.  He said that this Bill does  not  reduce

anything.  Would the House again, Sir, read  column

38  of Annexe 1? This is what the workers say. They

have  received a letter from United Engineers which

states  "that they [United Engineers]  will  adhere

strictly to the provisions of the Clerks Employment

Ordinance.".  The  workers  say  that   this   Bill

"provides  less benefits than currently enjoyed  by

United Engineer workers who would be classified  as

'Industrial  Clerks' under the Ordinance,  in  that

they would be allowed one week annual leave against

two  weeks now enjoyed by them, and they would work

44  hours  weekly, instead of 40 hours at present."

These are the people we are seeking to protect  and

these are the representations, Sir, which you  have

received. So it is inaccurate to suggest that  this

Bill  takes  away nothing. It does, in  fact,  take

away  what they have, and according to the  workers

themselves



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1885</b></font><br><br>



who are affected, United Engineers being one firm

which intends to implement the letter of the law,

and the minimum possible, and the minimum possible

will be much less than what they get today.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I maintain

that  what I have said is correct. This Bill, when

it  becomes  law, will take away nothing.  If  any

employee in any firm gets more benefits than  what

this  Bill intends to confer, there is no  penalty

clause in the Bill which says that an employer who

grants more benefits than set out in this Bill, is

liable to a fine or to imprisonment.

question of agreeing this amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity, Sir, of

emphasising  that it has never been the  intention

that the provisions of existing agreements between

employers and employees, which fall short of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1887</b></font><br><br>



minimum  standards  which are  prescribed  in  the

Bill,  should be preserved; and I would like  just

to touch on clause 7 in this context which depends

to  some extent on the amendment which is going to

be made, we hope, to clause 6. I would like to say

this, Sir, that it has never been the intention of

the   Government   that  agreements   which   give

employees more than the minimum standards provided

by the Bill should be prevented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to say, Sir, that we do not go

so  far  by  any means as the hon. Member  in  his

construction  of the clause in its  present  form,

but  we do agree that the drafting can be improved

and should be improved.



<br><br>12 noon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members generally will know that in

their present form clause 6 - and I am speaking also

of clause 7 - corresponds precisely with sections  6

and  7 of the Labour Ordinance, and this Ordinance

has  been in force for some 18 months, and so  far

as  I am aware, the construction of those sections

has never been challenged in the sense that it has

never  been suggested that they do not  carry  out

the intentions to which I have referred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, to conclude what I have to say, we do

support  this amendment because we think  that  it

will make the clause abundantly clear and indeed I

think  this is one of the occasions on  which  one

can  say  with some confidence that the  amendment

will  achieve our purpose - what must always be  the

purpose  of legal draftsmen when they are drafting

any legislation - and that is so to draft it that it

cannot be misunderstood, not only by a person  who

wants  to  understand it but also by a person  who

wants  to  misunderstand it. Sir, we support  this

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It would appear then that it is

for the convenience of Members to discuss also the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7-



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, my objection to

clause 7 are the words "any term of a contract  of

service  which  is contrary to the  provisions  of

this  Ordinance shall be illegal, null and  void".

Sir,  it must be quite obvious that there  can  be

contracts  of service which are contrary  in  that

they  are less favourable, as well as contrary  in

that  they  are  more favourable. I  am  happy  to

report, Sir, that I have had the full co-operation

of  the  Attorney-General on the subject who  sees

the  point, and I have collaborated with him, Sir,

in  the amendment which I now put before the House

and which I understand is fully acceptable to him-

that  we  delete  clause 7  completely  after  the

figure  "7", and insert a new clause. So,  Sir,  I

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 17, lines 12 to 16, to leave out all

words  after  "7." to the end and  insert-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every term of a contract of service whether made before

or  after  the date on which this Ordinance  comes

into  force which provides a condition of  service

which  is less favourable to an employee than  any

of  the  conditions of service prescribed by  this

Ordinance shall be illegal, null and void  to  the

extent that it is so less favourable."



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> All I wish to say on this, Sir,

is that the Government accepts this amendment, and

useful,  Sir, for me to repeat what I have already

said.

Sir,  here  again  I am happy  to  report  to  you

agreement with the Attorney-General as a result of

my drawing the attention of the House to the Privy

Council  case of Clouston and Corry which  decided

that  not  all  acts  of  misconduct  are  grounds

sufficient for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1889</b></font><br><br>

with  the Attorney-General who stated that it  was

not,  in fact, the intention of the Government  to

extend  the  area  of  the  grounds  on  which  an

employer could dismiss an employee, and therefore,

Sir,  in  the  words of the case of  Clouston  and

Corry, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 18, line 41, after "misconduct", to

insert  "inconsistent with the fulfilment  of  the

supports  this amendment, and here again  I  would

like  to say that I am grateful for the assistance

which  he  gave  me when we were  discussing  this

particular matter. I would like to say this,  Sir,

that  it  has  always been the  intention  of  the

Government  that  this clause should  only  permit

dismissal without notice for misconduct where that

misconduct is serious or substantial. It  follows,

Sir,  that  the Government is concerned that  this

clause  should  not be capable of being  construed

more widely, and for the reasons which I think the

Member for Cairnhill has indicated, the Government

takes the view that it would be wise to adopt  the

amendment  to it on the lines which he has  moved.

We support this amendment, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There are two amendments standing

in the name of the Member for Cairnhill (Mr D. S.

Marshall) which appear to be complementary:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[In page 19, after line 6, to add a new sub-clause numbered (2) as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(2) Strike action by an employee in pursuance

<br><br>Unless  any  hon. Member has an amendment  to  the

clause  itself,  I  propose  to  call  the  second

amendment.  If the second amendment  is  accepted,

then, of course, the first amendment will be  made

as a matter of course.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Chairman,

Sir,  thank  you. I was wondering what the  proper

procedure would be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, this is a provision that is

absolutely  vital to the labour  movement  of  the

country.  You will permit me, Sir, to remind  this

House that in true colonial tradition, the workers

of  Singapore  had no right to organise  in  trade

unions  until after the Second World War and  that

up  to,  I think, late in 1941, it was a criminal

offence   and  a  criminal  conspiracy   for   any

employees  to  get  together and  to  press  their

demands  on  their employers on the  understanding

that  if they did not get them, they would strike.

Under pressure from the Labour Party of the United

Kingdom,  there was introduced in this  colony  in

1951 trade union legislation. I say under pressure

from  the  Labour  Party of  the  United  Kingdom;

perhaps I should add, and in view of the crumbling

and  disintegrating situation in  Singapore  as  a

result  of  the  Japanese threat when  imperialist

capital was seeking every means to placate those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1891</b></font><br><br>



it  had  persistently made their enemies, but  the

1941 legislation was of no effect until after  the

war. Not one single organisation registered itself

as  a  trade  union  under that legislation  until

1946. So, Sir, trade union law and protection  for

the  worker is very new. There is a law and it  is

no longer a criminal conspiracy to go on strike or

to  take  other action on a collective  bargaining

basis  against  unreasonable employers  but,  Sir,

though it is no longer a criminal offence, it is a

civil offence to go on strike - something very  few

people seem to know. It is a civil offence  to  go

on strike, tantamount to a breach of contract from

which  damages can flow. I see that the  hon.  Mr

Sutherland looks with surprise. Perhaps  the  Hon.

the  Attorney-General - I  know  Mr  Sutherland  no

longer,  Sir, he says, takes what I say  as  being

accurate - will correct me if I am wrong or at least

indicate how far I am right. But let me repeat  in

case there is any misunderstanding. It is today  a

civil  offence  to  go on strike  amounting  to  a

breach of contract, attracting immediate dismissal

for misconduct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we have the privilege of having as

Chief  Minister  and as Minister  for  Labour  and

Welfare  a  man  who  has told  you  that  he  has

laboured in the trade union movement all his  life

and  he  should understand what it  means  to  the

workers of Singapore that the principle should  be

recognised  not  only  of non-criminality  of  the

right  to  strike but of the absolute legality  of

the  right  to  strike, that the right  to  strike

should   not  be  considered  a  civil  misconduct

warranting  instant dismissal. We,  Sir,  in  this

House are all Socialists with the exception of the

Nominated Members. I grieve to see that  the  most

socialist of Socialists, according to their views,

are entirely absent - the People's Action Party, all

of  them.  I  grieve to see that  the  Independent

Member  for  Sembawang (Inche Ahmad  bin  Ibrahim)

absent on so important a motion. I grieve to see a

large section of the Liberal-Socialists absent  on

so  important  a  motion, but, Sir,  we  have  the

Labour  Front that stands for Socialist principles

and I say to you, Sir, that to any true Socialist,

it is axiomatic that the right to strike should be

lawful. You



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1892</b></font><br><br>



cannot  say  it is lawful if it comes  within  the

definition  of  misconduct  and  if  it   warrants

instant dismissal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister today received

the  praise  and  the accolade of British  capital

whose confidence he has gained. I would ask him to

remember the labour movement. I would ask  him  to

remember  the  need  of this country  and  of  any

government of this country to have the  faith  and

confidence of the labour movement. I would  remind

him.  Sir, of something that perhaps he knows  and

he does not often remember, and that is, since his

coming  into  office,  many  genuine  and  sincere

constitutional trade unionists are  frightened.  I

say,  Sir,  that the acceptance of this  amendment

which makes lawful the right to strike will  go  a

long way to restoring the confidence of the labour

movement   of   this  country  and   the   present

Government of this country would go a long way  to

allay  the  fears of the labour movement  of  this

country  and  would also go a long way  to  giving

justice   to   the   worker.  There   is   nothing

unreasonable in strike action, Sir. All I ask here

is  that strike action, not what they call  "wild-cat"  strike  action, but "strike  action  at  the

lawful request"- you will notice that phrase, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strike action by an employee in pursuance of the

lawful request of his registered trade union shall

not be deemed to be breach of contract."



<br><br>I  do plead that, in this House that claims 9/10th

Socialists, this very modest axiomatic  protection

for the worker should be conceded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 19, after line 6, to add a new sub-clause

numbered (2) as follows-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(2) Strike action by an employee in pursuance

of the lawful request of his registered trade

union shall not be deemed to be breach of

contract."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the

Government cannot accept the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the right of workers to strike is not a

right  which is given or taken away by legislation

of  this  kind.  The  Clerks  Employment  Bill  is

concerned with the contracts of service. As far as

possible, rights and duties under this legislation

as  between the employers and employees should  be

reciprocal. It is a common



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1893</b></font><br><br>



law  right and workers are protected from most  of

the  common law consequences of strike  action  by

the  Trade Disputes Ordinance. However,  a  strike

must still be regarded as a declaration of war and

a   declaration   of   war  automatically   severs

diplomatic  relations. In the same way,  a  strike

severs contracts of service. After all, the  usual

purpose  of  a strike is to secure new and  better

contracts of service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill describes the right not

to  allow  anyone to go on strike a civil offence.

Sir, I am not a lawyer. As far as I know, there is

such a thing as criminal offence and a civil wrong

but there is no such thing as a civil offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when a trade union asks its members to go

on  strike, the purpose behind that strike  action

is  actually  to  terminate the  old  contract  of

service as not good enough and therefore to seek a

better contract of service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill brings in a lot of

facts  that are rather misleading to the point  at

issue. His amendment merely asks that in the  case

of a strike:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strike action by an employee in pursuance of

the  lawful request of his registered trade  union

shall not be deemed to be breach of contract."



<br><br>A  strike is merely the co-ordinated withdrawal by

workmen  of their labour and may or may not  be  a

breach  of  contract. Strike notices are  probably

sufficient in most cases to terminate the contract

of  most men engaged and in such a case, there  is

no  breach  of  contract. The  withdrawal  may  be

without notice and there is therefore a breach  of

contract. In either case, the contract of  service

is  ended,  that  being the very  purpose  of  the

strike - to  end a contract that does not appear  to

be  good  to the employees concerned - and the  only

question   that   remains,   Sir,   is   one    of

reinstatement or a new contract.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to allow this amendment to go

through,  it would encourage wild-cat strikes  and

confusion in industries and would prolong  strikes

as   workers  would  have  nothing  to  lose.  The

employers would be held liable to pay the wages of

employees who are on strike and who, by  the  very

fact that they are on strike, have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1894</b></font><br><br>



clearly  indicated  their understanding  that  the

contract  of  service which they  had  with  their

employers is not good enough and that they want  a

better one.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am rather

surprised that the Minister in charge of the  Bill

himself should be unconscious of the provisions of

his own Bill. If the Minister will read clause 27,

he  will  see there that the employer  may  deduct

from  the wages of an employee an adequate  amount

for  absence without good reason. Therefore,  when

the  Minister  tells you that the  employer  would

have to pay wages during a strike, he informs  you

inaccurately,  Sir, no doubt, through  not  having

sufficiently carefully read his own Bill. Sir,  it

is  not  true that to say a strike is not a breach

of  contract  would mean that the  employer  would

have  to pay the wages during the period of strike

and  it is not true to say that every strike is  a

termination of contract because it is not good.  I

am  not  a  trade unionist, Sir. The Minister  for

Labour  and Welfare is. May I remind the  Minister

of  some notorious fact, that unions go on  strike

when there is victimisation of trade union leaders

by employers? Does he not know of that? Has he not

himself  intervened  in  a  recent  case  in   the

Singapore Pilot Association when all the employees

walked out because a vice-president of a union was

sacked?  They  did  not  seek  to  improve   their

contract   of  service.  They  said,   "You   have

wrongfully  dismissed and victimised  one  of  our

members.  Therefore, we are  going  on  strike  in

order to force you to be reasonable."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what the Minister asks for is that the

employers    should   have   the    monopoly    of

unreasonableness. Why? He again says that it would

encourage  wild-cat  strikes.  Sir,  I  have  just

explained that my amendment says that only  strike

action  in  pursuance  of a lawful  request  of  a

lawful  trade union shall be deemed not  to  be  a

breach  of contract. So there again, Sir,  he  has

misunderstood  my amendment - I do hope  so - because,

it is, I repeat, vital to the trade union movement

of   this  country  and  to  the  labour  movement

throughout the world that their right to strike be

protected. A



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1895</b></font><br><br>



great  deal,  Sir,  depends upon  their  right  to

strike.  They  have no strength like the  employer

has.  The employer will still eat, sleep and drive

in  his  car when there is a strike but it is  the

employee  who  takes the risks  of  starving,  who

takes  the  risks of real privation to his  family

when  he goes on strike. The employee does not  go

on  strike, Sir, just for the fun of it. There  is

no  fun  in economic privation but if you  do  not

give him this protection, Sir, he immediately gets

dismissed.  As a consequence, he might  be  thrown

out  of the house which he occupies as an employee

of  the  company. Let me point this out, Sir:  the

fact that you protect the right to strike does not

prevent  the  employer from giving  you  a  proper

notice  dismissing you from his  service.  He  can

still dismiss you but dismiss you with notice. All

I  am  pleading for in this amendment is that  the

right  to  strike  shall not be deemed  misconduct

sufficient to warrant instant dismissal.  How  can

Members of this House, Sir, all of us who seek the

welfare of the people, all of us who claim  to  be

Socialists, reject and refuse a very modest and  a

very reasonable plea?



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> I will say quite frankly, Sir,

that   I  had  hoped  not  to  intervene  on  this

particular  matter  but one  or  two  observations

which  have  fallen from the Member for  Cairnhill

make me feel that I should say something.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, what I would like to say is this,

Sir,  that  I am not very sure that I  follow  the

argument  of  the hon. Member and  insofar  as  it

related  to the amendment which we are considering

now, and was based on the provisions of clause  27

of  the  Bill. I am sorry that I cannot  say  more

about  it but all I do say is this, that I do  not

follow the argument.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to refer to the concluding part

of  his  argument, that is, his  argument  in  his

second  address  in Committee on  this  particular

point,  and that was, I think - correct me if  I  am

wrong - he was pleading that where employees strike,

the  action  they take in striking should  not  be

regarded   as   misconduct  justifying   dismissal

without  notice.  That is what  I  understood  his

argument to be, Sir, and that seems to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1896</b></font><br><br>



me  to be confused in some way with the provisions

of  clause  14 which deals with dismissal  without

notice on grounds of misconduct which we discussed

this  morning. It seems to me - I may  be  a  little

obtuse  on this matter - to have very little  to  do

with  the amendment which we are considering  now.

The  amendment which we are considering now is  to

the  effect,  as  I understand it,  that  for  the

purposes  of  clause  15, where  employees  go  on

strike, their going on strike should not be deemed

to be a breach of contract. That seems to me to be

an  entirely different matter and to conclude what

I  have  to say, Sir, I would remind the Committee

that,  on the question of whether or not a  strike

involves  a  breach of contract, that must  depend

upon  whether the withdrawal of the employees  has

followed   on  notice  which  would  bring   their

contract  to an end or whether it does not  follow

on such notice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that there is anything further I

can usefully add, Sir, to what has been said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I might help, Sir, the Attorney-General and I would like to read clause 27. It

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deductions may be made under paragraph (a) of

section  26  of this Ordinance only on account  of

the  absence of an employee from the place  where,

by  the terms of his employment, he is required to

work, such absence being for the whole or any part

of  the  period  during which he  is  required  to

work."



<br><br>What I am saying there, Sir, is: if a man goes  on

strike,  the  employer does not have  to  pay  his

wages  or  his salary because under the provisions

of  clause  27, he may deduct from his salary  the

monies that would have been payable to him had  he

attended  work and that, in fact, he is liable  to

these deductions if he absents himself from work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, whether a strike action amounts to a

breach  of  contract  without  misconduct   or   a

misconduct  which affects the express  or  implied

terms  of  a contract is really not very material.

All  I  am saying is that under the common law  at

present,  a trade unionist who obeys the order  of

his  trade  union  to  go on  strike  can  legally

justify  an  instant dismissal  by  his  employers

without any notice and I am asking that he  should

have adequate protection.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am a

little bit confused. The Member for Cairnhill

wants this. If the employees go on strike, they

should be paid the wages-



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> -and that the wages should

not be deducted - when he referred to clause 27.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> He did not say that.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, if absence

from  work caused by strike is not to be a  breach

of  contract, then surely under clause 26 (1) (a),

the  employer shall not be allowed to  deduct  for

absence  from work because no deduction  could  be

made  for  absence from work as a  result  of  the

strike not being a breach of contract. We are  not

a court of law, Sir, and you do not sit as a judge

but looking at clause 26 (1) (a) together with the

proposed amendment, surely it does not make sense.

If  strike action is not a breach of contract  and

absence from work is a result of strike action, no

deduction can be made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I still have to persist, Sir. Would

the hon. Member read clause 27 (3) :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If any employee absents himself from work

otherwise than as provided by this Ordinance or by

his contract of service, the employer may, subject

to  any order which may be made by a court  or  by

the  Commissioner  on complaint of  either  party,

deduct  from  any salary due to such employee  the

cost of food.".



<br><br>Now,  that  is one. Look at clause 27  (1)  again,

Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deductions may be made under paragraph a) of

section  26  of this Ordinance only on account  of

the  absence of an employee from the place  where,

by  the terms of his employment, he is required to

work.".



<br><br>Now, Sir, I have a contract with you whereby I  am

required to work for you in your office. I  absent

myself for one day, for two days, for three  days,

and  I come along and say, "I am sorry, Sir, I was

attending  my  grandmother's funeral,"  but,  Sir,

that   does   not   necessarily  justify   instant

dismissal  and  I should not be penalised.  As  an

employer, therefore clause 27 (1) permits  you  to

deduct from my wages the wages which should have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1898</b></font><br><br>



been  paid for those three days. What I am  asking

for  in this amendment is not that they should  be

paid  as  the  Minister for Commerce and  Industry

(Mr  J.  M.  Jumabhoy) suggests. I am not  asking

that they be paid any wages or salary during their

strike. All I say is that their action should  not

amount  to  a  breach of contract  which  attracts

instant dismissal. That is all that my clause says

and  if  there is any change in wording that  this

House  should want in order to make the  intention

clearer either in clause 27 (1) or in clause 15, I

will  be  only  too happy to concede  and  to  co-operate  to  the  utmost. All I ask  is  that  the

principle  be accepted, that it is no civil  wrong

to  go  on  strike  and that  an  employer  cannot

dismiss  you  summarily because you have  gone  on

strike.

Sir,  I  know  that this House is in  no  mood  to

listen to my amendment but I appeal to it again to

consider  here that an industrial clerk  does  the

same  work  as an ordinary clerk and there  is  no

logic  in his getting seven days annual leave  and

the  ordinary clerk getting fourteen  days  annual

leave.  It  cannot be said that if the  industrial

clerk  gets  fourteen days, he  would  disorganise

anything, Sir, because you do not take your  leave

simultaneously  with  the workmen  with  whom  you

work.  You  take  your  leave  staggered.  In  the

circumstances, I think we could do just  a  little

justice  to  the industrial clerk  here,  Sir,  by

recognising  that  he is the same  type  of  human

being as the others to whom we are giving fourteen

days annual leave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore move,

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the same

reasons  apply to this amendment as the reasons  I

gave with regard to the amendment to clause 36.  I

do  not  say that industrial clerks are not  human

beings, but I do say this: that workmen are  human

beings   just  as  well,  and  under  the   Labour

Ordinance they are given a minimum of seven  days;

and  as industrial clerks are being classified  in

the  same category, they should be given the  same

number  of  annual holidays. Although  the  Labour

Ordinance  provides for seven days  annual  leave,

most  unions have, by active negotiation,  secured

for  their  members 14 days annual leave.  In  the

same  way,  it  is  hoped  that  organisations  of

industrial clerks may be just as active to get for

their  members what unions of workmen have secured

for their members.

<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I was just going

Labour believes that employers have recognized, in

agreement    with    the   trade    unions,    the

reasonableness  of 14 days annual leave  for  this

type  of  employees, surely that is all  the  more

reason  for  this House to put that as a  minimum?

Would he not reconsider the position, Sir? A vital

principle  is  involved; there  is  a  very  large

section  of the people of Singapore to  whom  this

means a great deal. Why does he throw the onus  on

unions,  who  are weak at the present  moment,  to

strive  to obtain the minimum? This Bill is  there

to  assist  in fixing the minimum, and  surely  14

days leave for a clerk is not too much?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 37 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 38-



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I beg to move

an amendment to clause 38, that is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 25, line 41, after "employer", to insert

"or  in  default of such appointment by  any  duly

registered medical practitioner".



<br><br>Sir, I think you will remember that, at an earlier

stage,  references were made to the provisions  of

this  clause,  and  amongst other  things  it  was

suggested  that  it  was  defective  because   the

position  of the sick employee would be difficult,

if  not  impossible, in cases  where  an  employer

declined   or   failed  to   appoint   a   medical

practitioner whose certificate he would accept for

the  purposes of this clause. And for that reason,

Sir, this amendment is now proposed, its effect is

that, where an employer does not appoint a medical

practitioner to whom his employees can  go  for  a

certificate when they are sick, they may go to any

other registered medical practitioner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I should add, Sir, that this amendment

anticipates  in part the amendment  of  which  the

Member   for   Cairnhill  has  given  notice.   It

anticipates it because we on this side think that,

so  far as it goes, it would be more appropriately

made  at  this particular point in the clause.  It

omits  any  provision for any  time  limit  during

which the employer's doctor is required to examine

his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1903</b></font><br><br>



patients,  and  it omits references  to  maternity

leave,  both  these points being included  in  the

Notices  of  Amendments to this clause  which  has

been  given  by  the  Member for  Cairnhill.  With

regard  to these two points, I may perhaps  rather

in  anticipation say that the Government takes the

view  that it is unnecessary to prescribe a  time-limit  within  which a doctor should  examine  his

patients,  and  so  far  as  maternity  leave   is

concerned-

clause,  and  I  am happy to accept  the  proposed

amendment  by the Hon. the Attorney-General.  But,

Sir,  he  forgets one thing. The whole concept  is

that  the employee should be examined by a  doctor

to  be appointed by the employer and to be paid by

the   employer;   but   supposing   we   have   an

unreasonable employer, I asked what should  happen

and  I  proposed certain amendments. Now the  Hon.

standing  in the name of the Member for Queenstown

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[In page 25, line 42, to leave out "twenty-eight

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is not here, but I might say that

to adopt the amendment, to propose it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Chairman,

Sir,   my  objection  to  clause  38  having  been

satisfactorily  met in so far  as  the  lacuna  is

concerned,  I come to an important principle,  and

that  is  the  question  of  maternity  leave   to

employees.  I would like to move that a  new  sub-clause (2) be added, reading:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every employee shall be entitled to additional

paid  sick  leave during terms of four weeks  each

before and after her maternity confinement."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I did make a plea in my observations on the

motion for recommittal pointing out that clerks as

well   as   labourers  need  protection  in   this

instance, and the Minister for Labour and  Welfare

had  only one argument in reply. He said that  the

more  benefits we give to female clerks, the  less

the  number  of  female clerks will  be  employed.

Well,  Sir,  surely  he has given  these  benefits

under  the  Labour Ordinance? Is it then suggested

that  such  benefits in respect of  maternity  are

intended  to deter employers from engaging  female

labourers?  Obviously illogical. I  know,  Sir,  I

keep pressing the need for logic in the conduct of

Ministers  and  in the application of  Ordinances.

The   Labour   Ordinance  provides   that   female

labourers  are  in need of four weeks  before  and

four weeks



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1905</b></font><br><br>



after  confinement. Surely, Sir, women clerks  are

in need of the same period of leave. They are made

of  the  same  stuff,  they go  through  the  same

trials,  and I cannot understand the oversight.  I

had  at first hoped that it was an oversight,  but

it  seems  it  is  not, and I  shall  listen  with

interest to the explanation why women clerks  have

been  excluded  from the provisions  on  maternity

leave.  Is  it suggested, Sir, that it is  because

they  have 28 days sick leave under the Ordinance?

If  so,  let  it  be pointed out  that  everybody,

including males, have 28 day sick leave  (that  is

in  case  they are sick). Surely this is something

totally different - a woman, like a man, may be sick

for  28  days in respect of other matters but,  in

respect  of maternity confinement, she  should  be

entitled  to special consideration. In any  event,

Sir, if 28 days leave is not adequate for a female

labourer, how can it be considered adequate for  a

typist  or  any of the other women who  labour  as

fodder in our business machine?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, it has been

suggested  that it is illogical to grant maternity

leave to female workers under the Labour Ordinance

and  not  to female clerical workers. Sir,  it  is

common  knowledge that in many industries,  female

workers  (who are covered by the Labour Ordinance)

are  engaged because they are ideally  suited  for

particular  jobs.  In the case of  clerical  work,

however, what a girl can do a man can do  just  as

well,  and  I  say  that if you provide  maternity

leave for female clerks, impose it by legislation,

it  will  make it more difficult for them  to  get

employment  because  it  is  inevitable  that   an

employer - call  him unscrupulous if  you  like - will

then  engage  only  male  clerks.  If  it  is  the

intention  to deprive female clerks of employment,

then you can go ahead and impose maternity benefit

leave.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill in his speech on my

motion   quoted  the  names  of  good  employers - I

believe he mentioned Messrs. Boustead. Much can be

done,  Sir,  by example and precept  of  good  and

progressive employers. If employers are  good  and

progressive, it is immaterial whether a benefit is

provided or not by law; they will give



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1906</b></font><br><br>



maternity benefits to their female clerks  to  the

extent that they feel they can afford. Sir,  as  I

said   the  other  day  when  moving  the  motion,

Government is opposed to this amendment because it

does  not  want to deprive female workers  of  the

opportunities of employment as clerks in offices.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I would like to

understand whether I am wrong in thinking this:  I

am an employer and have a lady working for me. She

is a married woman. I do recognise the possibility

that one day she will become pregnant and that, in

the  normal  course of nature,  she  will  have  a

confinement one day. I do not expect her  to  drop

the baby in the waste-paper basket by the side  of

her  typewriter. I do recognise the  fact  when  I

employ a woman that one day she is going to have a

confinement  and  that she needs maternity  leave.

Every man, every industrial worker, every employer

who  employs a woman, must recognise that. So  the

fact  that  they are employing women  today  means

that they recognise that she will, at some period,

require  maternity leave. What I am seeking  here,

Sir,  is  to  fix a reasonable minimum  period  of

maternity leave. I know the Hon. the Minister  for

Labour   and   Welfare  is  enamoured   of   these

gentlemen, the employers, who are "reasonable  and

progressive", as he calls them, but if in fact his

experience  as  a  trade  unionist  suggests  that

employers  are  reasonable and progressive,  there

will  be no need for the legislation which we seek

to  enforce  minimum standards and  conditions  of

service.  Sir,  this  provision  is  intended  for

recalcitrant  employers.  Those  who   are   today

employing women will continue to do so because  in

commerce  there are women with special ability  as

there  are  specially suitable women labourers  in

industry. For example, quite frankly I think  that

a   woman   stenographer-secretary  is  far   more

competent  than any male stenographer-secretary  I

have come across. Stenography is one line in which

women  are  supreme, where you cannot  do  without

them  and  where they will continue to be employed

even if you give them this additional benefit. So,

I  say,  Sir, this is for the protection of  women

clerical workers against unscrupulous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1907</b></font><br><br>



employers who may seek to give them only 28  days

or  less  sick leave. Surely it is  our  duty  to

protect   these   women   from   this   type   of

exploitation? It is not true that employers  will

be  deterred  from  employing  women  in  offices

because of maternity leave. If you take it by and

large,  how  often is maternity leave given?  Not

every  woman  is married, Sir. Not every  married

woman   has  a  child  every  year.  Let  us   be

reasonable. A confinement occurs rarely  and  the

question is to protect women employed in  offices

from  unscrupulous employers who seek to  deprive

them  of  the  necessary time to recuperate  from

their confinement.

possible.

clause  41,  wherefor this annual leave  of  seven

days? Sir, every civilised country that I know  of

gives  14  days  leave to shop  assistants.  Here,

there  is  no question of labourers being involved

and   of   industrial  clerks  having   the   same

conditions of service as labourers. I do not  wish

to  lengthen this debate, Sir, and I would like an

indication from the Hon. the Minister whether,  if

I  move  an  amendment to change "seven"  days  to

"fourteen" days, he will accept it. I do not  wish

to be committed, Sir, and then have it thrown out.

Let  us know his intention now, because he has got

the  Whip  and  the majority. Will he  accept  the

amendment?

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is completely out of order.

The  hon. Member must move an amendment before the

matter  can  be  discussed.  It  is  a  matter  of

procedure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, in

that case I move an amendment to the amendment,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After clause "42" to insert "and clause 41".



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I suggest that we first take

the  original amendment and then it is up  to  the

Member  for Cairnhill to move a further  amendment

later  on? The first amendment is to insert  after

"clause 50" the words and figures "and clauses  6,

7, 14 and 42".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir, I would like to move a further amendment,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After clause "42", to insert "and clause 41".



<br><br>I understand from your ruling yesterday, Sir, that

it  is  a matter of convention that where a Member

seeks  for  a  clause  to  be  recommitted  to   a

Committee of the whole House, the wish is granted.

But  may  I say this, Sir, that if it is  not  the

intention of Government to concede an extension of

leave  for shop assistants from seven days  to  14

days,  I  do not want the clause to be recommitted

on  this question because it will merely waste the

time of the House. So if the Hon. the Minister can

indicate in reply whether he is agreeable,  I  can

either  withdraw my amendment or it can  be  voted

out.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have already indicated what the

correct  procedure  is. The Member  has  moved  an

amendment  and is entitled to speak at  length  on

that motion, but it will need a seconder before it

can  be  discussed.  Can I  have  a  seconder?  No

seconder? The amendment fails.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Report from the Select Committee on

the  Shop Assistants Employment Bill, as contained

in  Sessional  Paper L.A. 3 of 1957,  be  adopted,

subject  to the recommittal of the Bill in respect

of  clause  2,  clause 28, clause 29,  clause  30,

clause 34, and clause 50 and clauses 6, 7, 14  and

42 to a Committee of the whole Assembly,"

insert "or theatre".



<br><br>Sir,  owing  to  an oversight, the definition  of

"employer" was related only to shops and  not  to

theatres. It is obviously necessary to relate  it

also  to  theatres  in order  that  employers  of

ushers, ticket collectors, etc, will be bound  by

the  provisions of this Bill. Members  will  have

noted  that  the definition of "shop  assistants"

already includes ushers, ticket collectors,  etc.

in theatres. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2, as amended, ordered to stand part of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to add anything to what has

already been said in relation to clause 6 of  the

Clerks Employment Bill which has just been  dealt

with; the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1914</b></font><br><br>



reasons for this amendment are identical with

those given for that one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, Sir, the reasons for this,

amendment   have   already  been   discussed   in

Committee  on  the Clerks Employment  Bill,  when

clause 14 of that Bill was considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.

the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1915</b></font><br><br>

shall be the day on which the shop is required to

remain  closed in pursuance of the provisions  of

section 35 of this Ordinance".



<br><br>Sir, the clause, as worded, is too inflexible. It

says  that "rest day" shall be the day  on  which

the  shop  is required to close. As theatres  and

shops  in the Schedule are not required to close,

it is obviously impossible for shop assistants in

such shops and theatres to have their rest day on

a  closing  day.  The clause  as  re-worded  will

enable  this anomaly to be avoided and  make  the

provision much more flexible.
