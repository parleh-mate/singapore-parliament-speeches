<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been

asked  by  the  Prime  Minister  to  reply  to  this

question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kampong street lighting schemes are being

systematically  introduced  throughout  the   Island

according   to  priorities  based  upon   population

density and availability of electricity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area Paya Lebar to Jalan Alsagoff, street

lighting was installed last year. In the area  Jalan

Alsagoff to Jalan Eunos, known as the Malay Farm,  a

proposal to light five streets at a cost of  $15,000

has   been  submitted  for  consideration   of   the

Planning  Development Committee.  The  five  streets

are  Jalan Betek, Jalan Tebu, Jalan Penggaga,  Jalan

Bayam,  and Jalan Ubi. Proposals for the area  Jalan

Eunos  to  Jalan  Sentosa will have  to  take  their

place  alongside other proposals under  the  kampong

lighting  scheme. These particular  areas  have  the

added complication of being private property.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, could the

<div align="center"><b>(Statement on Talks with Federation of Malaya Government)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat</b> asked the

Minister  for  Finance  whether  he  will   make   a

statement on the progress made in the talks with the

Federation  of  Malaya  Government  on  the   Common

Market.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposal

to  establish a Common Market arrangement in respect

of  a  limited number of commodities produced either

in  the Federation or Singapore was first mooted  by

the  Singapore Government in September  1959.  As  a

result  of  subsequent discussions both at  official

and  ministerial levels, the two Governments  agreed

to  form  a Joint Committee of Officials to  discuss

the  proposal submitted by the Singapore  Government

for the establishment of a Common Market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three meetings of the Joint Committee of Officials

were  held between 10th June, 1960, and 25th August,

1960. In the course of these meetings, the officials

of  the Federation Government sought elucidation  on

certain  points, and both sides examined  in  detail

the   implications  of  the  proposal.   After   the

conclusion  of  the first series  of  meetings,  the

Federation representative asked for time to consider

these  proposals.  It is hoped that  talks  on  this

question  will be held shortly between Ministers  of

the Governments of Singapore and the Federation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the

Minister  not agree that there has been no  progress

at   all,   and  that  in  view  of  the  Federation

Government's attitude it would be better to drop the

whole matter?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not agree that no progress

has  been  made, Mr Speaker, Sir. May I remind  the

hon.  Member that in the case of the European Common

Market,   it  took  nearly  ten  years  before   the

proposals  were  finally  put  into  shape?  I   see

absolutely no cause for pessimism in regard to  this

scheme that we propose.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Would the Minister then give an

indication  whether  the talks will  be  successful,

since there have been no talks from August 1960?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Member  for  Cairnhill is asking  for  an  assurance

which,  in  the  nature of things,  just  cannot  be

given. But I would say that we are trying our  best.

The  next  step - and it is a significant advance - will

be  that discussions will be held at a higher level,

that  is  to say, it has progressed from discussions

between  officials  on purely technical  matters  to

discussions  between  Ministers  where   the   wider

implications can be examined.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have not

asked  for  an  assurance.  I  have  asked  for   an

indication.  Will  the  Minister  please   give   an

indication  whether  the  talks  are  going  to   be

successful?

persons  or  property which  cannot  otherwise

reasonably  be  avoided  for  which  there  is

sufficient  justification for precautions  but

not   sufficient  to  warrant  depriving   the

public of the services of a trained guard  and

escort police officer without compensation  to

potential   kidnap  victim  or   of   valuable

property at a function to which large  numbers

of the public may have admission;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) circumstances in which a crime might be

and  Pulau  Blakang Mati attending  morning  session

schools in Singapore were unable to reach school  in

time.  The  Ministry  took the matter  up  with  the

the  school  are  some very large  granite  boulders

which  are  considered a source  of  danger  to  the

alternative accommodation on their own, they will be

paid compensation for any improvements they have put

into  the  land in accordance with the  schedule  of

approved rates. If they wish to be rehoused  by  the

Housing Board, they will either be given one of  the

low-cost  one-room units now under  construction  at

Kim Keat Road and St. Michael's Estate at rentals of

$20  p.m.,  or  any  other  type  of  Housing  Board

accommodation,  but  they  will  not  be  paid   any

compensation for moving out. Lastly, they can choose

to  be  resettled in one of the resettlement  areas,

where  they  will be given a small lot with  a  free

house;  they  will  also be paid compensation  where

appropriate  for any improvements they  own  on  the

present land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am, of course, aware that resettlement is a

difficult  problem  and that the  persons  resettled

will  experience some initial inconvenience and,  in

some cases, perhaps some temporary difficulties.  It

is  not  expected that cases will arise  of  persons

having  to  lose their present means of  livelihood.

Those  who  are  farmers  will  be  given  all   the

facilities for carrying on with farming, whereas the

non-farmers  can  choose, out of  three  methods  of

resettlement,  the  method  that  best  suits  their

of  Home  Affairs who are supposed to keep  tabs  on

these  things. But unfortunately arising out of  the

difference  in  the long run to have  the  Ordinance

continue in force. A lengthy debate took place  with

the  Police  who  convinced me, as the  then  Acting

continue. I then gave instructions that, instead  of

a yearly renewal, a Bill should be prepared to allow

the  Ordinance to continue in force for a period  of

five years, and the matter could be reconsidered  by

a  subsequent Assembly. When the Bill was  prepared,

it  was introduced not as a new Bill for a period of

five  years, which it is now our intention to  move,

but  one  which, as the Member for Farrer  Park  had

pointed  out, attempted to continue in  existence  a

Bill which, technically, had lapsed by a failure  to

print  a  Gazette notification. The matter  has  now

been  put  right.  I do not know whether  it  is  of

advantage to pass any castigating remarks on  either

the  Crown  Counsel or the junior clerical  officers

who  should have seen to this matter. However, I  am

assured  that everybody did, in fact, do  his  duty,

but the reference book which is turned up day by day

to  see what lapses and what needs to be renewed was

unfortunately not turned up in this particular  case

in  time. It was discovered a few days after it  had

lapsed.  I  must say this on behalf of the permanent

officials  of the Government - that the discovery  was

made  within  three  days of the  lapsing,  and  the

length   of   time  between  the   lapse   and   the

introduction of the Bill does not indicate  that  it

was  forgotten for that long period of time, but  it

does  indicate that a debate was going on whether  a

Bill of that nature should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>



reintroduced. As I have said, we have  decided  that

the  Bill  should  continue,  instead  of  a  yearly

renewal.  It  has  a  certain deterrent  effect  and

should  continue for the rest of the  life  of  this

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Order for the resumption of debate on the

Second  Reading of the Offences relating to Vehicles

(Amendment) Bill set down this day as item 3 of  the

Orders  of  the Day he discharged and  the  Bill  be

withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is similar to the Offences relating to

Vehicles  Ordinance,  1960, which  had  expired  and

which  the Offences relating to Vehicles (Amendment)

Bill,  1961, sought to continue in operation  for  a

further period of four years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Offences relating to Vehicles (Amendment)

Bill,  1961,  was given its Second  Reading  at  the

Assembly  sitting on 26th April, 1961, but,  as  the

House  will  remember, further debate was  adjourned

owing  to  criticism of the method of extending  the

principal Ordinance. This amending Bill has now been

withdrawn and in its place is this new Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the debate on the Offences relating to

Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 1961, I gave the  reasons

why   it  was  necessary  to  extend  the  principal

Ordinance for a further period of four years.  I  do

not  propose,  therefore,  to  say  much  about  the

Offences relating to Vehicles Bill, 1961, except  to

say  that it is also to be in operation for a period

of  four  years, that its provisions are similar  to

the  1960  Ordinance of the same name, and that  its

becoming law is a matter of urgency, since it is  to

replace the Offences relating to Vehicles Ordinance.

1960,  which would have already continued to  be  in

operation  for another four years, if  the  Offences

relating  to  Vehicles (Amendment) Bill,  1961,  had

been passed by the Assembly.

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House is aware, the Government is revising

the  electoral  registers  this  year.  The  present

position  with regard to this revision is  that  the

existing registers and Lists A and B have been  open

to public inspection since 8th May, 1961, and closed

on  22nd May, 1961. Next will follow what we know as

the  Claims  and  Objections period  when  lists  of

claimants  will be published, objections  to  claims

received,  and adjudication of claims and objections

made. According



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>



to  the  timetable  drawn up for completion  of  the

revised  registers, it is expected that the  revised

registers will be certified and published in  August

1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the revision of the electoral registers is

going  on, we have before us the Anson Division

by-election caused by the death of the late Member  for

Anson,  Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff.  Because

of  complaints that some persons who intended to  be

candidates in the Hong Lim by-election could not  do

so,  and because their names had been omitted in the

present  registers, it is considered desirable  that

this by-election should be held on the basis of  the

certified revised registers, and not on the  present

registers which are over two years old.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of these revised registers of electors

will  mean  that persons standing as  candidates  in

this  by-election  will  not  be  confined  only  to

persons  whose  names appear in the 1959  registers.

Normally,  these  revised  registers  would  not  be

certified and published until September at least  of

the   year  in  which  revision  takes  place.   The

Government  has  decided, however, that  proceedings

for  the  holding of the by-election for  the  Anson

Division  should be commenced early next  month  and

that  Nomination Day should be 10th June. Therefore,

this  Bill  has  been  introduced  to  make  special

provisions  to enable any person whose name  appears

in List B for any electoral division or who has made

a  valid claim for the insertion or retention of his

name  in  a  register  of electors  to  stand  as  a

candidate for election for the electoral division of

Anson if he so desires, although his name is not yet

included  in  a register of electors.  This  special

legislation  in  effect  will  allow  nomination  of

candidates  to proceed, while the new registers  are

being  completed for certification and  publication.

We were unable to provide similar special provisions

in  respect of the Hong Lim by-election as the

time-table  for  the  preparatory  work  on  the  revised

registers for 1961 did not make it possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as voting on Polling Day in the Anson

by-election  is  concerned, administrative arrangements

have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>



made  to ensure that the revised register for  Anson

will  be  given priority attention and be ready  for

certification  and publication by  July  this  year.

This  certification  and publication  will  be  made

sometime  before Polling Day in order to enable  all

voters  in the certified revised register for  Anson

to  vote  at  the by-election. They  alone  will  be

eligible  to  vote, as this register  would  be  the

register of electors in operation on Polling Day  in

accordance  with  the provisions  of  the  Singapore

Legislative Assembly elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am  a bit disturbed by the speech of the Minister in

the  Second  Reading  of this  Bill.  He  says  that

Polling  Day for Anson will have to wait  until  the

revised register is ready, and he says that ii  will

not  be  ready until sometime in July.  This  means,

Sir, that after Nomination Day a candidate will have

difficulty  in knowing who his voters are.  He  will

have  to work a bit in the dark as he will have only

the 1959 register to guide him. It will mean greater

difficulty to all the candidates, especially as they

will have to wait until the new revised register for

Anson  is  out before they can send their manifestos

and circulars to those people whose names appear  on

the  revised  electoral roll which, as the  Minister

has said, will not be ready until July.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a bit difficult if the Government

Printing Office were to experience some breakdown in

the  machinery.  What will happen then  to  the

by-election?  I  think it is only a  maximum  of  eight

weeks  or  two  months between  Nomination  Day  and

Polling  Day, and if the revised electoral  roll  is

not ready by then, there might be no by-election!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister also says that this amendment is

to  enable  those whose names appear in  List  B  or

those  who  have made claims for their names  to  be

registered in the electoral roll to stand as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1478</b></font><br><br>



candidates.   He   says   that   he   has   received

representation. I do not say that I do  not  believe

him, because there was an instance in Hong Lim where

a  prospective  candidate was not allowed  to  stand

because  her  name did not appear in  the  electoral

roll  and  there  was  a  scene  where  some  public

mourning  took  place. In a way this did  give  some

indication  to the public that it was  mourning  day

for the P.A.P. in Hong Lim.



<br><br>3.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Minister sought to give the impression  to  the

House that while the registers are being revised, it

might  not  be  possible to hold  a  by-election  in

Anson. I got that impression from the Minister  when

he opened his speech this afternoon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that impression is confirmed by what I read

in the Straits Times of Wednesday, 24th May, on page

one. It reads, Mr Speaker, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Official announcement also stated that the

Government would ask the Legislative Assembly at its

sitting  tomorrow to approve a special  Bill,  which

would allow the by-election to proceed while the new

Anson  electoral  register is  being  finalised  and

certified.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my understanding of that official statement, as

printed  in the Straits Times, is correct, it  seeks

to   give   to   the   public  of   Singapore   this

impression - that because the electoral  roll  is  now

being  revised and as the revision will take two  or

three months and while this revision is taking place

no by-election can be held, and as the Government is

anxious  that  Anson should not remain unrepresented

in  the  Assembly for too long, the  Government  has

therefore  introduced this special Bill  which  will

enable   the   electorate  of  Anson   to   have   a

representative in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my understanding of the Elections Ordinance

is  that no revision need deter the Government  from

holding  a by-election in Anson. In fact, the  whole

basis   of   the   Legislative  Assembly   Elections

Ordinance is that election will be held at the  time

when a vacancy arises on the register then obtaining

at that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1479</b></font><br><br>



time.  Mr Speaker, Sir, if my understanding of  the

law  is correct, then the Government has been guilty

of  issuing a statement which, on the face of it, is

not  in  keeping  with the law  as  it  stands.  The

Government  seeks to place itself  in  the  favoured

position  of  telling  the public  that  it  is  not

delaying the election and that what it is trying  to

do  is to hold the election earlier than is possible

by  law.  Therefore, it is bringing in this  special

Bill  to enable an election at Anson to take  place.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  P.A.P.  Government  is  no

chicken.  I am fully convinced in my own  mind  that

the Government, with all the assistance that it has,

is  fully  aware that an election in Anson can  take

place  while  the electoral roll is  being  revised.

Therefore,  one  asks  the  question.  Why  was   it

necessary  for  the Ministry of Culture - I  think  it

must  have been the Ministry of Culture, because  it

was  an  official statement - to put out  a  statement

which, on the face of it, is not in keeping with the

law?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested, Mr Speaker, and suggested

seriously,  that the Government has some  particular

candidate   in  mind  to  put  up  in   Anson,   but

unfortunately  for  them, he  is  not  on  the  1959

electoral   register.  Therefore,  it   has   become

necessary, shall I say, to amend the law in order to

suit this particular individual, so that he might be

given  the  privilege and the right to  contest  the

election  in Anson when the existing law denies  him

that right or privilege. Mr Speaker. Sir, it is for

the Government in its reply to explain the situation

adequately.  I  do not accept the statement  by  the

Minister that because one person has complained that

he or she had not been allowed to stand in Hong Lim,

therefore,   the  Government  has  been   conscience

stricken  about the whole thing, and it  has  become

necessary to use the whole legislative machinery  to

enable  this one person to contest the  Anson

by-election.  I  am sufficiently a cynic, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  not  to  accept  that reason.  There  must  be

something  more to it. And it is for the  Government

to explain it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading the Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, it would

appear  that those persons who would be  allowed  to

stand as candidates might not get their names on the

registers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>



in  time to vote, unless the Government extends  the

time to a date when it will become possible for  the

registers  to  be  finalised.  If  the  Minister  is

seriously  suggesting that the  election  will  only

take place when the 1961 registers have been finally

revised and certified by the Returning Officer, then

the  time  for  claims  and objections  and  appeals

against those claims and objections would have to be

taken  into  account;  then the  election  might  be

delayed  till  August  or  September.  Is   it   the

intention  of  Government  then  not  to  hold   the

election  until  the  revised  registers  have  been

finally  certified by the Returning  Officer?  As  I

read the Bill, Sir, it merely enables the Government

to  hold  the election on the existing registers  as

they  now stand, with the addition of List  B,  with

the  addition of any person who now claims  or  will

claim that his name has been left out. As far  as  I

can see, Mr Speaker, Sir, it makes no provision  to

enable persons whose names are on List B to vote  in

the  election.  The only way in which persons  whose

names  appear  on List B can vote would  be  if  the

registers  have been certified before  the  election

takes place. If, unfortunately, those registers  are

not  certified, then persons on List B cannot  vote.

So  we  have the anomalous situation of a  candidate

who  has  not got a vote in that particular area  or

any  area  being  able to stand as a  candidate  for

Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I cannot help people being

cynical  or  pessimists, or  otherwise  abnormal  in

their  attitude to life, but we would like  to  help

them  to understand what this legislation is  trying

to  do.  For quite some time now the Census  Office,

together  with the Elections Office, had  fixed  May

for  the  revision of the registers. These registers

were  last  revised in 1958. The date for  the  next

revision  was postponed from 1959 and 1960  to  take

place  in 1961, because we felt that it would  be  a

waste  of  effort  to have a yearly revision  whilst

other  more important things were being looked into.

Therefore, this operation had already been triggered

off for quite some time before May 1961.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are asking some odd thousand people - new

voters - to  go and check their names in the electoral

roll - List B; those whose names have been struck off

from the old register for various reasons, those who

have  now reached 21 since 1958. At the moment,  you

can only hold an election in Anson without this Bill

cm  the old 1958 registers and you are going to have

confusion  not only in Anson but in the whole  town.

Everybody  has just gone to check his  name  on  the

register.  Then he is told he cannot vote.  Election

must,  therefore, willy nilly take place on the  new

register.  That is the position. The  operation  has

been launched for a revision of the register and  we

have to go through with it. In normal circumstances,

what  would  happen  is that the register  would  be

finalised  in  September  and  could  be  used   for

nomination in October. We are putting in overtime to

finish  the register in Anson by July so that voting

can take place in July. The other constituencies can

be  held  up, and they will probably be finished  in

August.  But  in  July when voting  in  Anson  takes

place, all those who have gone to check their  names

will  find  that they are entitled to vote.  At  the

same time, there have been complaints that the names

of some people have been left out from the register.

They  want  to  be candidates - whether sincerely  or

just  as a guile is another matter. We say,  by  all

means  be candidates. By all means, let us  vote  on

the  new  register. The 10th of June  is  fixed  for

Nomination Day for Anson. Anybody whose name  is  on

List  B or on the old register is entitled to  be  a

candidate.  The  period for inspection  has  already

closed.  It  closed last Saturday.  Two  weeks  were

allowed  for inspection. The inspection has  closed.

That is why we are taking this Bill today. All those

who have inspected the register and have found their

names there can be candidates. If they are in Anson,

they can be voters. That is the position. All we are

doing  is  to prevent a delay in the by-election  or

the by-election being carried out on an old register

which is out of date



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1482</b></font><br><br>



and  which, in view of the fact that this  operation

to  revise  the register has already been  launched,

will  cause  confusion. People  have  gone  to  Post

Offices  and have seen their names. If they are  now

told they cannot vote because this is being held  on

the  old  register, there will be a  great  deal  of

confusion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position is simple. If the Member for Farrer

Park  and  the  Member  for  Cairnhill  want  to  be

cynical,  or  for  other  medical  or  psychological

reasons are unhappy about it, I can do nothing about

it.  All  I  can  do is to try and explain  to  them

simply  what this operation is all about. It  is  to

enable  an  election in Anson to take  place  using

this  register which has already been  inspected  by

the   public,  and  ensuring  a  suitable   overtime

arrangement that the register is certificated before

Polling Day. Sir, the Member for Farrer Park is  not

the  only person who, on reading the Bill, asks  why

there  has  been no provision that those on  List  B

will  be  able to vote in Anson. I am sorry  to  say

that,  for a person who is conversant with  the  law

and  professionally holding himself out as a  person

who is prepared to advise other persons on the law,

he  had not bothered to look up the provisions which

the  State  Advocate-General would tell him.  It  is

unnecessary  to have any special provision  in  this

Bill  to  say  that certification  will  take  place

before polling. Certification must take place before

polling before the register can be used; otherwise a

fraud  on  the  public will have  been  perpetrated.

Surely  the Member is not suggesting for one  moment

that  we are going to go through the whole elaborate

process of legislation to speed up the election  and

then  on  Polling  Day say, "Ladies  and  gentlemen,

please vote on the old register." Some 2,000 persons

in  Anson whose names are on List B would thereby be

turned  away, causing a great deal of  unhappiness,

misunderstanding and cynicism on a much bigger scale

than  it  has  already worked in this House  on  two

Members of the Opposition.

subsequent events may bear out that what  the  Prime

Minister  has said is true, yet, coming as it  does,

this   new  Bill  does  create  a  very  unfortunate

impression.  The impression, Sir, is  that  for  the

sake  of some particular person or persons this Bill

is  being  specially introduced to  enable  them  to

stand as candidates. That may not be true, Sir,  but

that is the unfortunate impression being created.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Anyway, Sir, the principle

introduced  is  wrong - that just before  an  election

this  kind  of legislation should be introduced.  If

the  rules  were  not satisfactory  they  should  be

allowed  to  stand until after the particular  match

has   been   finished  and  not  just   before   the

commencement  of the match. Otherwise any  party  in

power - maybe not this one - can legislate just  before

a  very important election in such a way that it  is

to  the  advantage of that particular party  or  the

particular candidate contesting for that party. I am

not  saying that the Government is going to  do  it,

Sir, but the timing of the Bill is very unfortunate.

I  just  wish to assure the Opposition Members  that

the   revised  electoral  register  will  be   ready

sometime before Polling Day. I can assure the  House

that  all  candidates will have sufficient  time  to

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry

that the debate has taken this turn. I would like to

make the position of the Government quite clear. All

we  are doing is to ensure that there is an election

held  quickly, fairly, and with no confusion. I have

explained that the operation to revise the  register

had  been planned some one year before hand. It  was

triggered  off  for May and had been triggered  off.

Thousands  of people have gone to see this  register

and  it  is impossible just to ignore this operation

and say, "Right, we go back to the old register."  I

give  this  House an alternative. So far as  we  are

concerned,  it  is  a matter of  irrelevance  to  us

whether the election is held on the old register  or

on  the  new register. But as far as the people  are

concerned, it is important that there should  be  no

confusion. Those whose names are already put in List

B,  and who have already inspected them, will expect

to  go  and  vote. If the Opposition feel that  they

want the register to be certificated, then when  the

time  for division comes let them vote against  this

amendment, and the Government will allow  this  Bill

to  be  defeated on the voice of the Opposition.  If

they say no to this Bill, then this Bill can go out.

The  register will be certificated in July  and  the

election can take place. We are quite happy to  have

this Bill and launch the by-election in June. If the

Opposition  feel,  as  the Member  for  Tanglin  has

suggested,  that this is changing the rules  in  the

midst  of  the  game, then we say,  "Right.  We  can

postpone  the  game at the will of the  Opposition."

Let  them  say no to this Bill. The Bill is scrapped

and   nomination  can  take  place  in  July   after

certification.  If they say yes to this  Bill,  then

nomination  can take place on the 10th of  June  and

polling will take place - I give a solemn assurance - on

the new register in July. That is the simple-

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am not quite certain at this stage.

first move the amendment, and if he is satisfied he

can beg leave to withdraw it.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member should make his speech

now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir. Section 17 of

the  principal  Ordinance, which  is  the  Singapore

Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance,  reads  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`17. -(1) Every person who is entitled in

accordance  with  this Ordinance to  have  his  name

entered in any register of electors at a revision of

that  register and whose name has been omitted  from

that register and from List B or whose name has been

included in List A, and who claims to have his  name

inserted  or  retained as the case  may  be  in  the

register  may apply to the Registration  Officer  to

have his name inserted or retained therein.'



<br><br>So  that, Mr Speaker, Sir, under section 17 (1)  it

is  merely a claim that we know. Section 17 (1) does

not  speak about a "valid" claim. Now, clause 3 here

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any person whose name appears in List B or who

has  made  a  valid claim under sub-section  (1)  of

section 17 of the principal Ordinance...'.



<br><br>May  I, therefore, ask the Minister to explain  what

exactly  he  means  by a "valid claim";  whether  he

distinguishes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1487</b></font><br><br>



a  "valid claim" from a "claim" under section 17 (1)

as  set  out  in the Singapore Legislative  Assembly

Elections Ordinance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not

anticipate the legal aspects of this debate,  but  I

should  imagine the answer lies in the fact  that  a

claim  has to be first substantiated. All  kinds  of

claims can be made to a Returning Officer or to  the

man in charge of the register. But the man in charge

of  the register either allows or disallows a  claim

according  to whether it is in accordance  with  the

facts  and  according  to the  Law.  The  expression

"valid  claim"  means one which  has  been  allowed,

found to be in accordance with the facts and the law

by  the  officer in charge. Further I would like  to

add   that  as  far  as  these  List  B  voters  are

concerned,  the  period for inspection  has  already

closed;   the  claims  and  objections   are   being

considered and will be over, I believe, in  about  a

fortnight. Thereafter, before the 10th of June,  the

claims  have either been accepted or they have  been

rejected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Prime

Minister  has appreciated the point I raised.  If  I

may  pursue the matter further from there, the point

then,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, is in  clause  3 - a  "valid

claim".  So that a "valid claim" cannot arise  under

clause  3 unless and until the claims and objections

have  been disposed of. Now, if a person's name  has

been  left  out  of  List B, then  that  person  has

certain remedies. He proceeds then under section 11.

The  chronological sequence of revising a  register,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, is this. As the Hon. the Minister

for  Home Affairs has indicated, the registers  were

published  two weeks before last Monday.  They  were

given  two weeks, which came to an end last  Monday,

which  was  the 22nd of May. Then any  person  whose

name  does not appear on List B can send in a claim.

If  a  person's name appears in List B, Mr Speaker,

Sir, that is not the end of the problem. The problem

is  just  about to start. Then the Returning Officer

has  to publish that list and within 10 days of  the

publication of List B, any person



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>



who  objects to any name on List B can then send  in

an  objection. If the objection is sent in, then the

Registration  Officer must hold  a  public  inquiry.

That takes some time. Before the public inquiry  can

take place, both the objector and the person to whom

objection  is  taken must be called to  this  public

inquiry. Evidence is then heard and the Registration

Officer  adjudicates upon the claim or the objection

as the case may be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my point is this. It is at that

point of time that it becomes a valid claim and  not

before;  so that a claim, to become a "valid claim",

might take two to three months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the other case, Mr Speaker, where no

objection is made to a person whose name appears  on

List B. Merely because his name appears on List B is

not  the  end of the matter. The proviso to  section

11(9) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Provided that the Registration Officer may,

without  any public inquiry as aforesaid, allow  any

claim in respect of which no objection has been made

if  he is otherwise satisfied that such claim should

be  allowed and shall insert the claimants's name in

the register.'



<br><br>So  that  in the case of a person to whose  name  no

objection  has  been taken, his claim becomes  valid

only  when  the  Registration Officer has  satisfied

himself that his name should be allowed to go on the

register. So we get two points of time when a  claim

can  become valid - in the case of a person  who  has

not  been  objected to when the Registrar  satisfies

himself that he is all right, and in the case  of  a

person who has been objected to after an inquiry has

taken  place  and the Registrar has  then  satisfied

himself.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this is going to take some time - from two to

three months. So I ask the Minister what then is the

meaning  of  the phrase, "or who has  made  a  valid

claim  under  subsection (1) of section  17  of  the

principal Ordinance"? Does it mean that the election

will be held up until such time as the Registrar has

satisfied  himself that in either case cited  by  me

that person has a valid claim?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the Member for Farrer

Park   delights  in  legal  quibbles.  We  are   not

concerned with legal quibbles as such. A problem had

to  be met, namely, that the operation to revise the

register had been launched in May. We are now trying

to  prevent  undue delay, because of this  revision,

from holding an election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of persons likely to be affected by an

objection  being made against them  or  by  a  claim

being  refused  is  probably not one  in  a  hundred

thousand, according to previous experience in  these

matters  - and  probably not one in  Anson.  Assuming

that  50  people  are  involved  in  Anson,  is   it

suggested that there can be no certification of  the

register  for  a  poll to be taken  till  all  these

inquiries are held? What we are saying is, "Here  is

List  B  a sum total in Anson of about 2,000 people,

out of a sum total in the whole of Singapore of over

100,000  people  who  now expect  themselves  to  be

voters. Let it proceed." We are confident that  with

overtime  work  put in, the Anson register  will  be

certificated in July. That is all we are  saying.  I

think  this is a more convenient time for me to  say

this,  because in the Third Reading I will  have  an

opportunity to speak only once. Some Members of  the

Opposition are either deliberately dense, or perhaps

they   are  naturally  incapable  of  following   an

argument  put  only once. The proposition  is  quite

simple. We intend to change no rules. It can make no

difference to the outcome whether you change or  you

do  not change the rules. All we are saying is this.

A  by-election has to be held in Anson.  It  is  our

intention to hold it as quickly as is convenient and

in  keeping with decency when a Member has died.  We

feel   that  the  most  convenient  time   will   be

immediately after the National Day celebrations when

we go back to work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Opposition feel that this is changing the

rules, all they have to do when they vote is to  say

no  and  the Bill will die. We will let the register

in  Anson  be  certificated in July and polling  can

take place. But let it never be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>



said that we were not prepared to introduce a bit of

legislation to enable it to take place in  June.  It

is  as  simple  as  that. We  can  argue  round  the

mulberry  bush and inquiries can go on  for  months,

but  how  many  people  are involved?  In  the  last

revision  of the register, the Returning Officer - the

man  in  charge - will tell you that there  were  not

more  than  20  to 30 objections for  the  whole  of

Singapore. Is it suggested that all this  should  be

held up?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us assume that one objection is made in

Anson - the one person being either on the register or

claiming  to  be on the register. He does  not  vote

while  his claim is being adjudicated, hut  all  the

other 2,000 odd voters plus the 8,000 voters on  the

old  register can vote. That is all. It is as simple

as that. I say sometimes perhaps the Opposition will

have to take the responsibility for legislation.  In

a  case  like this, we have taken the responsibility

of  bringing forward this legislation in order  that

things can move. If the Opposition feel that this is

not  in  their interest and they do not  think  that

this  is  according  to  the rules,  let  them  vote

against it. The by-election can be held up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It is a strange thing, Sir, that the

Prime  Minister  should  take  this  line  when  his

Government, having taken the full responsibility for

this  Bill,  should now talk as he is doing.  If  he

felt  it  was a national Bill, there was one  course

open  to him. He could have consulted the Opposition

leaders before he brought in this Bill, but he never

took  the  trouble to do that. But now  when  he  is

faced with problems, he is trying to put the onus on

the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, the point is that this

is  a Bill which does not talk of enabling people to

vote. It merely enables people to stand for election

and  not to vote. If the law of the country is  that

only  a person who resides in a particular ward  can

vote  or stand in that ward, then the problem  which

the  Prime Minister is speaking of might not  be  so

serious.  But here, Mr Speaker, Sir, in  Singapore,

irrespective of where you live and where your name

appears  on the register, you can go and  stand  for

election in any division. Now, this is a Bill  which

enables  people  whose  names  appear  on   List   B

throughout  the 51 electoral divisions to  stand  in

Anson, and the Prime Minister keeps on talking about

the  Anson register. Really, Mr Speaker, Sir, I  do

not understand the Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to

call for the file just to read out my minute to  the

Minister asking him to clear with the State

Advocate-General  with  certainty that there is no  necessity

for a provision in the Bill to ensure that those  on

List  B will be allowed to vote, and the answer that

came  back  from  the  S.A.G. was  that  it  is  not

necessary  because  it is expected  to  certify  the

register  before polling takes place. That  is  all.

That is the key operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, it is not our business. Once it is

suggested that this is a partisan Bill, then  I  say

we  pass the ball back to the Opposition. It is  the

business  of the Government to govern. If this  were

not a partisan Bill, then I say we take it though in

the   national  interest  regardless  of  what   the

Opposition say. But this is a Bill to ensure  a

by-election   in  Anson,  in  which  Members   of   the

Opposition  or  individuals in the  Opposition  will

become  interested parties, either via their parties

or via individuals whom they may support. Therefore,

if  it  is suggested for one moment, on a Bill which

is  meant to introduce a political contest, that  it

is  ensuring  laws  which are  unfavourable  to  the

Opposition, then I say scrap it. And I leave  it  to

them either to take the Bill or scrap it. That is  a

matter entirely open to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I read here a note from the S.A.G. to the

Permanent  Secretary  to  the  Minister   for   Home

Affairs?  This arose out of my query to the Minister

as  to  the  need  for having a provision,  and  the

S.A.G. wrote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I refer to your minute of the 17th May.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I confirm that if the new register is revised and

certified  before  Polling Day, voters  on  the  new

register  will be eligible to vote and there  is  no

need for a separate provision.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>



The query that was sent up from the Minister is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The draft Ordinance is all right insofar as it

overcomes the provisions regarding candidates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you please check whether the new register

which  is  now  being prepared  and  which  will  be

completed whilst the by-election is on can  be  used

on Polling Day? That matter has to be settled beyond

any doubt, namely, that on Polling Day it is the new

register with List B included that is to be used  as

the register for electors.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is from the Permanent Secretary to the S.A.G.:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Please confirm that voters on new registers

certified and published before polling day  will  be

eligible to vote on Polling Day.'



<br><br>It  is  as simple as that. Let me say this. Whatever

the  faults  of this Government, we are prepared  to

govern  in  the national interest, but this  is  not

governing in the national interest. This is a  piece

of  legislation meant for a political  contest  will

take place in Anson either on 10th June - if this Bill

goes  through - or if it does not go through, it  can

take  place  in July. It makes no difference  to  us

whatsoever.   We  get  no  benefit,   political   or

otherwise,  by enforcing this Bill.  I  say  if  the

Opposition feel in the least unhappy that an  unfair

advantage  is being taken, then let them say  no  to

the  Bill.  We propose to abstain and the Bill  will

die.  In  a  case where they have an  interest,  the

Opposition must either be satisfied, or if they  are

not satisfied (whether they are right or wrong),  we

are quite happy to let them have their way.

has  transpired  between the State  Advocate-General

and  the  Ministers of the State, but all I know  is

what  I  see in the Bill, and underneath  it  is  an

Explanatory Statement which reads as follows:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Now, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg  to  move,  "That the Bill be now read  a  Third

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye): Mr

Speaker, for purposes of the record, I would like to

clarify the stand that the Government has adopted in

abstaining from voting on this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it had been a Bill in the national interests

and  if  it was the responsibility of the Government

to  see that this Bill should be put through in  the

national  interests, then we would have seen  to  it

that  the Bill was passed. However, it has been said

by  the Member for Tanglin that the purpose of  this

Bill  is  to change the rules just before  the  game

commences.   It   is   to  dispel   completely   any

insinuation that we, on our side, wish to remain  in

power  by fixing the rules of the game that we  have

adopted the stand of abstaining from voting  on  the

Bill.   The  onus  therefore  now  lies   upon   the

Opposition whether they want an early election after

Nomination   Day,  10th  June,  or  Nomination   Day

sometime  after July when the new electoral register

has  been  certificated. Let it not be said  outside

that  the  Government is now afraid of an early

by-election  in Anson. Let it not be said that  we  are

worried about holding an early by-election in Anson.

If  there is any delay in the Anson by-election, the

Opposition must bear the responsibility for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this must be carefully clarified so that

members  of  the public will be able  to  understand

that  if Nomination Day does not take place on  June

10th, it will be because the Opposition Parties have

insisted that this Bill should lapse.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let us get

this  thing in the right perspective. Nobody  forced

the  Government  to state yesterday that  Nomination

Day  is  to  be the 10th of June. The Government  is

fully aware of its own intentions to carry this Bill

(which  is now receiving its Third Reading)  through

all  stages today. The Minister, in moving the Bill,

said  that Nomination Day would be the 10th of June,

but that Polling Day would take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>



place  after the revised register had been completed

or  printed; and that would be sometime in July.  He

was  not able to give a specific date. I pointed out

to  him,  Sir, that under the law there is a certain

time  limit between Nomination Day and Polling  Day.

If,  just  by a twist of circumstance - an unfortunate

circumstance at that - the Government Printing  Office

were  to suffer a breakdown and the electoral  rolls

could  not  be ready, how are we going to  carry  on

with  the  by-election? Knowing that  it  was  their

intention  to  table this Bill today  and  carry  it

through  all stages, surely the Government, if  they

had  thought of not wanting to put the Anson  voters

in  an  embarrassing position, could  have  declared

that  Polling Day could be some day later than  10th

June.  There was no need for them to show that  they

were  anxious for an early Nomination Day and  leave

Polling Day to fate, as to when and how fast the new

electoral registers could be completed. Now, the-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have allowed the Leader of

the  House and the Leader of the Opposition to speak

up  to  now,  but  of course they  have  been  quite

irrelevant under our Standing Orders, which say that

on  the Third Reading of a Bill, the debate shall be

confined to the contents of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways open to the Opposition if they

do  not wish this Bill to become law, and those ways

are indicated in the Standing Orders. Standing Order

No. 78, paragraph (1) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`On the third reading of a Bill amendments may be

proposed to the question "That the Bill be now  read

a third time" similar to those which may be proposed

on second reading;'.



<br><br>That  takes  us to Standing Order No. 67,  paragraph

(3), which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`On the second reading of a Bill, an amendment may

be  proposed to the question, "That the Bill be  now

read a second time", to leave out the word "now" and

add,  at  the end of the question, "on this day  six

months",  or an amendment may be moved to leave  out

all  the words after the word "That" in order to add

words  stating the object and motive  on  which  the

opposition to the Bill is based, but such words must

be  strictly relevant to the principle of  the  Bill

and not deal with its details.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>



Those  are  the alternatives, if the Opposition  are

contemplating defeating the Bill, those are the ways

to do it.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank you

for your indulgence. This is, of course, due to the

fact that the debate on this Bill has taken an

unprecedented turn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill itself is only concerned with allowing

those whose names appear in List B or those who have

made  claims  under section 11 of the  Ordinance  to

stand as candidates for the by-election in Anson. It

has  nothing to do with the right to vote  of  those

whose names appear in List B. We are not saying that

the  Government should hold this by-election on  the

old register. If they want it on the new register or

on any register, the Opposition are prepared to meet

them.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Just to clarify the position,

Sir.  This is an unusual bit of legislation in  that

the general public are not interested in it. This is

legislation   meant   for  political   parties.   It

inaugurates a political contest, and only  political

parties and politicians are interested in the  Bill.

It  is absolutely important and fundamental that  no

doubts  be cast on the proposition that the  contest

should  be fair and equal. We have put forward  this

Bill because we believe that this is a fair and just

way  of  doing it. If the Opposition feel,  as  they

have  indicated on the Second Reading, that this  is

unfair and unequal, all they have to do is to say no

to the Bill, and it lapses. It is as simple as that.

But  they cannot have it both ways. On the one hand,

they cannot expect the Government to carry this Bill

through in the teeth of their opposition, and  then,

on  the other hand, for them to go out and say, "Ah,

what  a  wicked Government; fixing the rules of  the

game  against the Opposition!" We are doing no  such

thing.  All we are doing is to ensure that a regular

and   proper   election  be   held   in   the   best

circumstances possible. If the Opposition think that

that is not their wish - this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>



is  as  much  for  them as it is for  us;  they  are

interested parties and so are we; so are  the  other

political  parties  and  individuals  who  want   to

contest this by-election - if they say no, so be it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I had better clarify the position

now.  Procedurally, as has been indicated by me,  if

there  is  no amendment to be moved to the Question,

"That  the  Bill be now read a Third Time",  then  I

will have to put that Question. That, perhaps, is an

appropriate time also for the Government to indicate

their intentions in so far as this Bill is concerned

by abstaining.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So that, procedurally, that is the

position.  The  Opposition now must  make  up  their

minds  whether  or  not they wish  the  Bill  to  be

defeated. If they wish it to be defeated,  then  the

proper   way  is  to  move  the  amendment  I   have

suggested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the Bill be now read a

Third time." As many as are of that opinion say Aye.

<br><br>5.31 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye): Mr

Speaker,  I beg to move the motion* standing  in  my name.



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the amendments, as recommended in

paragraph 5 of the Report of the Standing Orders Committee and contained

in Paper L.A 12 of 1961, be and are hereby made to the Standing Orders of

this Assembly.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this motion is to amend the

Standing  Orders  of the Assembly in  order  that  a

Committee  of Privileges can be formed. The  concept

for  a  Committee of Privileges is not really a  new

one.  It  has  been  the  practice  in  Legislatures

elsewhere   to   have   a  Standing   Committee   of

Privileges.  The purpose of such a Committee  is  to

assist  the Speaker in upholding the dignity,

self-respect  and honour of the legislating body  and  to

prevent  the  Legislature from degenerating  into  a

bawdy House during debates. We in this House have  a

duly in maintaining the confidence and faith of  the

people   in  the  Assembly  as  an  honourable   and

respectable legislating body; otherwise we will also

go  the  same way as other bodies in those countries

where there is despair in the possibility of working

a democratic parliamentary system. If ever we should

reach that stage, the least that can happen to us in

this  House  is  that  we will  disappear.  But  the

greater consideration is the uncertain future of the

country, the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>



and  the  people's children. For this consideration,

and   this   consideration  alone,   we,   who   are

responsible  to the people, have the obligation  and

the  responsibility to nip in the bud any deliberate

or  intentional  action that can only  have  as  its

consequence  the  undermining  of  the  dignity  and

respectability of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On looking back, I must say I am a little

astonished that the Assembly has had to wait for six

years  to  provide for a Committee of Privileges  in

its  Standing Orders, when it has been the  practice

of  legislating  parliaments in other  countries  to

have  a Standing Committee of Privileges. It  is  my

hope,  as Leader of the House, that it will  not  be

frequent  that  matters  in this  Assembly  will  be

referred  to the Committee of Privileges. We  accept

that  Members  of  the  House have  the  liberty  of

speech,  but  at  the same time  we  as  responsible

Members  must distinguish between liberty of  speech

and licence of speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be the function of this Committee of

Privileges  to keep a watching brief  over  what  is

uttered  in this House. The parliamentary system  is

young  in  Singapore and, because of its  youth,  we

have  yet to develop our own system of a traditional

institution.  It  is  one thing  making  clever  and

artful speeches, but another thing being wise. It is

one thing being rash and foolhardy and another thing

being  brave.  But then the virtues  of  wisdom  and

maturity  can only be acquired through  the  painful

experience of trial and error. The Assembly has  had

its  trials and it has noted its errors. I hope  the

House is a little wiser for that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.36 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support  in  principle  the  formation  of  such   a

Committee  of  Privileges, but it is important  that

accusations  of breaches of privileges must  not  be

provided  as  a  cloak to crush Opposition  Members.

With  the fear of such an event happening, my  views

are that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1502</b></font><br><br>



Committee of Privileges should compose of  you,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  as Chairman, and  a  Member  of  the

Government and a Member of the Opposition to be  the

only  two Members in the Committee, instead  of  the

present  proposal which gives the majority Party  in

power  an  overwhelming vote  in  the  Committee  of

Privileges. It is also my view that such a Committee

should  have delegated powers instead of  having  to

refer  back their findings to this Assembly, because

otherwise  what would happen is that any person  who

is  faced  with a complaint of a breach of privilege

may find himself faced with persons who are the jury

and,  at  the  same time, the judges, witnesses  and

perhaps, at the same time, the accusers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that with the result of the Hong Lim

by-election, what happened in this Assembly five months

ago   has  not  been  approved  by  the  people   in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Let us not go off the rails.

We  are now dealing with a specific amendment to the

Standing Orders, and I do not think what happened in

the  Hong Lim by-election has any relevance here  at

all. Mr Ong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Eng Guan: Mr Speaker, Sir, I support in

principle  the recommendations made by the  Standing

Orders  Committee,  and I have  given  my  views  on

paragraph (7) (a) (i) about the composition  of  the

Committee. I feel strongly against this,  because  I

have  had  the  experience of what  is  meant  by  a

complaint of a breach of privilege.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Toh, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, perhaps Members

are  aware that Standing Committees of the  Assembly

are so constituted as to represent both sides of the

House in proportion. Whatever conclusion a Committee

arrives  at,  whatever  Report  it  draws  up   must

eventually  be tabled in the House. No Committee  of

the   Assembly  has  an  absolute  judicial   power.

Ultimately,  it is responsible to the Assembly  and,

therefore,   any  findings  of  the   Committee   of

Privileges must be tabled, as, in fact, this  Report

of the Standing Orders Committee has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1503</b></font><br><br>



tabled,  for  debate. The ideal  thing,  of  course,

would  be to have all complaints concerning breaches

of  privilege referred to a Judge. In fact,  at  the

beginning of the year, we found that because of  the

absence  of  a Committee of Privileges,  Members  of

this  House  had to refer allegations  made  by  the

Member for Hong Lim to a Judge of the High Court  to

be adjudicated upon. The Judge in this Commission of

Inquiry proved the allegations-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think that could be

relevant  to  this motion. Details  of  that  nature

cannot be relevant.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I was only attempting, Mr

Speaker, to dispel any idea or any insinuation  that

a  Committee  of  Privileges as being  moved  to  be

established  under this motion will be Judge,  jury,

prosecutor, all lumped into one. I have said earlier

that  as privileged Members of the House it  is  the

bounden  duty of each and everyone of us to maintain

a  certain  degree of dignity, truth,  decorum,  and

self-respect in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are bound by the Legislative Assembly (Powers

and  Privileges) Ordinance and therefore,  we,  more

than  any  other  people, have a greater  degree  of

liberty  of  speech.  But, having  been  given  this

privilege,  it  is up to us to see  that  no  Member

abuses  it.  If  such an abuse has  been  committed,

surely it should be referred to the House; and if it

is  referred to the House, the correct procedure, as

is  done in Parliaments elsewhere, is to refer it to

the   Committees   of  Privileges   which   are   so

constituted  as  to  represent proportionately  both

sides  of  the House. In fact, Mr Speaker,  as  you

yourself are aware, in the Standing Orders Committee

I made a certain suggestion that provision should be

so  made  that there must always be Members  of  the

Opposition in the Committee of Privileges because an

occasion  may arise when, let us say, you have  only

two  Members of the Opposition on this Committee and

these   two  Members  themselves  are  the  involved

parties,  and  then the Government Members  who  are

left in this Committee of Privileges would be placed

in  an invidious position of having to deliberate in

the absence of any Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>



from the opposite side. We have, therefore, provided

under  this motion that it Members in the  Committee

of  Privileges  are  the  parties  involved  in  any

accusation  of  a  breach of privilege,  then  their

places   would   be   filled  by   the   appropriate

substitutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the amendments,

as  recommended in paragraph S of the Report of  the

Standing  Orders  Committee and contained  in  Paper

L.A.  12  of  1961, be and are hereby  made  to  the

Standing Orders of this Assembly.

<div align="center"><b>PUNISHMENT OF KIDNAPPING BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is the strongest manifestation yet of

the  Government's  determination to  wipe  out  evil

perpetrators of the offence of kidnapping for ransom

and  to  create a situation whereby the  payment  of

ransom  money is made so difficult that, on the  one

hand,  it  will  deter  potential  kidnappers   from

risking  their necks without the certainty  of  gain

and  that,  on  the  other hand, it  will  encourage

victims  and their families and agents  to  be  more

resolute  in their co-operation with the  Police  in

tracking   down  and  arresting  these   evil-doers.

Nothing  makes  the kidnapper feel more  secure  and

become  bolder than the knowledge that most  victims

and   their   relatives   are   tongue-tied   during

negotiations  whilst the victim is in captivity  and

even  after  payment  of  ransom  through  fear   of

possible  reprisals  instilled into  them  by  these

kidnappers,  who  cleverly  use  this  psychological

weapon to good advantage. At heart, the kidnapper is

a  cowardly  adventurer, who banks on  the  wall  of

silence built by his victims to protect him from the

forces of law and order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of this Bill - a similar Bill has

also  been  introduced by the Federation  Government

- does not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>



mean  that the Government has not been taking strong

and  effective  action  to  combat  this  kidnapping

menace,  which has reared its ugly and evil head  in

recent   years  and  caused  alarm  and  nervousness

especially   among   the   wealthy   merchants   and

businessmen.  Indeed since this Government  came  to

power,  substantial results have been achieved.  Not

only were protective and preventive measures carried

out,  but  as  a result of intensive and painstaking

investigations by the Police, a number of kidnapping

gangs  were  broken up, several thugs and  gangsters

involved  in kidnapping detained under the  Criminal

Law    (Temporary   Provisions)   Ordinance,    some

kidnappers  convicted  in Court  and  the  notorious

gangster  and  kidnapper, Oh Kim  Kee,  whose  short

reign of terror was largely due to the conspiracy of

silence  between him and his victims, was shot  dead

and  his  accomplices captured.  Much  of  this  was

achieved  by  the efforts of the Police  themselves,

despite  the reluctance on the part of many  victims

and their relatives and agents to talk or co-operate

with the Police. Nothing is more frustrating to  the

Police  than to find their efforts to help the  very

people who need help badly, bogged down by the

tight-lipped  silence and blank stares of those  who  have

only  to  open  their mouths to  bring  about  quick

retribution to these evil-doers. But much more could

have  been achieved and ought to have been  achieved

and  better results obtained, if there had been  the

will  to  resist and sincere co-operation  with  the

Police  manifested. The Government is determined  to

wipe  out the kidnapping menace and it is hoped that

the  wide  powers  in this new legislation  will  be

fully appreciated by the public who should show more

public-spiritedness  and  wholehearted  co-operation

with the Police in the onslaught against crime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at present, under the existing provisions of

the  Penal Code, there is no suitable punishment  of

treating kidnapping for ransom as an aggravated form

of  ordinary  kidnapping or  abduction.  Under  this

Punishment  of  Kidnapping  Bill,  each  element  of

kidnapping is made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>



punishable.  As you are aware, Sir, the elements  of

kidnapping are abduction plus wrongful restraint  or

wrongful confinement, and, under this Bill, each  of

these  elements is punishable, if it is  perpetrated

for ransom. Clause 3 of the Bill makes it an offence

for  a  person  to  abduct, wrongfully  restrain  or

wrongfully confine any other person with  intent  to

hold such person for ransom, and, on conviction,  he

shall  be  punished with death or  imprisonment  for

life  and, if the sentence is imprisonment, he shall

be  liable  to  caning. Clauses 4  and  5  make  the

receiver  of ransom money or property, knowing  that

such money or property has been given as ransom, and

the  person who negotiates to obtain ransom for  the

release   of   any  person  abducted  or  wrongfully

restrained or confined, to be guilty of offences and

liable,  on  conviction, to a  term  in  prison  not

exceeding ten years and also to caning. Provision is

also  made  in clause 5 for any person who knowingly

negotiates to pay or pays or provides funds for  the

payment of any ransom to procure the release of  any

person,  who  has  been  wrongfully  restrained   or

wrongfully  confined,  to be guilty  of  an  offence

punishable   with  imprisonment  for  a   term   not

exceeding seven years and also liable to a fine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 6 of the Bill, power is given to the

Public  Prosecutor to order any bank to  freeze  any

banking  account,  where he is  satisfied  that  the

money may be withdrawn for the payment of any ransom

for  the  release  of any person,  and  it  makes  a

manager  or  a banker, who fails to comply  with  an

order  of  the  Public  Prosecutor,  guilty  of   an

offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 (Public Prosecutor's power to order

inspection of books, accounts, receipts, vouchers or

other  documents  by the Police), clause  8  (Public

Prosecutor's  powers to obtain information),  clause

12 (evidence of accomplice not to be deemed unworthy

of  credit because he has paid or negotiated to  pay

ransom),  clause 13 (evidence of pecuniary resources

or  property, disproportionate to his known  income)

and   clause   14  (protection  of  informers)   are

provisions  taken from the Prevention of  Corruption

Ordinance, No.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>



39  of 1960, and are included in the Bill, as it  is

considered  that they will facilitate investigations

into the offences under this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 of the Bill makes it the duty of any

person,  who is aware of the commission  or  of  the

intention  of any person to commit an offence  under

this Bill, immediately to give that information to a

police  officer; and this clause also  provides  for

the  punishment of any person who fails to give such

information to a police officer. Provision  is  made

in  clause  10 of the Bill for the Public Prosecutor

to  authorise  any police officer to  intercept  any

article  sent  by  post  or  any  messages  sent  by

telegraph or to listen to any telephone conversation

if  he  is  satisfied  that  such  communication  is

related to the payment of ransom for the release  of

a  person  who  has  been wrongfully  restrained  or

wrongfully confined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 of the Bill provides that all offences

under  this  Bill  shall be deemed  to  be  seizable

offences  for the purposes of the Criminal Procedure

Code.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the introduction of this Bill will, it is

hoped,   achieve  its  desired  purpose  and   deter

criminally-minded kidnappers from kidnapping persons

for ransom. It will be noted that the death sentence

is   not  mandatory  but  is  only  provided  as  an

alternative  to  life  imprisonment,  and  this   is

similar  to  the punishment provided  for  using  or

attempting to use, arms under section 4 of the  Arms

Offences Ordinance. This Bill should be regarded  as

a stern warning that kidnapping does not pay. Should

there be any future kidnapping case, it could become

an  appointment with death or an invitation to  life

incarceration for the kidnapper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Ong Pang Boon].

wishes to speak on any particular clause.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I wish to speak on clause 6.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I will take clauses 4 and 5 then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 and 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 -

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this

particular  clause,  if  fully  carried  out,  might

result in great hardship to the workers. Sir, if  it

happens that the particular person kidnapped is  the

head  of  many organisations and the owner  of  many

factories,  according  to  this  clause,  Sir,   his

accounts  in  the various banks will be  frozen  and

there  will  not  be  the  wherewithal  to  pay  the

workers. Supposing the workers are on weekly  wages,

Sir, then they may, have to wait for a week, or  two

weeks, or three weeks to get their pay. Surely it is

not  the intention of the Government that the  wages

of  workers  should remain unpaid. But according  to

this  clause, while the account is frozen, there  is

no way of paying the workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Surely, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Tanglin  is  not  all that innocent  about  the

business  practices amongst the big  businessmen  in

Singapore.  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  if  their  money  is

frozen, all they have to do quite easily is to raise

a  loan  from other businessmen. Once they get  that

loan, they can pay the workers. And when their money

is  unfrozen, they can pay off the other businessmen

by and by.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had hoped that the

Minister  would say that in such a case he would  go

to  the assistance of these unfortunate persons, and

allow the bank to have the wages



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>



paid rather than force those unfortunate individuals

to raise a loan in the market at eight per cent.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> There is a further point, Sir.

If anyone helps anybody who is already kidnapped, he

himself,  Sir,  may be facing a seven-year  term  of

imprisonment!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure it

is  not the intention of the Government to cause any

suffering  to any worker as a result of  this  Bill.

This  Bill  is directed at those who refuse  to

co-operate with the Police but with the kidnappers.  If

a case could be made out to the Public Prosecutor by

the  manager  of any of those concerns belonging  to

the  kidnapped  victim, then I am  sure  the  Public

Prosecutor is not so unreasonable as to refuse money

to  be drawn for the purpose of paying wages to  the

workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to introduce into Singapore the

doctrine  of  what is commonly known as  "diminished

responsibility".  This  was  originally  a  Scottish

doctrine  but  was  imported  into  England  by  the

Homicide  Act,  1957. The present  law  relating  to

insanity  is  contained in section 84 of  the  Penal

Code which reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nothing is an offence which is done by a person

who,  at  the  time  of  doing  it,  by  reason   of

unsoundness  of  mind, is incapable of  knowing  the

nature  of  the  act, or that he is  doing  what  is

either wrong or contrary to law.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This provision, Sir, is based on the so-called

M'Naghten  Rules, which summarised the advice  given

by  the  Judges to the House of Lords in M'Naghten's

Case  in  1843.  According to  this  provision,  the

relevant test of insanity is a legal test and not  a

medical  or  psychiatric test. For  the  defence  of

insanity  to  succeed, it is necessary to  establish

that  the accused was suffering at the time  of  the

offence  from a defect of reason due to  disease  of

the  mind so that he either did not know what he was

doing  or  did  not know that it was wrong.  If  the

accused is not suffering from a disease of the  mind

or  is  not suffering from a form of insanity  which

affects  the  intellectual powers  as  distinguished

from  the  will  or emotions, he is not  within  the

M'Naghten Rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill, which is based on section 2

of the Homicide Act, 1957, of England, provides that

culpable  homicide  shall  not  be  murder  if   the

offender was suffering from such abnormality of mind

(whether  arising from a condition  of  arrested  or retarded development of mind or any inherent  causes or  induced  by  disease or injury) as substantially

impaired his mental responsibility for his acts  and

omissions in causing the death or being a  party  to

causing   the  death.  The  effect,  Sir,  is   that

diminished   responsibility  will  be  a  mitigating

factor  and, to quote from the report of  the  Royal

Commission on Capital Punishment in England, it is a

"device  to enable the courts to take account  of  a

special  category  of  mitigating  circumstances  in

cases  of  murder and to avoid passing  sentence  of

death in cases where such circumstances exist."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exception of diminished responsibility is

quite  different  from  that of  insanity.  Insanity

covered by the M'Naghten Rules and section 84 of the

Penal  Code  is  a complete defence leading  to  the

verdict of acquittal while diminished responsibility

merely reduces the offence to culpable homicide  not

amounting to murder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of the new Exception 7 to section

300  of  the  Penal Code, which are proposed  to  be

inserted  by  clause  2 of the  Bill,  cover  mental

abnormality  whether induced by mental  or  physical

disease or injury or arising from mental



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>



deficiency  or  other inherent causes.  These  words

would appear to cover mental abnormality due to  any

form of insanity, to mental defectiveness, epilepsy,

psycho  neurosis  arising from inherent  causes  and

forms  of  psychopathic  personality  arising   from

arrested  or retarded development of the  mind.  The

onus  of  proving that he comes within the exception

is   by  virtue  of  section  106  of  the  Evidence

Ordinance  on  the accused, and it  is  for  him  to

satisfy  the  jury not only that abnormality  within

the definition contained in the Exception existed at

the  time of the offence, but that it was of such  a

degree  that  it substantially impaired  his  mental

responsibility  for  the  acts  with  which  he   is

charged. The use of the term "mental responsibility"

makes  it  clear that it is not legal responsibility

which   is   in   question  at  this  point.   Legal

responsibility   is  diminished  if   the   criteria

contained  in  the  Exception  are  satisfied,   but

diminution of legal responsibility is not itself one

of those criteria.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctrine of diminished responsibility has been

applied  in England for over five years and  has  on

the  whole  been applied successfully. The  doctrine

has  also  been adopted by a number of  Commonwealth

countries and recently the Judicial Committee of the

Privy Council has given authoritative advice on  the

application of the doctrine in the case of  Rose  vs

the  Queen, in an appeal from the Supreme  Court  of

the Bahama Islands. In the English case of Regina vs

Byrne  (1960) 2 QB 396 Lord Chief Justice Parker  in

delivering  the  judgment of the Court  of  Criminal

Appeal said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"Abnormality of mind" which has to be contrasted

with  the  time-honoured expression in the M'Naghten

Rules  "defect of reason" means a state of  mind  so

different  from that of ordinary human  beings  that

the  reasonable  man  would term  it  abnormal.  The

expression  "mental  responsibility  for  his  acts"

points to a consideration of the extent to which the

accused's  mind is answerable for his physical  acts

which must include a consideration of the extent  of

his  ability  to exercise will power to control  his

physical acts'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord Chief Justice then went on to cite from

Scots  cases  indicating that "such  abnormality  as

substantially  impairs  his  mental  responsibility"

involved  a  mental state which in popular  language

(not that of the M'Naghten Rules)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>



a jury would regard as amounting to partial insanity

or being on the borderline of insanity. Lord Tucker,

in  giving the opinion of the Judicial Committee  of

the Privy Council in Rose vs the Queen, referred  to

the case of Regina vs Byrne and said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Their Lordships respectfully accept this

interpretation  of the words "abnormality  of  mind"

and  "mental  responsibility" as  authoritative  and

correct. They would not, however, consider that  the

Court  of Criminal Appeal was intending to lay  down

that  in  every  case the jury must  necessarily  be

directed  that  the  test  was  always  to  be   the

borderline  of  insanity. There might  be  cases  in

which the abnormality of mind relied upon could  not

readily   be   related  to  any  of  the   generally

recognized   types  of  "insanity".   If,   however,

insanity  was  to  be taken into  consideration,  as

undoubtedly would usually be the case, the word must

be used in its broad popular sense. It could not too

often  be emphasized that there was no formula  that

could safety be used in every case - the direction  to

the  jury  must always be related to the  particular

evidence  that  had been given and  there  might  be

cases  where  the words "borderline" and  "insanity"

might not be helpful.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctrine of "diminished responsibility" was

considered at the United Nations Seminar on the role

of the Substantive Criminal Law in the protection of

Human Rights held at Tokyo last year and the Seminar

in  its  report  recommended  the  adoption  of  the

doctrine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other important amendment made by the Bill is

contained  in  clause 6, which seeks  to  widen  the

definition of "stolen property" to include  property

into or for which stolen property has been converted

or exchanged. This follows the provisions of section

46  (1) of the United Kingdom Larceny Act, 1916, and

will  enable  a  prosecution  to  be  instituted  in

respect  of  property into which or  for  which  the

property  actually  stolen  has  been  converted  or

exchanged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill seek to provide that

the  punishment  of caning may be  imposed  for  the

offence of voluntarily causing hurt or grevious hurt

to extort property or to constrain the commission of

an  illegal  act.  As caning is already  a  possible

punishment  for  the  offence of  extortion,  it  is

considered  that  it  should  be  available   as   a

punishment where hurt or grevious hurt is caused  to

commit extortion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill is complementary to and

consequential on the Punishment of Kidnapping  Bill.

It  seeks  to  make  the offence  of  kidnapping  or

abducting  in order to murder punishable with  death

or  imprisonment  for life (instead of  imprisonment

for  life  or imprisonment which may extend  to  ten

years as at present).

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr   Speaker.   Sir,   I  have   His   Excellency's

recommendation to proceed with the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this Bill is to provide for

the  establishment of a Police Cadet  Corps  in  the

State  of  Singapore.  As the  House  is  aware,  we

already have in existence three Cadet Corps, namely,

the  School Cadet Corps, the Sea Cadet Corps and the

Malayan  Air Training Corps. The time is appropriate

that  we  should  have a fourth corps,  namely,  the

Police  Cadet  Corps. The aims of this Police  Cadet

Corps  are to produce further civic mindedness among

schoolboys  and  other youths, to  bring  them  into

closer  association  with our re-dedicated  and

re-orientated  Singapore Police Force, to get  them  to

know more about the work and responsibilities of the

Police   Force,  to  regard  them  as  friends   and

encourage  them  to support the forces  of  law  and

order against criminals and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>



gangsters,  and  also to provide  an  incentive  for

educated youth to join the Police Force as a career.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the other existing cadet corps, enrolment in

the Police Cadet Corps will be on a voluntary basis.

The  Bill provides that only Singapore citizens will

be  eligible for enrolment in the Corps, which  will

he  affiliated  to the Singapore Police  Force,  but

members  of  the Corps shall not be police  officers

within  the  meaning of the Police Force  Ordinance.

The  Bill  also provides for the Commandant  of  the

Police  Cadet Corps to be appointed by the  Minister

in consultation with the Commissioner of Police, and

also  for  the  Corps to consist of such  units  and

divisions  and such numbers of officers and  cadets

as  may  from  time  to  time  be  approved  by  the

Minister.  Provision is also made for the secondment

of  members of the Police Force for service  in  the

Corps on full or part-time basis. Provision is  also

made  for  the  appointment of officers,  and,  like

other  cadet corps, for the payment by the Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara of compensation for death or  injury

sustained  by  members of the Corps  when  on  duty.

Power  is  also  given  to  the  Minister  to   make

regulations    for    the   constitution,    general

government, discipline and training of the Corps and

also  for the quantum of compensation in respect  of

death and personal injuries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House may wish to know something of the set-up

and  organisation of the Police Cadet  Corps  to  be

made  under  Police  Cadet  Corps  Regulations.  The

intention  is  that the Corps should  consist  of  a

Commandant  and  Headquarters based  at  the  Police

Training  School,  School  Units,  attached  to  the

various language schools, comprising schoolboys from

the  particular schools, and officers provided  from

amongst the teaching staff, and Open Units, attached

to   the   Police  Training  School  or   Divisions,

commanded  by  Special  Constabulary  Officers   and

comprising  cadets  drawn  from  different  approved

categories   of   persons.  Cadets   will   wear   a

distinctive  uniform  based on the  Police  uniform.

Cadets  will be drawn from the age groups 15 to  19,

and the Corps will be organised in units, each of 50

men and two officers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1515</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is a new Cadet Corps and is a new

charge of expenditure on the revenues of the State,

its  establishment will not, however,  require  any

extra  financial expenditure as it will be financed

by  part  of  the funds of the School  Cadet  Corps

provided  for in the Estimates. For a start,  there

will be a gradual build-up of Police Cadet Corps by

direct  recruitment  from  schools.  This  will  be

phased  with  the gradual run-down  of  the  School

Cadet  Corps  by  wastage and non-recruitment.  For

some  time  to  come the Police Cadets  and  School

Cadets will operate side by side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the training of the Corps, maximum

emphasis  is placed on understanding the  functions

and  civic  duties of the Police and  developing  a

sense of responsible participation in the corporate

life  of  the community. Physical discipline,  that

is,  drill, self-defence and revolver shooting will

also  be  taught to increase the range of interest.

At  advanced  levels, cadets will be introduced  to

the  more  specialised fields of police work,  e.g.

radio,  investigations, court procedure and  marine

duties.  The Syllabus is based on training  schemes

for   regular  and  special  police  officers   and

association with the Police force will  be  further

fostered  by  bringing  the senior  body  into  the

training and activities of the cadets. It is  hope,

in  this  way, to increase the flow of  recruitment

from  secondary  schools  to  provide  for  a  more

educated and efficient Police Force.

recommendation that the Bill be proceeded with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in part I of the People's Action Party

long-term  statement of policy - The Tasks Ahead - we  set

out  on  page  25  in the Chapter on  our  Economic

Policy,  the  proposal  to  establish  an  Economic

Development Board which will plan, co-ordinate  and

direct  the  industrialisation  of  the  State.  On

coming  into office, the Government set  about  the

task  of  establishing  the  Board.  The  model  of

organisation and pattern of legislation of economic

or  industrial  development  boards  of  our  Asian

neighbours  and of smaller countries further  away,

were  studies in detail. The important function  of

the  Board  in  the determination of  our  economic

future  did  not permit us merely  to  copy  or  to

graft. We were searching for an organisation  which

would  fit  itself into the economic situation  and

structure  of  Singapore.  Economically,  Singapore

today  is in a crucial stage of transition. On  the

one  hand,  we have to do our best to maintain  and

expand our trade, which has sustained Singapore  so

long  and  so  well. At the same  time,  using  the

profits  and the organisation of trade as a  spring

board,   we  have  to  industrialise  quickly   and

efficiently so that, in the near future,  we  shall

be  able to sell to our neighbours the products  of

our  labour instead of merely the services  of  our

entrepot   skill.   Countries   around    us    are

increasingly pursuing, and justifiably so, a policy

of  direct  trade.  In  this  expansion  of  direct

trading  relations, Singapore can hope to play  its

role by being the supplier of manufactured products

labelled  "Made in Singapore". Being  strategically

located, the savings in freight would be one factor

which will enable us to sell quickly and cheaply.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring about this economic transformation, on

which  our  survival depends, the Government  cannot

adopt  a purely laissez faire attitude. Nor  can  it

play   a   simple  administrative   role   of   just

maintaining civil stability and providing the  basic

essential   services.  To  initiate  the   road   to

industrialisation,  the Government  has  to  play  a

positive  and direct role. The Economic  Development

Board which we seek to set up under the authority of

the Bill now before the House will be the agency  of

Government   to   direct  this   transformation   of

Singapore's economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has taken the Government nearly two years to

prepare   for  the  establishment  of  the  Economic

Development Board. To some this may appear to be  an

unduly long period. But I myself do not accept  this

view.  This is going to be one of the most important

steps to be taken by the Government. It is obviously

necessary that measures of such importance should be

made only after careful thought and preparation. May

I  outline  some of the preliminary steps  which  we

have taken before creating this Board?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first major move that the Government made was

to   ask  for  teams  of  international  experts  to

investigate  the  potentialities  of  expansion   in

certain  specific  industries. Members  are  already

aware of the work that is now being carried out  and

will  soon  be  completed  by  the  U.N.  Industrial

Mission headed by Dr A. Winsemius. Why is this step

necessary?  Could  we not have  gone  ahead  without

seeking  the opinion of experts. The answer is  that

in   attempting  any  major  transformation  of  the

economy, it is well to have available the opinion of

the  best  brains that we can get hold of.  For  the

economic  position of Singapore is  unique  and  the

experience  of  other and larger countries  in  Asia

which    are   now   attempting   to   industrialise

themselves,  offers us no guidance  whatsoever.  The

reasons  are simple and have been repeated  ever  so

often.  We  do  not  have,  as  they  have,  natural

resources which can provide the raw



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1518</b></font><br><br>



materials for industrialisation. In itself  this  is

not   so  important  as  these  raw  materials   are

accessible  from  neighbouring countries.  But  more

important  than  this is the size  of  the  domestic

market  which  imposes  a limit  to  the  extent  of

industrialisation based on it. In this  respect,  we

differ fundamentally from the larger countries  such

as  India  and  Pakistan, or even  the  medium-sized

countries  in Asia such as Thailand or Burma.  These

countries have the advantage that the home  consumer

demand  is  large and therefore the question  of  an

adequate  market for the products of  industry  does

not present a problem in such an acute form that  it

does to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the further added complication of the

free   port  status  of  our  island  State.   While

adjustments can be made here and there to this  free

port  status, no precipitate action in the  interest

of rapid industrialisation can be contemplated which

would  cause such a major dislocation of the economy

that  the  gain through industrialisation  would  be

outweighed  by  the  loss  of  our  standing  as  an

entrepot market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These considerations do not apply to other Asian

countries  which  are attempting  to  industrialise.

Their  problems  and difficulties  stem  from  other

causes, on which I need not embark here. But,  faced

as  we  are in this unique position, it is necessary

to  seek advice from experts abroad. We lost  little

time in doing so, and in Singapore today we have, in

addition  to  the  U.N. Industrial Mission,  another

Mission  to  study  the  establishment  of  a  steel

industry in Singapore. Both these Missions contained

men of ability and experience and they have given us

new  insights into the nature of the problem  facing

us and the solutions that we can apply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have now reached the stage when we can take

this   major   move   to  establish   the   Economic

Development   Board.  The  acute   difficulties   in

recruiting  staff  to  the Board,  which  will  need

industrial  economists, engineers, and other  expert

personnel,  which  we  have experienced,  have  been

partially solved. As I announced in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1519</b></font><br><br>



the  Assembly on a previous occasion, we  have  been

able  to  get experts from countries abroad such  as

India  and Israel, and with these as the nucleus  we

propose to press ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with some of the major functions

of  the Board. First, the Board will investigate and

evaluate   industrial  opportunities.   The   market

potential, availability of raw materials, production

costs,  capital  requirements  and  other  technical

factors,  will be worked out and assessed.  When  an

industry is considered feasible, industrialists will

be  invited to consider the establishment of such an

industry,  with  financial and technical  assistance

from  abroad  if  necessary.  It  may  be  that  the

industrialist may possess the know-how but lack  the

capital.  The Board will then assist him financially

by  direct  loans  and advances, or  underwrite  and

guarantee  the  issue  or  equity  capital  by   the

enterprise concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, where necessary, the Board will itself

participate   in   establishing  industries,   where

private   participation  is   not   forthcoming   or

insufficient.  This  may  happen  when  an  industry

requires  substantial investment outlay  and  expert

technical know-how.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to provide prepared sites for industries,

the  Board will have the power to lay out industrial

estates,  where the basic requirements of  industry,

such as power, water, roads, railways and such other

facilities will be laid on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Board will assist industrial

enterprises by giving technical advice. A  technical

consultant  service  will be  organised  which  will

advise an industrial enterprise with regard to  both

economic and purely engineering problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An industrial research unit which will be sited in

the  Polytechnic  is in the course of  establishment

with  the  assistance of the New Zealand Government.

This  unit will be able to give valuable assistance,

especially to medium-scale industries, in the way of

solving  their production and engineering  problems.

At a future date we intend to set up a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1520</b></font><br><br>



productivity  centre to improve  the  efficiency  of

management  and  to  raise  the  output  of  workers

through  the  application of modern techniques.  The

relation  between the industrial research  unit  and

the  future  productivity  centre  of  the  Economic

Development Board is something which will have to be

resolved. I do not wish to anticipate what the Board

itself will want to do. This will have to await  the

establishment of the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the Board will have power under clause II

to  raise its own capital by the issue of bonds  and

debentures, a substantial part of the Board's assets

will  be  made  available by the Government.  It  is

expected  that  over the Plan period 1961-1964,  the

Government  will contribute from current  revenue  a

total  of  $100  million for the  operation  of  the

Board.  This  will be done under the  provisions  of

clause 10 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 16, the Board will have compulsory

powers  to  acquire land. This is necessary  as  the

development  of industrial estates and sites,  which

is  one  of the functions of the Board, must proceed

expeditiously  to channel industries  into  suitable

areas  where the economies of scale in the provision

of basic services can be enjoyed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board as constituted under clause 5 includes a

full-time  Chairman and a Director, the Chairman  of

the  Housing  Board, and five members  to  represent

respectively  banking,  manufacturing,   commercial,

labour  and  professional interests.  Representation

and  participation in the running of the  Board  has

been  so  distributed that the whole  community  can

become   a   part   of   the  national   effort   to

industrialise,  which  task  would  be  the  Board's

supreme responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill will repeal the Singapore

Industrial Promotion Board Ordinance, 1957, and  the

assets  of  the  present Industrial Promotion  Board

would  be  vested  in  the new Economic  Development

Board.  The new Board will have a hundred-fold  more

resources at its disposal, with which to provide the

means for the take-off into industrialisation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, a word about the future. The powers of

the  Board  as I have described them fall  into  two

broad  categories.  First, there is  the  industrial

promotion  effort  and  the rendering  of  technical

services  and assistance to industries.  Then  there

are  the  financial activities of the Board such  as

the  provision  of loans or participation  in  share

capital.  It  is  the experience of other  countries

that  the latter functions, that is, loan operations

and  share  participation in industries, are  better

performed   by   a   separate   Industrial   Finance

Corporation. We may well find this to be the case in

Singapore.  But  as  a  first  step,  it  does  seem

unnecessary  to  establish  two  separate  statutory

bodies when not much is known as to the details  and

scope for what they would actually be doing and  how

much  demand  there would be for  the  services  and

resources that they will provide. This knowledge can

only come about through actual experience, and if it

is  proved necessary in the future to separate these

two   functions  and  allot  them  to  two  separate

authorities, then we shall proceed to do so. In  the

initial  stages  at  any rate, a certain  degree  of

centralisation would appear to be advantageous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Bill, we provided for the formal powers

and  the  general  modus operandi  of  the  Economic

Development Board, It is obvious that the setting up

of  the  framework  itself by no  means  provides  a

guarantee  of  success. Successful industrialisation

depends  on  many  other  factors  - maintenance   of

political stability, industrial peace, and a general

effort  by everyone to work harder and with  greater

skill. This means that the success or failure of our

venture  basically depends on whether every  citizen

in Singapore is prepared to make his contribution to

the national effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the

question  of  industrialisation, we have  given  our

views  at  previous sittings of this  Assembly,  and

they are quite well



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>



known. But I think it is worth while to repeat  here

the most important factors that can contribute to  a

successful industrialisation policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance himself said nearly two years ago that the success of any industrialisation

plan  depends on a common market, and this  morning,

in  reply to a question from the Opposition, it  was

made  known for the first time that there  had  been

only-



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, on a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Cairnhill quoted

me    as   saying   that, the   success   of   our

industrialisation depends on a common market. May  I

ask him, Sir, to quote chapter and verse so that  my

words  can be judged in their exact context  and  in

accurate terms?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am not able to quote the exact

words,  but it was clear from the Minister's  speech

at  the  time  when  he proudly  acclaimed  in  this

Assembly  that he had thought of the wonderful  plan

for a common market which was vital - I think the word

used could have been "vital" - to the success of  any

industrialisation plan. And then with  titters  from

the  Government Benchers that they, the bright  boys

of  the P.A.P., would then have discussions with the

Federation  Government. That was  nearly  two  years

ago.  And  only  this morning,  as  a  result  of  a

question asked-



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, on a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> No. It was only this morning, in

reply  to  a question from the Opposition,  that  we

became  aware of the fact that after the ministerial

meeting   some   two  years  ago  there   had   been

discussions  at official level. Three meetings  took

place  between  June and August  1960.  After  that,

there have been no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>



more  meetings but a lot of correspondence has  been

exchanged  on  various points that  require  further

clarification  or elucidation. But  anyway,  it  was

admitted  this morning that after August 1960  there

had been no further meetings, official or otherwise.

When  the  Development Plan of  the  Government  was

brought  up  for debate at the previous  sitting  of

this Assembly, no murmur whatsoever was made of  the

fate  of  the  discussions on the  Common  Commodity

Market. And today, it is significant that in  moving

the  Bill  the Minister pointed out the difficulties

or  the  prerequisites for the success of the  Bill;

but   he  forgot  his  great  brainchild - the  Common

Commodity Market with the Federation of Malaya.  May

I therefore ask him, in his reply, if he would stand

up and say that there is no hope of a Common Market?

Perhaps  the people of Singapore can be resigned  to

that  fate instead of being kept in suspense whether

or not such a Common Market is to come into being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister himself said that there are many things needed to guarantee the success of the Plan.

That  was  towards the end of his speech.  First  of

all,  he  said  there  must be political  stability.

There  has  been a lot of political instability,  if

political stability is to be measured in terms of 39

against  12 Members, then they can call it political

stability. But the way I look at political stability

is  that it is a Government that knows its mind.  It

is  a  Government that knows how to look  after  all

interests  and not just indulge in class hatred.  It

is  a Government that has Ministers who do not stand

up and proudly say, "If a company or such and such a

union  does  not behave, I will see to it  that  all

immigration passes will be withdrawn. So look  out!"

That  is  not  political stability.  That  engenders

political instability. Of course, Sir, I do not  say

that  the  Minister for Labour and Law was wrong  in

feeling so exasperated when he was told of what  had

happened by his colleague who was then and who still

is  the  adviser  to this newly-formed  Oil  Workers

Union.  But  if  he really has the interest  of  the

workers and the country at heart, there is certainly

another more effective way to settle the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>



problem.  Surely he could send for the employer  and

give  him a ticking-off in his office and say, "Look

here,  you  should not do this; you  should  not  do

that; you should not do the other," instead of doing

it  P.A.P.-style - "Either or!" Industrial peace! Ever

since the P.A.P came into power, there has been more

industrial unrest than there has ever been before.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir I can understand that the

truth sometimes hurts, and hurts rather deeply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Remember the Hock Lee riots!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The hon. Minister for Finance

himself  can - may I be so bold as to suggest to  him?

- look  up  the  statistics from his  colleague,  the

Minister for Labour and Law, and he will be able  to

see  whether  there have been more strikes  or  less

strikes.  Of  course, there should  have  been  less

strikes  because  the T.U.C. is a P.A.P. controlled

T.U.C.! I do not know whether it is a good thing for

great  P.A.P. trade union leaders to be at the  same

time  political leaders and try to mix politics with

trade  unionism. While they are here, they say,  "We

represent the Government," and while they are in the

A.U.P.E., they say, "We represent the workers."  And

the poor man there [Indicating] keeps on telling his

colleague,  "I  want  more  and  more  money  to  be

returned  to  the civil servants in respect  of  the

arbitrary pay cut." But when he sits here, he  says,

"I  am  in  favour of the pay cut." I  do  not  know

whether  it is a good thing for industrial peace.  I

do  not  know, because the P.A.P. have great  brains

and they know what they are doing!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want a successful industrialisation

programme  to  be  carried out, it  is  vital - it  is

accepted by the Government - that the conditions must

be  of such a character that there can be no fear of

confidence  in  the  Government  being   lost.   The

Minister  has  brought  up the  question  of  market

potential. He himself has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>



admitted  that  Singapore has a  very  small  market

potential,  but  that because of  the  situation  in

Singapore there are great prospects of selling goods

manufactured  in  Singapore  overseas.  Perhaps  the

Minister  is  not aware that it takes a  very,  very

long time to sell a new product.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not oppose the Bill, because we feel

that something has to be done to help the country to

solve the unemployment problem, but we do urge  upon

the   Government  to  be  more  realistic  in  their

approach  to the problem and to see to it  that  all

interests must be well and truly balanced.



<br><br>6.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to dwell

on  one  or two points. The first point is something

which  the  Minister himself made in his speech.  He

said  that it is necessary, in the existing economic

circumstances which Singapore finds itself, for  the

Government to play a positive and direct role in the

economic development of Singapore in order  to  stem

the  difficult unemployment situation. Sir, he  then

went on to develop that by saying how these positive

and  direct steps will be taken. While he was making

his  speech, I was looking at the Bill which he  had

placed   before   the  Assembly.   I   was   looking

particularly at clause 12 of the Bill which sets out

seriatim  the powers of the Board. I may  be  wrong,

Sir, I  may be a pettifogging lawyer. But sometimes

it   is  necessary  that  pettifogging  lawyers   do

propound  their views, because it is eventually  the

Courts that decide these things, and the Courts  are

presided  over by lawyers who might not  necessarily

be pettifogging but are yet lawyers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at clause 12. Mr Speaker, Sir, I get the

impression  that there is nothing in it which  would

enable  the  Board to play the positive  and  direct

role  in  industry which the Minister has  indicated

should  be done if the economy of this place  is  to

reach  some sort of stability. As far as I can  see,

all  the  powers are given either to underwrite  the

issue of stocks and shares of industrial enterprises

or   to   guarantee  loans  raised   by   industrial

enterprises, or to grant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1526</b></font><br><br>



loans  to industrial enterprises, or to sell shares,

and  manage  and  invest  in  shares  of  industrial

enterprises, or to acquire land, or:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`to act as agent for the Government or, with its

approval, for any other person in the transaction of

any  business  with  an  industrial  enterprise   in

respect  of  loans or advances granted or debentures

subscribed by the Government or such other person;'.



<br><br>So  that, in effect, the role which the Board  would

play  as  envisaged by the Bill, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

seems  to  be  this:  to come  to  the  help  of  an

industrial  enterprise  in circumstances  when  that

industrial enterprise cannot stand on its  own  feet

and  needs  or  solicits  the  help  of  Government.

"Industrial  enterprise"  is  expressly  defined  in

clause 2 which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`[It] means any sole-proprietorship, partnership,

company   or   co-operative  society  wheresoever

registered or incorporated under any law for  the

time  being  in force relating to companies,

co-operative societies or businesses and engaged  in

mining  or  in  the manufacture or processing  of

goods;'.



<br><br>So  that,  in  effect,  Mr Speaker,  an  industrial

enterprise  is either a partnership or a  registered

company  or  some  society  which  has  a  statutory

entity,  which indulges either in mining or  in  the

manufacture or processing of goods. Sir,  as  I  see

the  Bill,  there  seems to be a  divergence  and  a

cleavage between what the Minister has said  on  its

Second Reading and what in effect will be the  legal

powers  of  the Board. There are other matters,  Mr

Speaker, which I will raise in Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point which I wish to touch upon,

particularly as a matter of principle, is clause  15

of  the  Bill  which is charting  a  new  course  in

legislation.   Mr   Speaker,  I   have   repeatedly

complained  in  this House about  what  the  present

Government is doing to our courts of law: that it is

taking  away from them matters which normally  under

any  democratic government should go  to  them,  and

matters which having gone to them should be left  in

an  unfettered  manner for them  to  do  justice  to

according to the law of the land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, imagine my surprise, Mr Speaker, when I

received this Bill. In going through clause  15,  it

seems to me that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1527</b></font><br><br>



the   P.A.P.   Government,  that  is,  our   present

Government,  has gone one better than  it  has  been

doing  up till now. It is seeking to make our courts

of  justice a rubber stamp. Yes, Mr Speaker, I  use

the  words  deliberately - a rubber stamp.  Clause  15

goes on to say that if certain applications are made

to  the  Court, certain orders shall be made by  the

Court;  certain interim injunctions shall be  given;

and  certain orders shall issue from the Judges. Mr

Speaker,  Sir, this is the first time  I  have  seen

legislation which places a mandatory obligation on a

Judge  in  the way of what he shall decide or  shall

not  decide. It is all the more heinous because  the

very  things that they are going to the  Courts  for

are  powers  which are already vested in  the  Board

itself  under  clause 13. In those circumstances,  I

cannot  see  why clause 15 is necessary whereby  the

Courts become a rubber stamp.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this is a matter of principle. Mr Speaker.

This  is  not an isolated matter which only  affects

this  Bill  only. The independence of the Judiciary,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, is one of the  corner-stones  on

which  parliamentary democracy rests. If we  destroy

the  confidence  of the public in the independence - I

repeat the word again - independence of action and  of

thought  of  our Judges, then our whole  concept  of

parliamentary  democracy as we  understand  it  must

surely fall. If clause 15 is passed into law, and if

our  Judges  become rubber stamps,  I  submit,  with

respect   to  you,  Mr  Speaker.  Sir,   that   the

administration  of justice in this country  will  be

held  in  contempt, and any justice which becomes  a

matter  of  contempt will lose the  respect  of  the

people.  Once our Judges become objects of  contempt

in  the  eyes of the public, then the main essential

on  which  our  democratic concepts  rests  will  be

undermined.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Cairnhill. Sir,

he   has   given  a  completely  subjective,  highly

inaccurate and completely malicious account of  what

our-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I did notice that the Minister

for  Finance was fuming in his chair. But I  do  not

think  that  entitles  him  to  use  unparliamentary

expressions in this Assembly. To allege that an hon.

Member  of  this  House  has  been  guilty  of  some

malicious  act  is unparliamentary. That  should  be

withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I withdraw the objectionable

epithet, Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what the Member for Cairnhill has done is to

say that we, the Government, had made certain claims

as  to  the  virtue  of the Common Commodity  Market

proposals.  Speaking  purely from  memory  and  when

challenged to quote the actual remarks which  I  had

made, the Member for Cairnhill was completely unable

to  do so. Therefore, I shall dismiss his remarks as

being  purely  a political tactic to  discredit  the

Government.  We  had  made  no  such  claims  and  I

challenge the Member for Cairnhill, when he gets his

copy  of  Hansard and sees his own remarks  in  cold

print,  to  compare  his statement  of  what  I  was

supposed to have said on the Common Market with what

I  did actually say about it. And let him come again

and  defend the propositions that he has made before

the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill made a second point about

the   importance  of  political  stability  and  the

various  ways  in  which the P.A.P.  Government  had

failed  to  achieve it. This again is  so  obviously

untrue  that  it  does  not call  for  any  detailed

comment.  All I need say is that we need no  lessons

on  how  to  maintain political stability  from  the

S.P.A. or  the  former Labour  Front  members  who,

during  their brief and inglorious term  of  office,

had  provided an object lesson on how to bring about

a state of complete political instability and chaos.

If we need any lesson from Members of the Opposition

bench,  it  is  on  how  to  bring  about  political

instability  through  sheer  incapacity  to   govern

Singapore wisely, firmly and justly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1529</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point made by the Member for Cairnhill

is  that  during the tenure of office of the present

Government,  far  from achieving  industrial  peace,

what has happened is that there has been a record of

strikes,  and  he  said  that statistics  of  labour

disputes   will  bear  this  out.  Sir,   I   am   a

statistician  by  profession  and  I  have  made   a

particular effort to keep correct the statistics  of

man-days  lost  as  a  result of  strikes - statistics

which  are  furnished by my colleague, the  Minister

for  Labour  and  Law. May I remind the  Member  for

Cairnhill that when his Government was in power,  we

then  achieved  the  all-time record  of  industrial

disputes,  that in the year 1956 no  less  than  one

million  man-days of work were lost through strikes?

That  was an absolute record which exceeded the most

riotous  days of the post-war era when  the  Malayan

Communist Party openly challenged the then  colonial

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I turn to the comments of the Member for

Farrer  Park.  I  am  unable to  follow  the  legal

arguments  that he made, namely, that the provisions

of   clause  12,  taken  in  conjunction  with  the

provisions of clause 2, will not enable the Economic

Development Board to perform the function of  direct

and  positive participation in industry. Sir, may  I

refer him to clause 12  which empowers the Board:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`to grant loans or advances to, or subscribe to

stocks,  shares, bonds or debentures  of  industrial

enterprises;'.



<br><br>This  is  continued in paragraph (d), which empowers

the Board:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`to manage, control or supervise industrial

enterprises  by nominating directors or advisers  or

otherwise  collaborating with them or entering  into

partnerships  or any other arrangement  for  jointly

working with them;'.



<br><br>Clearly,  these two paragraphs empower the Board  to

participate   directly   and   positively   in   the

management  and  establishment of industry,  whether

existing  ones or new ones. But it may be  that  the

point that the Member for Farrer Park was making  is

that in clause 2 industrial enterprise is so defined

as  to include only existing enterprises and not new

ones.  I  do not know whether that was the point  he

was  making.  With respect, Sir,  if  that  was  the

point, then may I just say that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>



this  is  really a legal quibble, because there  are

many ways of bringing into existence enterprises  of

one  form  or  another,  so that  once  their  legal

existence  is established by the simple  process  of

administration  under any law, then the  Board  will

have the power to perform the functions which I have

enumerated. But I do not think the Member for Fairer

Park  was  making  a substantial  point  there.  His

principal  attack was against clause  15,  which  he

said  reduced the courts to the position of being  a

rubber stamp, and undermined the independence of the

Judiciary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 15 is not a clause which was created

de novo by us. I cannot recollect offhand the actual

precedent on which this clause was based. But to the

best  of  my  recollection, it  was  either  in  the

Industrial  Finance  Corporation  Ordinance  of  the

Government of Pakistan or some similar Ordinance  in

the  Government of India. I would say. Sir, speaking

purely as a layman with perhaps some trepidation  in

these matters, that the courts would be reduced to a

rubber  stamp  only if the decision in  any  dispute

between  the  Board and the other party can  legally

under  this Ordinance be resolved only in favour  of

the  Board,  and there is nothing in  clause  15  to

provide for this. All that clause 15 provides for is

that certain steps should be taken in regard to  the

attachment  of  property to ensure that  the  assets

against which loans are made shall be conducted in a

proper  and orderly way. Further, there is provision

for  safeguards  in that the orders which  are  made

under  this clause are interim orders and  that  the

Economic Development Board will have to show  cause.

I  think these are adequate safeguards, and  to  say

that  this provision undermines the independence  of

the  Judiciary is really carrying matters  too  far.

The  independence of the Judiciary, as I  understand

it,  means that a Judge, when he makes his  decision

in  any matter placed before him, should be able  to

do   so   without  pressure  or  duress   from   the

Government. For instance, the appointment, dismissal

and  disciplinary action in regard to Judges, should

be  removed as far as possible from the authority of

the Executive

his contention.

Bill, "industrial enterprise" is defined as-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"industrial enterprise" means any

sole-proprietorship, partnership, company or co-operative

society wheresoever registered or incorporated under

companies,  co-operative societies or  business  and

[this  is  the point, Mr Speaker, Sir]  engaged  in

mining  or  in  the  manufacture  or  processing  of

goods;'.



<br><br>So  there are those who are engaged in mining; there

are  those  who  are engaged in the  manufacture  of

goods; and there are those who are engaged in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>



processing  of  goods - three kinds of businesses.  I

can  understand the last two categories, namely, the

manufacture and processing of goods. Might I ask the

Minister  what  sort  of  mining  business  does  he

propose to conduct in Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I do not know why the

Member  for Farrer Park believes that the activities

of the Economic Development Board should be confined

to  Singapore. There may be occasions to  engage  in

activities outside Singapore as a complement to  the

industrial effort in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Is the Minister seriously suggesting to

this  House  that,  if a company is  established  in

Singapore, as there are indeed many now having their

registered head office in Singapore but indulging in

mining operations in the Federation - mining for  iron

or  tin or anything like that - he is going to utilise

the  taxpayers' money in Singapore for the financing

and  advancement of this company which is exploiting

the  mineral  resources  in the  Federation  to  the

betterment of the Federation Government?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it could be

mines  anywhere? But the point is  this.  I  do  not

think  it will be proper for us to so constrict  the

activities  of  the  Board as to  disallow  them  to

engage  in such operations. After all, Mr  Speaker,

Sir, there is, in the jargon of the economists, such

a  term as "forward and backward" integration.  That

is,  when  industries either go  forward  to  absorb

marketing  processes or go backward  to  take  under

their  charge the production of raw materials  which

are  necessary for their existence. As I have  said,

this  is  just  a  piece of permissive  legislation.

There  may be occasions when it might come in useful

or it might not come in useful. This, I think, is  a

matter which we should leave to the Board.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under clause 4, the

Minister  has  power to appoint a  Chairman  of  the

Board,  and he shall be a full-time officer  of  the

Board.  Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will run  your  eye

down  clause 5. Under clause 5 (1) (b), it says  the

Director  of  the  Board shall  be  appointed  under

section  7  of this Ordinance, which says  that  the

first  of these Directors shall be appointed by  the

Minister and that all subsequent Directors shall  be

appointed  by the Board. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  would

like  to  know from the Minister why it is necessary

to  have a Chairman of the Board, who is going to be

a  full-time  officer of the Board and who  probably

will  be paid a fairly high salary and, at the  same

time, have a Director of the Board who possibly will

be  paid a very high salary. Would it not be  enough

if  we  had only one person, and we call him  either

the Chairman or the Director?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, the answer is

quite  simple. It is likely that the first  Director

of  the  Board  will  be  a  person  appointed  from

overseas. He will be an industrial economist who has

experience  in such matters. It would  obviously  be

undesirable  to  leave the whole management  of  the

Economic Development Board in the hands of an expert

who  is  not a Malayan. This is then, therefore,  in

order  that  policy  matters  and  local  background

information  can be made continuously  available  to

the  Director of the Board. It will be an  advantage

if the chairman of the Board, who will be a Malayan,

is  appointed. It does not follow, of  course,  that

the  Chairman  of the Board will draw  a  very  high

salary.  Perhaps I may remind the Member for  Farrer

Park   that   the  Chairman  of  the   Housing   and

Development Board draws no salary, no allowance,  no

transport  allowance, and he works more  than

full-time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am fully aware that

the  present. Chairman of the Housing Board is doing

that,  because  he  is  the  present  Chairman,  and

because he does not want the money, so he says.  But

if  he  were desirous of getting the money, he could

have got it. So, if the Minister can assure me that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>



the  Chairman of the Economic Development Board will

perform his functions in the same way as the present

Chairman  of  the  Housing Board is performing  his,

then there would be no objection. But the point I am

raising  is this. It would appear that under clauses

4,  5  and 7 of this Bill, we are going to have  two

very highly paid officers of the Board, both of them

sitting  on the Board and both of them being members

of  the  Board.  I  would  suggest  that  if  it  is

necessary  to have a technical officer to  be  paid,

then he should be paid and remain as an employee  of

the Board, and not as a member of the Board. I think

it  is very undesirable to have two very highly paid

members of the Board drawing perhaps $2,500 each.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when you have

a  Board  that  will  have at  its  disposal  a  sum

amounting  to  $100  million, I  do  not  think  the

question of salary would be a matter over which  one

should quibble for any length of time. What we  want

is  the  quality of the men and if we  can  get  the

right  type, then I say he is worth the salary which

we will give him.

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, where a public

authority  or  an authority borrows money  from  the

public, it is normally the case that provisions  are

inserted  in  the  Bill  for  sinking  funds  to  be

created,  so that that authority will from  year  to

year pay into that sinking fund, contributions which

would  eventually be utilised to redeem the loan.  I

notice  that  in  this  Bill  these  provisions  are

missing.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the provision

of  sinking funds would be, appropriate in the  case

of  public  authorities where the money is  used  to

establish  an enterprise or a utility of some  sort;

then  a  sinking fund is necessary for repayment  or

for  replacement of its capital assets. But  in  the

case   of  the  Economic  Development  Board,   loan

debentures  may  be  used  not  so  much  against  a

specific project but as part of the process  of  the

financial activities of the Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, it may borrow money to lend to

other  persons  against  assets  which  are  already

there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 13 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, clause 13 gives certain rights to

the Board. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) Where any industrial enterprise which is

under  a  liability to the Board under an  agreement

makes any default in repayment or otherwise fails to

comply  with  the  terms of its agreement  with  the

Board,  the  Board shall, without prejudice  to  any

other  rights or remedies which it may possess under

the  law, have the right to take over the management

of  such industrial enterprise, as well as the right

to sell and realise the property pledged, mortgaged,

hypothecated or assigned to the Board.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at this stage I am not saying

that  this  is not a proper clause. What I  wish  to

draw  the attention of the House to is this - that  in

clause  15,  which we will come to in a minute,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  provisions  which  enable   the

parties  to  go to court also arise in circumstances

where  the  powers of the Board are concerned  under

clause 13. That is the point I wish to make now.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think it is a repetition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The rights of the Board in these

matters are set out in clause 13. The procedure  for

the enforcement of these rights is set out in clause

15.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, as I understand clause 13, if I

may put it simply, whenever a breach of an agreement

takes  place,  the Board has statutory powers  under

clause 13, when it becomes law, without prejudice to

any  other  rights or remedies which it may  possess

under any other law, to take over the management  of

such industrial enterprise. So that once there is  a

breach  of an agreement within the meaning of clause

13,  then  the Board has the right to take over  the

management of the industrial enterprise. It also has

the right to "sell and realise the property pledged,

mortgaged,  hypothecated or assigned to the  Board."

So the statute



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1537</b></font><br><br>



confers  the right on the Board to sell and  realise

the   property   mortgaged  in   the   circumstances

envisaged under clause 13. So that my point, when  I

come  to  clause  15,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  will  be

this - since  you  already have the  statutory  powers

under  clause  13  whereby you  can  take  over  the

management or sell and give a good title,  why  then

must  you  go through this rubber-stamp  process  of

going  before  the  Court and  getting  it  to  chop

things, when you already have the powers?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Clause 15 provides for the

necessary processes that have to be set on  foot  in

the   event   the   management  of  the   defaulting

enterprise  disputes the right of the Board,  either

in  general  terms or in detail, to  take  over  its

assets and the management.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Is the Minister suggesting that before

the  Board can take over the management of  such  an

industrial  enterprise, or  before  a  sale  of  the

mortgaged properties can be effected, steps must be

taken under clause 15?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 13 sets out

the  rights  of the Board in cases of  default,  and

clause 15 clearly sets out the procedures.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Am I to understand that the contention

of  the Government is that the Board cannot, of  its

own  accord, exercise the rights conferred on it  by

clause  13 without going through the processes  laid

down  under  clause  15? I do  not  read  those  two

clauses in that way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think

clause  15  is invoked only where, as  I  have  said

before,  the  defaulting  enterprise  contests   the

rights  of the Board. Where there is no such dispute

as  to  the rights of the Board, then the Board  can

proceed in a normal manner without recourse  to  the

Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. "That clause 14 stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, clause 14, to my mind, raises

certain  points which, if I am right, might operate

to take away some of the effectiveness of this Bill.

Clause 14 reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary,

and  without  prejudice  to  any  other  rights   or

remedies  which it may possess under  the  law,  the

Board   may   by   notice  require  any   industrial

enterprise,  to  which it has granted  any  loan  or

advance,   forthwith  to  discharge  in   full   its

liabilities to The Board-'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, Sir, it sets out a series of

circumstances - (a), (b), (c), (d), (e). And in (1) it

goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`if for any reason it is necessary in the opinion

of the Board to protect the interests of the Board.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will notice how wide a

clause  that  is. So that in itself  it  could  have

read, omitting (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary,

and  without  prejudice  to  any  other  rights   or

remedies  which it may possess under  the  law,  the

Board   may   by   notice  require  any   industrial

enterprise,  to  which it has granted  any  loan  or

advance,   forthwith  to  discharge  in   full   its

liabilities  to the Board if for any  reason  it  is

necessary in the opinion of the Board to protect the

interests of the Board.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, that is a very wide clause. If that is the

law,  let us take these circumstances. There  is  an

industrial enterprise which has been started and  is

doing  well.  Some bank has advanced it monies.  Say

the bank has advanced it $50 million or $10 million,

and  then  that enterprise needs further money.  The

bank declines to lend further money. This industrial

enterprise employs, say, a thousand persons.  It  is

in  the  national  interests  that  this  enterprise

should  be  kept  alive  as a  going  concern.  This

enterprise  goes to the Government,  puts  its  case

before  them,  and  in the circumstances  Government

might  feel  that this is one of those  cases  where

Government should help and then Government  advances

$10  million  to  this  enterprise.  The  bank,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  do not forget, has already  advanced

$10  million or $50 million as the case may be.  And

then  after  the Government have advanced  this  $10

million, they decide to call in the loan and say  to

this  enterprise, "Will you discharge in  full  your

liabilities to the Board?"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1539</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the question I ask the Minister is this - is

the Board going to be a preferred creditor or is  it

going  to rank in pari passu with the bank?  Now,  if

the  intention of the Bill is to make  the  Board  a

preferred  creditor, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  then  I  am

submitting to the Minister that a bank would be very

loath  to lend monies to any business enterprise  of

the   nature   envisaged  by   the   definition   of

"industrial enterprise" because any subsequent loans

made by the Board would become a preferred debt  and

the   bank  might  be  defeated  by  virtue  of  the

provisions of clause 14.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think clause 14 does bring

about  a  state whereby the Board would become,  in

effect, a preferred creditor if the Board so desires

to exercise its powers under this clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are various reasons why this is

necessary.  It  is  obvious  that  the  dictates  of

financial prudence would determine that the  Board

should be given certain protective powers. I am  not

so much interested in the hypothetical arguments put

forward by the Member for Farrer Park. What is  more

to  the  point is this. In the present situation  in

Singapore,  insofar  as the supply  of  bank  credit

loans  to industry goes, the facilities are  limited

and  the terms are not as attractive as would be the

case  with trading concerns. Speaking entirely  from

memory,  I  would  say that the proportion  of  bank

credit loans going to industry is extremely  small,

probably  of the magnitude of five per cent,  and  I

suspect  most of these to be more in the  nature  of

short-term  loans against goods or raw materials  in

store or finished goods in godowns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial financing hardly exists as a practice

in  bank finance in Singapore today. Therefore,  the

situation  which  the  Member for  Farrer  Park  has

described  would not, in fact, be a serious  problem

at all. It would be a completely different matter if

we  had,  say, private industrial banks engaging  in

loans  on a substantial scale. If the Board were  to

act  in  an  unreasonable manner independently,  and

even  in opposition to private banks, then the

ill-effects which the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1540</b></font><br><br>



Farrer Park has described may come into being. As it

is,  what  we  are  doing really  is  to  discuss  a

completely hypothetical proposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I am glad the Minister has

dispelled  that and if he has balanced  the  problem

and  thinks that that should be the position, I have

nothing  further  to  say. But I  put  this  further

proposition to the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supposing an industrial enterprise were indebted

to  its  trading creditors to the extent of $600,000

or  $1 million. While it is so indebted, it goes  to

the  Board  and  gets a loan of  $1  million  or  $2

million,  and  subsequently the Board  recalls  that

loan.  Is  it the intention of Government  that  the

Board's  loan  should over-reach the  other  trading

liabilities  and  defeat them, and  that  the  Board

should  get preferential treatment rather  than  the

legitimate trading creditors who had lent  money  or

supplied goods prior to the Board giving the loan?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I should say it is a matter of

policy. These reserved powers of the Board should be

used  with great circumspection. So far as possible,

where legitimate trading and financial interests are

involved, the Board should, as I have said, be  most

circumspect in the use of these reserved powers.  If

the    Board   were   to   exercise   these   powers

indiscriminately, then I should say that the  effect

would   be   harmful  not  only  on  the  enterprise

immediately  concerned,  but  it  may  have  adverse

consequences on other debtors to the Board. I  think

these  are  matters which can be left  to  the  good

judgment of the Board itself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I wonder if matters like this

should  be  left to the good judgment of the  Board.

[Interruption] The Minister might think I am wasting

his  time, but I think there is point in what  I  am

saying.  Many people would not say I am wasting  his

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many problems which arise over

this.   If   these   enterprises  should   go   into

liquidation or bankruptcy, then who is the preferred

creditor?  It  is  not good enough  merely  for  the

Minister  to assure this House that the  Board  will

use its discretion, because the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1541</b></font><br><br>



who  trade with these enterprises will want to know.

If  the  laws  are not equitable, then  people  will

refuse  to trade with these enterprises and, instead

of  helping industrial expansion in the country, the

net  result of this legislation might well  be  that

these  people  will think twice about  trading  with

these enterprises when they know that the Board,  on

giving   these   enterprises  money,   will   become

preferred creditors and defeat them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are being

driven into this detailed argument, as I have  said,

over a completely hypothetical proposition. I do not

see  why the Member for Farrer Park should deny  the

Government the right to say that the Board  will  be

manned  by  people capable of making sound  business

policy  decisions and that they will exercise  these

reserved  powers  which are necessary  where  public

money  is involved. I have gone as far as to concede

that   if   these  powers  were  to   be   exercised

indiscriminately, then the objectives of  the  Board

would  be  defeated. I think the Member  for  Farrer

Park should be satisfied with the recognition I have

given to the point he is trying to make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 15 stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have made

my  point  on  the Second Reading of the  Bill  that

clause 15 merely gives powers to the Board to go  to

the  Court  where  they themselves could  act  under

clause 13, except possibly under clause 15 (1)  (c);

but  insofar  as  clause 15  (1)  (a)  and  (b)  are

concerned,  the Board already have the powers  under

clause  13. There are various places here where  the

Judges  are called upon to make interim orders,  and

there are places where the Judges are called upon to

make  certain orders and they are not left with  any

discretion.  For instance, under sub-clause  (7)  of

clause 15:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1542</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If no cause is shown on or before the date

specified  in the notice under subsections  (4)  and

(6)  of this section, the judge shall forthwith make

the  interim order absolute and direct the  sale  of

the attached property or transfer the management  of

the  industrial enterprise to the Board  or  confirm

the injunction.'



<br><br>Under  this sub-clause, Sir, the Judge can  only  do

this  specified  thing. He cannot do  anything  more

than  that.  But what the framers of this sub-clause

have  failed  to appreciate is that  they  have  not

given  the power to the Judge to cancel the  interim

order.  Without  the  cancellation  of  the  interim

order,  none  of these orders can take  place.  They

have  gone  on  to  tie the hands of  the  Judge  by

saying, "You shall do this and that," but they  have

not allowed him to cancel the interim order. Without

the  cancellation of the interim order, I do not see

how  sub-clause (7) can work at all. But that is for

the Minister for Labour and Law to decide.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my friend the Member

for Farrer Park is well aware of the construction of

this particular clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clause deals with cases of default where an

enterprise  reaches  agreement with  the  Board.  In

those  circumstances,  there  is  provision  for  an

application to be made by an accredited  officer  of

the  Board to the High Court for the reliefs set out

in  paragraphs (a), (b) and (C). These  reliefs  are

designed to protect the interests of the Board,  and

I cannot see anywhere in the procedures that are set

out  in clause 15 that the Judges of the High  Court

are  treated  as  rubber-stamps, as claimed  by  the

Member  for  Farrer Park. Let us  look  at  it,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir. Take the case of an application  made

for the transfer of the management of the industrial

enterprise  to the Board on default. If  the  House

will  look  at  sub-clause (4)  of  clause  15,  the

procedures are set out there. Let me read sub-clause (4):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where the application is for the relief mentioned

in  paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section,

the   judge   shall  grant  an  interim   injunction

restraining    the   industrial   enterprise    from

transferring or removing its machinery or  equipment

and  issue  a  notice  calling upon  the  industrial

enterprise to show



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1543</b></font><br><br>



cause on a date to be specified in the notice as  to

why  the  management  of  the industrial  enterprise

should not be transferred to the Board.'



<br><br>That is a judicial process, Mr Speaker, Sir, for an

interim  injunction and notice to show  cause.  Then

sub-clause (5) provides:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Before making any order under subsection (3) or

subsection (4) of this section, the judge may, if he

thinks   fit,   examine  the  officer   making   the

application.'



<br><br>There  is  the application that is made  under

sub-clause  (1) - the application for the reliefs set  out

in  paragraphs (a), (b) and (c). Then there  is  the

procedure  for the Judge to examine the officer  who

makes  the  application. There is also the procedure

for  the  notice to show cause which must be  served

upon the defaulting enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we go on to sub-clause (6) which

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`At the same time as he makes an order under

subsection  (3)  of this section,  the  judge  shall

Issue   to   the  industrial  enterprise  a   notice

accompanied  by copies of the order, the application

and  the  evidence, if any, recorded by him, calling

upon  It to show cause on a date to be specified  in

the notice as to why the interim order of attachment

should  not  be  made  absolute  or  the  injunction

confirmed.'



<br><br>Then  a notice to show cause issues on a date to  be

specified in the notice as to why the interim  order

of  attachment - if it is a case of attachment - should

not be made absolute or the injunction confirmed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then sub-clause (7) goes on to provide:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If no cause is shown on or before the date

specified  in the notice under subsections  (4)  and

(6)  of this section, the judge shall forthwith make

the interim order absolute...'.



<br><br>Here is the case where an opportunity has been given

to  the  enterprise to show cause, and when it  has

failed to do so then there is power for the Judge to

make  the interim order absolute and direct the sale

of  the attached property or transfer the management

of the industrial enterprise to the Board or confirm

the injunction.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1544</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-clause (8) provides:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If cause is shown, the judge shall proceed to

investigate   the  claim  of  the  Board   and   the

provisions of the Rules of the Supreme Court,  1934,

shall   as   far  as  practicable  apply   to   such

proceedings.'



<br><br>So  that there is, right through these clauses,  the

proper  legal  procedures  which  must  be  followed

before  the Judge makes his orders and I cannot  see

how  it can be claimed by the Member for Farrer Park

that, by virtue of clause 15, it is the intention of

this  Government  to  turn the Judges  into

rubber-stamps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Just one point, Mr Speaker, Sir,In

clause 23 (b), on the 4th line from the end, it

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... freed and discharged from any trust

whatsoever,   but   subject  nevertheless   to   the

provisions of this Ordinance; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) all liabilities and obligations of the

Singapore Industrial Promotion Board which may  have

existed   immediately  prior  to  the  coming   into

operation of this Ordinance shall be transferred  to

and vest in the Board.'



<br><br>I  can  understand paragraph (c), Sir, but I  cannot

understand (b) when it says that merely because  all

the liabilities and obligations are transferred from

the  previous Board to the present Board, any trusts

that  were attaching to the previous Board shall  be

"freed  and discharged". Could the Minister  explain

what that means?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, "Upon the coming into

operation  of  this  Ordinance all  liabilities  and

obligations  of  the Singapore Industrial  Promotion

Board  which may have existed immediately  prior  to

the coming into operation of this Ordinance shall be

transferred  to and vest in the Board" by  operation

of  law.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  once  that  situation

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1545</b></font><br><br>

that  if all the liabilities and obligations of  the

previous  Board were to be taken on  by  the  future

Board,  then  the pharse "freed and discharged  from

any  trust  whatsoever" in paragraph  (b)  is  quite

meaningless. You cannot have any trusts attaching to

it  freed and discharged. Yet the Minister is trying

to  say  that  any obligation - and  a  trust  is  an

obligation - has been taken on by the  new  Board.  It

seems to contradict itself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Although they are freed and discharged

Board by the operation of paragraph (c).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.



<br><br>8.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be

now read a Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Women's Charter Bill, which was first

introduced  last  year, has  been  under  the  close

scrutiny  of two Select Committees and  I  hope  the

Bill,  as amended, will be generally accepted  as  a

significant  advance in social legislation  for  the

protection of the rights of women.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1546</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is not as revolutionary as some people

would  like  it to be. In particular, the provisions

relating   to   divorce   follow   closely   similar

provisions  in the English Divorce law  and  may  be

said,  as  a representor before the Select Committee

maintained, to be framed on the basis of  Protestant

theology.  It  was felt, however, that  to  allow  a

marriage to be dissolved by mutual consent or  under

the Chinese custom by a unilateral public act by the

husband  would defeat the basis on which the Women's

Charter was framed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks, on the one hand, to make it as

easy  as  possible  to enter into  the  contract  of

marriage  and,  on the other hand,  to  make  it  as

difficult as possible to contract out of it.  It  is

especially necessary, in a situation where  existing

polygamous  marriages  are  recognised   and   where

monogamy is to be enforced for the future, that  the

institution  of marriage should be safe-guarded  and

that  too  easy  divorces should be  prevented.  For

otherwise,  it  would  be easy for  an  unscrupulous

husband  to divorce his existing wife or  wives  and

take  for himself another wife. Thus the very  basis

of  the legislation would be demolished and, instead

of  raising  the status of women, the Charter  would

further  lower it. It may be that when the women  of

Singapore  are more advanced and more aware  of  and

more  in  a  position to exercise their  rights,  it

would be possible to go further in liberalising  the

law  of divorce - but for the present it is felt  that

it  would  be  better to work on the  existing  law,

which has been in force in Singapore since 1912, and

which has been found on balance not to have operated

unsatisfactorily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One significant change which has been introduced

is  the  power  given  to the  Court  to  refer  the

differences  between the parties to  a  marriage  to

Conciliation   Officers  so  that  a  reconciliation

between  the  parties can be affected.  It  is  also

provided  that  where there are differences  between

the  parties to a marriage the parties or either  of

them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1547</b></font><br><br>



may  refer the differences to a Conciliation Officer

for  his advice and assistance. It is hoped that  in

this way the parties will be assisted to arrive at a

reconcilation, and that every effort will be made to

resolve their differences before the parties  resort

to the Court for dissolution of their marriage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions in the Charter relating to the

disability  to  contract polygamous  marriages  will

have effect from the 2nd March this year, and it  is

therefore  necessary  to bring the  Women's  Charter

into  operation  as  soon as possible.  It  will  be

necessary,  before this is done,  to  prescribe  the

form to be used under the Charter and to appoint the

Deputy  Registrars  of Marriage  who  will  have  to

assist  in the registration of marriages. The  forms

are  already in draft, and it is therefore  expected

that it will be possible to bring the Ordinance into

operation  after  it is enacted  in  the  very  near

future.

section 5 of the Registration of Imports and Exports

Ordinance (Cap. 261), resolves that the Registration

of  Imports  and  Exports (Amendment)  Rules,  1961,

published as Notification No. S 92 in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>



Gazette Supplement No. 26 dated 14th April, 1961, as

contained in Paper S.L. 10 of 1961, be approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main reasons for amending the

Registration of Imports and Exports Rules, 1935, are

briefly  to  regularise  certain  current  practices

which  have  been  carried on for some  considerable

time  and in which respect Rules Nos. 4 and  14  are

affected, and to extend a concession to the shipping

community in respect of which Rule 7 is affected.  I

shall deal with them one at a time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volume of Government imports is quite

considerable  and  under  the  existing   Rule   14,

although   the  State  Government  Departments   are

exempted  by  the Rule from declaring their  imports

and  exports,  in  practice  they  are  required  by

administrative  instruction to make declarations  to

enable  the  Statistics  Department  to  obtain  the

desired coverage of merchandise now included in  the

current  publications of the Malayan  and  Singapore

External Trade Statistics. Hence, for the purpose of

regularity,  Rule  4  (1) is  amended  by  inserting

proviso  (a)  which will give legal  effect  to  the

Administrative  instruction. Consequently,  Rule  14

also  requires  amendment with which  I  shall  deal

later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 7 prescribes a time limit of four days for

the submission of outward manifests to the Registrar

of  Imports and Exports. The shipping community  has

lodged a request that more time be allowed to enable

them to meet the amount of clerical work involved in

the preparation of the manifests. As a compromise to

the  request for a new time limit of 10 days, it  is

proposed  to extend the current period of four  days

to  seven days which is considered adequate. Rule  7

is amended to this effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three amendments to Rule 14 relating to

exemptions  of declaration for imports  and  exports

will:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) regularise the practice whereby trade

samples, gifts up to $100 in value and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1552</b></font><br><br>



printed  shipping  and airline  documents  are

currently  exempted  from the  requirement  of

rendering   import  and  export  declarations.

This  practice, which is considered reasonable

and  has,  in  effect, been in  existence  for

some  considerable time, is without any  legal

basis  and  it  is desired to  regularise  the

position;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) closely define personal and household

effects  of passengers or crews in  order  to

assist  in  proper checks and to clarify  the

limitations   on  "passengers'  baggage   and

personal effects"; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) no longer exempt the Governments of the

State  of Singapore and of the Federation  of

Malaya  from the provisions of the Rules.  At

present  the  Federation  Government  is  not

required  to declare its imports and exports,

but with the alteration in respect of our own

Government  it  is right that the  Federation

Government  should follow suit in respect  of

their departmental imports and exports.

75  or  100  tons.  As far as I know,  although  the

Government has considered that such certificates are

equivalent  to certificates of local trade  masters,

however,  the holders of such certificate are  faced

with  many difficulties. For instance, in the matter

of  getting employment, employers give preference to

local trade masters without the stipulation of 75 or

100 tons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is this, Mr Deputy Speaker. If

Government can give consideration to the first point

I  have  raised, I appeal to them to  implement  the

second point, which is the setting up of a Board for

the purpose of obtaining employment in rotation just

as  they  have done in the case of seamen.  But  for

local  ships officers, such a Board is non-existent.

There  is  no  system  of  rotation  in  respect  of

employment.  Mr  Deputy Speaker, today  this  is  a

matter  which is degrading the status of  the  local

ships  officers,  because if an employer  wishes  to

employ  an  officer on board a ship, it is  normally

done  through the trade unions. Here it  seems,  Mr

Deputy  Speaker  - I  am not accusing  certain  trade

unions - those trade unions with such powers have made

use  of  their  trade  unions as  a  private  labour

exchange  to look for employees for their  employers

to  work  on board ship. Is it really good  for  the

Government to set up a Board so that all local ships

officers will have an opportunity to find employment

without   discrimination,  if  an   employer   seeks

employees,  and  not  just have  it  confined  to  a

certain  trade union only? In addition,  Mr  Deputy

Speaker, Sir, if a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1554</b></font><br><br>



local  trade master is required on a salary of  $400

or  $500 a month, there will be bargaining about the

pay,  resulting in its being reduced to  $250.  This

will be a loss to the certificate holders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point, Mr Deputy Speaker, is this.

Since  the  Government has agreed to approve  people

with local trade masters certificates to sail as far

as  Tawau,  then I hope the Government  will  permit

these certificate holders to have an opportunity  to

navigate  ships  as far as Bangkok and  Djakarta  in

order  to reduce employment because Tawau is farther

than  Bangkok  or  Djakarta. I hope  this  too  will

receive the serious consideration of Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Deputy Speaker, is this appeal

which  is  submitted to the Government in connection

with  the  local Press announcement that pilots  are

required to work in the Singapore Harbour Board.  In

my   opinion,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  I   wish   the

Government could act so that opportunity is open  to

local  citizens who hold trade masters  certificates

to become trainee pilots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, whether it is being

practised  or  not,  I appeal to the  Government  to

train  seamen in all nautical matters and that  they

be taught in the national language. It is not that I

do  not  agree that lessons be given in the  English

language; this is good for youths who wish to become

leaders in the maritime field, but it is to give  an

opportunity to our local boys who are not  so

well-versed in the English language. So if classes  could

be  conducted in the national language,  I  am  sure

many of the local ships officers could enhance their

status  as  local trade masters, not merely  in  the

home trade but also in the foreign trade as well.



<br><br>8.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I will

answer  point  by point the matters  raised  by  the

Member  for  Kampong Kembangan. With regard  to  the

first  point, I am surprised to hear that after  the

amendment  to  the Merchant Shipping Ordinance  last

year, local trade masters have found it difficult to

get employment to handle



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1555</b></font><br><br>



ships  of up to 1,000 tons. Section 20 (2)  (ii)  of

the amended Merchant Shipping Ordinance reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`unless the Minister in any particular case

otherwise  directs, a certificate as a master  of  a

local-trade  ship of under one hundred  tons  or  of

under  seventy-five tons shall be  deemed  to  be  a

certificate as master of a local-trade ship,  and  a

certificate  as  a gunner shall be deemed  to  be  a

certificate as a mate of a local-trade ship:'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, under that revised Ordinance those who

previously were eligible to handle ships of only 100

tons or 75 tons would automatically be permitted  to

handle  ships of up to 1,000 tons. I have been  told

by the law officers that it is not possible to issue

a  new certificate to those local trade masters  who

had sat for examinations held previously. However, I

am  looking  into  the matter and if  there  is  any

attempt  at discrimination, I will try to solve  the

problem  by having the old certificates endorsed  so

that  they  will  be  considered  as  good  as   the

certificates which are now issued to those who  have

passed  their  local trade masters examinations  and

which  enable the holders to handle ships of  up  to

1,000 tons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point raised by the Member for

Kampong    Kembangan,   that   shipping   companies,

especially   local   shipping   companies,   recruit

officers  through the unions and that, in doing  so,

the  blue-eyed boys of certain unionists  are  given

preference  before  others,  that  matter   can   be

resolved easily enough. I will make arrangements for

a  register for shipping officers to be prepared  at

the  Shipping Office so that employers who  wish  to

employ  local  trade masters can go to the  Shipping

Office,  look up the register and pick any man  they

wish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add that the seamen, at the

moment, have a register of their own; also,  at  the

same  time,  shipping companies  are  now  permitted

under  arrangements with the trade  unions  to  keep

their  own  register.  However,  the  Ordinance  and

regulations  concerning the Seamen's Registry  Board

cannot be applied strictly to ship officers as  this

Ordinance concerning seamen applies only to seamen.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third point raised by the Member for

Kampong Kembangan, that Bangkok and Djakarta  should

be  included in the local trade limits, I  will  say

this.  I  have been trying very hard to  extend  the

limits   of  the  local  trade.  Last  year,   after

negotiations with the Governments of the Federation,

Brunei, Borneo and Sarawak, we managed to extend the

limits of the local trade to as far as Tawau. It was

pointed out during those discussions that the  local

trade  master  navigates his ship by sighting  land,

and  to include Bangkok or Djakarta within the local

trade   limits  would  mean  that  we   are   giving

responsibility to captains who are not qualified  to

navigate to those ports. It must be understood  also

that the Singapore Government alone by itself cannot

just  alter local trade limits or home trade  limits

as  it  pleases. After all, most of our  seamen  and

shipping  officers are employed on ships  which  are

not  registered  in  Singapore. At  the  same  time,

whatever  rules  and regulations we pass  and  which

will  involve other governments must also  have  the

consent of these governments. We can, tonight,  just

by  a  scratch of the pen say you can take this ship

to such and such a place. But if you do not seek the

consent  of the government of the country  to  which

the ship is sailing, what will ultimately happen  is

that  the ship will not be given clearance when  she

arrives  at that port. Therefore, it is not such  an

easy  matter  for  us just to say,  "Right.  Let  us

include  such  and such a place within  local  trade

limits." It can be done. But it will be ineffective.

The only way we can do so is to seek the concurrence

of other governments, and that takes time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already made two major amendments in the

Merchant  Shipping Ordinance concerning local  trade

masters.  One is to raise the tonnage of  the  ships

from  75 tons and 100 tons to 1,000 tons. The second

is  that we have extended the local trade limits  to

as  far  as  Tawau.  I consider these  are  two  big

achievements;  and these amendments were  made  only

last  year.  I  would  ask local  trade  masters  to

improve their training so that eventually they  will

be able to sit for the home trade certificate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth point, concerning the appointment of

pilots  to the Singapore Harbour Board, I would  add

that  when the P.A.P. Government came in, we  found,

to  our  consternation, that there were  pilots  who

were earning as much as $100,000 a year. One of  the

first  things my Ministry did was to initiate  steps

to malayanise the pilotage for this port and, at the

same  time,  to  bring the scales of emoluments  for

pilots to some rational scale that is parallel  with

those  of  other  officers who  hold  equal  if  not

greater responsibilities in this country. Steps have

been taken to bring pilotage under the aegis of  the

Singapore  Harbour Board and, ultimately,  the  Port

Authority.  It is definitely Government's  intention

that  as many local trade masters as possible should

be  trained to pilot ships, and it is my hope indeed

that  as  many  of them as possible will  apply  for

posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fifth point, I would say that the training

of  local trade masters is already conducted in  the

Malay  language. It is being done in the Polytechnic

out  of  funds paid from the Seamen's Welfare  Fund.

Examinations  for  the Local Trade  Certificate  are

conducted  in Malay. So on that point, I  think  the

Member for Kampong Kembangan has really nothing  new

to raise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would only like to add this. Those who aspire to

work  on board ship should extend their horizons  to

further  places. Our youths should  be  prepared  to

work hard so that ultimately they will be fitted not

only  to man locally-registered ships for the  local

trading  ports,  but  also to qualify  for  work  on

foreign-going  ships.  Towards  this  objective,  we

have,   with   the  co-operation  of  the   shipping

companies,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1558</b></font><br><br>



started to strengthen the Nautical Department at the

Polytechnic. Cadets have been taken in and when they

complete  one  year's preliminary  training  at  the

Polytechnic,  all of them will be  placed  on  board

ship  where  they  will  gain practical  experience,

during  which time a correspondence course  will  be

conducted  so  that they will be able  to  correlate

their    practical   experience   with   theoretical

training.  Ultimately  they  will  return   to   the

Polytechnic  for  a refresher course  before  taking

their  foreign-going mate's examinations or

foreign-going master's examinations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the House that the Government is

doing  its  very  best  to improve  and  extend  the

opportunities  of employment for local  citizens  on

board  ship  at all levels - not only at  the  officer

level but also at the seamen level. As Singapore  is

the  fifth  largest  seaport in  the  world,  it  is

correct  that  as many as possible of  our  citizens

should take to the sea. All the steps we have  taken

so far have been directed towards this purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may add that a new course in marine engineering

will  be  started at the Polytechnic for the  1961-2

session. This course will ultimately train our local

boys to become marine engineers who will be able  to

work  on board ship, or if they wish to do so,  will

also  be  able  to find employment as  engineers  in

factories   with  their  practical  experience   and

theoretical training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

is  therefore not possible to say generally what the

subsidy  will be for a particular type of unit;  the

information  can  be  given only  in  respect  of  a

particular housing estate.

<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat</b> asked the

Minister for National Development what are the total

number  of  such flats allotted to fire  victims  so

far.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> There are altogether 2,920 flats,

16  maisonettes and 68 shops at the Kallang  housing

estate.  The  2,920  flats  comprise  the  following

units:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. According to the Housing Board's records a

total  of  some  940  units  at  Kallang  have  been

allocated to fire victims over the years since 1958.

and the number of units occupied by fire victims  as

at 30th April, 1961 was 501.
