<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yesterday, I received a letter dated 16th

November,  1964, from His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

to  the effect that by virtue of the provisions of the Singapore

(Election  to  the House of Representatives) Ordinance,  he  had

been   informed  that  a  vacancy  exists  in   the   House   of

Representatives following the resignation of Mr  Ho  See  Beng,

and  requesting me to arrange for the election of  a  Member  in

accordance with the provisions of the said Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House are aware that Mr Ho See Beng, who is

the  sitting Member for Bras Basah and a member of the  People's

Action Party, must be replaced by another member of the People's

Action  Party  on this election, and that is by  virtue  of  the

provisions  of the said Ordinance which I have just quoted.  So

when Members elect another Member in replacement of the said  Ho

See  Beng,  the  Member  should be nominated  from  amongst  the

sitting Members in this House from the People's Action Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, by virtue of the powers vested in the Assembly under the

provisions   of  the  Singapore  (Election  to  the   House   of

Representatives) Ordinance, this Assembly will  now  proceed  to

the election of the Member. Any proposal?

Speaker  of the House of Representatives the name of the  person

elected,  that  is to say, Mr E.W. Barker, as a Member  of  the

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>CONTRACT LABOUR</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues</b> asked the Minister for National

Development (a) to list the areas in which contract  labour

has been  introduced  in  his  Ministry to perform  jobs  previously

carried  out by regular labour; and (b) to state the  reason  or

reasons why contract labour has been engaged to perform jobs previously carried out by regular labour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, contract labour has not been

introduced by my Ministry to displace the regular labour  force.

It  has always been the practice, when there are temporary peaks

in  the  volume  of regular work with which the  regular  labour

force cannot cope, to let the work out on contract. Otherwise an

increase  in the regular labour force for an occasional overflow

of  work would mean a redundancy problem when the volume of work

returns to normal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one particular case, the regular labour force expressed

aversion  to  the work of removal of sludge in the  Ulu  Pandan

Sewerage  Disposal  Works because of the unpleasant  smell,  and

asked to be taken off these duties. This work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



has therefore been given out to contract since the end of 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in certain fields of unskilled labour such as grass

cutting,  planting of grass along road sides and side tables  of

roads,  the  efficiency  of the regular labour  force  is  being

checked  against  work allocated on contracts in  order  to  see

whether   departmental  labour  is  keeping  up  its   rate   of

productivity.  There has been a tendency in the  regular  labour

force  to slow down the pace of work in order to create overtime

on  public  holidays  and Sundays. If this trend  persists,  the

productivity of the regular labour force will become  lower  and

lower and finally ludicrously uneconomic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem is now widespread in all Government Departments

where  overtime can be created by slowing down the pace of work.

The  Government is having a committee to look into  this  matter

with a view to removing the temptation to slow down productivity

in  order to create overtime. Unless this problem is solved, the

disparity  between  departmental labour  and  work  let  out  on

contract will make it absurd for the Government to continue  its

present  policy of high daily wages at the minimum of $4.55  per

day  for  unskilled labour, with double and treble overtime  for

Sundays and public holidays. The Government is sure that most of

its  union  leaders are keen to protect their honest  and

hard-working  members and will want to eradicate malpractices

leading to   deliberate  malingering  and  absenteeism.Absenteeism  is

sometimes as high as 25 per cent on a week day and as low  as  3

per  cent on a public holiday when treble pay obtains.  In  some

cases, drivers of lorries have earned as much as $380 per  month

and  workers  have  earned  more than  $200  per  month  through

artificially  created  overtime giving them  incomes  more  than

their supervisors. This problem has become more and more vicious

over the last six to seven years. A possible solution would seem

to  lie, as in the case of the Singapore Port Authority, in  the

abolition  of overtime through the introduction of shift  duties

at rates of pay which guarantee that the total



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



take-home pay will be at least 26 days full wages per month  for

each worker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will be discussing this matter with the unions

to  work  out a solution which will do justice not only  to  the

honest and industrious workers but also to the tax-payers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigues (Telok Blangah)</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> A supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question.

Will the  Minister state why he has not consulted the union concerned

before accepting and making use of contract labour? Will he also

undertake to consult the union concerned in future?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in my reply just now, I said

we  do make use of contract labour during peak hours. That means

there is some work which has got to be done quickly. On the  one

hand, we are trying to do our very best to expedite the work  of

the  Government; and on the other hand, there is a request  here

which says, why did I not consult the trade union? It would have

taken  me  at least six months to get an answer from them  if  I

were  to  consult them whether contract labour could be used  or

not.  I  think it is well within the authority of the Government

to  employ contract labour if and when we think it necessary  to

expedite work.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> A supplementary question. Will

the  Minister tell this House how exactly the Government intends

to implement the P.A.P. policy on socialism ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a supplementary question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, I would like to put it in another way.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member will have to rephrase it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> If contract labour succeeds in increasing

efficiency, will the Government permit it to create more inroads

into the public sectors?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is better.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are aware of the abuse

which can take place in contract labour. But, at the same time,

Mr Speaker, Sir, we are elected by the people to administer the

government. We are trustees of the public funds. We are not

going to spend money to enlarge a force where malpractices such

as I have stated exist. It is our duty, Sir, to see that the

labourer is worth his pay. We do not want to have malingering.

We do not want to have artificially created overtime. In this

respect, I say that the trade union leaders and the members of

the trade union themselves have a responsibility. We are here to

foster a more enlightened labour policy. But, in doing so, Mr

Speaker, Sir, it takes not only the Government, but the labour

leaders and the members of the union to see that both play their

part. It is only when there is a certain minimum standard of

efficiency that we can undertake to see that more and more

daily-rated labourers are being used to carry out our work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lembaga Gerakan Pelajaran Dewasa, constituted under section

5  of  the  principal  Ordinance,  consists  of  eleven  members

appointed by the Minister for Education. Under paragraph (c)  of

section  5,  one member is to be appointed on the nomination  of

the Minister for Labour and Law; under paragraph (f) of the same

section,  one member is to be appointed from among the  tutorial

staff of the University of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>



Malaya  in  Singapore  and under paragraph  (h)  of  the  same

section,  two  members are to be appointed on the nomination  of

the Trades Union Congress in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the change in ministerial responsibility in the

portfolio  of Labour and Law and of nomenclature in  respect  of

the  University of Malaya in Singapore and to the fact that  the

Trades  Union Congress is no longer in existence, no appointment

of  members to the Board can be made under paragraphs  (c),  (f)

and  (h) of section 5 of the principal Ordinance. Therefore,  it

is  necessary  to amend these paragraphs to enable the  Minister

for Education to make such appointments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid going to the Legislative Assembly in future for

amendments such as those I have just mentioned, it is considered

that the Minister for Education should be empowered to vary  the

composition of the Board, by notification in the Gazette. It  is

also  considered that the Minister should be similarly empowered

to  vary the number of the members of the Board and provide  for

the manner in which additional members, if any, shall be appointed.  The additional subsection (10) to section 5 proposed in the

Bill  serves  such purposes. In fact, identical provisions  have

been  made  under subsection (4) of section 3 of the  Architects

Ordinance (Cap. 189).

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Registration of Dentists Ordinance

(Chapter  197  of  the  Revised Edition)  to  enable  a  dentist

registered  in the Second Division of the Register  of  Dentists

and  practising in Singapore to be appointed to the Dental Board

by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dental Board formed under this Ordinance has as its main

function  the  control of the registration of dentists  and  the

regulation of the practice of dentistry in the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two classes of dentists who are registered under the

Ordinance:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dental surgeons trained in recognised Dental Schools and have

Dental Degrees. These are registered under the First Division of

the Register.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unqualified dentists who are non-graduate dentists but

registered under the Second Division of the Register.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the register for unqualified dentists was closed in

1950,  opportunity was given to all unregistered  dentists  then

practising  in  Singapore  to  be registered  under  the  Second

Division, if they should pass a registration examination. Out of

197   candidates   who  presented  themselves   for   the   said

examination, 173 were successful and were accordingly registered

under  the Second Division of the Register. The Dental  Register

as  at  30th  June, 1964, stood as follows:-  117  Division  I

dentists and 223 Division II dentists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Division II dentists formed themselves into an organisation

known  as the Singapore Chinese Dentists' Association. In  April

this  year  the  Association  petitioned  this  Ministry  for  a

representative of the Association to serve on the Dental  Board.

This proposition was acceptable to the Ministry because even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



in  Malaya, a representative from Division II Dentists had  been

serving on the Malayan Dental Board for some time. Clause 2  (a)

(k) of the Bill now seeks to provide for such representation  of

Division II dentists on the Singapore Dental Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is taken in clauses 2 and 3 of the Bill to make

certain   minor   amendments  in  the   Ordinance,   mostly   in

nomenclature.  The  words  "Federation  of  Malaya"  are  to  be

substituted  by the word "Federation", except in section  5  (1)

(f)  of  the Ordinance where the words are to be substituted  by

the "States of Malaya". The Head of the Department of Dentistry,

Faculty  of  Medicine, University of Singapore, is to  supersede

the seat previously held by the Professor of Dental Surgery, and

the words "Malayan Dental Association" are to be substituted  by

the  words "Malaysian Dental Association" in accordance with the

new registered name of the Association.

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is the direct outcome of complaints from many sources

about  the  sharp  practices  of  certain  unscrupulous  housing

developers  in  their  dealings  with  house  purchasers.   Such

complaints have been ventilated in the Press from time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



to  time,  the architects' profession have openly clamoured  for

some  form  of regulation of building construction so  that  the

relationship  between  the  developer  and  house  purchaser  is

properly  set  out,  and  even  certain  members  of  the  legal

profession  have  been alarmed at the very  one-sided  contracts

which house purchasers have to enter into with the developer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One may well ask why, in a system such as we have in Singapore,

any  government interference with the laws of demand and  supply

is  necessary. The answer is simple. While the Government  tries

to  satisfy  the housing necessity of the lower and lower-middle

income groups by providing public housing for sale or for  rent,

it  has always been assumed that the private sector will provide

for   those  who  would  wish  to  live  in  better   types   of

accommodation  than  those provided at  public  expense.  Hence,

while we are aware that 14,000 to 16,000 units of housing may be

required  each year, our efforts have been directed to supplying

only 10,000 to 12,000 units annually, leaving the remaining

one-third  or  so  to  be  supplied by private enterprise.  This  is

healthy  in so far as the State should not have the monopoly  of

providing housing, private enterprise should participate in  the

development of our city areas, and better type of housing should

be built at the same time as low cost housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, because of shortage of land, varying building

conditions and the upward trend of prices of building materials,

there   are   many  uncertainties  in  the  housing  development

business.    While   certain   well   established    development

organisations  with  proper  financial  backing  and  managerial

experience are able to cope with the changing situation  and  to

deliver  the  goods  in accordance with the terms  of  agreement

entered   into  with  the  purchaser,  the  existence  of   such

uncertainties  has  given birth to a spate of  mushroom  housing

developers  who use every opportunity to make quick  profits  at

the expense of the house purchaser.



In  a  situation where the purchaser is acutely aware  that  the

limited amount of money he has to purchase a house



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



might  soon  be  insufficient due  to  rising  land  prices  and

building costs, it is not surprising that he will be prepared to

enter  into agreements which are so patently one-sided and  most

disadvantageous  to  him. Many of these agreements  provide  for

refunds  of deposit to the purchaser without any special reason;

increase in the price of the property to be purchased;  no  time

limit  for  the completion of the house; a free hand in  varying

the  materials to be used and in the alterations to the detailed

plans; and various additional items of expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of such unscrupulous practices by certain

developers,  many house purchasers have been properly  swindled.

In  the  eyes of the law, there is little they can do  about  it

because the agreement they have entered into is perfectly legal.

Such  purchasers have, therefore, little redress; they  can,  of

course,  withdraw  and have their money back, often  many  years

after  paying the initial deposit, but by that time land  prices

and  prices of properties would have gone up to such  an  extent

that he would feel properly cheated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of the speculative developer, it is clear that he

has no intention of delivering the goods early; what he wants is

to make use of the purchaser's money for as long as possible. He

enters  into a series of land speculations, promising  flats  or

homes  for  one set of purchasers after another,  while  in  the

meantime either acquiring, mortgaging and re-mortgaging whatever

land he has got in the hope of cashing in on rising land values,

or  if  land  values do not rise fast enough,  using  the  money

collected as deposits for other types of business. All  this  is

most unhealthy for the economy of the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of this legislation now before the House is to

give  a  certain  amount  of protection to  the  innocent  house

purchaser  by preventing the excesses of the building developers

and  by bringing all housing developers under the proper control

of Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long term, the other more important purpose of this Bill

is  to  ensure  that  we encourage the establishment  of  proper

housing  developers who will contribute their share  to  the  re-development of the City of Singapore. As you know, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  we  are  now going in a big way into the problems  of  the

large scale re-development of our City. The Government does  not

intend  to  do, and cannot do, all the re-development  but  will

welcome  private  participation. In fact, it is  the  considered

view  of  the  Government that every effort should  be  made  to

ensure  that  the greater part, if not all of the re-development

of  our  City, should be done by private enterprise.  The  State

will  only  ensure  that the conditions  of  urban  renewal  are

congenial  for private participation. It will acquire the  land,

do  away with fragmented ownership, provide for the resettlement

of  existing  tenants,  rehousing them in new  housing  estates,

replan the area on a comprehensive basis and make available

sizeable  plots to private enterprises to develop in accordance with

a pre-planned pattern.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that this can come about, there must exist in the

State sufficient development organisation and institutions  with

the  proper financial backing and managerial experience to  make

serious large-scale capital investments. There will not  be  any

place  for unscrupulous speculators and opportunists. Hence  the

need  now  to weed out such opportunists in order to foster  the

healthy   growth   of   sound  development  organisations.   The

experience gained in developing houses for sale will go  a  long

way  towards  training  these developers in  the  techniques  of

development for long term investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before the House will seek to enforce control over

the  operations  of  building  developers.  It  lays  down  that

developers, whether a company or individual or partnership,  can

only  operate  with sufficient capital under a licence.  In  the

case  of  a company, it must have a paid up capital of not  less

than $500,000, and in the case of a partnership or individual, a

deposit of $100,000 will have to be made with the Controller.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Controller to be appointed under the Bill will be vested

with  wide  powers. He may, at any time after  the  grant  of  a

licence, vary or revoke any conditions of the licence or  impose

conditions  or additional conditions on the licence.  There  is,

however,  a  provision for appeal to the Minister  in  any  case

where  the  developer  is dissatisfied  by  the  action  of  the

Controller. The use of the words "Housing Developers"  will  now

be  regulated,  and  no one can now carry  on  the  business  of

housing development without a licence. Stringent control will be

applied  on  housing  developers  and  every  licensee  will  be

required  to  exhibit in his office a copy of his  last  audited

balance  sheet and the full names and particulars of all persons

who are in control and management' of the business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housing developer will be required to appoint an auditor to

make  a  report upon his annual balance sheet and accounts,  and

the  Controller  is  furthermore empowered  to  investigate  the

books,  accounts  and  transactions of  the  developer,  or  the

Minister may order the Controller or an Inspector to investigate

into   the  affairs  of  a  licensed  housing  developer.  Where

purchasers   are  dissatisfied,  the  Minister  can   order   an

investigation  into the affairs of a licensed housing  developer

if an application is made by not less than five purchasers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain circumstances, such as a housing developer being

unable  to meet his obligations, or if he conducts his  business

in  a manner detrimental to the purchasers or the public, or  if

he  informs  the  Controller that  he  is  unable  to  meet  his

obligations,  the  Minister may direct a  company  or  board  to

assume control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will empower the Minister to make rules for the

purposes  of  the  Ordinance in such matters as  regulating  the

advertisements  of the housing developer, the use  of  names  of

housing  estates,  the  payments and  deposits  to  be  made  by

purchasers  at various stages of construction of the house,  the

forms of contracts to be used by the housing developer, and  the

conditions in the contract which, if used, will be void.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a prohibition in the Bill to prevent a person, who

becomes bankrupt, or suspends his payments or compounds with his

creditors,  or  if he is convicted of an offence  involving  dishonesty or fraud, from being a director, manager or secretary of

a licensed housing developer company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister will be empowered to exempt any person, group of

persons, society, company or statutory board from the provisions

of the Ordinance. There are also transitional provisions for the

licensing of housing developers who were in business before  1st

November, 1964, and who may not be in a position to comply fully

with  the requirements of the Bill. In such circumstances,  when

the  Bill  becomes law, they may be granted provisional  licence

with or without conditions, for a period which may extend up  to

five years, and which may be revoked at any time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drafting this legislation, careful consideration has been

given  to  all  the complaints that have been  received  in  the

Ministry  as well as those made in the Press. I would also  wish

to  thank  the  Bar  Committee for making  suggestions  for  the

formulation  of  the  principles of this  Bill.  They  submitted

written views and suggestions to the State Advocate-General  and

to  my Ministry, and the State Advocate-General's Office in  pre

paring this Bill have given careful consideration to their views

and suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I rise to speak in support of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purchasers of houses have for a long time been at the mercy of

unscrupulous men whose sole aim has been to make quick money  at

the  expense of would-be purchasers. There are, of course,  many

decent  business  men  who develop housing  estates,  and  their

service to society is acknowledged as an effective corollary  to

the Government's policy of providing decent living standards for

the people. Over the past few years,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



the Government has concentrated on building flats for the people

in  the lower income group because this is the group that really

needs  Government assistance. This has left people in the middle

and  upper  income groups to look to private housing  developers

for  houses.  Once a man's combined family income  is  up  to  a

maximum  of  $800  per month, it is left to himself  to  find  a

house.  But  this  does not mean that he must  be  left  to  the

wolves.  Many  of these people, especially in the middle  income

group,  are  ordinary working people who dream of  purchasing  a

house. They sweat and toil to save enough money at least for the

initial  deposit  for a house, foregoing many  of  the  ordinary

pleasures  of  life.  When  they are exploited  by  unscrupulous

developers, their dream of a house of their own is shattered and

the attendant hardships are of some magnitude.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not allow racketeers disguised in the name of housing

developers  to  rob  the fruits of prosperity  of  our  society.

Prosperity must be shared. So is the wealth of our country.  The

common  man has every right to expect a decent house of his  own

and  to  lead  a  decent life. We must not allow  racketeers  to

frustrate  his  hopes. And if racketeers make  false  plans  and

promises  to rob them of their hard-earned savings,  it  is  the

duty of the Government to suppress these racketeers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few racketeers in the housing business are nothing more

than  harmful parasites who live on the sufferings  of  innocent

people. They have probably no land, no concrete plans, and  even

no  business  capital. Newspaper advertisements  and  flamboyant

brochures  and  pamphlets are published to  lure  deposits  from

innocent  buyers. The deposits so made constitute their  working

capital with which they purchase land, not with the intention of

building  houses  thereon  immediately,  but  with  an  eye   to

speculative profit. They wait for some time until the  price  of

land increases and then notify the people who have booked houses

that in the light of the increased price of land,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



an  increased price over that originally agreed must be paid for

the house, and in some cases they even return the deposit, after

having  made  money  out of the accumulated deposits,  with  the

trite excuse that the booking has been cancelled. In some cases,

a  transfer fee in addition to the deposit is demanded and  when

the  frustrated buyer finally demands back the deposit, he  gets

it,  but not the transfer fee. If the buyer, on the other  hand,

had deposited the money in a bank he would have earned interest,

but when caught in the web of these racketeers he not only loses

his transfer fee but the interest that he would have earned. The

racketeer  has  always the upper hand - he  tosses  the  coin  and

confidently  expects to call always "Heads,  I  win,  tails  you

lose."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the shrewder ones, however, give an appearance of

legitimacy. They make the price attractively low to lure buyers,

but  what  the  unsuspecting buyer does not  know  is  that  the

developer  has  deliberately excluded from the price  he  quotes

very  important  items such as septic tank,  electrical  cables,

etc.  When the house nears completion, and the buyer is  already

firmly  committed, the developer confronts the buyer for  a  few

thousand  dollars more for the laying of cables or  installation

of  a septic tank, and so on. What can the buyer do but pay  the

additional  amount  demanded, for he  cannot  live  in  a  house

without  basic necessities like lighting and modern  sanitation?

It  is sad to say that today there are already some house buyers

who  are in a very ridiculous and pitiful position; living in  a

modern house without modern sanitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know of developers who, in the final stages of

building,  suddenly tell the buyers that they have to  pay  more

than  the agreed price on the pretext that prices have generally

increased.  In a few instances, resolute buyers have  joined  to

resist such developers with some measure of success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now cite cases of housing companies which have caused

hardship to house-buyers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first case I would like to cite is that involving the

Jurong  Park  Limited at No. 38 Jurong Road,  8¼  milestone.  In

1962,  this  company published advertisements in the  newspapers

announcing  its  proposed housing estate.  These  advertisements

attracted  many  school  headmasters  and  teachers  in  Chinese

schools  in  the Jurong area because it presented them  with  an

excellent  opportunity to obtain adequate housing  accommodation

close  to  their place of work. Many of them booked houses,  but

more  than  2½ years have elapsed since then, and the estate  is

not  even in its first phase of building programme. I also  know

of  one  particular person, a friend of mine, who  had  dealings

with  this same company. He was so eager to get a house in  this

estate  that he paid $2,500 to the company as a transfer fee  to

book  one  and, in addition, he paid $1,000 as initial  deposit.

His  hopes, however, were doomed to despair for, when  6  months

later  he  visited the site, he found to his consternation  that

the  site remained nothing more than the original wasteland that

it was. There was no sign of building, not even a bulldozer or a

building contractor's temporary office. He, therefore, wrote  to

the company asking when the house would be complete. The company

returned  him  the deposit of $1,000 he had paid, informing  him

that  his booking had been cancelled and that he would  have  to

look  for a house elsewhere. The same letter also threatened  to

take  legal action against him for sending copies of his  letter

to  the  Government. There was no mention of the $2,500  he  had

paid  as a transfer fee to book the house; it would appear  that

this amount had vanished, not into thin air as would commonly be

said, but, I am sure, into the pockets of someone in the company

and permanently lost to the person who paid

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second case involves the Singapore Trading Company,

Limited,  of  Nos.  4 and 4-1 Collyer Quay,  which  has  several

building projects in Singapore. I am mentioning only one housing

estate  in particular, namely the Hillview Estate which is  also

in the Jurong area. About the middle of 1961, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  Trading Company, Limited, advertised in  the  Press

about  this estate. They also printed a pamphlet giving  details

of  their  scheme and inviting applications. They  called  it  a

"Save  $5  to  own a house" scheme. In my view, this  is  highly

suspect. However, this is a small point and I do not propose  to

go   further  into  it.  The  pamphlet  asked  people  who  were

interested  in  the  scheme to apply to  the  Singapore  Trading

Company, Limited. But when they did apply and, after several discussions, decided to buy such a house, surprisingly enough  they

were  asked  to sign the usual agreement not with the  Singapore

Trading Company, Limited, but with an entirely different company

called  the  Popular Estates Limited. Though I am  not  familiar

with  this  sort of thing, it appears odd to me  that  one  firm

should offer houses for sale and another firm should be a  party

to  the  agreement. It would seem to me that this is a  ruse  to

outwit  the  purchasers  because the company  that  offered  the

houses  for  sale cannot be held responsible if the houses  were

not  built  according to the original specifications printed  in

the  pamphlet.  This would give the second company,  the  actual

party  to  the  transaction,  an opening  to  sell  houses  very

different from the original specifications, and the buyer  would

have  no  legal  right  of remedy against  either  company.  The

Singapore  Trading  Company, Limited, and  the  Popular  Estates

Limited  are,  however, in the same premises  and  the  Managing

Director  of both these firms is one called Seah Boon Heng.  Mr

Seah very recently made a generous donation to the building fund

of  the  St. John's Ambulance Brigade and thereby obtained  some

publicity  in  the  Press as a philanthropist.  If  the  harvest

reaped by racketeering is transformed into a donation and  makes

the donor a philanthropist, may we be spared in future from such

a travesty!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us come back to the Hillview Estate in Jurong. Three years

have passed but the Hillview Estate is hardly in the first phase

of  building activity. The worried and indignant purchasers have

joined forces and formed an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



association   to   protect  themselves  against  the  unscrupulous

developers. I commend them for the action that they have  taken.

Accordingly,  the  Hillview Estate House  Owners  and  Residents

Association was registered on 15th July, 1964, as a society.  On

1st  of June, 1964, three years after the purchase agreement was

signed and when the Association was still in its pro-tem stage,

the  pro-tem  Secretary issued a circular to its  members,  the

contents  of  which will clearly signify their plight.  I  quote

below a few significant paragraphs. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Vendor [that means the Company] in his last letter dated

26th  February, 1964, assured us that the whole project  was  expected to the completed within the next five months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then three good months have passed and there seems to be

no  sign of completion even after the lapse of five months. Work

seems  to be in progress, but only at a very slow unsteady pace,

which  could mean that the target date could be dragged  on  for

another year or so.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was three years after the purchase agreement was signed.

It went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We also note from our inspection of the site that the Car

Porch is not in accordance with the requirements. The drive  way

to  the  Porch  is  at a very bad angle in practically  all  the

houses. We have, therefore, insisted to the vendor that  at  all

costs the drive way must be flat or parallel to the ground.  You

could   undoubtedly   expect   a   further   delay   over   this

representation.  Nevertheless,  we  expect  to  attain  our  aim

patiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A letter dated 28th May, 1964, has been received by all

house-owners  from the vendor recommending that house-owners  consider

to build on their own retaining walls in front, back and side of

our  land,  which  we are aware will cost well over  a  thousand

dollars.  This  extra unnecessary expenditure  could  have  been

avoided had the developer taken greater care while planning  the

site. We have no intention of suffering over-errors committed by

the  developer.  Moreover,  there is  nothing  specific  in  our

agreement to the effect that such expenditure must be  borne  by

house-owners.  Therefore,  the Committee  has  decided  to  seek

further legal advice to put such shortcomings right.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the common plight faced by the house purchasers who fell

into  the merciless grip of these sharks in the building  trade.

Strange to say, however, the law is used to tie up the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



purchasers  in  what  is almost always a one-side  agreement  in

which,  unfortunately enough, lawyers play the vital  role,  and

the purchasers are at the receiving end. The law, of course,  is

an  honourable profession and it is most unfortunate that in the

name of the law dishonourable documents are drawn up to fix  the

innocent buyers. Because the legal requirements are met in these

documents,   it  is  almost  impossible  to  bring  unscrupulous

developers  to court if they failed to fulfil their obligations.

The  documents  are framed in such a way that the  developer  is

completely  free to change specifications, raise the  price  and

use any material he likes, and it is more than likely that these

would  be  inferior ones. There are possibly other ramifications

in  this  type  of  racketeering but, because  I  have  not  got

sufficient information on them, I do not propose to go into them

now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of legislation to curb and control housing

developers  and  to  protect home buyers, a fertile  field  will

exist for avaricious developers. Like vicious man-eating sharks,

they  always hunt for their prey. The Government has, therefore,

a duty to protect society from them. A firm line has to be drawn

between legitimate business and bubble. The bubble must  not  be

allowed  to  form and if already formed we must  take  steps  to

ensure  that  the public is protected before the bubble  bursts.

Legitimate  business  serves  a  useful  purpose  in   that   it

contributes  to economic and social development but the  bubble,

on  the other hand, lives on the sufferings of the people and is

therefore absolutely anti-social.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other instances and I hope members of the

public,  especially  the purchasers, who are  victims  of  these

building  sharks, will come forward to give information  to  the

Government  and  the  Controller  to  be  appointed  under  this

Ordinance,  so  that remedial action can be taken against  these

sharks in the building trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is these sharks that have spoilt the good name of the

building trade, and it is these sharks that the Government seeks

to control and suppress.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I personally have no special love or hatred for these

housing  developers. I never had any occasion  to  buy  a  house

myself. However, as a representative of the common people, it is

my  duty to voice their protest and indignation against such  an

evil force in our society and if I cannot do this safely ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hear disturbances in the House which must

safely outside the House without being involved in expensive law

suits, then I must do it in this House under its privilege which

is meant for such purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is also interested in seeing that genuine

developers will not be seriously affected by this law. We  have,

therefore,  decided  to commit this Bill to a  Select  Committee

after  its  Second Reading in order to hear views  from  various

quarters. We hope that this Bill, after introduction, will  help

to regularise and strengthen the building trade in Singapore.

seem  to  have increased in numbers. As the development  of  the

City  proceeds with increasing tempo, it is necessary  to  bring

this  problem  under firm and effective control  if  our  health

standards  are not to deteriorate. The fact that there  is  less

and  less  land  for  cattle  grazing  in  the  State  must   be

recognised,  and  where  cattle grazing could  once  take  place

without  serious  consequences, this is no  longer  possible  in

Singapore today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cattle also present a problem in that they damage private

and public property and tend to pollute water courses, drop dung

on  public  streets and other public places; and, in short,  con

stitute  a  serious  health  menace.  Cowdung  constitutes   an

excellent source of breeding for flies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the control of different aspects of cattle was

covered  by  three  different authorities. Firstly,  the  Health

Department was concerned only with the control of cattle insofar

as  the licensing of cattle sheds and the sale of milk and  milk

products was concerned. Secondly, the Police were concerned with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



stray  cattle  under the Minor Offences Ordinance. Thirdly,  the

Primary  Production  Department have  been  concerned  with  the

animal husbandry aspects of cattle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is principally to control cattle

within  the  State, including stray cattle, for the preservation

of  public health. The Police are too preoccupied and  have  not

been  able  to  deal with stray cattle which  anyhow  present  a

health  problem also. This will be done by total prohibition  of

cattle in certain areas which may be declared by the Minister as

restricted  areas. In such restricted areas, no  cattle  of  the

category described in the Minister's order may be kept  at  all;

if  found, such cattle will be liable to seizure and disposal by

the  Health  Authorities without compensation.  In  other  areas

which are not declared as restricted areas for cattle within the

State,  the  keeping of cattle will be permitted  under  licence

issued  by the Director of Medical Services. Here too,  this  is

subject to the proviso that such cattle shall be confined to the

licensed  place  specified  in the  licence  and  shall  not  be

permitted  outside such licensed place except  upon  penalty  of

seizure  and  disposal  without  compensation.  The  Bill   also

provides  for  the necessary powers to control the movement  and

transport of cattle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for penalties for owners of cattle or those

in charge of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



the cattle for non-compliance of the provisions of this Bill  or

Regulations thereunder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is in the phase of rapid development and is becoming

a  complex  urban  development. In this  situation,  it  is  not

possible to allow cattle within its developed and built-up area.

They  present a serious health problem (besides other  problems)

and  the measures sought in the Bill are for an effective  means

of controlling the cattle for the preservation of public health.
