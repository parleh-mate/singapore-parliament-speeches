<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr N. Govindasamy</b> asked the Minister for

Education (a) how many teachers have attended  in-service training courses, which will qualify  them

for   incremental  credits,  up  to   the   latest

convenient  date;  (b)  what  is  the   basis   of

than  one  such course; (d) how many teachers  who

had  undergone  in-service training  courses  have

been  utilised in the Education Service;  and  (e)

whether he will consider increasing the number  of

in-service   training  courses  to   enable   more

teachers to take advantage of such courses.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the first in-service

course  earning incremental credits was  conducted

in  1964, to date 1,873 teachers have attended in-service  training courses which qualify  them  for

incremental credits.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who apply for participation in

incremental benefit courses are selected by a duly

constituted  selection board on the basis  of  (a)

aptitude; (b) qualifications; (c) relevance to the

present teaching; and (d) recommendation from  the

principal of the school. Other things being equal,

those   who  have  not  had  the  opportunity   of

attending  any in-service courses are  given  more

consideration.   The  only   exception   to   this

procedure is the course on the teaching of English

as   a  second  language.  All  teachers  who  are

teaching this subject are required to attend  this

course in batches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the third part of the question, Sir, 17

teachers  have attended more than one such  course

earning incremental credits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the fourth part of the question, Sir,

teachers who had undergone in-service courses have

been assigned to teaching subjects related to  the

training which they have received.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the last part of the question, Sir, since

the  aim  is  to improve the quality of  teachers,

more   in-service  courses  will   be   organised.

However,  with a view to economising on  recurrent

expenditure  and, at the same time,  to  providing

some  kind of incentive, my Ministry has  proposed

to  the  Ministry  of Finance a  bonus  scheme  to

replace  the  present incremental  credit  scheme.

Several non-incremental benefit in-service courses

have   been  conducted  for  teachers  in  various

subjects.  Every teacher who takes  pride  in  his

teaching  and  wants  to  bring  up  to  date  his

knowledge  of the content and technique  will,  of

his  own  interest, volunteer  to  enrol  in  such

courses. The desire to achieve fulfilment in their

chosen  profession should be the best and ultimate

motivation.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, my supplementary question is also in parts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, can the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister  for  Education explain why  17  teachers

have taken more than one such in-service course?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned

that,   as   far  as  possible,  those  who   took

additional  courses teach the  subjects  in  which

they have been trained. Can he categorically state

that  these teachers teach the subjects  in  which

they have been trained?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, in what form is the bonus scheme going to

replace the incremental credit scheme?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the reason why 17 teachers have

done  more than one such course is that they  find

that  they are subject teachers for more than  one

subject  and  it is in their own interest  to  up-grade themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are cases of drop-out of teachers who have

undertaken  in-service courses  and  who  are  not

utilised  for teaching the subjects in which  they

have   been   trained.  In   such   cases,   their

incremental credits have been withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the last part of the supplementary question

regarding  the bonus scheme which my Ministry  has

proposed, the details are being worked out  and  a

final  decision on the matter has  not  been  made

yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Parliamentary Secretary

to the Minister for Education say why it is at all

necessary to offer bonus incentives to teachers to

come  forward  for courses when large  numbers  of

them  have  come forward for such courses  without

having such incentives?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are certain subjects

which  are not "hot favourites" with the teachers.

As  a  result, certain incentives and bonuses have

to be provided.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, is the Parliamentary Secretary saying that

only  subjects  that are "hot favourites"  attract

teachers to attend these in-service courses?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, I would appreciate it if the Member for

Telok Blangah could repeat his question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Govindasamy, can you rephrase your question,

please?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary says that we

have  to  offer incentives to attract teachers  to

attend the special courses in subjects that do not

appeal  to them. Does he mean that it is only  the

bonus  which attracts the teachers to attend these

courses?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> It appears to be so in certain subjects like

English as a second language.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr N. Govindasamy</b> asked the Minister for

Education  whether he is aware of any brain  drain

from  the  Republic as a result of  persons  going

abroad   for   further  education  or  specialised

training  and  failing to return to  Singapore  on

completion  of  their  courses;  and  if  he  will

consider  taking  steps  to  minimise  this  brain

drain.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the problem of a brain drain

from  the Republic has not been seriously  studied

because  it  is not regarded as a serious  one  at

present, particularly in regard to scientists  and

technologists going to other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons going abroad for further education or

specialised   training   are   either   government

scholars   or  private  students.  For  government

scholars  in  respect of whom proper  records  are

maintained,  the  percentage who  have  failed  to

return to Singapore in the past on completion of a

course is insignificant. For private students,  no

specific  records are maintained. But  the  number

who  choose not to return has not been noticeable.

This is perhaps because the number is small.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate measures will be taken to minimise

the  brain  drain  from the  Republic  should  the

problem become serious.

<br><br><!-- Mr Phua Bah Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications (Mr Phua Bah Lee) (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Punggol may

recall  that  in  July  1968,  the  Minister   for

Communications  announced in  Parliament  that  he

would  establish  a  Transport Advisory  Board  to

study ways and means to improve the present public

transport service in Singapore. This Board was, in

fact,  set  up the following month and  has  since

been holding regular monthly meetings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board submitted its first interim report to

the   Minister   in   February   this   year   and

Government's  acceptance of most  of  the  Board's

recommendations was announced in his speech at the

opening    ceremony   of   the    Transport    and

Communications Exposition on 1st August. The  most

important  recommendation,  being  the  compulsory

wearing   of  crash  helmets  by  motor  cyclists,

scooterists  and  their pillion-riders,  is  being

implemented in stages as from November 1969.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is currently studying the problem of

uniform legislation for bus companies in Singapore

and  also the possible re-routing of existing  bus

routes  so as to provide more efficient and direct

services  for commuters from their homes to  their

places of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for long-term solutions of our transport

problems,  this  needs  the  attention  of  better

qualified  professional experts and planners.  Two

senior  officials from the London Transport  Board

have  already  submitted "a preliminary  study  of

possible  new  measures  to  improve  and   expand

Singapore's  mass  transport  facilities",   which

report  is  being  examined by officials  from  my

Ministry and those from the Ministries of National



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



Development and Finance. Furthermore,  a  team  of

United Nations advisers attached to our State  and

City  Planning Office have in the past  two  years

been  studying and assessing Singapore's long-term

needs  in  public transport, including  the  long-range  aspects of providing a mass transit  system

for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the existence of the Transport

Advisory Board to find short-term solutions to our

transport  problems  and the  assistance  of  U.N.

experts  now  attached  to  the  State  and   City

Planning Office to examine our long-term needs  in

public  transport and to recommend ways and  means

to  meet  them, I do not think there is a need  to

set  up yet another committee for the purpose,  as

indicated by the Member for Punggol.

at   the  Paya  Lebar  International  Airport  are

sufficient  to cope with the anticipated  increase

are any plans to meet the anticipated increase  in

Jumbo Jets.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phua Bah Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phua Bah Lee (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the present facilities at our

Paya  Lebar International Airport were planned  to

meet  the  requirements of present generation  jet

aircraft such as the Boeing 707, Douglas DC 8  and

VC  10. To cope with the newer and larger types of

aircraft  such  as the Boeing 747 jumbo  jets  and

supersonic  aircraft like the TU 144  or  Concorde

which are expected to be in commercial service  in

the late 1970s, a firm of aviation consultants  in

the  United  Kingdom was appointed  to  prepare  a

master plan for the development of our Airport for

the next two decades, i.e., up to the period 1990.

This   firm   of   consultants,   Scott,   Wilson,

Kirkpatrick  & Partners, commenced work  in  March

1968 and its report was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



submitted to Government in May this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consultants' recommendations have been

studied  and,  so  far, only the  first  phase  of

development for immediate improvements to existing

facilities,  e.g., alterations and  extensions  to

the present terminal building, improvement to taxiways and extension of the jet apron, to cater  for

traffic  up  till 1976, has been approved  and  is

estimated to cost over $7 million. This does  not,

however,  include projects which  have  just  been

completed, namely, the extension and strengthening

of  the runway from 9,000 feet to 11,000 feet  and

the commissioning of the Instrument Landing System

amounting to over $5 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the medium- and long-term recommendations for

further  development  of the Airport  may  involve

capital  expenditure to the  order  of  over  $600

million  and advances in technology may result  in

certain   proposals   becoming   obsolete,   these

proposals  will  have  to  be  reviewed   at   the

appropriate  time  by  the  Treasury,   prior   to

implementation, if found necessary.

part  is  concerned with the attaching of a  full-time  medical  officer  to the  Industrial  Health

Unit.  The  Ministry of Health  is  aware  of  the

limitations  of the Ad Hoc Industrial Health  Unit

which  was  set up in October 1967 with a  limited

staff  consisting of a part-time medical  officer,

an inspector of factories and a few office staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the visit of an expert on occupational

health  from the International Labour Organisation

in  1967-68, recommendations were put  forward  to

expand the Ad Hoc Industrial Health Unit in  terms

of  staff  and activities. My Ministry  recognises

the  need to establish a more effective Industrial

Health Unit to promote industrial health which  is

incumbent upon our rapid industrial growth. A plan

to  expand the industrial Health Unit in terms  of

staff  and activities is already in hand.  In  the

provision for more staff, it is envisaged  that  a

full-time   medical  officer  and  an   industrial

hygienist  with  an  engineering  background,   in

addition  to  eight  other professional  and  non-professional staff, would be included.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I come now to the second part

of  the  question which is regarding the expanding

of   the   Unit  and  increasing  its   functional

activities.  Consequent upon the increase  in  the

high-level staff of this Unit, it is our intention

that  the  scope of the work of the Unit  will  be

expanded to include the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to assess the occupational health problems in

Singapore  by selected examinations and evaluation

of the working environment of our workers;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to study and draw up preventive measures

appropriate to local conditions;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) to formulate procedures for periodical

medical  examinations  as a control  on  hazardous

occupational groups;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) to undertake factory inspection of working

relevant  sections of the Factories Ordinance  and

related  occupational  legislation,  normally   administered   by  the  Ministry  of  Labour,   with

<br><br><!-- Mr Phua Bah Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications (Mr Phua Bah Lee) (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the formation of the Light Dues Board

in   1957,  Government  was  responsible  for  the

provision  and  maintenance  of  lighthouses   and

navigational  aids. Ships using the port  did  not

pay  any  light  dues. During  1956  the  shipping

industry, however, agreed in principle that  light

dues  could  be  levied on shipping in  accordance

with  international practice and that a  statutory

board  should  be  established to  take  over  the

maintenance,   operation   and   improvement    of

navigational  aids.  For this purpose,  the  Light

Dues Ordinance was enacted in 1957 under which the

Light Dues Board was established.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience has shown that the Ordinance does

not provide the necessary powers for the Board  to

carry  out  its  functions  efficiently  and,   in

particular, there are no powers for the  Board  to

invest its surplus funds, to own property,  or  to

provide   for   pension  schemes,  gratuities   or

provident fund benefits for its staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before the House seeks to amend and

consolidate  the existing Ordinance  so  that  the

Board can operate and carry out its functions more

effectively.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 of the Bill provides the Board with

wider  powers so that it may undertake  activities

that   may   be  deemed  necessary  or  expedient,

including  the  acquisition of  property  and  the

provision of additional services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 provides for the transfer of

Government  property to the Board, which  transfer

has   been   approved,  in   principle,   by   the

Government.  These  properties consist  mainly  of

lighthouses, land for same, and other navigational

aids.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clauses 18 and 19 the Board is required to

submit  an  annual report as well  as  an  audited

annual  statement of accounts for presentation  to

Parliament. This requirement is in line  with  the

other statutory boards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also pointed out earlier that there is no

provision in the existing Ordinance for the  Board

to  invest  its surplus funds. The  Board  has  at

present $1.45 million in reserve funds invested in

Treasury  Bills ($1.435 million at cost), although

the  existing Ordinance does not provide for this.

It  is only appropriate that funds not immediately

required    should   be   invested   in   approved

securities, and clause 21 authorises the Board  to

do so accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 22, "native sailing ships" are no

longer  exempted as a class from light dues.  This

class  of ships, although fast dying out, actually

use navigational aids and there are no grounds for

such ships to be exempted. However, exemptions may

be granted if a case is made out for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing Ordinance, light dues may

only be altered by Parliament. The new clause  29,

however, empowers the Minister to alter the  scale

of  light dues, after consultation with the Board.

This  is  in  line  with  the  Port  of  Singapore

Authority Ordinance, 1963.

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Bill is to exclude a finance

company licensed under the Finance Companies  Act,

1967,  from  the  provisions of  the  Moneylenders

Ordinance. It also seeks to stagger the renewal of

moneylenders'  licences throughout  the  year  for

administrative  convenience and provides  for  the

late  stamping  of  a  note,  a  memorandum  or  a

promissory  note  within  seven  days  after   its

execution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present definition of "moneylender" in

the    Moneylenders   Ordinance,   1959,   finance

companies are required to take out a licence under

the  Moneylenders Ordinance. Finance companies are

also  required  to be licensed under  the  Finance

Companies  Act, 1967. In order that  such  finance

companies,  which are licensed under  the  Finance

Companies  Act, are not again licensed  under  the

Moneylenders Ordinance, the Minister in  exercise

of   the  powers  under  section  34  (a)  of  the

Moneylenders   Ordinance  has  granted   qualified

exemptions to such finance companies. Since  there

is  provision in the Moneylenders Ordinance  which

expressly   excludes   pawnbrokers,   co-operative

societies, banks and insurance companies which are

all  governed by their own respective  ordinances,

it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



proposed  to  exclude a finance  company  licensed

under  the Finance Companies Act, 1967,  from  the

provisions of the Moneylenders Ordinance. Clause 2

of the Bill does this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present all moneylenders' licences expire and

hence are required to be renewed at the end of the

year.   There   is   a  total  of   412   licensed

moneylenders and it is administratively convenient

that   the   renewal  of  licences   takes   place

throughout the year instead of at the end  of  the

year.  Clause 3 of the Bill provides for a licence

to  be  valid for a period of 12 months  from  the

date specified therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been pointed out that the Moneylenders

Rules   are  not  in  accordance  with  the  Stamp

Ordinance.  Section  40  of  the  Stamp  Ordinance

requires every instrument chargeable with duty and

executed in the Republic to be stamped before  its

execution.  Rule  12  of the  Moneylenders  Rules,

1959,  on  the  other  hand, provides  that  every

promissory  note shall be presented  for  stamping

within  seven days of its execution.  However,  as

section  46 of the Stamp Ordinance allows stamping

after  the  first execution where it is  expressly

provided under the Stamp Ordinance or in any other

ordinance, it is proposed to amend section  17  of

the  Moneylenders Ordinance to allow for  stamping

of  an  instrument  within seven  days  after  its

execution.  Clause  4  of  the  Bill  removes  the

conflict  between  the  Stamp  Ordinance  and  the

Moneylenders Rules.

<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1969/19691222/19691222-HA-0290217.pdf"">Appendix to Mr Barker's motion on "Department Titles" at column 181(Cols 0217-0232)</a><br>

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the titles or names of offices in

Government  departments are changed from  time  to

time  for various reasons, and the purpose of  the

Departmental Titles (Alteration) Ordinance  is  to

ensure  that where a change has occurred, the  new

title  or name is substituted for the old wherever

the  old  title  appears in any law  or  document.

There  is  a  short provision to  this  effect  in

section  2  of  the  Ordinance which  operates  in

conjunction with the list of old and corresponding

new  titles  contained  in  the  Schedule  to  the

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will appreciate that what the Ordinance

does is not to change the titles of offices but to

make  the  necessary substitution in the laws  and

other  documents after the change has taken place.

The  Ordinance  must, therefore, be  revised  from

time  to time to bring it up to date, and this  is

done in two ways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is by removing from the Schedule to the

Ordinance all the items in which the old title  or

name  of  office no longer appears in any  law  or

document,   these  having  ceased  to   have   any

operation. For instance, one of the items  in  the

Schedule on page 106 of Volume II of the  Laws  of

Singapore, 1955



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



edition,  substitutes "Assistant Commissioner  for

Labour" for "Assistant Controller for Labour".  As

"Assistant  Controller of Labour", the old  title,

no  longer appears in any laws or documents, it is

removed along with a number of other items set out

in  Part I of the Schedule to the motion and which

are no longer required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second way is to add items to the Schedule

to   the   Ordinance   where   there   have   been

departmental changes and the old titles  or  names

are  still  likely to be found in  laws  and  documents.  To  take an example, the office of  "Extra

Assistant  Commissioner for  Labour"  was  changed

last year to "Principal Assistant Commissioner for

Labour",  but the old name still appears  in  some

laws and other documents. The addition of this and

other  items  in  Part II of the Schedule  to  the

motion  will  ensure that wherever a reference  to

one  of the obsolete titles and names occurs,  the

corresponding new title will be substituted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ordinance provides in section 3 that

additions  and amendments to the Schedule  may  be

effected by a resolution at any time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 3 of

the  Departmental  Titles  (Alteration)  Ordinance

(Chapter  55), resolves that the Schedule  to  the

said  Ordinance  be amended by the deletion  under

the  headings of "Old Title or Name of Office" and

"New Title or Name of Office" respectively of  the

items,  shown in Part I of the following Schedule,

and  by  the addition under the headings  of  "Old

Title or Name of Office" and "New Title or Name of

Office", respectively of the items shown  in  Part

II of the said Schedule+.

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before this House seeks to make a

number of minor amendments to various laws and  to

repeal  entirely twenty other laws  in  accordance

with  the  recommendations  of  the  Law  Revision

Commissioners  who  were appointed  to  prepare  a

revised edition of our Acts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of the amendments is to remedy gaps,

remove  inconsistencies and  obsolete  provisions,

and  to  improve the form and arrangement  of  the

statute  laws, but without changing their original

purpose.  The Bill is not intended to  affect  any

existing  rights,  duties or  liabilities  of  any

person or body of persons, public or private.  The

enactment of the amendments will enable them to be

incorporated in the revised edition of our Acts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will observe that the amendments which

appear  in  the  First Schedule to  the  Bill  are

generally of a formal kind and self-explanatory. I

shall  therefore now elucidate the more  important

amendments only as they appear in this Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments are made in section 5 of the

Arbitration Ordinance to conform to the provisions

of  the  Bankruptcy Ordinance; and in section  33,

subsection  (3) is taken out and inserted  in  the

Merchant   Shipping  Ordinance   and   the   other

subsections,  except subsection (6), are  repealed

to   avoid   duplication   with   the   Limitation

Ordinance, 1959.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bankruptcy Ordinance, the provision now in

the    Workmen's   Compensation    Ordinance    is

incorporated  in  section  43  and   an   obsolete

provision



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



removed;  in  keeping  with modern  practice,  the

Official  Assignee's accounts are  to  be  audited

once instead of twice a year under section 77; and

section   109  is  reworded  so  that  the   penal

provisions in Part VII will distinguish between  a

trial court and the Bankruptcy court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Registration of Criminals Ordinance,

offences   under  the  Corrosive   and   Explosive

Substances and Offensive Weapons Ordinance,  1958,

are  added  to  the  list  of  registrable  crimes

because  offences under the law which it replaced,

namely, the Corrosive Substances Ordinance,  1955,

were  registered.  For the same reason,  the  1958

Ordinance  is added to the laws specified  in  the

Third  Schedule  to  the Criminal  Law  (Temporary

Provisions) Ordinance, 1955, which by section  49c

increases the penalties for certain offenders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Revised Edition of the Law (Annual

Supplements)   Ordinance,  1956,  authorises   the

publication  of  annual supplements  to  the  1955

revised   edition  of  Ordinances.   The   present

amendments will enable the Attorney-General to  go

on    issuing   annual   supplements   after   the

publication of the revised edition of  Acts  which

is now being prepared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Women's Charter, 1961, the word "Part" is

defined  so  as  to simplify the  wording  of  the

Ordinance;  the omission of some words in  section

21  is  corrected;  in section 28  the  correction

already made in the 1961 Supplement to the Laws is

confirmed;  the definition of "maintenance  order"

in  section 70, in describing orders made in other

Commonwealth  countries, mentions those  that  are

confirmed  in  Singapore but  omits  reference  to

orders  that are registered in Singapore and  this

is  rectified  so as to conform to the  Reciprocal

Enforcement  of Maintenance Orders Ordinance;  and

in   Part  X  concerning  women  and  girls,  some

obsolete   references  and  verbal  mistakes   are

corrected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments to the Interpretation Act, 1965, will

ensure  that  its provisions cover Malaysian  laws

enforced   in  Singapore,  and  that  section   57

effectively  repeals  the  Delegation  of   Powers

Ordinance, 1956, as was intended.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments to the Evidence Ordinance will correct

mistakes  in  sections 57  and  82  and  remove  a

provision  in  section  118  concerning  bills  of

exchange; there  is now a different provision on the subject

in the Bills of Exchange Ordinance, 1949, which is

a  complete  code for bills of exchange,  and  the

amendment will allow the latter to operate in  its

entirety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Criminal Procedure Code, section 18 is

amended  to  give District Judges jurisdiction  in

all  extradition cases, not just those  concerning

Commonwealth countries; a correction  is  made  to

section  310, and section 442 is amended  so  that

affidavits  may  be  sworn  before  Singapore  and

Malaysian   consuls  and  vice-consuls;   and   an

additional form of charge is inserted in  Schedule B.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laws to be repealed by clause 3 and the

Second  Schedule to the Bill have, for one  reason

or another, ceased to have any useful operation or

purpose. The Bill is intended only to remove these

laws  from the statute book and not to affect  the

operation of any other laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Customs (Exemption and Remission of Charges)

Act, 1965, which was enacted whilst Singapore  was

in  Malaysia, is unnecessary because  the  Customs

authorities have adequate powers of exemption  and

remission  under the Customs Ordinance, 1960.  The

turnover  tax  which  was  provided  for  by   the

Turnover  Tax Act, 1965, has never been levied  in

Singapore and its repeal is made retrospective  to

the date of Singapore's separation from Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 46 of the existing Housing and

Development Ordinance, one management corporation

has to be established by the owners in each and

every building of Housing Board flats. In

practice, it has been found that more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



than one building can be satisfactorily managed by

one management corporation. For reasons of economy

and administrative efficiency, it is desirable  to

amend section 46 to make it possible for more than

one  block  of  buildings to  be  managed  by  one

corporation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity is also taken to amend subsection (5)

of the same section to remove any doubts as to who

should  be  the authority to set up  a  management

corporation.  Under  this amendment  a  management

corporation  will  not  be constituted  until  the

Minister makes an order so constituting it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment made is in respect of the

period  of  appointment of members  to  the  Board

under   section  6.  Under  this  amendment,   the

Minister  may appoint a member to hold office  for

any period not exceeding three years instead of  a

fixed  period  of  three  years  and  no  less  at

present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the people of Singapore,

especially  those  from  the  low  income   group,

welcome most heartily the policy of the Government

to   facilitate  the  purchase  of   Housing   and

Development Board flats through the utilisation of

their Central Provident Fund savings. As a result,

more  and  more  people have become houseownership

conscious  and  are able to give effect  to  their

desire   to   become  homeowners.   Homeownership,

however,   has   given  rise  to  some   attendant

problems. The maintenance of the blocks  of  flats

purchased  by the tenants, for instance,  will  in

due  course  be entrusted to various  co-operative

schemes   operated  by  and  for  the   respective

homeowners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at present the maintenance and servicing of

Housing and Development Board flats are undertaken

by the Board which employs large numbers of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



workers  for such purpose. The sale of  the  flats

under  the  homeownership scheme and the formation

of  management  corporations  to  take  charge  of

maintenance, servicing, etc., have resulted in the

fragmentation of estates in so far  as  the  Board

employees  who are responsible for the maintenance

and  servicing of the flats are concerned. We  are

all  aware  of  the problems of the rubber  estate

workers  similarly  affected by  fragmentation  of

estates in the neighbouring countries. I am afraid

our workers in the Housing and Development Board

are  going to face the same problems as the result

of  the parcelling out of our housing estates  for

the purpose of maintenance and servicing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment Bill, while it still embodies the

principle  that the privilege of homeownership  is

associated  with  the  responsibility  of   taking

charge of the maintenance and servicing facilities

through  the  management corporations by  widening

the  basis for such management corporations, helps

to   minimise  the  undesirable  effect   of   the

fragmentation  of maintenance services.  In  other

words,   it  prevents  mushrooming  of  management

corporations  in any one housing  estate  and,  as

such, I welcome

it.  However, I would like to ask the Minister  if

he  can assure the House that, as a result of  the

formation  of  such  management corporations,  the

employees in the Housing and Development Board who

are  at  the moment maintaining and servicing  the

Board  flats will not become redundant or,  alternatively,  would it be possible for the  Board  to

continue  providing maintenance and  other  allied

services  in the blocks of flats which  have  been

sold  to  the  public by charging  the  homeowners

economic rates for the services so provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In raising this point, I have also in mind the

possibility  that gangsters and other  anti-social

elements may attempt to muscle and cash in on  the

situation. We are all aware of the racket of swill-collection  in  the  housing  estates  until   the

Housing  and  Development  Board  completely  took

charge. Similarly, it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



has  been reported in the press how residents  and

owners  in private housing estates have been  held

to  ransom  by contractors who charge extortionate

rates  for  whatever services they  perform  since

other  contractors are kept out of the  respective

estates through fear of the gangster.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Govindasamy, I think the rules of

relevance are being stretched to the utmost limit.

Can   you  please  confine  your  remarks  to  the

contents of the Bill?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I will try. These management corporations

are  mainly  formed for the purpose of maintaining

and servicing flats. I would like the Minister  to

assure  us  that, as a result of the formation  of

management   corporations,   no   Housing    Board

employees  will be made redundant. Also,  I  would

like  to  know whether the Housing and Development

Board  will  be  in  a  position  to  provide  the

servicing that they are doing now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The answer to the Member for Telok Blangah is

"Yes".  There will be no redundancy.  The  Housing

Board  has built about 110,000 units of  flats  in

Singapore  of which about 22,000 have  been  sold.

This  is  just one-fifth of the total number,  and

whatever   happens  to  these  flats   and   their

management corporations, surely the Housing  Board

will  need  all  its employees to look  after  the

balance of the 80 per cent. It is rather difficult

to    follow   the   Member's   arguments    about

fragmentation   of   estates   in    Malaya    and

fragmentation of flats in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill now before this House seeks to

amend the Extradition Act, 1968, principally  with

a  view to bringing sections 21 and 31 of the  Act

in  line with the corresponding provisions in  the

extradition legislation of most other Commonwealth

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing provisions of our Act, a

fugitive   offender  who  has  been  returned   to

Singapore  for an offence committed prior  to  his

return  may be tried not only for the offence  for

which  he  was returned but for any other  offence

based  on  proof of the same facts of the  offence

for  which  he  was  returned; whereas  under  the

"speciality  rule" of extradition  legislation  in

most  other  Commonwealth countries including  the

United Kingdom, such a fugitive can only be  tried

for  any lesser offence based on proof of the same

facts.  Where,  for  example, the  United  Kingdom

Government  accedes to a request of the  Singapore

Government  to  return a fugitive accused  of  the

murder  of a child that he had kidnapped, the  use

of  the words "any other offence" under section 31

of our Act as at present drafted would enable that

person  to be convicted of kidnapping with  intent

to  murder  which under our law carries  the  same

penalty as murder - the offence for which  he  was

returned. The offence of kidnapping with intent to

murder is not therefore "a lesser offence" to that

of murder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless, therefore, the existing provisions in our

Act  are  amended  as proposed in  the  Bill,  the

Singapore Government would be obliged to give



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



an  undertaking to the Government  of  the  United

Kingdom  every  time  it seeks  the  return  of  a

fugitive  offender that he will only be tried  for

the offence for which he was returned, or a lesser

offence  based  on proof of the same  facts.  This

would  lead to unnecessary inconvenience and delay

in  the  rendition of a fugitive.  The  amendments

proposed in clauses 4 and 6 of the Bill will  thus

obviate   the   necessity  of   giving   such   an

undertaking  every time we seek the  return  of  a

fugitive offender from the United Kingdom  or  any

other  Commonwealth country which has adopted  the

"speciality rule".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity has also been taken in this Bill to

make  a  drafting amendment to the  definition  of

"extradition  crime"  in  relation   both   to   a

Commonwealth country and to a foreign  state,  and

also  to  make it clear that a District Judge  has

all   the  powers  that  are  conferred   upon   a

Magistrate  under the Extradition Act. Though  the

latter situation is to a great extent provided for

by  section 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code,  it

is  desirable  that specific provision  should  be

made  in our Act if for no other reason than  that

this  Act  is  intended to deal in a comprehensive

manner  with  all matters concerning  extradition.

This  amendment appears in clause 2  which  amends

section 4 of the Act.

are drafting amendments.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid expansion of industries and the

construction  of  more and more,  and  higher  and

higher  buildings  in the Republic  has  placed  a

greater burden of responsibility on our practising

engineers.  Unlike law, medicine  or  accountancy,

the practice of engineering is not governed by any

substantial  written  law,  and  the  800  or   so

practising  engineers can only be  registered,  if

they so desire, as practising architects. With the

need  today  for  more  sophisticated  engineering

projects, the Government feels the time  has  come

to  legislate for the compulsory registration  and

control of practising engineers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to provide, inter alia, for the

establishment  of a Professional  Engineers  Board

which will be responsible for the registration  of

all  practising engineers. The Board will regulate

the  practice and will hear and determine disputes

relating to their profession, and it will have the

power to cancel the registration of a professional

engineer, or suspend him for as long as it  thinks

fit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision has been made to empower the Board in

the  event  of any prima facie defect in  work  or

prima  facie  negligence to suspend  forthwith  the

engineer  responsible from further performance  of

his  profession  for  a  period  of  time  pending

further  investigation and the final  decision  of

the Board. This provision is strict but considered

to  be  necessary in order to safeguard  life  and

property  and  to  maintain  a  high  standard  of

performance by professional engineers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All persons who possess the necessary

qualifications  may apply for registration.  There

is no restriction on the applicant's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



citizenship. Unregistered persons will, of course,

be  prohibited  from  practising  as  professional

engineers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the passage of this Bill, the existing

Architects  Ordinance will be amended and  brought

up  to  date  to  fall in line with  some  of  the

provisions  herein.  This  Bill,  though  it  says

"Third   Reading  immediately  after  the   Second

Reading"  on  the  Order Paper, will  be  sent  to

Select Committee where further representations  of

the profession and those of the public can be made

and will be given every consideration.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when this Bill was introduced in this House,

I  emphasised the fact that the proposed abolition

of the jury had not been conceived impulsively but

that Government had given considerable thought  to

this  Bill  and  could not ignore  experiences  in

recent  trials  by jury. I would not  hesitate  to

reiterate  that rather than allow  justice  to  be

thwarted,   through   either   squeamishness    or

ignorance,   Government   is   prepared   whenever

necessary  for the well-being of the community  to

amend the procedural methods of administering  the

law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opponents to the Bill had asked whether we had

any  positive  evidence that the jury  system  had

failed. Because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



of  these objections, this Bill was sent to Select

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many written representations were received by the

Committee,  of  which 11 were  accepted  as  being

relevant,  and these are annexed to the Report  as

Appendix  II.  Most of these representations  were

from  advocates and solicitors and one from  their

Council.  Oral  evidence  was  heard  from   seven

members  of one jury and three members of  another

jury, who sat in two trials for murder held in the

few  weeks  since the Second Reading of the  Bill.

The  Deputy Registrar of the High Court also  gave

evidence.  Six representatives of the  Council  of

the  Singapore  Advocates and  Solicitors  Society

were heard and given the opportunity to listen  to

a  recorded  tape  of the evidence  given  by  the

jurors.  They  were also given the opportunity  to

examine these jurors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence heard by the Select Committee

strengthened and confirmed Government's view  that

trial by jury in capital cases should be abolished

altogether.  In  one  case it  appeared  that  the

foreman  of  the jury had innocently  delivered  a

mistaken  verdict. Three members of the  jury  had

voted  for murder, and four for culpable  homicide

not  amounting  to murder. Such a  verdict  would,

under  our law, result in a retrial. Instead,  the

verdict delivered was an unanimous verdict for the

lesser  offence. When the foreman  returned  home,

his  conscience  pricked him and  subsequently  he

informed  the Deputy Registrar of the  High  Court

about  the mistake. But nothing could be  done  to

rectify  the  mistake  as  the  jury  was  functus

officio.  In  the second case after  an  unanimous

verdict for murder had been delivered, one of  the

jurors  was very upset when the sentence of  death

was  passed. He was under the impression that  the

accused would at the most be given a sentence  for

life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nearly all the ten jurors said that they

were  reluctant to serve on juries and would  have

been  happier  had they not been  called.  It  was

apparent   that   a  few  did  not   have   enough

understanding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



of  the English language to follow the proceedings

in court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Bar Council, after having heard

the  evidence  and having examined some  of  these

jurors,  submitted a further note on this Bill  to

the Attorney-General, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In July of this year when the Council's original

Memorandum  to the Select Committee was submitted,

there  was no positive evidence available  to  the

Council  apart  from  the statistics  showing  the

relative  number  of  convictions  and  acquittals

which  would give any reliable information  as  to

the precise detailed working of the Jury System as

it  is  at present administered in Singapore.  The

reason  for  this  was no doubt  the  longstanding

tradition  that  what happens  behind  the  closed

doors of a Jury Room after the Jury has retired is

never  disclosed. It was because of this  lack  of

evidence  that the Council urged in  its  original

Memorandum  that  Government should  give  further

consideration to the issue as a whole in  a  wider

context,  and  in  giving their  evidence  to  the

Select   Committee  the  representatives  of   the

Council  canvassed  the  possibility  of  a   full

inquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since July, the Select Committee has heard

evidence  including that given by 7  members  from

one  jury and 3 from another, the substance of all

of  which  and the actual transcript and recording

of  the  greater  part  of  which  has  been  made

available  to  the  Council's representatives  and

through them by permission of the Chairman of  the

Select  Committee to the remaining members of  the

Council,  This evidence has to some extent  opened

the closed doors of the Jury Room. The details are

contained in the record of the proceedings of  the

Select  Committee, and it would be superfluous  to

set them out again in this Memorandum. Suffice  it

to  say that if the state of affairs disclosed  in

the   evidence  is  typical  of  Jury  trials   in

Singapore  as a whole, all members of the  Council

are    satisfied   that   there    is    something

fundamentally wrong with jury trials as  they  now

operate  and that some remedial measures  must  be

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is at this stage that opinions among

individual  members  of  the  Council   begin   to

differ.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bar then reiterated that the majority of

their  members  still felt that  the  Jury  System

should  be retained. On the assumption that  their

views  for the retention of the Jury would not  be

accepted,  the Bar made further suggestions,  most

of which have been accepted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the result, in all capital cases:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The accused will be tried by a Court of two

Judges, one of whom shall be the presiding Judge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Both Judges must agree that the accused is

guilty as charged before he can be convicted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) If they cannot agree, he shall not be

convicted of that offence but may be convicted  of

any  lesser  offence  based  on  the  same  facts,

provided, of course, both Judges again agree.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Upon all questions relating to procedure and

the  admission  or rejection of evidence  in  the

course of a trial, the presiding Judge shall have

a casting vote in the event of disagreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would put it to the House that

the  case for the total abolition of the Jury  has

been  proved beyond reasonable doubt,  as  can  be

seen from the Report of the Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the basic principles of

democracy is that "justice must not only  be  done

but  must be seen to be done". While I agree  that

doing  away  with the jury system might  save  the

court   some   precious  time,  because   a   jury

consisting  of  laymen may sometimes  be  slow  in

grasping  the complicated points of law,  I  would

maintain  that it is better to waste some precious

time  of the court than to stop the clock unjustly

and  perpetually  for  the  accused.  Whether  our

actions  are  considered wrong or seriously  wrong

depend on the yardstick used to measure them.  And

when  a  man's  life is at stake for some  offence

that  he  has been charged with, such  as  murder,

then  the yardstick used to measure him should  be

the  yardstick that he and other common people  of

society use to measure themselves. Whilst  I  hold

our  Judges in high respect, I maintain that trial

by  jury  under the guidance of the judge  is  the

least  we  can give to a fellow man before  he  is

condemned to the gallows, and I am sure that it is

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



rule  rather  than the exception  that  the  Judge

agrees with the verdict of the jurymen. For  every

case in which the jurymen had unanimously given  a

wrong  verdict, therefore, there must  be  a  case

where an experienced Judge could also have given a

wrong verdict. In such a case, it is not so much a

failure of the system as a human failure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are indeed fortunate that we have a panel of

Judges  who  are  strong enough to  pass  judgment

without  fear  or  favour. But with  the  best  of

intentions, we cannot say this for all time in the

future, perhaps 20, 50 or 100 years to come. While

we are sure that our Judges are not subject to any

Government  pressure,  we  cannot  be  sure  about

future  Judges. The retention of the  jury  system

is,  in  my  opinion, the best guarantee  for  the

present and for the future, for it is less  likely

that  all  seven jurymen can make the  same  wrong

judgment  at  the same time and it is  not  likely

that any future government could apply pressure to

all  the  seven jurymen who are selected from  all

walks  of life. Mr Speaker, Sir, with due respect

to the Minister, I cannot support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I propose to take the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.

Sir,  with  the passing of the Bill,  we  in  this

House  will  be  happy with the enhancing  of  the

Government's role in ensuring that fair and proper

administration  of justice is made applicable  and

available  to all our citizens. It will also  meet

our   citizens'  demand  that  the  administrative

machinery should provide sufficient safeguards  to

protect their rights and liberty so that they  can

safely go about their business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill will also reduce the possibility of

error  in  a trial where a man's life is at  stake

and ensure that in a murder trial both the accused

and  the murdered person will receive justice. The

Minister  has  referred to  the  evidence  in  the

Select   Committee's  Report   when   the   Select

Committee heard evidence from some ten members  of

the jury who had served in two recent trials. I am

sure  if  Members  go through the  record  of  the

Committee, they will see for themselves the things

that  happen in the jury room in Singapore. And  I

am  sure they will join us in wishing to see  this

Bill  passed as soon as possible so that  a  trial

for  a  man's  life is not reduced to  a  game  of

chance.  Sir,  we have to ensure that  justice  is

done  to an accused person on the basis of whether

or  not he has actually committed the offence, and

not  whether  he is able to engage a good  lawyer.

There  was  a  suggestion to  raise  the  academic

qualification  or the standard of English  of  our

juries  as a solution to the problem, But I  doubt

if  this  will really help. We have had a  special

juror  who was a professional man trained overseas

and  yet who fumbled over the terms commonly  used

in  a murder trial. It is a matter of attitude. It

is  a  matter  of understanding the fact  that  at

times there are certain unpleasant things in  life

we just have to do. That really is the crux of the

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg leave of the House to refer to the

submission  of  a local journalist  and  also,  as

pointed  out by the Minister, that of  the  Deputy

Registrar of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



High  Court. Both of them have intimate  knowledge

of  the  working of the jury system, and  both  of

them were convinced that the jury system must  go.

But,  of  course,  we  cannot  prevent  frustrated

politicians who have been left way behind  by  the

progress of time from attempting to make political

capital out of such an issue. I really do not  see

the  wisdom  of  such a move. One can  accuse  the

Government   of  preparing  the  way   for   total

dictatorship or totalitarianism, but one will soon

bite one's tongue when one is permitted to hold  a

public rally in Fullerton Square on the issue over

which  the accusation was made. It will be  better

if   everyone  will  sincerely  search   his   own

conscience and ask himself if the jury system  has

really worked well in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to conclude by expressing my full

confidence  in the Bill as reported by the  Select

Committee.  I  have  no  reservation  at  all   in

supporting  the  Government on  this  issue.  Some

people    have    been   insinuating    that    we

Parliamentarians will not oppose the Bill for fear

of  being  expelled  and,  therefore,  losing  our

seats.  Let  me take this opportunity to  make  it

clear   to   everyone  concerned   that   we,   as

representatives  of the people, will  support  the

Bill or, for that matter, any other Bill worthy of

support, because  we realise  that  we  are  good

enough  to administer our affairs, and, therefore,

we  are bold enough to face the facts and have the

courage of our convictions. In this case, Sir, the

fact is that the jury system has been proved to be

unworkable in Singapore and we have the courage to

say so and to vote for scrapping it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to support the motion.



<br><br>5.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you may recall that I rose to

speak against the Bill on its Second Reading. As a

layman, I had certain misgivings and I raised  two

relevant points to substantiate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



my objection. The two issues I  raised,

if I may quote, are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) 'Singapore can ill afford the luxury of

having three Judges to be fully occupied with  one

trial;' and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) I objected to clause 3 of the Bill which

sought  to  amend Chapter 21, section 178  of  the

Criminal Procedure Code.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in support of the second point, I also said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If three learned Judges cannot arrive at a

decision,  then  I suggest that some  doubts  have

been  raised  and  I  feel the  case  deserves  an

acquittal,  and  not another trial before  another

court,  consisting  of three Judges  of  the  High

Court   other  than  those  who  had   tried   him

previously.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments to the Bill as contained in

the  Report  of the Select Committee have,  in  my

view,  taken care of the objections that I  raised

then, instead of the luxury of having three Judges

trying one case, now we have the bare necessity of

two Judges sitting in one case at a time. In fact,

a  member of a legal firm which almost exclusively

deals  with  criminal cases has advocated  in  his

written memorandum trial by two Judges instead  of

three. My objections to clause 3 of the Bill which

sought to amend Chapter 21, section 178, have also

been  met.  The  Bill  as  amended  now  reads  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Where the two Judges fail to reach an unanimous

decision  as  to  the guilt of an accused  charged

with an offence in respect of which punishment  of

death  is  authorised  by law,  he  shall  not  he

convicted  of  that offence but may,  if  the  two

Judges  agree, be convicted of any lesser  offence

of  which he could have been charged based on  the

same facts:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that where the failure to reach an

unanimous decision as to the guilt of the  accused

rests  on  the ground that one of the two  Judges

has  acquitted him by reason of the provisions  of

section  362 of this Code, then the accused  shall

not  be convicted of the offence with which he has

been charged but shall be dealt with in accordance

with the provisions of section 363 of this Code.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, if the two Judges do not

unanimously agree on the guilt of the accused, the

accused  has  to  be  acquitted.  With  this   new

amendment,  no accused person will be tried  twice

for the same offence or placed in peril



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



of  his  life twice as originally proposed in  the

Bill

.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said earlier, the Report o the

Select  Committee  has  taken  care  of  both  the

objections  which  I  raised  during  the   Second

Reading of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had the privilege of being a Member of the

Select Committee which considered the Bill.  After

hearing the views expressed by the various persons

who gave oral evidence before the Select Committee

and  reading the representations submitted,  I  am

thoroughly  convinced that  jury  trials  are  not

workable  in  Singapore. Sir, we also  heard  oral

evidence from some persons who had sat as  jurors.

We  heard  that  in  one  case  involving  special

jurors, who   were  supposed  to  possess   high

educational  qualifications, the foreman  declared

the  verdict  to  be unanimous,  as  the  Minister

pointed out earlier, when in actual fact there was

not  even  a majority decision. One juror  claimed

that the accused person should have been acquitted

on  the  grounds of self-defence when neither  the

prosecution nor the defence ever raised the  issue

of self-defence, as there was no question of self-defence at all. Another juror admitted that he did

not pay much attention to the case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the language used in our courts is English.

We  had  a special juror who was classified  as  a

special   juror   because   of   his   educational

qualifications  and  yet who pronounced  the  word

"unanimous" as "universe" and "culpable  homicide"

which sounded like "cumable suicide". Sir, in  the

case  where  the  foreman  wrongly  announced  the

verdict  to the Judge, his fellow jurors  did  not

have  any  qualms about it but happily  went  home

without  attempting to draw the court's  attention

to the foreman's mistake.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One foreman said he was trembling, sweating and

was  nervous on the day the trial ended. In  reply

to  a  question  whether he and his fellow  jurors

were  able  to follow the evidence, he said  about

one  or two or maybe three did not seem to be able

to  follow  the case properly. A leading  criminal

lawyer,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



who  also  gave  oral evidence after  hearing  the

recorded testimony by the jurors, freely confessed

that,  "I  recognise that three out of  the  seven

jurors  I  heard did not strike me as  having  the

quality for responsible judgment." Sir, if amongst

the  seven jurors, three did not follow  the  case

properly,  I  submit it is not worth  having  jury

trials.  We were also told by people who had  been

jurors  that one man amongst the jurors  can  sway

the decision of other jurors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one juror who was so influenced perhaps by

the  Perry Mason series in our T.V. programmes said

that  in the case where he was a juror, if it  had

been  tried in an American court the accused would

have  been acquitted if he had a good lawyer.  And

this  was the very same juror who had voted for  a

verdict  of  not guilty. But when  he  found  that

there was a tie in the voting, he immediately said

to  the foreman, "Can I just change my verdict  to

"Manslaughter"?" Sir, he was convinced the man was

not guilty, but on finding that there was a tie in

the  voting, he immediately decided to vote for  a

verdict  of guilty. The foreman in that case  said

the juror had changed his mind immediately and the

juror  himself  admitted that it  took  him  about

three  minutes  to  change his mind.  On  his  own

admission,  within three minutes, he  had  changed

his mind from letting a man free to sending him to

gaol.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another juror, though she knew that the foreman

was  going  to  announce a verdict different  from

that  arrived  at  by the jurors, disclaimed  her

responsibility   by   justifying   in   her    own

words:"..if  we continued arguing, it would  never

end." One juror, when asked for her reaction  when

she  heard the incorrect verdict conveyed  to  the

Judge, said, "I think we had done our duty. We had

cast our vote and that is that." Sir, an incorrect

verdict  had been given and this juror  maintained

that she had done her duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in that particular case, as the Minister

pointed out earlier, the verdict reached was  four

in favour of culpable homicide and three in favour

of guilty of first-degree murder. Sir, you are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



aware,  and  as the Minister pointed out  earlier,

that  we  need at least a five to two majority  to

call it a majority decision. The foreman announced

that  there was an unanimous verdict for  culpable

homicide and the accused was accordingly sentenced

to  imprisonment. The interesting point is, we may

ask  ourselves, what if the voting had taken place

differently?  If  four had voted  for  murder  and

three  had voted for culpable homicide and if  the

foreman had announced that there was a verdict  of

guilty of murder, then the accused would have been

sent  to the gallows. A grave and irreparable  act

of injustice would have been done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another member of the legal profession, who

represented the Council of the Singapore Advocates

and  Solicitors  Society, after having  heard  the

recorded  testimony of seven jurors,  also  freely

confessed:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'After hearing the tape and reading the

transcript  that  was handed to  us,  I  find  the

context of the transcript very shocking. Never had

I  imagined  that this was the level  of  the  so-called  richer  experience and understanding  that

the  juries  are being credited with. If  this  is

representative  of the whole of the  jury  system,

then  I  say,  Sir, that the jury  system  is  not

working at all.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after having the benefit of hearing some

jurors and having read the written representations

from  members of the legal profession as  well  as

others,  I have no doubt whatsoever that the  jury

system  has not worked and will not work  properly

in  Singapore.  In  fact, a member  of  the  legal

profession in his written submission admitted that

if  he had committed a crime, he would rather have

a  jury  try his case in the hope that his counsel

would either confuse the jurors sufficiently so as

to  cause  them  to disagree among themselves,  or

succeed in setting off an emotional chain reaction

by   appealing   to   their   pity   or   sympathy

irrespective  of the justice of the case.  On  the

other  hand,  he said, if he were not  guilty,  he

would   choose  a  Judge  because,   through   his

experience and training, he would have  a  greater

ability to discern the truth. Sir, I cannot  agree

with him more after having heard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



how   our,  jury  system  actually  functions   in

practice. The pertinent question to be decided  by

us  is whether jury trial or the abolition of jury

trial serves to promote the interest and ideals of

justice in actual practice. I am inclined to  vote

for  the  second choice and I, therefore, rise  in

support of the Bill as amended in accordance  with

the Report of the Select Committee.



<br><br>5.14 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr L. P. Rodrigo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in its passage through the

Select  Committee,  this Bill  was  put  to  close

examination by the representatives of the  Council

of the Singapore Advocates and Solicitors Society.

In  the light of the proceedings of the Committee,

a  number  of  the suggestions of the Bar  Council

have been, in fact, incorporated in the notices of

amendments  to the Bill and filed by the  Minister

for Law. The end result of this deliberation, Sir,

is the modification of certain basic provisions of

the  Bill.  Two  Judges would try  an  offence  in

respect   of  which  the  penalty  of   death   is

authorised  by  law - a presiding  Judge  and  one

other.  The decision of the court as to the  guilt

of  the accused in respect of such a charge  would

be  arrived at unanimously. Failure to  have  such

unanimity  would bar conviction on the charge  but

would  allow a conviction on a lesser offence  and

only  if  the  two  Judges agree  that  the  facts

justify   such  a  conviction.  All  interlocutory

questions  would  be determined by  the  presiding

Judge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, Sir, it cannot be doubted that these

suggestions  have been received in the  spirit  of

wanting  to  make the system work efficiently  and

effectively, and the purport of the Bill cannot be

imputed to be otherwise. Sir, that the jury system

has  not  been working as expected, I  think,  has

apparently the agreement of the members of the Bar

Council.  This  turn  of  mind  came  after  their

members  became  informed of the deficiencies  and

errors of the jury system by the jurors themselves

in Select Committee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case referred to by the Minister, the

foreman of the jury gave vent to an expression  of

acute   dissatisfaction  with  the  system.   This

dissatisfaction presumably surfaced because of the

Bill  and  the existence of a Select Committee  on

the Bill which provided a much-awaited opportunity

for  a change of the system, the efficacy of which

this  juror, at least, had grave doubts. Sir, this

is  a  disclosure which has come in the 143rd year

of the practice of the jury system in our country.

The  lucid  details given by the Member for  Telok

Blangah   opposite  are  sufficient  to  cause   a

disturbing  disillusionment about the efficacy  of

the  system  to which we have subscribed  for  all

these years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, would not our conscience be assailed by the

vision  of  more shocking errors and inability  of

our  jurors in the trials which they have hitherto

determined  in the course of those 143 years?  Are

we   to   gloss   over  these  very  disconcerting

disclosures with the argument that there is always

scope for improving the quality of our jurors, and

that   we  should  retain  lay  participation   in

criminal  adjudication in our system, or that  our

Judges  would  be  progressively  incompetent   to

decide  on  questions of fact  as  they  would  be

removed  from the experiences of the  common  man?

This last argument, as far as I am concerned, Sir,

appears to imply that our Judges would lose  their

memory of all social and cultural experiences with

the  common man immediately upon their appointment

as  Judges of the High Court. Besides, how removed

can  any  Judge be from the realities of life  and

from  his  physical experiences in  a  society  as

compact and as exposed to mass media as ours?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the urgency of the moment is to

prevent  a repetition of the kind of grave  errors

that  the  Member for Telok Blangah has undertaken

to  inform this House, particularly the kind  that

the foreman of the jury in one case had committed.

This  foreman  undoubtedly had wrestled  with  his

conscience  and  finally confided  to  the  Deputy

Registrar  of the High Court that he  had  made  a

serious mistake. But what is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



more  important still is the urgent need to ensure

that in the last analysis, whatever the system is,

justice  is  in  fact done, and as  far  as  I  am

concerned, even if it is not as lucidly seen to be

done as is desired.

<br><br>5.20 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the time that the Select Committee on the

Bill  first met, I had been persuaded to vote  for

the  abolition of the jury system by my own  brief

experience of the system, directly or vicariously,

and my belief in its unworkability. Having sat  in

Select  Committee on the Bill, the disclosures  in

the  Report which are for everyone to read, merely

confirms my conviction that the system as we  have

it today is not workable.



<br><br>5.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, nothing that has

transpired since the Second Reading of  this  Bill

has  moved me to revise my original stand that the

removal  of the jury system from our machinery  of

justice  would  result in fairer, truer  and  more

just  criminal  trials. It  is  essential  to  our

system  of administration of justice that  justice

be  meted  out in our courts of law in  accordance

with   law,  explicit  written  law,  by  men   of

integrity trained for the purpose, and there  can,

in  this  scheme of things, be no  place  for  the

intrusion,  in the shape of the jury, of  elements

of  prejudice or subjective, emotional, irrational

notions  of  what  justice should  constitute.  In

fact, we have sad modern evidence of the nature of

trial  by popular prejudice in the people's courts

of  totalitarian states where popular  justice  as

against  justice in accordance with law has  taken

its ultimate horrendous form.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In removing the jury, we remove the final

survival  of  this element from our system  and  I

would  indeed venture to state that  the  step  we

take  today  is  logical in  the  context  of  the

rational  drive  against the jury that  is  taking

place, no doubt circuitously, in other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



democratic states where the rule of law  operates.

I might here add that the state of Israel does not

have jury trials, and I am sure that not even  our

eminent  jurist, who recently charged at Fullerton

Square  that  the last nail was being driven  into

the  coffin of our basic freedoms, would seriously

contend that Israel was a totalitarian state  that

had destroyed the one thread in the history of the

individual's struggle for freedom,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fullerton Square oration as reported in the

Straits  Times of Wednesday, 17th December,  1969,

while  it  showed elements of Messianic  prophecy,

was alien to the modern critical temper and was so

unhistorical that it made one sad to think that an

otherwise brilliant legal mind was unable to  face

and  accept  facts  as they were.  If  the  proper

lessons  were drawn from history, the  categorical

assertion that the jury was an obstruction to  the

exercise of absolute power by the executive of the

Government   could  not  have  been   made.   This

proposition has never been true in Singapore and a

study of the treason trials in England would  show

that it was also not true in England.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the gravest danger in seeking to run the

affairs of state on the basis of pretence.  Having

misled oneself, one goes on to mislead and confuse

the people. For is it really true and tenable,  in

the   light  of  experience,  to  assert,  without

qualification, that the historical reason for  the

jury  in criminal trials, and its major attraction

in  democratic countries, is that it interposes  a

group  of anonymous persons between the government

and the citizens in the administration of criminal

justice?  That because of its very anonymity,  the

jury sieves out personal whims and animosities  of

the  Government and provides the best system known

of  impartial justice? That that is  why  no  jury

survives in a totalitarian state?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, is this hallucination or

hard historical fact? Does a jury anywhere in  the

world really live up to the extravagantly romantic

claims made on its behalf by its publicists?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inevitably, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I must

support this Bill.



<br><br>5.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ghazali Bin Ismail -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ghazali Bin Ismail (Aljunied):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, having been on the

Select  Committee on the Bill and having  had  the

privilege  of listening to all the evidence  given

by interested parties, I was amazed at the defects

in   the  administration  of  justice  should  the

existing jury system be retained in Singapore.  So

many  factors arise from the nature and set-up  of

our society, partly because of the educational and

intelligence  aspects, and partly because  of  the

multi-racial content of our community  where  each

member of a particular community carries along his

superstitious  and traditional  beliefs  into  his

practical life, that the jury system seems  to  be

inadequate  in ensuring that justice  is  done  in

trials of capital offences in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pregnant juror, for instance, may not vote for

a  verdict  of guilty if she knows that that  will

send  the  accused to the gallows  for  fear  that

something  would  happen  to  her  unborn   child.

However,   the  fact  that  almost   everyone   in

Singapore,  except those with special professional

and  political  interests who think  in  terms  of

either  commercial or political interests  instead

of  the  interest of justice, has not  voiced  any

objection  to  the  abolition  of  this   un-Asian

system,  I presume, means that the people are  all

behind  the Government to see that this system  is

scrapped once and for all,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many lawyers agree that the standard of our

jurors  has gone down because many jurors  do  not

have  a sufficient standard of education to enable

them  to  possess enough intelligence to mete  out

justice adequately. Quite a number of them are not

so   conversant  with  the  use  of  the   English

language.  As  has already been mentioned  by  the

Member for Telok Blangah just now, one juror,  for

instance, who appeared before the Select Committee

could  not  understand  what  "culpable  homicide"

means.  He even pronounced it as "cumable suicide"

instead of "culpable homicide",



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



and  this  happened to many others who  served  as

jurors  because of lack of education  or  lack  of

English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the very system that Mr David Marshall

fought so hard to prevent its abolition. He  tried

to  tell  the  people  that men  of  the  "cumable

suicide" type could offer better justice than  the

Judges  themselves.  Of course,  we  know  why  he

prefers  the jury to stay. After all,  under  that

very  system, he has got acquittals in many murder

trials  to  his credit. He was also so angry  with

the  Bill that he not only attacked the Government

at his luncheon speech on Wednesday last, but also

in  the  same rally he attacked the press for  not

publishing his previous criticisms on the Bill, He

alleged that the press did this out of fear of the

Government. If the press did not really give ample

publicity to his grumbling about the issue, it was

probably because they knew that his grumbling  was

more  of  a  political nature motivated  by  self-interest than professional.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my profession is

journalism  and,  like many other journalists,  we

feel  hurt  when  someone who is a  non-journalist

like  Mr Marshall tells us what to do in  respect

of  assessing  news value. I would  ask  that  the

journalists  be left alone. They know  how  to  go

about  their  work. Similarly, no journalist  will

tell  Mr  Marshall  how  he  should  conduct  his

client's defence to win his case in court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite a number of journalists, including many who

have been court reporters for years, have told  me

that  they  are in favour of abolishing  the  jury

system.  Therefore, for Mr Marshall to  say  that

there  are  only one or two men in  Singapore  who

really  want  to abolish the jury  system  is  not

correct.



<br><br>5.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, after having read the

Select Committee's Report, I think I am more  than

convinced that the system of trial by jury is  not

workable,  particularly in  our  multi-racial  and

multi-lingual society. But that does not mean that

we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



should not allow opponents to the Bill to disagree

with us. Let me put it this way. If we had planted

a  tree straight, we need not worry about the moon

shadow that it reflects, even if the shadow were a

little  bit bent. So why should we worry that  so-and-so,  an opponent of the Bill, held a rally  in

Fullerton Square?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the system is workable or not depends on

the  attitude of man. And I also say that even  if

we had a wonderful system but the attitude of that

man  was hostile to the system, he would say, "No,

no, this is rubbish." So we should not worry about

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I would like to recall what the author of My

Country  and My People, Dr Lin Yu-Tang, said.  He

said that some people even regard the moon as more

beautiful if you look at it from the West. If  you

have men with this attitude, whatever you do, they

will  say that it is wrong. So I think it is  good

for  the Prime Minister to tell Mr Marshall,  "Go

ahead  and  hold a rally in Fullerton  Square."  I

find there is nothing wrong in that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Marshall, or any opponent of this Bill, can

say  that the P.A.P. is undemocratic. To  this,  I

say,  "Let such people accuse us of being a little

bit  undemocratic. But nobody can accuse us of not

being pragmatic."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I share the feelings of the

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with the support given by

nearly  all the voices heard today, except one,  I

need  hardly wind up. The Member for Telok Blangah

previously did criticise the Bill, but we put  him

on  the  Select  Committee. Since  then  he  has

changed his mind. It is a pity that we did not put

his  namesake from Anson on the Select  Committee.

We might have been able



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



to  make  him change his mind; I do not know.  But

whatever it is, I do not think it can be  said  of

him that he is not a man of courage. Certainly  he

is not afraid to air his views in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to join issue with him here

today  except to correct one misapprehension  that

he is under, which is this. He did say that one of

the  reasons  given by Government for  introducing

this Bill is that the jury takes too much time.  I

have  never  given this as a reason. But  I  would

agree  with  him  that where a man's  life  is  at

stake,  it is not important for us to insist  that

time  is of the essence. When a man's life  is  at

stake,  the  trial  should  take  as  long  as  is

required.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs  and Minister for Labour whether  officers

before  being posted to overseas missions have  to

undergo  any  systematic training  for  diplomatic

service;  and whether he will set up a  diplomatic

service  school within his Ministry,  specialising

in  diplomatic affairs, for potential officers  in

the foreign service.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam:</b> In general, our diplomats on

first  appointment  are  given  general  training,

comprising lectures as well as attachments, before

being  posted  overseas. The  attachments  are  to

various  divisions  of  the  Headquarters  of   my

Ministry  and to the various departments concerned

with  trade,  information and consular activities,

e.g. the  Trade  Division  of  the  Ministry   of

Finance,  the  Customs,  Marine,  and  Immigration

Departments,  and  the Registry of  Citizens.  The

lectures arranged follow a set pattern, but, where

relevant,  trainees also attend courses  organised

by  the  Extra-mural  Studies  Department  of  the

University  of Singapore. Advantage is also  taken

of  visitors,  from  time  to  time,  for  ad  hoc

lectures to be arranged. Briefings on protocol and

etiquette  are  also arranged.  Thus  the  present

training arrangements are as systematic as can be,

without  the  setting up of a separate  diplomatic

service  institute. Even then the  more  practical

aspects  of  diplomacy  will  have  to  be  learnt

through attachments and later on the job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supplementing all these, advantage is taken to

send   specially  selected  officers  to  overseas

courses   such  as  those  run  by  the   Carnegie

Endowment for International Peace, UNITAR  (United

Nations Institute for Research and Training),  and

the institutes run by various governments such  as

those of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



Australia  and  India. It is intended  to  develop

further this line of approach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1966, a total of 10 training awards abroad

have  been  utilised.  Three  of  these  were  for

courses  conducted  in New  Delhi  by  the  Indian

Ministry of External Affairs, three others by  the

Ministry of External Affairs of Australia, and one

by   the  Ministry  of  External  Affairs  of  New

Zealand.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs  and Minister for Labour whether  overseas

missions  maintain  records  of  the  numbers   of

Singapore  students studying in  their  respective

countries; and whether he will consider appointing

more  students directors in overseas  missions  to

look after the welfare of our overseas students.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam:</b> To answer the second part of the question first,

a  Students  Director has been  appointed  in  our

London  Mission and one of his first tasks  is  to

compile complete statistics of our students in the

whole of the United Kingdom, with full details  of

their   background  and  the  courses   they   are

pursuing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Australia, it is not practical to

have  a  Students  Director resident  in  Canberra

where  our  Mission is located, as the  number  of

students  there  is  relatively  few.  Nor  is  it

practical  to  have one stationed in another  city

because  our  students are scattered over  a  very

wide  area.  Instead a number of Students  Liaison

Officers have been appointed on a part-time  basis

in  several states. A similar situation exists  in

the  United  States,  though instead  of  our  own

Students  Liaison Officers, each university  there

is well served by a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



separate  department  for the  administration  and

counselling of foreign students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other countries, like New Zealand, India,

Japan  and various European countries, our student

population is too small to justify the appointment

of a Students Director.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for statistics of students, complete

statistics of both private and Government students

in  the  United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand

are   maintained  by  our  respective   Diplomatic

Missions  there.  For the other countries,  fairly

reliable estimates of total numbers are available,

besides    accurate   and   fairly   comprehensive

information of Government scholars.
