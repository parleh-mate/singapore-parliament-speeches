<div align="center"><b>NEW ELECTRICAL TARIFFS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for the Environment)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, about a year ago,

in reply to an Oral Question in this Chamber, I

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore is still saddled with the antiquated

system of wiring and metering separately for

lighting and power'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



I  also informed the House that the Public Utilities

Board  had employed a firm of consultants to  advise

on  the  changeover to a single meter tariff  system

for   implementation  as  soon  as  is  conveniently

possible. The Consultants have since submitted their

report  and  their recommendations  have  also  been

carefully examined and studied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing tariff structure is complicated and

unwieldy.  To  give one example:  a  hotel  operator

today pays his electricity bill based on three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



different tariffs. The Board's concern has  been  to

replace  the  existing outmoded set  of  tariffs  by

tariffs   which   are  simple,  easily   understood,

rational,  fair and equitable. The new tariffs  will

promote  electricity consumption without  penalising

the  small  consumers.  The  primary  objective   of

introducing  the  new tariff is rationalisation  and

not the increase of revenue.



<br><br><i>The Old Tariffs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing tariffs were formulated and developed

when  the  maximum load arose from lighting  in  the

evening.  It was then desirable to keep the  evening

peak  as low as possible. This was to keep down  the

number  of  generators which had to be kept  running

for  only  two  or  three hours a day  to  meet  the

evening   peak  demand.  Hence,  higher  rates   for

lighting were charged since the major portion of the

costs  incurred  by the Electricity Department  were

principally  to  meet  the  lighting  load  in   the

evening.  The situation has now changed.  There  are

now three peak loads. One at 10.00 a.m., one at 4.00

p.m. in the evening, and one at 7.00 p.m. It  means

that  the cost of supplying electrical lighting  and

power  to various consumer categories is nearly  the

same.  So  there is no point to meter  lighting  and

power separately and charge differently.



<br><br><i>The New Tariffs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now proposed to replace the existing twelve

tariffs by six tariffs. The six new tariffs are: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The low tension domestic tariff for dwelling

houses.  There  are  231,808  accounts  under   this

category.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The low tension non-domestic tariff for

shops,   offices,   small   industries   and   small

commercial   buildings.  There   are   40,696   such

accounts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The high tension industrial tariff for large

industrial  concerns  using above  100,000  kilowatt

hours (kwh) per month. 115 accounts come under  this

category.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The high tension non-industrial tariff for

large   commercial   buildings,  hotels,   statutory

boards, the armed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



forces, etc. There are 98 such consumers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) The entertainment tariff for the 54 existing

theatres and amusement parks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) The public lighting tariff for public

lighting and traffic lights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for ease of reference. I have

asked  to  be  handed to Members  a  Table* (*See Annex, cols 131-42)  showing

details of the existing tariffs, interim tariffs and

the  new  tariffs  for the different  categories  of

consumers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Copies of the Table handed in to the Clerk and

distributed to hon. Members].



<br><br><i>The Low Tension Domestic Tariff</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, as Members are aware, there are two

domestic lighting rates:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a rate of 12 cents per kwh for a monthly

consumption of less than and up to 20 kwh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a flat rate of 18 cents per kwh for a monthly

consumption of more than 20 kwh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present domestic power consumption, i.e, power

for  cooking,  heating and all domestic  appliances,

except  fans,  is charged at seven  cents  per  kwh.

Power  for fans is charged the, lighting rate of  18

cents  per  kwh.  This,  I think,  is  the  bone  of

contention  of  many Members, especially  those  who

have the welfare of the low consumers at heart.  The

new  tariff  will  do  away  with  this  anomaly  of

charging 18 cents per kwh for power for fans  and  a

much lower rate for power for air-conditioning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new tariff will be a simple single rate for

both lighting and power, and is as follows:



<pre>



Running                  Kwh                 Cents

Charge                per month             per  kwh



1st Block    	       1  -  20               12

2nd Block   	      21  - 750                8.25

3rd Block           750 and above              7.25

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will also be a minimum charge of $1.20 per

month,  instead  of  the present minimum  charge  of

$1.50, separately for lighting and for power, making

a total of $3.00. At present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



domestic consumers using lighting and power have  to

pay  a minimum charge of $1.50 for metering of power

and  $1.50  for the metering of lighting,  making  a

total of $3.00 per month. In place of this, we  will

now have a minimum charge of $1.20.



<br><br><i>Financial Effects of New Tariffs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are altogether 231,808 domestic consumers.

They  use  only  21  per cent  of  total  electrical

energy.  Under the new tariff they will collectively

pay  3  per cent less, i.e, the PUB will lose 3  per

cent  of  its  present revenue from  these  domestic

consumers.  About 61 per cent, or 141,771  of  these

consumers  to  be  exact, use 20 units  or  less  of

lighting. They now pay 12 cents per unit.  Of  these

141,771  consumers using 20 or less units per  month

of  lighting,  33,707 will pay less  under  the  new

tariffs.  They are the small consumers who use  less

than  30  units  of electricity for both  power  and

lighting. They have a rebate through the new minimum

charge  of  $1.20  as  against the  present  minimum

charge of $3.00 per month (i.e., as I have explained

just  now,  $1.50  minimum charge for  lighting  and

$1.50  for power). The rest of the 141,771 consumers

of  domestic lighting and power, i.e, the  remaining

108,064 consumers will pay slightly more. Now, those

whose  consumption of power is 5 to 10  times  their

consumption of lighting will pay more; not  slightly

more,  but  more.  I have here a  Table  which  will

illustrate this:

<pre>

                                          Additional

     Consumers                            payment as

                                           % age of

No.    % age        Additional             charges

<i>Removal of Illegal Tapping of Power</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single tariff for both lighting and power will

remove  the temptation of tapping power for lighting

because rates for power are cheaper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88,518 consumers use more than 20 units for

lighting. They are now charged at 18 cents per unit.

Of  these, the majority, that is, about 76 per  cent

or  67,412  consumers, will pay less  because  their

consumption is predominantly lighting. The remaining

21,106   consumers  will  pay  more  because   their

consumption is predominantly power.



<br><br><i>Low tension non-domestic consumers</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come now to the low tension non-domestic

consumers. At present, there are several tariffs for

the  low  tension non-domestic consumers.  They  are

known as Tariffs, A, C, D, and F, and consumers  are

charged combinations of these. It could be (A +  D),

or  (A  +  D  +  C),  or  (C + D).  I  have  already

circulated a Table* (*See Annex, cols. 131-42) showing details of the  existing

tariffs, the interim tariffs and the new tariffs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new tariffs for the low tension non-domestic

consumers are in your hands for easy reference,  and

they are as follows:



<pre>

Running                  Kwh                 Cents

Charge                per month             per  kwh



1st block              1-    50              16.00

2nd block             51- 1,000               9.00

3rd block          1,001-10,000               8.00

4th block         10,001-50,000               7.00

Follow-on      All in excess of               6.00

rate                     50,000



Minimum Charge: $1.60 per month

</pre>



<br><br><i>Financial Effects</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty-one per cent of the 40,696 consumers under

this  category will pay less as their proportion  of

lighting  to  power  usage is  high.  The  remaining

20,020  consumers will pay more as their  proportion

of  lighting  to  power usage is low.  Collectively,

however,  the  consumers will pay 9  per  cent  less

under the new tariffs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



<i>High Tension industrial Tariff</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at present 35 industrial consumers

taking  supplies  at  high  tension  and  80  taking

supplies  at low tension. With the new high  tension

industrial  tariff,  these 80  consumers  will  save

money   by  converting  from  low  to  high  tension

supplies.  The  new  high tension industrial  tariff

will be as follows: -



<pre>



Running                  Kwh                 Cents

Charge                per month             per  kwh



1st Block    	       1-   100,000           4.00

2nd Block   	 100,001-   500,000           3.00

3rd Block        500,001- 3,500,000           2.25

4th Block      3,500,001-10,000,000           2.00

Follow-on          All in excess of           1.75

  rate                   10,000,000



Maximum Demand Charge: $4.00 per kw per month.



Minimum Charge: $650 per month.



</pre>



Collectively,  under the new tariff, they  will  pay

0.7 per cent more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are separate charges for energy consumption

(kwh)  and  maximum demand (kw). The maximum  demand

charge  will  encourage  consumers  to  lower  their

maximum  demand for short periods and  spread  their

consumption  over longer periods.  Thus,  they  will

instead  help  to  lower  the  cost  per  unit   for

themselves. By lowering the maximum demand for short

periods,  they  will  also help  the  PUB  to  defer

capital  investment in new cables,  switchgears  and

power generating plants. Let me give you an example.

For  instance, if a consumer like a factory requires

100,000 kwh a month, it could schedule its load  for

three  shifts  and require at most only  200  kw  of

demand.  However, if it works on one shift, it  will

require  up to 600 kw of demand increasing the  need

for  more  power generating plants, switchgears  and

other equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a declared demand charge. This

charge is to discourage consumers from asking for  a

greater supply of electricity than they require. For

instance, a consumer like an oil refinery or a steel

mill  requires only 25 megawatts. But, to  be  safe,

they  ask  the PUB to provide facilities  to  supply

them with 50 megawatts. This means



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



spending   unnecessary   capital   expenditure    on

provision of equipment such as switchgears,  cables,

substations, etc, for 50 megawatts instead of 25.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said earlier that it is expected that the

80  consumers who are receiving low tension supplies

will  convert  to  high tension  supplies.  This  is

because  the  low  tension  non-domestic  tariff  is

higher than the high tension industrial tariff.



<br><br><i>High Tension Non-industrial Tariff</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new tariff is as follows: -

<pre>



Running                  Kwh                 Cents

Charge                per month             per  kwh



1st Block    	       1-   100,000           5.00

2nd Block   	 100,001-   500,000           3.50

3rd Block        500,001- 3,500,000           3.00

Follow-on          All in excess of           2.75

  rate                    3,500,000



Maximum Demand Charge: $4.50 per kw per month.



Minimum Charge: $700.

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 71 large non-industrial consumers

receiving  low  tension supplies and 27  large  non-industrial   consumers   receiving   high    tension

supplies. The new tariff is also known as a two-part

tariff with a maximum demand charge of $4.50 per  kw

per month. For similar reason as I have just stated,

it  is expected that the 71 consumers receiving  low

tension   supplies  will  convert  to  high  tension

supplies.  Collectively they will  pay  6  per  cent

less.



<br><br><i>Entertainment Tariff</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, there are 54 consumers and they will pay 4

per  cent more than at present. Amusement parks  and

small  theatres  will pay less on  the  new  tariff,

while the large cinemas will pay 10 per cent more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new entertainment tariff is as follows : -



<pre>



Running                  Kwh                 Cents

Charge                per month             per  kwh



1st Block    	       1-       500          16.00

2nd Block   	     501-    50,000          10.00

3rd Block         50,001-   100,000           9.00

Follow-on          All in excess of           7.00

  rate                      100,000



Minimum Charge: $80 per month.

<i>Public Lighting Tariff</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public Street Lighting and Traffic Signs, Traffic

Signals and Bollards or beacons are not affected  by

the   tariff   changes.  However,  the  two   tariff

categories applicable to them are consolidated  into

one (both rates being the same).



<br><br><i>Fuel Oil Variation Clause</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important feature of the new tariff structure

is the fuel oil variation clause. It will be applied

uniformly to all the six new tariffs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are completely dependent upon imported fuel

oil.  It  accounts for 35 per cent of our  operating

expenditure  excluding capital cost.  The  fuel  oil

variation  clause provides that the  cost  of  every

kilowatt  hour  shall be increased or  decreased  by

0.0033  cent for every 10-cent increase or  decrease

per  ton in the cost of fuel oil. The increase  will

be  calculated over a basic oil price of $40 per ton

and  the decrease under a basic oil price of $38 per

ton.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although prices of oil have been reasonably stable

for many years, there was an increase of 30 per cent

in  fuel  oil prices to the Board since early  1971.

There  is  possibility of further increases  as  the

OPEC  countries  charge higher royalties  for  their

crude  oil. For this reason, a fuel price adjustment

in  tariffs  for  all consumers is necessary.  There

will be no need for tariff changes with every change

in oil prices.



<br><br><i>Interim Tariffs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must inform the House that, pending the

introduction  of  the single meter tariffs,  several

interim  tariffs have been implemented. Anticipating

the  introduction of single meter tariffs, the Board

in  1969  advised hotels under construction to  wire

their premises with a single distribution system for

lighting  and  power instead of  having  a  separate

wiring circuit for each. On completion, these hotels

were charged the interim rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former British bases and some Government and

Statutory Board



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



quarters  for  employees were metered  on  a  single

wiring system for lighting and power, and they  were

charged  a bulk rate. Those occupying these premises

ale   now  required  to  have  separate  meters  for

separate consumers. They also had been placed on the

interim tariff.



<br><br><i>Summary</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, of the six new electricity tariffs,

i.e, the  Low Tension Domestic Tariff, Low  Tension

Non-Domestic  Tariff  and Entertainment  Tariff  are

block  rates  metered on a single  meter.  The  High

Tension  Industrial and High Tension  Non-Industrial

Tariffs,  which are known as two-part tariffs,  also

have  block  rates for units consumed.  However,  in

addition,  they  will contain a  flat  rate  maximum

demand charge. The Public Lighting Tariff is a  flat

rate tariff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new tariffs do not require separate lighting

and power circuits. Thus, developers of all types of

property will benefit from lower capital expenditure

on  electrical installations. Householders  also  in

future will pay less for their internal wiring.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The block rates of all the new tariffs are

promotional.   The  greater  the  consumption,   the

cheaper  the rates become. With the new High Tension

Tariffs, industrial and non-industrial users  taking

supplies  at high voltage can reduce their bills  by

reducing their maximum demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new High Tension Tariffs are lower than the

new  Low  Tension  Tariffs. But to convert  to  High

Tension  supplies, consumers will have to invest  in

capital equipment. Nevertheless, it is expected that

large  Low  Tension consumers will  switch  to  High

Tension  supplies, because they will  recover  their

capital  investment in one or two years through  the

lower tariffs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All new tariffs carry a Fuel Oil Variation Clause

to  avoid messy revisions of the tariff rates  as  a

result  of increases in fuel oil prices by increased

royalties imposed by the OPEC countries.

<i>Introduction of New Tariffs in December</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new tariffs will be introduced from the

December  billing cycle. Gazette notifications  will

be  published  accordingly. In a general  adjustment

and  rationalisation  of tariffs  covering  so  many

different rates and categories, it is impossible  to

introduce a new set of tariffs which will enable the

many categories of consumers to pay exactly the same

as under the old tariffs. It is inevitable that some

will have to pay more and some slightly less.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must emphasize, Mr Speaker, Sir, that this

change  to  be  introduced in  December  is  not  to

increase the revenue of the PUB. In fact, as I  have

stated,  the PUB's revenue estimates for  1973  show

that  receipts will be $1.8 million less  under  the

new  tariffs. The PUB will also have to spend  about

$1  million  to  convert the existing  240,000  dual

meter accounts to single meter accounts. In the long

term,  however,  there will be  savings  in  capital

expenditure as the recovered meters can be used  for

new  consumers or to replace old meters. There  will

also  be  savings  in administration  costs  because

instead  of reading two meters, only one meter  need

be read.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new tariff structure is in line with latest

practice.  It is simple and clear-cut, rational  and

fair,  because it does not discriminate between  the

use of electricity for lighting and power. The small

consumers benefit. Those who consume less than or up

to 30 kwh per month for both power and lighting will

pay less under the new tariffs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the greater the consumption,

the  lower the rates, therefore benefitting also the

large  consumers. This new tariff also  removes  the

anomaly.  As  I  have said earlier,  of  charging  a

higher  rate  of  electricity for  use  of  fans  as

against  use of air-conditioning and other  domestic

power appliances. It saves all consumers expenditure

by making unnecessary duplicate wiring circuits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the public, including hon.

Members, will benefit from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>



new  tariffs. They are being introduced  only  after

careful study and detailed examination over a period

of  nearly three years. Consumers on the whole  will

pay  less. The PUB's revenue for electricity in 1973

under  the new tariffs, as compared to the  existing

tariffs, will be less by $1.8 million.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

on  a  point of clarification. I was just  wondering

why  1st December is the date for the implementation

of  the new tariff. I was thinking that perhaps  1st

January. 1973, or the period January 1973, would  be

a  better  date  to implement. The second  point  is

whether,  in  the review of the old tariff,  through

the  interim tariff, and on to the new tariff  which

took   three   years   of  study,   consumers   were

represented or consulted in the process.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Sir, I would like to take

this  opportunity to enquire from the Minister  into

the  reason  for the fairly substantial increase  in

the PUB bills of many consumers in recent months.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister  a  couple of questions?  (1)  He  has  not

actually  given  a breakdown of consumption  of  the

social-class.  Will the introduction  of  these  new

rates  affect  the lower income group,  particularly

those  who  are  poor and living in the  $20-a-month

Housing  and  Development Board cats? (2)  I  notice

that the Minister has given us figures which, to  my

mind,  are  too many for us to study at  this  hour.

Anyway, he did say that those who consume up  to  33

kwh  per  month and those who largely consume  power

will benefit from these new rates. Who then will  be

the ones who have to pay more?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister three

questions.  The  Statement  given  by  the  Minister

contains  many  figures and terms. Many  Members  of

Parliament,  and I believe some Ministers  too,  are

confused by such figures and terms. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



would like to know whether the small consumers  will

pay   less  after  the  introduction  of  these  new

tariffs. If they have to pay more, then it will  not

be  beneficial to them. It will be a greater  burden

to  them.  Secondly,  since our  generators  produce

enough  supply  of electricity, we should  encourage

consumers  to  use  more electricity  so  that  more

revenue  can be collected by the PUB. In  this  way,

with more revenue, I believe it is not necessary for

the PUB to introduce these new consolidated tariffs.

The third question is this. With this new tariff,  I

would  like  to  know  whether  the  PUB  will  also

introduce a uniform tariff for water.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to ask The Minister one very simple point

of   clarification.  He  mentioned  that  with   the

introduction of the new tariff, the revenue  of  the

PUB  will be less by approximately $1.8 million, and

that  it  will  cost  the PUB approximately  over  a

million  dollars to switch over to the single  meter

system.  The  Minister mentioned  that  in  the  new

system  there would be savings in the administrative

cost,  but  he did not indicate the figures.  I  was

just wondering how much savings there will be.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like  to  ask a very simple question.  It  is

about  meter readers. Whenever meter readers take  a

reading  of  the  meters, the consumption  seems  to

increase every month. Will the Minister do something

about that? While he is equalising the rates on  the

one hand, he is increasing the meter readings on the

other.  Will  the  Minister look  into  this  matter

first, after introducing the new tariff?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, to take

the  Member for Sembawang. I do not know whether  he

was  paying very close attention to my Statement  or

not. I have already stated that the new tariff is  a

promotional tariff. Therefore, if you use more,  the

rates  will be less. Thus, it encourages  people  to

use more. So it is promotional,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



that is why there is a new tariff. But he says there

is no need for a new tariff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kwh is a unit of measurement of the amount of

electricity consumed, just as it is so many  gallons

of   water,  it  is  so  many  kilowatt   hours   of

electricity; that is the simple explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also stated that it is not possible in a

review of this nature to see that everybody pays the

same rate. Our main concern is to see that the small

consumers  or  those people who live,  as  the  hon.

Member  said,  in $20-a-month Housing  Board  flats,

should  not be asked to pay more. I have  said  that

those who use a combined total of 30 kwh or less  of

electricity  per month for both power  and  lighting

will  pay less. There is the question that  if  some

people pay less, who pays more? Let me tell him  who

pays  more. I, for one, will be paying more  because

of air conditioning, for which I use more power than

lighting. As I have explained, the cost of supplying

electricity, either for power or lighting, is  about

the  same.  So  the charges should be the  same.  At

present,  the  rate for lighting is higher.  We  are

paying  18 cents per unit for lighting, and  only  7

cents per unit for power. It means that lighting has

been subsidising power. So now, those people who use

power are now asked to pay their due share and those

people  who  have  been paying  a  higher  rate  for

lighting, well, they do not have to subsidise  those

who use power. Therefore, in toto, if you use a very

large proportion of power, compared to lighting, you

will  now have to pay more, and this is as it should

be.  That is why I have said that the new tariff  is

fair, equitable and just.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the other question of how much savings

there  will be in administrative costs, I hope there

will  be  some  savings. But  it  is  too  early  to

anticipate the amount. There are priorities.  We  do

not  spend our time calculating something  which  we

are not very sure of. Probably, by the time when  we

sit  for  our 1973-74 Estimates, and if the question

is raised again, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



may be able to give an answer. Otherwise, it is just

futile because, as you have heard from my colleague,

the  Finance Minister, yesterday, there  will  be  a

review  of  salaries for those whose  salaries  have

stagnated.  Therefore, all these have  to  be  taken

into consideration before we make the calculations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why the new rate should take effect on 1st

December  and  not 1st January, 1973, we  have  been

studying this question for three years, and I  think

December  is  a  good time because  people  will  be

celebrating Christmas and the New Year, and they can

turn  on  more  lights as lighting  will  then  cost

between  8 1/4 cents and 7 1/4 cents, instead  of  18

cents.  I think it is a good month to start the  new

rates.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon.

Minister  did not reply to my question  about  meter

reading.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, this is a perennial

complaint.  I think that if you use more,  and  when

the  meter reader comes and takes the readings,  you

complain.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> No I am sorry, Mr Speaker,

Sir, I think the meter reader does not take down the

accurate figures, you know. So he will have to check

up.  I  have received so many complaints about that.

For example, for this month the bill is $20, and for

the  next  month  $30; and the  following  month  it

increases to $40. I do not know how or in  what  way

they read the meter. He must check on this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, we are on new tariffs. On

this  question of wrong reading of meters, as I have

said,  we  have a quarter million domestic consumers

altogether. If there are only one or two complaints,

it  is  largely  because probably consumers  do  not

realise  that  they have used more.  However,  where

there  is  a mistake or where the meter  is  out  of

order,  we always investigate the complaint. When  a

consumer's bill goes up every month, then  something

may be wrong. I, too, have received a complaint



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



from  a  consumer saying that his bill for the  last

month has more than doubled. I asked, "What did  you

do  during that month?" He said, "We had a  marriage

in  the  house." So there you are. Things like  this

happen.  The consumer is not consciously aware  that

there  are  occasions when he has to use  more.  But

where  there  are legitimate complaints,  we  always

look into them.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are you asking a supplementary

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Just a point of

clarification, Sir, Mr Speaker, Sir, at the  present

moment  there  are two meters, one for lighting  and

the other for power. So there will be a necessity to

remove one of the meters so that this new tariff can

be implemented. I wonder whether the PUB will refund

to the consumer the cost of the meter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the meter belongs

to the PUB.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> I believe that when a flat or a house

is  constructed, the cost of the meter is charged to

the  householder when he moves in and he has to  pay

for it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

first,  allow  me  to  express  my  thanks  to   the

President  for his Speech. Secondly, let me  at  the

same  time  express my satisfaction of the  policies

contained  in the Speech. The President has  pointed

out that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`when the last Parliament was convened, the

prospects were grim. We faced the stark question  of

survival:  how to hold up the economy,  to  generate

jobs, of any kind, to mop up massive unemployment...

Today's  continuing and controlled  boom  is  giving

Singapore  that glow of success. There  is  a  bloom

which  will  spread from the city to the new  towns,

and  through  to  the villages and kampongs  in  the

rural areas.'



<br><br>That we have achieved the good results today is  due

entirely  to  our  decisive will to  succeed,  sheer

determination, hard work, and realistic planning. We

have overcome the many difficulties then facing  us,

and  have  achieved  the  targets  we  set  out   to

accomplish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are several points arising out of the

President's  Speech  which I would  like  to  raise.

Firstly, it is about the re-adjustment of the salary

scales and terms and conditions of service of  civil

servants.  The  Addendum to the  President's  Speech

pointed out that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is necessary to re-examine once again the

structure of pay and service conditions and to  make

the  rewards  in  certain  departments,  ministries,

grades and professions more comparable to what  they

can get in the private sector.'



<br><br>This  suggestion is very good. However, the question

is whether this adjustment will involve only a small

group  of  senior  officers or all  civil  servants,

including  those  in  Divisions  II,  III,  and  IV.

Several  years ago, the Government set  up  a  Civil

Service  Salary Adjustment Committee. They submitted

their  recommendations which benefited  only  a  few

senior  officers. Civil servants in the lower  ranks

did  not  benefit  by the adjustment.  Therefore,  I

would like to suggest here that the re-adjustment of

the  Civil Service salary structures should  not  be

discriminatory, benefiting only the senior officers,

and not the lower ranks of civil servants. In actual

fact, the re-adjustment in salary structure is  more

pressing  for  the  lower  ranks  than  for   senior

officers to whom a small adjustment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



is  insignificant. It is just like a  drop  of

water  in  the  ocean  to senior  officers.  But  to

officers in the lower ranks, it is like a dewdrop in

a  season  of drought: or it is like providing  them

with  charcoal during winter. The re-adjustment will

benefit  them  very much. Therefore, a comprehensive

salary  re-adjustment is very necessary and this  is

also a pressing requirement of the general rungs  of

the civil servants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to look into the question

of  why  some  people  are not  satisfied  with  the

Government.  We all know that although  the  present

Government  won  a  decisive  victory  in  the  last

general elections, there are still about 30 per cent

of our electorate who cast votes for the opposition.

There  must be some reason for this. Sir, I remember

that when we separated from Malaysia, our Government

had  to make the people struggle very hard for their

survival. And now we have achieved definite results.

At  present, it is not a question of survival of our

people  as  our prosperity has topped the  whole  of

Southeast   Asia  and  it  can  even  compare   very

favourably  with  that of the Western  and  American

countries.  Living  in  this fortunate  environment,

except  for a very few extremists, chauvinists,  and

racialists,  why  should they  want  to  oppose  the

Government?   I  think  it  might  be  because   the

Government in implementing its policies had been too

harsh  or  hasty and neglecting the basic livelihood

of  the  people.  For example, in  implementing  our

urban  renewal  programme the Government  has  given

priority  of Housing Board flats to people  affected

by  the  resettlement programme. The Government  has

also  given them compensation and removal  expenses.

In  view of this, the Government can be said to have

done  its  best  to  help  the  people  to  resettle

comfortably. However, the Government has not gone  a

step further to resolve the problem of livelihood of

these  people. Because of this they are dissatisfied

with  the  Government. For instance, those who  were

affected   by  resettlement  were  originally   sub-tenants,  and many of them are families  of  six  or

seven each. They had been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>



paying  rentals  of $15 or $20 per month,  but  upon

resettlement in Housing Board flats they had to  pay

double  or even treble the rate. This had inevitably

increased  their burden. They had no choice  but  to

move  out. However, it was difficult to remove,  and

thus  their cause for dissatisfaction. Here I  would

like   to  suggest  that  in  future  whenever   the

Government  implements any policy that  affects  the

people,  it  should give the people  ample  time  to

adjust  to  the  changed situation. Secondly,  there

should   be   co-ordination   between   Members   of

Parliament and local leaders, who could make on-the-spot   investigations  so  that  they  could  better

understand  the  actual  living  conditions  of  the

general  populace  and to enable the  Government  to

draw  up  plans and policies in accordance with  the

surveys  obtained. This would meet the  requirements

of  the  people and would facilitate persuasion,  so

that  the  people  would  not  have  any  reason  to

complain against the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to touch upon the

reorganisation of the road traffic system. It cannot

be  denied  that  since  the reorganisation  of  our

public  transport, the bus services are much  better

than  before. This, of course, is a mailer for  joy.

Today,  many  people need to spend a  few  cents  to

travel  by  bus  from  one corner  of  Singapore  to

another.  However, this reorganisation  has  brought

about  many  problems. First of  all,  it  adversely

affects  the livelihood of the taxi drivers  because

with  so many buses running along so many roads  and

with  such  convenience and cheap means of transport

many people want to travel by bus. As a result,  the

income  of the taxi drivers has dropped very  badly.

If   this  trend  were  to  continue  further,   the

difficulties  now  faced by the taxi  drivers  would

become worse. Therefore, I would like to remind  the

Government  to pay attention to the problem  of  the

livelihood  of the taxi drivers. Secondly,  the  bus

services  along  so many roads, big or  small,  have

caused  greater  congestion along these  roads.  For

instance,  in MacPherson district there is  a  small

road  called  Circuit Road which is not  very  wide.

Originally, the vehicular traffic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>



there  is already quite heavy. But now, with buses

running along this road, the traffic is even  more

congested.  This  is only one example.  There  are

many   other  streets  and  roads  in   the   same

situation.  I hope the Minister for Communications

will  pay  attention to this undesirable situation

and  try to rectify it so that our road system can

be improved.



<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise  in  support of the motion  to  thank  the

President  for  his speech. In his speech  to  the

House,  the President has charted out the path  of

progress for the nation in the next few years.  We

owe  our  present well-being to hard work  in  the

past;  hard work it shall have to be if we are  to

continue  to prosper. As we become more  affluent,

we  shall  have more to spend and to save.  Whilst

spending  is a relatively simple matter,  although

some  people  seem  to have difficulties  spending

within   their  means,  saving  can   pose   quite

considerable  problems. It is perhaps  unnecessary

for  me  to enumerate the many painful experiences

which  some  of  our citizens have had  in  recent

years.  By  putting  their savings  in  the  wrong

places or in wrong hands, they have had their hard-earned  savings  taken away from  them  overnight.

What  has happened is history. My present  concern

is  the  future  security of the  savings  of  our

citizens, particularly the large majority  of  the

working class people. Ideally, I would like to see

most  of  the  savings going to  the  Post  Office

Savings Bank or perhaps the other well established

financial  institutions, but  as  there  are  many

other  competing alternatives offering what appear

to  be  attractive propositions in terms  of  high

rates  of returns for those who are eager  to  see

their  money  grow, security becomes a  matter  of

some concern. As such, I feel that it is essential

at this juncture for the Government to take a good

look  at  some  of  the existing outlets  for  our

national savings, with a view to ensuring  as  far

as  it is possible by legislative means that these

outlets are safe for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>



our  citizens to leave their money with. One  area

that  immediately  comes  to  mind  is  the  Stock

Exchange where we find today people from all walks

of  life playing "Bulls and Bears", and many  have

had  their  lingers burned. Here, are we satisfied

that  everything possible has been  done  to  curb

excessive speculation and manipulation which, more

often than not, benefits a resourceful few at  the

expense of a vast number of small investors? There

has been a suggestion that an independent watchdog

committee  be  set  up  to  keep  an  eye  on  the

activities of the Exchange, but to-date  this  has

remained a point of academic interest leaving  the

Exchange  to  continue  to  operate  as  a   self-regulating body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we become more and more of a "Global City", in

the  words  of  one  of  the Ministers,  we  shall

benefit  from  the  importation  of  technological

skills  and  expertise but at the  same  time  our

citizens  shall become more exposed and vulnerable

to exploitation by international crooks who, under

the  guise of commerce, will come along with their

highly  refined  and subtle confidence-tricks.  We

cannot   always  afford  to  learn   from   bitter

experience. In the course of the next few years  I

should  like  to see a rather more  effective  and

knowledgeable commercial crime unit within our own

police  force working hand-in-hand with the  Trade

Division of the Ministry of Finance and constantly

keeping a watchful eye on imported crimes directed

at taking away the precious savings of our people.

In  this connection, it is therefore reassuring to

note  from the addendum to the President's speech,

the proposed setting up of a Criminal Intelligence

Unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would be failing in my duty if I did not

bring  the attention of the House to some  of  the

perennial problems faced by the rural folk. At the

top  of  the  list is, of course, the pig  problem

which has been the subject of heated debate at the

last Parliament. Suffice it to say, I do sincerely

hope  that  the Ministry concerned will study  the

problem  in depth with a view to finding permanent

and suitable solutions at an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>



earlier date, leading to stability of price and at a

level  tolerable to farmers who have suffered severe

financial losses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take the opportunity of

requesting the Minister for Law to direct  the  Land

Office  to  carry out a revision of  the  conditions

attached   to  all  temporary  occupation   licences

granted to people occupying State land in the  rural

areas,  so that it would be easier and possible  for

existing  structures to be either  extended  or  new

structures   erected  in  order   to   meet   rising

expectations. At present most, if not all,  of  such

applications  are  turned  down.  Consequently  many

families   have   to  put  up  with   very   crammed

conditions,   since  alternative  accommodation   is

becoming increasingly difficult to come by,  bearing

in  mind the long waiting list at the Housing Board.

The  very  involved procedures at present which  are

necessary in order to obtain approval for repairs or

renovations,  no  matter how  minor  the  nature  of

repairs may be, also leave much to be desired, and I

would  urge  that  something  be  done  to  simplify

matters and to avoid unnecessary delays. All in all,

I  feel  that  the time has come for a  rather  more

comprehensive   set  of  policies  aiming   at   the

betterment of life in general in the rural areas  so

that, to quote the President, the bloom as reflected

from  the glow of success "will spread from the city

to  the  new towns, and through to the villages  and

kampongs in the rural areas."

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications (Mr Lim Guan Hoo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to support the motion, moved by the Member  for

Bukit  Batok, expressing our thanks to the President

for  the speech which he delivered on behalf of  the

Government  at the opening of the First  Session  of

this Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We meet today in a more favourable atmosphere with

a  homogeneous parliamentary line-up, fully equipped

with  the  determination to safeguard what  we  have

achieved in the past 13



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>



years.  Far  from  being  annoyed  by  any  form  of

political  instability,  we  are  now  in  a  better

position  to enjoy a stable situation brought  about

by  the  PAP's  achievement in  the  recent  general

elections. Mr Speaker, Sir, if I recollect  rightly,

not  all  the countries in the world which claim  to

have  adopted a parliamentary democratic system have

benefited  from parliamentarism. One of the  reasons

is that in many of these countries a defective multi-party   system  or  even  a  two-party   system   is

encouraged to serve the purpose of those who  prefer

constitutional instability to the continuity  of  an

effective government. Time and energy are wasted  in

the  intensified  inter-party struggles  which  lead

eventually  to unrest and disorder. In the  case  of

the  Third  Republic of France,  there  had  been  a

century of constitutional instability. The real vice

lies  in  the  belief that democracy should  provide

more  intensified inter-party struggles rather  than

political stability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore do not believe that a small nation

like   ours   should  allow  foreign  interests   to

manipulate our internal politics under the guise  of

supplementing or reorganising our democratic  system

by  offering an opposition voice in this Parliament.

Democracy must be a national asset and there must be

no  room  for  insurrection to be triggered  off  by

foreign  nations. Members will recall that prior  to

the  general  elections in 1959, there was  a  well-known  case  of  a  decadent  Lim  Yew  Hock  regime

receiving  financial support from a certain  foreign

power.  The history of bracketed tractable operation

and  black operation designed by foreign powers  can

be  traced to as far back as the 1950s. It would  be

naive  for  us to believe that being an  independent

country   today,  Singapore  would  be   free   from

political intervention from outside. This is part of

the  hard facts of life which should always be borne

in  mind  by  all those who do not lack a  sense  of

commitment to the nation. We have to rely mainly  on

our determination to safeguard our national interest

against   any  political  manipulation  by   outside

powers. Too often we find people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>



possessing  love for the nation only  when  the  sun

smiles  upon them. But the patriot who stands  firm,

even  when  the cruel winds of fate blast  upon  our

shores  and  dark  clouds  loom  over  the  horizon,

deserves the gratitude of every man and woman in the

nation.  Only  God and the devil can live  alone  in

this  world. As men, we must live together and  care

for  one  another. This is a prerequisite to nation-building, and our first task is to build up a  sense

of  political  alertness and  to  develop  the  best

qualities  of incorruptible integrity. This  is  the

essence of statesmanship and political maturity. All

these  are  crucial and should be treated  with  the

utmost sincerity. Since my colleague, the Member for

Stamford and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for Labour, has quoted from a book entitled "Art  of

War"  by  Soon Tze yesterday, I would  now  like  to

quote Lao Tze for the reference of Members:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`When the highest type of men hear of Truth, they

forthwith  practise it sedulously. When the  average

type  of  men  hear of Truth, they are  unimpressed.

When  the  lowest type of men hear  of  Truth,  they

greatly deride it and simply laugh at it. Indeed, if

these men do not deride it, it is surely not Truth.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am confident Members will agree

with me if I say that nation-building is no laughing

matter. It is a matter that concerns life and death,

and  it determines whether empires wax or wane,  and

whether states cleave asunder or coalesce. Our  duty

as  Singaporeans is to provide and build a tradition

of  unshakable will to serve the best  interests  of

our  country  so  as to preserve the  continuity  of

political stability in this part of the world. We do

not  believe  that  the  proposed  presence  of   an

opposition  in  this House would  reflect  a  higher

standard   of  democracy  in  Singapore.   This   is

especially so when the benefits of having opposition

parties  are  entwined  with those  of  the  foreign

powers.  At  a time when foreign powers are  showing

greater   and   greater  interest  in  this   island

Republic, one can hardly believe that the opposition

parties would be capable of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>



resisting   the  temptation  generated   from   such

attractive sources. If opposition parties fall  prey

to foreign political manipulation, the time would be

ripe for us to declare them the common enemy of  the

people   of  Singapore.  There  is  no  feeling   of

indifference among our people on matters  concerning

national  survival. I therefore believe that  it  is

now  time  for a system to be established to  ensure

that  the  will  of the people in respect  of  major

issues  concerning their destiny is  well  expressed

and  that  such  a  system will  always  remain  the

decisive   force   in   the  safeguarding   of   our

sovereignty.

his  speech delivered last Thursday on behalf of the

Government  at the opening of the First  Session  of

this Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Education, it would not be out of place  for  me  to

dwell for a few moments on education in general  and

on   our   educational  policies  in  Singapore   in

particular.  These arc matters of great  bearing  to

the continued progress of our Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that the system and content of

education in any country be shaped according to  the

needs  of  the country. In a changing social  order,

education should guide the citizens in their efforts

to  build a new society. Young people must be taught

to  adapt  themselves to the new social environment,

and   this  should  be  the  responsibility  of  the

government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That education and the pursuit of knowledge should

not be the monopoly of any privileged class needs no

emphasis. Those who were not able, for one reason or

another,  to enjoy much education when young  should

be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>



given the opportunity to pick it up again at a  more

opportune   time   through   adult   education   and

vocational  training programmes. At the  same  time,

however,  the  people should not  be  encouraged  to

climb  the education ladder blindly, without  regard

to  social needs. For example, if the country's need

is for more people trained in practical skills, then

courses  offering  such  training  should  be  given

priority  over those which are purely  academic  and

non-practical.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education, as I see it within the context of

Singapore, should be planned instruction,  beginning

with  the  young, to cultivate their  potentialities

and  talents so as to enable them not only to engage

in   productive  work  in  order  to  improve  their

economic   well-being   but   also   to   contribute

wholeheartedly  to the promotion of social  progress

in the midst of a democratic system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has in recent years undergone

transformation in every field -political, social and

economic.  And throughout this period of  purposeful

ferment, education has been the main strut upholding

national planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In support of our Republic's rapid

industrialisation,  the  aims  and  content  of  our

educational  system were orientated towards  science

and   technology.  Many  new  measures   have   been

implemented  by the Ministry of Education.  A  major

reorganisation  of our secondary school  system  was

started  in  1968, laying unprecedented emphasis  on

technical  education. This was  necessary  in  order

that  the  state  of  industry  in  Singapore  could

advance.  Greater  stress  has  been  laid  on   the

teaching   of  mathematics,  science  and  technical

subjects  in  our technical schools  and  vocational

institutes.  We  have been encouraging  the  use  of

English  in  teaching  science  and  mathematics  at

secondary and even at primary levels in non-English-medium  streams. This is necessary in our  long-term

interests  for we believe that the English  Language

can  provide  functional support to  our  plans  for

scientific  and  technological  development  in  the

`80s.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in attaching importance to such

development,  we  shall not forget  that  our  young

citizens must be encouraged to retain their cultural

ballast,  in  order  that  they  may  derive  enough

confidence  from a knowledge of their  own  cultural

identity to counter any ills and problems which  the

pace   of  life  in  an  industrialised  and  highly

urbanised society may bring. This will be a  further

task  of education in Singapore. It is our aim  that

education  should  equip our young Singaporeans  for

the  task  of  turning Singapore  not  only  into  a

regional  centre  for  industries  and  services  in

shipping  and communications, banking and  commerce,

but also into a city of grace and vitality.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

achievements  of  the Government in  the  last  five

years  can  be  attributed mainly to the  sound  and

dedicated  leadership  on  the  one  hand  and   the

cooperation of our diligent people on the other.  We

have  mopped up unemployment, generated jobs,  built

flats,  new  towns,  factories, etc.  These  can  be

regarded  as tangible achievements. The tasks  ahead

of  us  with emphasis on "quality" are more  complex

and intangible than some of us would have realised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve quality in jobs, homes, social and

recreational  amenities, we require much  more  than

just  more  money to be spent on capital  equipment,

prolonged  training of technicians, and on educating

the professionals whose expertise is part and parcel

of an industrial society. It requires greater effort

on  research and planning before action in order  to

attain qualitative goals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is needless for me to stress that the main

efforts of our Government have been directed towards

improving the lot of every citizen of Singapore.  We

have  very little space in this island state and  we

have  hardly  any natural resources  worth  speaking

about.  It is precisely for this reason that I  feel

that there is an urgent need for the formulation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



of   a  comprehensive  socio-economic   and

physical development plan whose framework should  be

flexible but clear enough to guide our long term and

short  term  investment decisions, and to  help  put

every  square  foot of space in this island  to  its

best possible use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only through comprehensive planning and

thorough    research   will   we   achieve    better

communication and transportation, better  places  of

work,  better community facilities and amenities,  a

better  Singapore  for  our  children  and  for  our

children's children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection I feel that particular

attention  should be given to the development  of  a

more    effective   working   relationship   between

Government departments and statutory bodies. At  the

same  time, in order to achieve higher standards  in

everything,  as  the President  has  stated,  it  is

essential  also  to  cultivate  simultaneously   the

quality  of our people and hopefully to be  able  to

nurture  and  develop a broad base  of  intellectual

freemasons whose conviction and passionate  interest

in  social responsibility stand in harmony with that

of the sound and dedicated leadership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full well do we realise that in order to attain

the  ultimate goal it is imperative that the leaders

should  do the thinking, commanding, and carry  most

of the responsibilities. But in the pursuit of these

qualitative  goals,  it  is  preferable   that   the

leadership  have  the support and  collaboration  of

like-minded beings than the need to drive or  spoon-feed all the way those who are led.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that there are simple solutions

to  the  complex and intangible tasks ahead  of  us.

What  is  needed  is greater team  work  inside  and

outside this House. It is only through team work and

closer collaboration that effective plans evolve and

higher standards in everything achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion moved by the Member for

Bukit Batok.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Encik Sha'ari Bin Tadin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Encik Sha'ari Bin Tadin):</b> Mr Speaker,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



Sir, I wish to associate myself with the Member for Bukit Batok  in  moving a motion to express our thanks  to

the  President for the speech which he delivered  on

behalf of the Government at the opening of the First

Session  of  the Third Parliament on  12th  October,

1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has outlined some guidelines for

Singapore. When translated into practical terms,  it

will  mean  a better life for the mostest number  of

people  at  the  expense of marginal  sacrifices  by

those  able  to  bear  them.  Living  conditions  in

Singapore  have  already been kept stable  and  non-inflationary since 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The developed nations have not fared well in this

respect. There, galloping inflation is the order  of

the  day.  Irresponsible trade unionism  is  another

menace, so much so that one wag says that the unions

may   succeed   in  abolishing  the   working   week

altogether. In those countries, the status  quo  has

been defined as the mess they are in, which includes

pollution  and  all the rest of it. It  is  easy  to

understand that the soil there is conducive  to  the

development   of  hippi-ism  and  other   hedonistic

philosophies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who have travelled abroad find the contrast

between Singapore and other societies evident.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the developing societies, they will find that

there  is  no  economic take-off simply because  the

governments and the people do not pull together  and

make  the  necessary sacrifices. Many  a  developing

society  is left far behind in the race for economic

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, nobody starves if he is able-bodied

and  prepared to accept any job offered, even if  he

is  unskilled. It means that the correct formula for

nation-building has been found by us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cornerstone of nation-building is a realistic

policy of "from each his best, to each according  to

his ability". This means that whether in business or

in  the Government services, each man finds his  way

to the room at the top only on his own merit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans will have to continue to be economic

animals.  In fact, any halt to Singapore's  economic

development will be a national catastrophe. But from

time to time there have been pleas that we be not an

ugly  society  of  people  who  know  the  price  of

everything but the value of nothing. It simply means

that  dollar-worship should be matched by  aesthetic

appreciation.  It is good for Singaporeans  to  make

money,  but  in  doing  so, they  must  advance  the

national  interest  and, better still,  cultivate  a

love   for   arts.  This  way,  we   become   better

Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stress on the appreciation of arts and beauty

is  timely. This is the best time for such a clarion

call to be made. It would have been premature if the

call  was  made  in our earlier period  of  economic

development. Now that we are sharing the  fruits  of

national  development,  we  should  apply  ourselves

seriously  to the arts, since most of us can  afford

it.  And  if at such a time we should fail to  place

the right emphasis on cultural development, then  we

are  to  blame  if  ours becomes a gross  and  crude

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has said that Singapore's limited

land  resources means that "we cannot seek fame  for

sheer  size".  But we can be synonymous  with  human

excellence. This means, among other things, that  we

can   be   world-known  as  a  society  of  cultural

refinement. We can achieve this because  we  possess

the cultural resources of all the major races on the

globe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other related point I wish to make is the

necessity to work hard in the national interest.  So

long  as the economy is kept buoyant, our prosperity

is  assured,  not forgetting the need  for  national

defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we have an unfavourable man-land ratio, we

have  to plan the use of every inch of this resource

very  carefully.  We  have to  compensate  for  this

unfavourable  man-land ratio by acquisition  in  the

national  interest  -  in  other  words,  land   not

economically used is acquired for public projects to

benefit  a  thousand times the number of people  who

have to move out. Dislocation is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



caused to the affected few. But there should  be  no

hard  feelings if those affected understand that  if

Singapore were 10 or 20 times its present size, such

dislocation would not be necessary. Yet unscrupulous

politicians  told those affected that  should  their

parties  be  elected and come to power, these  urban

renewal  or redevelopment projects would be reversed

or  halted.  Certain political parties in  Singapore

will  not hesitate to set back the clock of national

progress in their efforts to win votes. This is very

sad  for  them because the concept of an alternative

government  with a two-party system means  that  the

alternative  programme must be  as  progressive  and

constructive, if not more so, as the ruling party's,

if  they  are  to have any prospects  at  a  general

election.  However, their empty  promises  did  have

some  effect during the last general elections.  The

electorate  in Singapore must be taught to  be  more

critical and analytic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the last general elections has

demonstrated beyond any shadow of doubt  that  there

are  still  those  in Singapore, be  they  political

parties  or individuals, who would seek to  come  to

power not for the benefit of the people as such, but

for  their  own benefits, irrespective of what  harm

their policies would do to our Republic. We, on  the

other  hand, are a party which have come up  against

many  problems in the past, introduced many  crucial

adaptations  and  changes which  have  to  be  made,

unpopular as they might have been to some people. In

spite   of   the   prophets  of   doom,   who   have

unsuccessfully tried their best to discourage us  in

our  endeavours, we intend to continue to  face  and

overcome whatever obstacles that come our way in the

future.  Unlike those who make' promises at election

time   and   then,  not  being  elected,   disappear

completely from the scene without any more  interest

in  the people whom they pretend to stand for and to

look  after, we plan many years ahead and anticipate

or  try  to anticipate the changing scenes  and  the

many  problems which come within the orbit not  only

of Singapore but of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



all  other countries as well. As a nation  of  doers

and not criers, we always gear ourselves to meet the

challenges ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned with the problems of nation

building  which, as the Member for Bukit  Merah  has

rightly   said,  should  be  treated   with   utmost

sincerity  as  they  are  affected  by  the  various

aspects  of  culture. Mass media is a most  powerful

weapon,  and my Ministry intends to see that  it  is

used  to unify and consolidate the building  of  our

nation  with  the  right aims and attitudes  towards

peace  and progress. The various aspects of cultural

and  social activities which come within the purview

of  my  Ministry are directed and channelled towards

the   building   of  character  of   our   citizens,

especially our youths, so that not only will they be

hard-working and achievement-oriented but they  will

also  be mentally active and loyal citizens  of  the

Republic,  able  to appreciate things  of  aesthetic

value  and  are  always  intellectually  alive   and

responsive  to changes which take place  beyond  our

shores.



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the opening

Address  to  Parliament  by our  President  on  12th

October in this House is a very significant one. The

speech outlined plans for Singapore and the problems

we  have faced and may face in the next five years.

The  contents of the speech are worth noting for the

down-to-earth  treatment  of  our  problems  we  are

facing, instead of presenting a speech with a glossy

surface as is the case with some other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the elections in 1968 we were faced with a

very  grave problem. The British in their  desperate

efforts to salvage a sinking economy, which  was  on

the  verge  of  bankruptcy, had  dealt  Singapore  a

terrible  blow.  Their  announcement  of  an   early

withdrawal  of  their troops would  have  spelt  the

death   knell  for  many  countries,  but  not   for

Singapore  because  of  the kind  of  citizens  that

Singapore   possesses.  Fortunately   we   have   an

efficient government whose foresight has saved Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



many  a time. The Government has again  proved

its  worth  and calibre. Under the Prime  Minister's

magnificent    leadership,   together    with    the

resourcefulness  and  hardworking  nature   of   the

Singaporeans,  we have instead proved  the  doomsday

prophets wrong once again. Nowhere in Asia,  besides

Japan,  is  there a country experiencing  such  boom

conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to experience these boom conditions

further,  we have to employ a great number  of  non-citizens from abroad. I might mention at this  stage

that, although work permits are issued liberally for

most  categories of workers, we still find factories

employing   workers  without  work  permits.   These

workers  had  their applications  for  work  permits

rejected  by  the  officials  responsible,  on  some

flimsy  grounds. It is high time that  work  permits

were   issued  to  workers,  particularly  to  those

employed  in factories, as they are being  exploited

by  their employers. Further, these workers  do  not

have  any  CPF contributions made to them; thus  the

country and the workers are losing money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching on the subject of visas, may I point out

that  the office responsible for the issue of  visas

seems to have a particular prejudice against members

of  the  religious  orders. Quite  often  they  have

difficulty  in the renewal of their visas.  To  make

matters  worse,  new applications  are  quite  often

rejected. Since Singaporeans are more interested  in

the  materialistic world which they  are  surrounded

with, only a few join the religious orders. There is

great  difficulty  among  the  religious  orders  in

maintaining  the services, institutions  and  homes,

which  they  have admirably maintained for  so  many

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's speech, however, has failed to

mention  the problems faced by the Port of Singapore

Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics in this case are very deceiving. Since

the  PSA  raised their tariffs late last year,  many

vessels have avoided coming to the docks in order to

avoid  paying  the very high charges. Statistically,

during the first half of this year as compared  with

that of last year,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



there  is a greater turn-round of ships and  greater

handling of cargo. But one most important thing  has

been  covered up by these statistics issued  by  the

PSA;  and that is, there is a great volume of  cargo

being  handled at the roads, for which  the  PSA  is

losing  money. These ships at the roads avoid paying

the  many  charges  involved, if  they  had  docked.

Thereby Singapore is losing a great deal of money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary for some sort of remedial action

to be taken to alleviate this abnormal situation. In

the  long run more and more shipping companies would

be  wise to the game and would discharge their cargo

in  the  roads instead. This is not a good omen  for

Singapore.  Either the tariffs are lowered  or  some

other  means  have to be adopted to bring  back  the

"lost"  ships.  Just because we  are  enjoying  boom

conditions in other sectors, it does not  mean  that

we  should  neglect  or gloss  over  the  statistics

issued  by  the PSA. Otherwise one of our  important

sources of income may dry up through neglect  and  a

false picture created by statistics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time may I also bring to the attention of

the  Government the plight of the lower income group

in  the civil service. With the cost of living going

up,  these  workers  are  the  ones  who  are  being

neglected, and they are finding it extremely hard to

stretch the dollar. It is time that review of  their

salary  structures  be  considered  immediately.  If

there  is going to be a wage revision, may 1 suggest

that  the  lower  income group workers  be  given  a

higher  percentage of the increase  as  against  the

increase for the higher Division officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the civil service and in the statutory boards

it is the officer with the proper qualifications who

gets   the   promotion  and  not  the  person   with

capabilities. A person with a University degree  can

be assured of a promotion when competing with a non-graduate  for  a  certain post,  although  the  non-graduate

may  be more experienced and  quite  often

more  capable  than  the graduate.  This  system  of

giving  University graduates preferential  treatment

in everything has thus produced a dis-satisfied



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



civil service, particularly in the case of

the  non-graduate  who is a very capable  person.  I

would suggest that it is important for it to be well

known generally that, in theory and in practice,  it

is  possible for meritorious officers to be promoted

to  higher grades, even though they may not have the

educational  qualifications  normally  required  for

direct  entry into the grade, provided  always  that

they  are in all respects capable of performing  the

duties  of  the higher grade. Therefore, the  stress

should  be laid on performance and potential  rather

than  on formal qualifications. There should  always

be   promotional  opportunities  open   to   serving

officers capable of high performance. Therefore,  at

all  levels of the service a number of vacancies  in

the  recruitment grades should be made available for

in-service promotion for such officers. It  is  also

important that an officer should benefit immediately

on  promotion  and  that  the  promotional  increase

should  he a meaningful one, i.e., it should  be  an

amount   representing  not  less  than  one   normal

increment on the salary scale of the post  to  which

the officer is promoted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scheme should also he framed to give more than

one annual increment to officers as an incentive  to

officers  for  their exceptionally good  performance

during the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in respect of the rising cost of living,

pensioners   who   had   retired   prior   to    the

implementation  of  consolidated  salaries   -   not

myself, there are others- should have their pensions

computed  to the equivalent of the consolidation  in

order to keep up with the times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this term of Parliament saw the

introduction of a new Ministry. The Ministry of  the

Environment was formed at a very apt moment.  It  is

worth  noting  that the Ministry has many  important

responsibilities under its care.  A  few  years  ago

there  was  a  smog  in  Japan,  which  considerably

hindered  its economic performance. This was  mainly

due  to  too many industries operating at  the  same

time,  thus  causing serious air pollution.  I  also

understand that in Los Angeles, USA,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



and  in Fleet Street in London there are times  when

the  public  are  advised not  to  do  any  physical

exercise! This is due to the existence of  bad  air.

However,  Singapore has recently taken precautionary

measures  such  as the establishment  of  the  Anti-Pollution  Unit  and  other  measures  to  keep  the

environment free from this menace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last few weeks we noticed a haze now

and  again  appearing in our country. Never  in  the

history of Singapore, other than this moment, did we

come  across  haze.  Though  the  Ministry  of   the

Environment  has  given words  of  consolation  that

there  is  no reason for any alarm, nevertheless  in

the long-term interest it is important to the public

that  the  air is kept safe. Steps must be taken  to

ensure  that the people will not be infected by  any

form of sickness caused by this mysterious haze.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion moved by the

Member for Bukit Batok.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chin, you shall be the last speaker

for the day.



<br><br>4.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied) (in Mandarin):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I would like to thank the  President

for  his Address to Parliament on the opening of the

First  Session of this Parliament. I would  like  to

stress  on  two points here. The first is about  the

Constitutional  amendment and the  second  is  about

environmental  health. These two problems  are  very

closely  related  to the lives  and  safety  of  our

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the President pointed out that

our  Constitution will be amended to provide  for  a

minimum  of  two-thirds  majority  in  a  referendum

before Singapore could form a federation or could be

merged  with  another country. This is a  very  wise

proposal.  The  people of Singapore know  very  well

that  since  independence the  developments  in  our

country   have  received  the  admiration  of   many

countries. Our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



country  has  made  great  progress  - from  economic

difficulties   to   the   threshold   of    economic

development.  These achievements have not  descended

upon  us  from heaven. These achievements have  been

made possible by the great effort and dedication  of

our people. We must preserve the precious fruits  of

our  success. We must not allow other people through

any  process to take away the fruits of our success.

The  Constitutional  amendment will  strengthen  the

sovereignty  of  our  country.  This  is  absolutely

necessary  at the present juncture. I am  wholly  in

support of this proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the Speech of the President,

it  can be seen that in many respects the Government

is  looking after the livelihood of the people  very

well. The Government is set to raise the standard of

living  of our people. This can be seen through  the

establishment  of  the Ministry of the  Environment.

This  shows  the determination of the Government  in

this  respect.  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  following  active

economic development, more and more industries  have

been   established.  The  problem  of  environmental

health  then becomes more and more serious. In  many

advanced  cities  like  Tokyo  and  New  York,   air

pollution  has become an insurmountable problem.  It

has affected the lives and safety of the people.  In

the last few years, air pollution tended to increase

because of the rapid industrialisation in Singapore.

As  a  result of economic progress, there  are  more

vehicles  on  the roads, more radio  and  television

sets   in  Singapore,  contributing  to  more  noise

pollution   which   will   gradually   affect    the

tranquility  and  health of our living  environment.

Before  these  can seriously affect our  living  and

safety,  the  establishment of the Ministry  of  the

Environment  now is a far-sighted and a very  timely

proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think adopting legal measures alone is not

sufficient to combat pollution. This matter must  be

the  concern of everyone in Singapore.  I  hope  the

Ministry  will  introduce concrete and comprehensive

proposals   to  improve  environmental   health   in

Singapore.  Besides the Ministry of  Culture,  which

should do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



its   best   to   disseminate  the   importance   of

environmental health, and the Ministry of  Education

which  must impart its importance to all our  school

children, everybody must voluntarily respond to  the

call  for  environmental health. Civic organisations

should   systematically  and  periodically  organise

campaigns  to  preserve  our  environmental  health.

Vehicles  should  be  regularly  serviced  and  they

should  use anti-pollution devices. Industries  must

play  their part in preventing pollution by adopting

suitable measures and methods and to avoid pollution-causing processes. We must at all cost preserve  the

cleanliness  and  wholesomeness  of   the   air   in

Singapore. Hawkers must also do their bit to prevent

the  pollution  of  the environment  and  the  water

source.  Sir,  I  must stress that  the  problem  of

environmental health can be solved only when we  all

can  see that it is directly related to our standard

of  living and national safety and when we  all  can

actively  and  voluntarily  adopt  early  preventive

measures.  How to make our people realise the  close

relationship  this problem bears to us  and  how  to

thoroughly  solve it, I think, depend on the  effort

of all our people.

all  these  addenda.  May I,  therefore,  move  that
