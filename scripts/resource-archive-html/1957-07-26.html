<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15-



<pre>

 Ord. of        Amendment proposed - [25th July, 1957] -

   1957.     In page 80, line 27, after "him", to insert

             ", provided  that  the provisions  of  this

             section shall also  apply in respect of the

             Districts described in the First and Second

             Schedules  to this  Ordinance  respectively

             from  those  existing under  the  Municipal

             Ordinance  and from  those described in the

             Local Government Ordinance, 1957." - [Mr John Ede].

</pre>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the words proposed to

be inserted, be there inserted."



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> The Government agreed with

alacrity apparently to make the change proposed by the

Rural  Board  in  putting Nee Soon  Village  into  the

district  of  Serangoon instead of Bukit Panjang,  and

the Rural Board is a wholly nominated body, not one of

whom  therefore  is an elected representative  of  Nee

Soon  Village,  and  the  Government  refused  changes

advocated  by  elected  City Councillors  and  elected

Members  of this House. Nevertheless, this shows  that

the  Government can make changes if it wants  to,  but

only apparently if it wants to, without being prepared

to  listen to public representations. The point,  Sir,

whether   the   changes  are  minor   or   major   is,

nevertheless,  not the main point. The main  point  is

the question of principle. The Government has time  in

which  to  accept this principle, and  therefore  this

amendment,   if   it  has  the  inclination,   because

elections will only be held in March 1958.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart (Acting Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Chief Secretary (Mr S. T. Stewart):</b> Mr

Chairman,  Sir,  in  connection with  the  Member  for

Tanglin's  remarks about the Rural  Board,  the  Rural

Board   has  seven  members  nominated  by  the  rural

district committees and these seven members are  quite

outspoken  in their views, as the Member for Serangoon

himself will know, having himself



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2288</b></font><br><br>



been   a  member  of  the  Rural  District  Committee,

Serangoon. If I may reminisce for a moment, Sir,  when

I  was  Chairman of the Rural Board, I  always  had  a

little  bit of trepidation going to the Rural District

Committee, Serangoon, knowing the outspokenness of all

the  members,  and  I think their  views  were  always

heard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is incorrect to say that the Government

did  not  consider the views of the City  Council.  It

did,  but  it  could  not  accept  the  arguments  put

forward. There has been no prejudice in favour of  the

Rural Board, Sir, because you will see from the Report

of   the   Select  Committee  proceedings   that   the

Government  also did not accept the arguments  of  the

Rural Board in regard to Pasir Panjang.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I think the question is

simply  this - whether or not the Government is prepared

to  accept  the principle now that fresh changes  have

been  made in Select Committee of advertising them  in

four languages and gazetting them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Mr Chairman,

Sir, the changes were made when the Bill was committed

to  a Select Committee. The First and Second Schedules

had  been made known before the Bill was presented  to

the  Assembly for First Reading in August 1956.  Since

then   it  had  been  open  to  the  public  to   make

representations  in regard to this  particular  clause

15,  so  that  the  Select  Committee  could  consider

whether  or not the First and Second Schedules  should

be amended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee has taken a very long time to

consider the Bill and has made a recommendation  that,

in regard to the Second Schedule, there should be some

alterations as a result of representations made by the

Rural  Board.  But surely it should not  be  suggested

that,  as  a  result, it should again be open  to  the

public  to  make  further objections, and  if  further

objections  are received and reconsidered,  and  still

further alterations made, then, using the same line of

argument, we should, every time we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2289</b></font><br><br>



amend something as a result of representations made by

the  public, again make it open to objections  by  the

public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I

just  want to draw the attention of this House to  the

fact  that  when representation is made  to  a  Select

Committee,  it  will  be made on  any  clause  in  the

Bill - any  clause  in  the Bill, Sir,  it  is  not  any

particular clause. Whereas when the Government propose

to have their ideas embodied in clause 15, it is for a

particular purpose, and that is about boundaries.  The

two  issues therefore should not be confused.  One  is

representation  on  the  whole  Bill.  The  other   is

representation  on a particular clause which  concerns

changes   of  districts  and  boundaries.  The   Chief

Minister has, in order to score just one point,  found

it  good enough to lump the two together. This I think

is most unsatisfactory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Sir, I was talking about the Government's

views  on amendments being thrown out. I will be  very

mild  today, and will pass them over. However, I would

like  the Government to note that every Member in this

Assembly represents the voice of his constituency. The

Labour  Front has seven elected Members today. It  has

come  down  from  ten to seven. The Liberal-Socialists

have  gone  up from six to seven elected Members,  and

whatever  it is - seven members on one side,  seven  on

the other - the views are as important on one side as on

the other. I will just leave it at that, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16-



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 80, line 30, to leave out "twelve" and

insert "eighteen".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clause 16 deals with the constitution of

District   Councils   and  the   number   of   elected

councillors  to be provided. It is our  view  that  an

elected   body   of   12   district   councillors   is

insufficient and that there should be 18. Our reasons



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2290</b></font><br><br>



are  based  largely on the arguments we  have  already

submitted with regard to the City Council, and  it  is

not  our  desire  to pursue the same  arguments  again

today, except in so far as they are strictly relevant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we do consider very seriously, Sir, that 12 is

an  insufficient number to do the work of  a  District

Council on the basis of standing committees, which  is

the foundation of the running of local government.  It

seems to us that there should be at least six standing

committees   to   make  a  District  Council   operate

efficiently - Establishment, Health,  Building,  Finance

and  General  Purposes, Public Works, and  Assessment.

There  are  nine  standing  committees  in  the   City

Council. We do not think that it is necessary to  have

quite  so  many  in  the District  Councils,  but  the

minimum should be six. If you assume that each  member

should sit on two committees - it is the normal practice

in  the City Council and it might well be followed  in

the District Councils - you will find that you will only

have  five members on each committee with a quorum  of

three  at  the most. And 18 members would give  you  a

slightly larger committee of six, with presumably  the

District  Council chairmen as permanent  chairmen,  at

least to begin with, of all these committees, making a

more  reasonable  total of seven. The  Government  was

considerably surprised in the Select Committee when  I

advocated  these  what I considered  to  be  perfectly

normal,  reasonable points, but the  hon.  Member  for

Seletar stated at col. 68 of the Report:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". . .we have not considered whether or not a

District  Council should have all these committees  or

whether it would be desirable to delegate authority to

certain heads of departments, and so on."



<br><br>Well,  I  hope  that by this time the  Government  has

given the matter more consideration. It seemed to be a

startling thought to the hon. Member that there should

be  standing  committees to operate the work  of  the

District   Councils,  although  you  will  find,   Mr

Chairman, on page 9 of the White Paper issued  by  the

Government these fulsome words:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2291</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In accepting the basic principles of the Report of

the  Committee on Local Government, the Government  is

convinced  that a more democratic framework  is  being

set up in which greater opportunities will be afforded

to  a  larger number of the community to take part  in

local government administration...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if you express this warm-hearted view and then

later  on  in Select Committee said that you were  not

certain  whether all the work should not be  delegated

to  heads  of departments who would be responsible  to

Government,   and  apparently  not  to  the   District

Councils, then you are knocking your own principles on

the head.



<br><br>10.15 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is, of course, that a greater number

on  these District Councils - 18 instead of 12 - will give

more   experience  to  more  people  in  the  shortest

possible  time,  and that is after all precisely  what

has   been   expressed  on  page  9   of   the   White

Paper - "greater  opportunities will be  afforded  to  a

larger  number of the community to take part in  local

government administration".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, I would refer to - it is not so important

but  nevertheless  it is relevant - the  fact  that  the

quorum  for  the District Councils has been  fixed  at

eight,  which is over 50 per cent of the total  number

envisaged  by  the  Government; whereas  in  the  City

Council the quorum is 11, or roughly 33 per cent. Now,

of  course,  the  normal quorum  for  any  council  or

committee is in the neighbourhood of one-third and not

one-half,  but  you have to fix the quorum  at  eight,

otherwise  the  number  at District  Council  meetings

could  be extremely small, which does, I think,  argue

that a slightly larger number would be opportune.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Sir, although the hon. Member has

misunderstood  me  in  the  Select  Committee,  I  did

correct  him  by  saying that  I  did  not  mean  that

District Councils should not appoint any committees. I

would  like  to read from col. 69 of the  same  Report

where I said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would like to correct the hon. Member's

misunderstanding regarding committees. I did  not  say

that   the   District  Councils  should  not   appoint

committees but what I said was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2292</b></font><br><br>



that we have not fixed the exact number."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this stage, I do not think it is possible

for  anybody  to say how many committees the  District

Councils  should  have.  As I understand  it,  Sir,  a

working  party  is  in the course of  considering  the

various  aspects of the District Councils, and  I  was

not  in a position to agree with the hon. Member  then

as  to how many committees the District Councils would

have.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Stewart:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the present Rural

Board  has  a  membership  of  18  nominated  members,

including  the  chairman. The proposed membership  for

each District Council, including the Chairman, is  16.

If  the  Rural Board, which is looking after  an  area

which  is to be divided up into three District Council

areas  initially and four eventually, has a membership

of  18,  then  I  think 16 members for  each  District

Council is quite sufficient. As the Member for Tanjong

Pagar said yesterday on this question of membership in

connection with the City Council - "Let us start  at  32

and  see how it works," - the same should also apply  to

the  District Councils. As to what standing committees

there  should be and the quorum required at  committee

meetings, it is not for the Government to say. It will

be left to the District Councils eventually. For those

reasons,  Sir, I think that 16 members, including  the

chairman, is a sufficient number for the membership of

the  District  Council, and I oppose the amendment  of

the Member for Tanglin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the proposal

to  amend the number from 12 to 18 is also hinged upon

the next amendment, that is, to do away with nominated

councillors,  and  if  the  Government   thinks   that

nominated  councillors are still very important  here,

then  the  number  need not be  changed.  We  will  be

arguing  on  the merits or demerits of  the  nominated

councillors  when we come to the next  amendment.  But

bearing in mind that if it is agreed that the days  of

nominated  members are over, if the  people  have  now

shown that they are tired of having nominated members,

then  we  should act in accordance with the wishes  of

the people and do away with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2293</b></font><br><br>



nominated  members. And if we do away  with  nominated

members,  then that number as contained in  clause  16

(1) should be increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the work of the Rural Board, I

would  like  to point out to the House here  that  the

Rural   Board  is  assisted  by  many  rural  district

committees.  Part  of the work is being  done  by  the

rural   district   committees.   They   submit   their

recommendations to the Rural Board and  if  the  Rural

Board  thinks that their recommendations are  suitable

and in conformity with the policy, the recommendations

are accepted. If they are not, then they are rejected,

because  these committees are purely advisory.  It  is

advisory  to such an extent that sometimes members  of

district  committees were not happy and  became  quite

frustrated,  and tempers might fly on  occasions  when

important personalities went along and visited them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Rural Board, as I say, is assisted by many

committees,  but when you divide the Rural  Board  and

make  it into three rural District Council areas,  and

if  the  Rural Board is to have one Health  Committee,

then  that Health Committee must be repeated in  three

places.  If  it  is  going to have a Public  Utilities

Committee, that committee will have to be repeated  in

every  one  of these three. There will be no lessening

of committees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it may be argued that the Rural Board

attends to the needs of the whole of Singapore outside

the  City Council, and therefore it must have a  great

deal more work. But I would like to ask the Government

side  what is the purpose of having District Councils.

The  purpose of a District Council is to attend to the

needs of the people more closely and more efficiently,

and if we are going to attend to them more efficiently

and  more  closely, making the councillors  understand

the  needs  of the people, then we will say  that  the

work  should not decrease even if you divide the Rural

Board  into three District Council areas; but, on  the

other hand, it should increase, because an increase in

work  shows  that these District Councils  are  really

working



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2294</b></font><br><br>



hard  for the people and work is done more intimately.

I feel that the number should be increased to 18.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It did not appear to me, from the hon.

mover's  remarks,  that  his amendment  which  we  are

discussing  now is connected with the next  amendment,

which  is to leave out the proviso providing for three

nominated  councillors for the  first  four  years.  I

understood  from the Member for Serangoon,  who  spoke

just  now, that there was some connection between  the

two  amendments. Perhaps the hon. mover would like  to

clarify?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Yes, Mr Chairman, with pleasure. There is

obviously some connection between the two. We advocate

the  increase  of membership of the District  Councils

from 12 elected councillors to 18, and subsequently to

do   away   with  the  proposal  for  three  nominated

councillors.  The  fact that we  wish  to  reduce  the

number  from  15 to 12, I think makes it evident  from

our  feelings that there are not enough members on the

District Councils, and we must, under clause  16  (1),

propose  an  increase. There is, in other words,  some

connection between the two amendments.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If that is so, I suggest that it would

be  convenient to the Committee if, in the  debate  on

the first amendment, the debate should also range over

the   next  amendment.  If  the  mover  of  the  first

amendment wishes to continue on those lines, he may do

so.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Yes, Mr Chairman, if you would like us to

take  into  consideration the next  amendment  to  the

proviso, I shall of course be very glad to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our point regarding this proviso,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided that for the first four years from the

date  of  the first ordinary elections...there shall  in

addition be three nominated councillors",



<br><br>is  that we feel that it is essential to do away  with

the principle of nominated members. But the Government

apparently wishes to hang on to the idea of  nominated

members,  presumably because through  them  they  have

hung on to power. Yesterday, on the amendment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2295</b></font><br><br>



to  clause  8 of the Local Government  Elections

Bill,  there  was a division which showed  11  elected

votes  on each side. The Government has a majority  of

six,  thanks to three nominated Members and three  ex-officio Members. It is quite obvious, therefore,  that

they are interested in seeing that there are nominated

members on the District Councils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various devices whereby the Government are

able  to maintain themselves where they are. Even when

the  Hon. the  Chief  Secretary goes  on  leave,  the

Government  can  resort to the device  of  keeping  up

their numbers by the Deputy Chief Secretary being able

to  step  into his place. It is, of course,  purely  a

matter  of coincidence that the Deputy Chief Secretary

is an authority on local government and an ex-chairman

of  the  Rural Board, but that fact is undoubtedly  of

value and use to the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One presumes that with this proviso one of the last

acts  of  the  present Government  will  be  to  elect

nominated  men to the District Councils who will  last

for  four years, and I think I am right in saying that

there   is   no   proviso - that  is  an   interesting

point - giving  the  Minister  powers  to  revoke  their

nomination.  Now  we  have had  some  debate  on  this

particular  question - I  think  it  was  the   Seamen's

Registry  Board  Ordinance on  which  we  raised  this

point, that revocation was an essential matter  to  be

left  in  the hands of the Minister. The Minister  for

Commerce  and  Industry shakes his  head.  Perhaps  my

memory is at fault - it was a different Bill?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> May I correct the hon. Member, Sir? It was

the Education Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, undoubtedly it is already in

the  Education Bill, but I was referring to the debate

in this House on a particular Bill. It was moved by my

hon. Friend opposite - I may be wrong about the title of

the  Bill in which we moved an amendment on this  very

point.  Now it is not clear to me why, in the case  of

nominated members on District Councils, the Minister's

powers of revocation should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2296</b></font><br><br>



be  omitted. It seems to me that what is convenient at

one   time  for  the  Government  is  not  necessarily

convenient at another



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a further point. One would have thought

that  one  of  the justifications for shifting  Katong

into a District Council - whether one agrees with it  or

not - and  we do not - might have been because  one  could

argue that, by putting a part of the City Council into

the District Council, you were providing opportunities

for men already experienced in local government to sit

on  the  District  Councils and that very  fact  would

enable  you to do away with nominated members. We  are

strongly   opposed  to  this  principle  of  nominated

members  being included in the District Councils,  and

that  is  one  of the reasons why we advocate  in  the

amendment  before us that there should be  18  elected

councillors instead of 12.



<br><br>10.30 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, it is rather curious to

find one of the closest allies and leading members  of

the  Party which tailored the Rendel Constitution  and

which recommended four nominated seats on this present

Assembly,  now criticising the principle of  nominated

members.  Evidently, Sir, at that  time  they  thought

they would be returned to power and they could use the

four  nominated members to their advantage. The tables

have  been turned on them. But let me assure them that

at  no time have the Government used or persuaded  any

of  the two nominated members on the opposite side  to

vote  with  them.  What  they  do  is  on  their   own

conscience  and  according to their  own  liking.  But

evidently,  Sir,  the  logic of  the  Members  of  the

Liberal-Socialist  Party is one that  they  themselves

only can understand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government thought it necessary that in the

initial  stage  of these new District Councils,  there

should   be  nominated  members  to  give   of   their

experience, because, as you will notice in  the  Bill,

anyone  can  now  stand for election in  the  District

Council. There are no language qualifications  to  bar

people who have had no experience. In the past,  those

people who have had experience of local government and

other similar bodies have been mostly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2297</b></font><br><br>



English-speaking.  Now there  is  no  such  bar.  And

therefore  you will get a great number of  people - and

we want to encourage a great number of people who are

non-English-speaking,  to come  out  and  take  their

share of local government. But in order to give  them

the  advantage of having the experience of those  who

have  gone  through  the mill  in  the  past,  it  is

necessary  that  there  should  be  a  few  nominated

members  in the initial stage. It is not proposed  to

have these nominated members forever and ever. It  is

only for the initial stage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> You may extend it.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I had not intended to speak

on  the  warning  given by my friend the  Member  for

Serangoon  in the debate on the amendment which  came

up  before this amendment - that the Labour Front  have

seven  elected Members now and the Liberal-Socialists

have  seven,  and therefore we should  take  care.  I

would  have  let  it pass, but the  hon.  Member  for

Tanglin  has grazed past that point. He has not  come

to it directly but he has grazed past it, and I think

it  is appropriate that they should be told that they

are wrong. Sir, when the electorate elected us to sit

in  this  Assembly, they elected ten Labour  Fronters

and   only  four  Progressive  Party  men   and   two

Democratic Party men. Since then, if elected  Members

manoeuvre  to their own advantage, that is their  own

wish.  The  electorate have had  no  chance  to  pass

judgment  on them. Therefore you cannot say that  the

electorate have lost confidence because three Members

on this side have crossed the floor to the Opposition

side. You might say, of course, that in Cairnhill the

electorate  have shown that they have more confidence

in  the Liberal-Socialist Party. I will make no bones

about  that.  Perhaps it is due  to  a  splitting  of

Labour votes.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is all this relevant?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> It is, Sir, because the Member

for  Serangoon did raise the point and the Member for

Tanglin did emphasise again on this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2298</b></font><br><br>



point, and I think it should not go unchallenged.  It

would be misleading the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is, of course, perfectly in

order for the hon. Member, in passing, to refute  any

allegations  made;  but I must  remind  hon.  Members

again  that  the personal conduct of Members  of  the

Assembly  shall  not be referred  to  except  upon  a

substantive motion moved for that purpose. If an hon.

Member moves from one side of the House to the other,

that is personal conduct and cannot be referred to.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I am sorry, Sir. I did not

intend to refer to their personal conduct. I was just

mentioning it in passing in answer to the point  made

by  the Member for Serangoon earlier this morning. Of

course,  the people of Singapore have also  seen  the

merging  of  two political parties who were  sent  to

this House in the proportion of four to twenty-five -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is

going a bit too far. It is more than in passing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Sir, the last

speaker  has  several times said in his  speech  that

other  people  have  no logic at all  and  that  they

themselves can only understand what they are  talking

about.  I  must say that he has just now given  us  a

perfect  exhibition  of talking  about  things  which

nobody can understand. Sir, I do not want to waste as

much  time as he has done in accusing this  Party  or

that  Party, but one thing is certain, Sir.  We  have

seen and we have learnt a lesson, that the government

should  not be run when the elected Members  on  each

side   of  the  House  are  nearly  in  proportionate

numbers.  The fate of the Government should not  hang

on nominated Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I thought I made it quite clear

that  that subject is not relevant to the debate.  It

should not be mentioned again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> That was a reply in passing, Sir,

to the hon. Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think one of the chief reasons for breaking

up local government into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2299</b></font><br><br>



City  and  District Councils and the  appointment  of

elected  councillors, was that the District  Councils

and  the  City Council should be the training  ground

for Members of this House the membership of which, in

the  near future, is going to be increased to 51.  If

that is one of the chief principles why this Bill  is

now  before  the House, then I cannot see any  reason

for  the Government to object to the increase  of  12

district  councillors  to  18  district  councillors,

particularly when we are saying - and I think in  their

own hearts they must agree with us - that there is  no

more room for nominated councillors on any council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main objection of the Hon. the Chief Secretary

and  his Assistant Minister to this is that it is not

proved   yet   how  many  district  councillors   are

required,  because the number of committees  has  not

yet been decided upon. Surely that argument is rather

in  our favour because if you are not certain yet how

many committees you want and how to work them, is  it

not  better to have more than less and not wreck  the

beginnings of the City and District Councils? So far,

Sir,  I  cannot see any argument at all  against  our

proposal to have 18 instead of 12 elected members.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> As a nominated Member,

I  find  it  difficult to agree to the  amendment  to

delete  the  proviso  for the  appointment  of  three

nominated members in the District Council. I have  so

far  found, Sir, that my nominated colleagues  and  I

are   the   four  most  important  persons  in   this

Assembly - four  persons  who  cannot  be  charged  for

malpractices  in  any election!  But  there  is  this

difference - now   the  nominated   Members   will   be

appointed,  I  presume, by the Council of  Ministers,

our  own  people;  our own elected  Members  are  the

majority in the Council of Ministers. There  is  that

difference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to

answer  the Member for Serangoon. He said that  there

are  district committees helping the Rural Board. Has

he  any  reason  to  suppose that when  the  District

councils were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2300</b></font><br><br>



formed, there would be no district committees helping

the  District Councils? Perhaps he has an  answer  to

that.  Perhaps  he would be going all  out,  Sir,  to

dissolve  all  district committees when the  District

Councils were formed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does seem, Sir, that the Liberal-Socialists, in

their attempt to increase the number of Members  both

in  the  City  Council and in the District  Councils,

have displayed their financial strength - that superior

element  over  all the other political Parties.  They

might be able to put up more candidates because  they

have  more  finances,  but  we  feel  that  is  quite

irrelevant,  and we believe that 32 members  for  the

City  Council  and  12 for the District  Council  are

sufficient.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Sir, this Bill is very

important  since we are changing the whole  Ordinance

by  taking  away some powers and giving some  powers,

and  yet it is being rushed through in this Assembly;

for it was only yesterday that we received the report

which, after it had been in our hands for only a  few

minutes, was debated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is an important debate, and I cannot

understand  why  some Members should bring  political

Parties  into  it. Possibly they are  afraid  of  one

strong political Party, but it will not help them  to

side-track  the  issue. Sir, here  is  the  question:

whether we want to have nominated Members or not. Now

this   very  Assembly,  which  is  supposed   to   be

democratic,  has been made a farce with the  help  of

the nominated Members and ex-officio Members, because

the  elected Members' majority voice is just silenced

by  those  votes.  The nominated  Members  are  quite

intelligent  people; they are my  friends,  but  this

nominated membership in democracy is out of date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some remarks made about the Rendel

Constitution  yesterday and also  today,  as  to  who

framed it and so on. Sir, I am the most senior Member

in  the  post-war Legislature. I was  on  the  B.M.A.

Council,  the  Advisory Council, and the  Legislative

Council from 1948. I have two good friends



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2301</b></font><br><br>



here,  the Hon. the Chief Minister and the  Hon. the

Assistant Minister for Home Affairs or something.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my experience is that as political progress is

made,  political changes must come about. Some people

attack   the   Progressive  Party  for   the   Rendel

Constitution and the nominated seats.



<br><br>10.45 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, those who have followed the political

trends in the post-war period in this city will  have

realised  that  from a purely nominated  Legislature,

you  came to one that had an elected majority with  a

few   nominated  Members.  Time  passed   and   other

countries surrounding us progressed. Then the  Rendel

Commission sat and I might tell you, Sir, that I  was

not  a  member  of the Progressive Party.  I  crossed

swords  with them in the Legislature many a  time  on

different subjects. Now the Rendel Commission saw  at

that  time  that there was a need for a few nominated

Members;  but  as  time  went  on,  from  a   totally

nominated Legislature we began to have more and  more

elected Members and, in the new constitution  we  are

going  to have a fully elected Assembly. Now  instead

of  acknowledging  the services of those  people  who

progress  and who have been the means of bringing  us

into  this Chamber, some Members are making political

capital  out  of  it. I think they  are  very  short-sighted  or  maybe they are trying to side-track  us.

Now   in  this  present  political  set-up  nominated

Members are out of place altogether as the voices  of

the elected Members are silenced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Sir, I read in the Straits Times that an

amendment moved yesterday was passed by 17  votes  to

11.   Whose  were  those  17  votes?  Eleven  elected

Government  votes against 11 in the  Opposition.  Six

were not elected Members. Rightly the Government fell

on that issue. Now here is a political Party, Sir, to

which  somebody  made a reference  regarding  elected

Members. Members on the Government side bring this up

time and again, and I am rather sorry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2302</b></font><br><br>



that  I should also bring it up now regarding elected

Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think I have made it quite

clear  that  the  subject is now irrelevant  to  this

debate, and I think the hon. Member should not  touch

on it any further.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I am still on the nominated

membership and how these nominated Members  frustrate

us - the  elected  Members - and how the Government  have

continued  with  the  help of the nominated  Members.

That is what I am touching upon, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In passing?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Well, I will agree to say that I am

touching on it in passing. It does not matter, but it

is  so.  The fact stands that these nominated Members

are out-dated and there should not be anywhere in the

world  at present nominated membership. If those  who

feel  like wanting to be in this Assembly,  let  them

stand for election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I was a little bit annoyed when a Member

on the Government side said, "Oh, I am rather sick of

the  debate." But he forgot that he is paid  for  his

time   sitting  in  this  Assembly.  He  should  have

patience.  At least such people should show  patience

because, after all, some elected Members on this side

are  voicing the opinions of the electorate.  Sir,  I

support  the  amendment moved  by  my  colleague  the

Member for Tanglin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas (Nominated):</b> I am sure, Mr

Chairman, that we all recognise that it is  the  duty

of  the  Opposition to oppose, and this House owes  a

great  debt to the only Member of the Opposition  who

has  effectively  opposed - he is the hon.  Member  for

Tanglin - supported occasionally by the  Members  for

Serangoon and Paya Lebar, and last by yet another  of

his  seven Members who has risen to speak on a  point

on  which  he has so often spoken before, usually  as

irrelevantly as he did today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to cast scorn on the hon. Member for

Tanglin's arguments:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2303</b></font><br><br>



but  they  do seem to me to amount to not  much  more

than this - that the more representatives you have on a

council, the more democratic you are; if you can have

18 elected members instead of 12, that is better; and

I  do  not doubt that 180 would be better still,  and

1,800  better still, and 18,000 better still. So  you

go  on  getting  more and more democratic  by  simply

adding to the numbers without any regard to the  work

these members may have to do. I think that is a  fair

summary of the points he was making. He does not know

what  work they are going to do. He has his own ideas

but  I do not suppose he will be either nominated  or

elected  to a District Council, and therefore  surely

he  will concede that elected members of the District

Councils can form their own ideas of the sort of work

they want to do and how they want to do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to my second point, Mr Chairman,

Sir. His other main democratic principle is that  the

City Council provides a perfect and ideal example  of

pure,  undefiled  and efficient  democracy.  Well,  I

quoted  some  points  to  which  no  one  effectively

replied  yesterday to illustrate  that  if  the  City

Council functions efficiently, it is perhaps in spite

of  its  committee system rather than because of  it.

The committees sit afternoon after afternoon and deal

with  enormous bundles of files containing a mass  of

irrelevant detail about holidays in China  for  fruit

sellers  and  hot  drink licences for  confectioners'

shops and that kind of thing. These are matters which

take  up  an enormous amount of their time. They  can

never get down to formulating a precise policy.  When

they  do  have to formulate a policy, they bog  down.

How  long  did  they  take over the  delimitation  of

taxis?  Two  years,  or some such  very  long  period

indeed, before they could finally frame a policy  and

get  it  carried  out.  They also  came  to  complete

confusion  with  the  Katong  cinema.  None  of  them

understand their own procedure and nobody knows  what

they  are  trying to do, or who is giving  orders  to

whom;  but  the  general  effect  on  the  public  is

undesirable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2304</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am only mentioning these points in passing, Mr

Chairman, because I do feel that we should not set up

the  City Council as a model for the things that  the

District Councils will have to do. They will  operate

on  a different scale, doing in many ways a different

type  of  job.  They  will not be administering  very

large  public utilities, nor will they have a  budget

of  the  size that the City Council have. They should

be  given  some freedom to work things out themselves

from  their  own experience and not be too  precisely

directed   beforehand  by  the   ambitions   of   any

particular political Party.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I have not been able to

understand the Hon. the nominated Member, Mr Thomas,

the  Minister for Communications and Works. Yesterday

he  read  the Hill Report which is useful, but  since

then things have progressed. Does he want to say that

there  should be only one member or five  members  to

run  the whole city? What is his objection to  having

an  increase  from 12 to 18 on the District  Council?

Will he not give consideration to the electorate - that

they should be adequately represented? He said if  it

were  to be increased, why not increase it to  50  or

100  or  500  members? Well, why not have  only  five

then?  Or three? Has he given any arguments  for  it?

Sir,  these  members should be adequately represented

and the District Councils should be formed in such  a

way  that all these people could perform their  tasks

without  too  much  burden on one shoulder,  that  it

should  be distributed. He has not given us any  idea

of that, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The point I was really making was that

the   general  tendency  of  the  Liberal-Socialists'

thinking  seems to be to add to the numbers  wherever

possible, to have more and more representatives,  and

I  carried  that,  of  course, to  absurd  limits  by

suggesting  that  they might aim at 1,800  or  18,000

because  that  is  absurd - too  absurd  even  for  the

Liberal-Socialists to put forward  that  number.  But

you  have to arrive at some figure, and they say that

18 is better than 12. We think that 12 is better than

18 - it is no more than that-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2305</b></font><br><br>



Our  judgment  is  that 12 is an adequate  number  to

perform the sort of work they have to do. The Liberal-Socialists have worked out that they want to have six

standing committees, and no doubt sub-committees  and

ad hoc committees and so on, on the full City Council

model,  and they think 18 members will be  needed  to

make  that  work.  Well, we do not necessarily  think

that  the members in the District Councils will  want

to  do what the City Council does, and we think  that

12 - plus,   of  course,  three  nominated   members - is

better. I will not touch on further irrelevancies.  I

could, of course, expound on the democratic principle

if I were allowed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substantial difference is very small by the

time  you  arrive at the final total.  It  is  simple

arithmetic:  12  plus 3 - 12 plus  6 - this  is  a  small

difference really.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I seek only a little

clarification. The nominated Member,  Mr  R.  C.  H.

Lim, mentioned the Liberal-Socialists in this debate,

Sir,  that  because they have money they can  put  up

more representatives. The other nominated Member, the

Hon. Mr Thomas, put up the same argument. Their idea

is  this:  the  Liberal-Socialists want more  people.

Why?   Adequate   representation  should   be   given

according to the strength of the voters in particular

areas in order that work must be carried on properly.

Sir,  more  than  95 per cent of the members  of  the

Liberal-Socialist  Party are workers,  and  they  are

poorer than the two Members sitting opposite.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I feel really amused today

to  hear our learned Members, Mr Francis Thomas  and

Mr  R.  C.  H. Lim, speak on the merits of nominated

Members and in the jargon I cannot find any substance

in  their  speeches.  But the last  sentence  of  the

Minister  for  Communications  and  Works  about  his

ability  to  expound the theory of  the  goodness  of

nominated  members will certainly be very welcome.  I

would  really love to hear his arguments on why there

should  be  nominated members, and then  ask  him  to

argue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2306</b></font><br><br>



with  himself why the Labour Front, of which he is  a

leading  light,  is  now  trying  to  do  away   with

nominated  members.  I remember last  year  when  the

Rendel  Constitution  was  operating,  there  was  an

outcry  from the other side that there should  be  no

nominated Members, that it was unconstitutional, that

we   should  do  away  with  all  officials  and  all

nominated  Members,  and that the  number  should  be

increased.  Today in this Chamber we  have  the  same

thing  reversed.  The  Government  will  appoint   an

official to the District Council in the person of the

chairman. The Government will appoint three nominated

members.



<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government said, "We will be happy to keep the

number  down." but at one time it said, "We  want  to

increase  the number of the Legislature  from  25  to

51."  Then  they said, "No, we will keep that  number

where it is." An absolute contradiction. I would like

the  Government to explain why there should  be  such

contradictions.  Words  spoken  last  year  are   not

applicable  today.  Why is that  so?  Where  are  the

changes of circumstances?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, let me go on with what one of the Members

on  the Government side said, that they are going  to

appoint nominated members to the District Councils in

the  initial  stages, in order to lend experience  to

elected  people. I would like to ask  the  Government

why they were setting up rural district committees in

Singapore.  In a small way, was that  not  a  way  to

teach  the people how to run their own affairs?  Have

they not been able, from those committees, to learn a

little and take part fully in their committee work? I

ask  the  Government again: Are there no people  from

such  rural district committees being represented  in

the  Rural  Board, and if they have been representing

the  various  districts in the Rural Board,  are  not

such people well experienced? I ask again, Sir, about

councillors who are in the City Council now living in

areas  demarcated as rural districts. Will not  these

people  also  have the experience, and if  there  has

been  enough  training for them, where is  there  the

necessity to put in other people with experience?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2307</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take another case, Sir, where the Government

contradict themselves. In the City Council  they  say

that  there shall be 32 elected members. There  shall

be no nominated members, no aldermen. "We do not want

them. They are lepers. We must have it democratically

set  up.  Experience does not matter. We do not  want

their  experience. We have enough people here."  Then

in another breath the Government say: "You can rig up

your  boundaries. You can do whatever you  like  with

the  electorate." But nobody could be sure  that  the

same  people or people from the same Party  would  be

elected.  It  would  be the same  with  the  District

Councils.  You  might have people  who  are  standing

there,  as  in the case of City Councillors.  In  the

next City Council, there is a chance that not one  of

the  present Members may be elected. There may  be  a

chance  that all the 32 members will be new  to  City

Council  affairs,  and  then  where  will  there   be

experience? Will you need aldermen to guide  you?  We

say    no.   We   say   people   should   elect   the

representatives democratically. In the  case  of  the

City  Council,  we  want to do  away  with  nominated

members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the District Councils, the same case

can  happen.  There  may be existing  rural  district

committee  members who may be elected. There  may  be

people who are on the Rural Board who may be elected.

There  may  be  people who have served  in  the  City

Council  residing in rural areas who may be  elected.

But  they may or may not be elected, just as  in  the

case of the present City Councillors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here we stick to one principle - there must be

no nominated members either in the City Council or in

the  District  Councils. But  if  you  want  to  have

nominated members, then let us have them in both  the

City  and District Councils. If you do not want them,

let   us  not  have  them  in  both.  The  Government

practised this "No nominated members" from the  level

of  the Legislature to the City Council. I would urge

the  Government  to  practise  it  one  step  further

down - to  the  District Councils.  I  would  like  the

Government to answer me on this point, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2308</b></font><br><br>



if  they  give  no  reason at all,  I  shall  not  be

satisfied.  I shall go away with a feeling  that  the

Government  will always be applying what  they  think

will  suit  them best, and every time,  the  tune  is

changed to suit their own purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In putting forward this incidentally, I would also

like  to  touch  on an answer given by the  nominated

Member, Mr R. C. H. Lim. He has not learnt his homework  on  rural district committees. He said that  if

you  appoint more people, then you do away with rural

district  committees. I do not know whether  that  is

Government's policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> I did not say this, Sir. I said I

challenged  the Member for Serangoon to give  reasons

why  district committees that exist today  would  not

exist when the District Councils were formed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> That is nothing more than a

challenge. The City Council may or may not  have  its

committees. Rural district committees may or may not

be  there, but I think if the city is progressing, in

all  probability District Councils will  be  more  or

less  miniature City Councils and of  course  if  the

hon. Member knows about rural district committees and

their  advisory functions, we will be  very  glad  to

learn from him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is most amusing to hear from the Minister for

Communications  and Works about my Party  wanting  to

elect  more  and more people to the Councils  and  he

quoted astronomical figures - figures that would appear

to  everybody  to be absurd. I feel that  he  is  not

clear  in  his mind as to what he wants to  tell  us,

when  we proposed an increase from 12 to 18 only.  In

fact, if you call in the nominated members, it should

be just from 16 to 18, and yet he puts up an argument

on  numbers  that run into many thousands.  I  cannot

understand that. His argument is against his own idea

of increasing the Legislature from 50 to 51. It would

be  interesting to hear him arguing against  himself.

All in all, I have not heard any argument put forward

from  the  Government side against this amendment.  I

would  very  much like them to use their  brains  and

scratch out some reasons for us.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I think we

agree  in principle that nominated members are out  of

date,  but  in the interests of all those  people  who

live  in the various districts where District Councils

are  to be formed, we feel that nominated members  for

the first four years are required to help them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> What about the City Council?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> There is a difference between the

City  Council and the District Councils. The employees

in  the City Council have been working there for  many

years.  They know and can help and guide the new  City

Councillors who might be appointed for the first time;

but  we  are having new staff for the various District

Councils  and  therefore it is  desirable  that  there

should  be  some nominated members for the first  four

years only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In passing, Sir, I should like to say this: although

the  Liberal-Socialists claim  to  have  95  per  cent

workers, the Labour Front have 100 per cent workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, I just rise to

reply to the insinuations in regard to the question of

nominated  members  for the first four  years  in  the

District Councils. The Liberal-Socialist Members would

have  the people of Singapore believe that this  is  a

sinister move on the part of the Government to put  in

three of their good men in the District Councils. Evil

is he who evil thinks.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2310</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this particular clause in the Bill was inserted

as  a  result of the unanimous recommendation  of  the

McNeice   Committee  on  Local  Government.  On   that

Committee   every  political  Party  was  represented,

including  the  Liberal-Socialists,  and  it  was  the

unanimous view of the McNeice Committee, and this view

is  expressed  in paragraphs 158 and 159*.  I  do  not

propose  to  prolong the debate by reading  these  two

paragraphs, but if the hon. Member will just take  the

trouble  to read them, he will find that the  question

of  nominated members for the new District Councils is

one  which is not being imposed by the Government  but

one  that  was unanimously recommended by the  McNeice

Committee.

<hr size="2" noshade>

* Following are paragraphs 158 and 159-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158. The limited local government constitution in

the rural areas in the past has led us to approach the

constitution  of  rural district  councils  with  some

caution. The weight of responsibility we are proposing

to  place  upon  these  councils is  considerable  and

experience in the management of weighty affairs is not

immediately evident in these areas. Our proposals have

therefore provided measures for the guidance of  these

councils  in  their early years, but  for  a  strictly

limited   period.  Beyond  that  period  it  will   be

necessary for the district councils to make their  own

way,  with the advice of Government and the  model  of

the  City Council before them and, should it turn  out

that   way,   to   learn   by  their   mistakes.   Our

recommendations imply a confidence in the  ability  of

the  rural  peoples  to elect capable  representatives

which we do not consider is misplaced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159. We recommend that the elected membership of

local  councils other than the City Council should  be

supplemented  by the addition of members nominated  by

Government  and  that the number of nominated  members

should form as near as possible to, but not exceed one-fifth  of,  the  total  number of  members  after  the

addition  of  nominated members. Taken in  conjunction

with  our  proposals for terms of office, we recommend

that  as  near as possible to, but not more than  half

of, the nominated members should retire after a period

of  two years and the remainder after a period of four

years.  Thereafter, the rural councils should  consist

of only elected members.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon asks why is it that, in the

case  of  the Legislative Assembly, we want to abolish

all  nominated members, and in the case  of  the  City

Council  too, it is proposed that all nominated  seats

shall  be  abolished. Surely he must understand,  Sir,

that as time goes on we learn more and more. The City

Council started with nine nominated seats in 1948 - nine

years,  quite  long, in fact, much too long.  What  is

recommended for the District Councils is just  a  term

of four years - the first term - to guide and help elected

councillors  do  the  work  which  is  going   to   be

difficult,  because it is something new  to  them.  In

regard  to  the Legislative Council, we  started  with

nominated Members in 1948 and it is also time that the

nominated seats be abolished.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I have taken the trouble to

read  paragraphs  158 and 159 of  the  Report  of  the

Committee  on Local Government, and I would refer  the

Chief   Minister  to  the  penultimate   sentence   of

paragraph 159 which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Taken in conjunction with our proposals for terms

of  office, we recommend that as near as possible  to,

but  not  more  than  half of, the  nominated  members

should  retire  after a period of two  years  and  the

remainder after a period of four years."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 19 of the Bill before us, we read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The nominated councillors shall be appointed by the

Governor  and  shall hold office for a  term  of  four

years  retiring on the first Saturday in  December  in

the fourth year after nomination."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no provision for retirement after two years.

In  other  words,  the Government is going  backwards,

while we propose to go forwards.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, we are living in a world

that is moving forward every day. We are not living in

a world that can remain static for one moment. What is

good for today may not be good for tomorrow. Nominated

members  who were good before, may not be good  today.

People  are today clamouring for elections and elected

representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to comment on what the Chief Minister

has  said - that  we must learn and make  use  of  these

things - the  things which we thought  would  have  been

good.  Banana notes were good in 1943. They were still

good  in  1944.  But  the  day immediately  after  the

Japanese surrendered, they were just worthless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same case with nominated members. They

were  good  in  colonial days.  They  were  good  when

nominated  members were able to serve  their  masters.

But   now   the   people  have  moved  towards   self-determination,  they are as worthless  as  the  banana

notes of the Japanese regime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Chief Minister, since

he   has   accepted  that  part  of  the  advice   and

recommendations of the McNeice Committee on nominated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2312</b></font><br><br>



members  for  the  new District Councils,  what  about

accepting  other  sections  of  that  Report?  Has  he

accepted  all  of them? Has he accepted aldermen?  No,

Sir. When a recommendation is accepted, it is put down

as the Government being amendable to suggestions. What

are  the  reasons  given for not accepting  the  rest?

Well, I should say the most appropriate reason is that

it  does not fall in with their ideas and therefore is

not acceptable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Mr R. C. H. Lim spoke about rural district

councils. He said that they will be run by people with

less  experience. Let him not say that,  Sir,  because

the  Rural Board has been engaged in that kind of work

for  a  long time, and those who are going to do  that

work will be hand-picked for that purpose. However, if

he has his doubts that raw hands will be put into such

jobs, I would suggest that he ask his Minister for the

reason why he has not made sufficient provision to see

to it that the machinery of district councils would be

run properly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 82, line 18, to leave out "A" and insert "B".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take it that I am correct when I say that that has

relation to the amendment to be proposed in the Third

Schedule?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Yes, Mr Chairman, I did wish to seek your

guidance  on  this - it  is, in  fact,  a  consequential

amendment - whether we should take this now or later.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is quite obvious that this

amendment is dependent on whether or not the amendment

which  is  proposed  to  the Third  Schedule  will  be

accepted.  It  is  a  type of consequential  amendment

which  may be made as a matter of course, and  if  the

amendment  proposed  to  the Third  Schedule - in  other

words, the addition of a new Form A - is accepted,  then

this  amendment and other cognate amendments  will  be

made as a matter of course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21-



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 82, line 37, to leave out from "(b)" to ";

and"  in  line 9 in page 83 and insert:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"if he is able to speak any Chinese dialect or Malay or Tamil

or  English and, unless incapacitated by blindness or

any  other physical cause, to read and write any  one

of those dialects or languages".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it will be clear from this amendment that we

on   this  side  do  accept  the  amendment  that  the

Government proposes to make regarding the reading  and

writing of any one of those dialects or languages.  So

the  issue  does  boil down to the question  which  we

consider most strongly - that any Chinese dialect should

be  spoken  by a candidate for election  in  the  City

Council as well as in the District Councils.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2314</b></font><br><br>



I  think  we are, by this amendment, now in  agreement

with  the  Government  on  the  other  parts  of   the

amendment which the Minister will move. This, then, is

the  question for consideration: that the City Council

should  include any Chinese dialect in  its  languages

for candidates for election and not just Mandarin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our feeling is that the City Council should not be

compared with the Legislative Assembly on this  point,

because  it seems that the Government feel that  there

should  be a parallel between the languages spoken  in

this House in future and the City Council. We take the

view  that  there should be a parallel  on  the  local

government plane - that the languages spoken in the City

Council  should  be  the same as  are  spoken  in  the

District  Councils. The point is, of course,  that  we

are debating and considering local government, and the

comparison should be between the City Council and  the

District  Councils.  There is  no  difference  in  the

qualification  of the electorate as between  the  City

and  the District Councils; therefore we should  adopt

the  parallelism of having no difference in  languages

between the two types of councils.



<br><br>11.30 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not at all clear why there should be this

difference.  If  I  may quote  from  col.  75  of  the

Official  Report  (No. 3) of the Select  Committee - the

Attorney-General (Mr Butterfield) at that time said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We do, on the other hand, take the view that so far

as  the  District Councils are concerned, it would  be

too  restrictive  to provide that, where  the  Chinese

language  is  concerned, it should be Mandarin.  There

are  numbers of districts where the persons voting  in

the  local  government elections  and  those  who  are

likely  to  represent  them are persons  who  commonly

speak  one  of  the several dialects of  Chinese.  The

Government takes the view that these people should not

be    debarred   by   too   restrictive   a   language

qualification and considers that, having regard to the

differences  in the districts, it would  be  wise  and

right in this legislation to provide that the language

qualification  for  the districts should  include  any

Chinese  dialect  and  should  not  be  restricted  to

Mandarin."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this argument which was applied to the District

Councils applies equally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2315</b></font><br><br>



to  the  City  Council in every syllable,  because  by

their  very act in bringing rural areas - Pasir  Panjang

and   Ulu  Pandan - into  the  City  Council  area,  the

Government  make this argument a valid one.  You  have

this  rural  area,  as  you have  other  rural  areas,

already inside the City Council where there are people

who  do  not speak Mandarin but who commonly speak  in

one  of  the  several dialects of Chinese. Why  should

they   be  debarred  by  too  restrictive  a  language

restriction?  Let  us  have  equality  at  the   local

government level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will find, if you turn to col. 79 of the Report,

that  the Minister was in entire agreement with me  at

the top of this col. 79:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I quite agree with the Member for Tanglin that if

we  were to stick to Mandarin, it would mean that only

the  younger generation would be able to take part  in

the   City   Council  elections  and  not  the   older

generation."



<br><br>And  why should the older generation be debarred  from

being candidates for election to the City Council?  It

is  from the older and wiser heads that one looks  for

representation  in the City Council,  and  it  is  the

older  and wiser heads who normally have more time  to

spare  for local government matters. In many parts  of

the world it is common to see persons who have retired

from  their  businesses, or at least have the  younger

generation  able  to  play a  greater  part  in  their

businesses,  finding  time  to  take  part  in   local

government  and  lending their wisdom  and  experience

over  the years to local government administration.  I

think  that is a very important point, and I  am  glad

that  the Minister agrees that if we were to stick  to

Mandarin in the City Council, it would mean that  only

the younger generation would be able to take part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister went on to say in the same paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, on the other hand, Sir, I must say this: that

in  the City Council area you will find that there  is

no dearth of candidates who, though they may be unable

to  speak  in  Mandarin,  may  be  able  to  speak  in

English."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the fact that there is no dearth of candidates has

nothing to do with the point. The point is that if you

speak



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2316</b></font><br><br>



any  Chinese dialect other than Mandarin,  you  should

not  be  disqualified from being a candidate. And  the

Minister went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the case of the District Council areas, the

reason  why  the  Government has  suggested  that  any

Chinese  dialect  could  be used  in  the  Council  is

because we feel that in the District Council areas  we

would very much like the ordinary farmer and the small

shopkeeper  to  take  part  in  the  District  Council

elections."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And why - we would like to know - would the Government

not like the ordinary farmer and the small shopkeeper,

of  whom there are thousands in the City Council area,

to  take part in City Council elections? As I said, by

the  very  move of the Government to bring essentially

rural  areas  inside  the  City  Council,  there   are

ordinary  farmers being apparently denied their  right

to  sit in the City Council simply because they cannot

speak  Mandarin. Sir, we are opposed to their  bar  in

the City Council area.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It has been proposed, as an amendment,

paragraphs (b) and (c) other than "and" - and there  to

insert: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"if he is able to speak any Chinese dialect or Malay

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members  will have noticed that  the  amendment

seeks, as I have said, to leave out paragraphs (b) and

(c) and to insert a new paragraph (b).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has given notice of amendments to paragraphs (b) and (c), where he seeks to leave out

only part of those words. I must draw the attention of

hon. Members to Standing Order 28 (4) (d) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the Speaker or Chairman, before putting a

question to leave out certain words, is informed  that

a Member wishes to move an amendment to leave out part

only  of these words and if he is of opinion that  the

proposed  amendment  of which he  is  so  informed  is

substantially a new amendment, he shall, if  possible,

put  the  question to leave out only so  much  of  the

original  amendment  as is unaffected  by  the  second

amendment;  but  if that question is  agreed  to,  the

whole  of the words proposed in the original amendment

to be left out shall be deemed to have been ordered to

be left out."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2317</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the opinion that that paragraph comes into

play and I shall therefore propose, and later put, the

Question  with  reference to the Member for  Tanglin's

amendment-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 82, line 37 to line 41, to leave out the

words from "(b) " to "with" - that is to say, the words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If in the case of the City Council he is able to

speak  Mandarin  or Malay or Tamil  or  English,  and,

unless  incapacitated by blindness or  other  physical

cause,  to  read  and  write one  or  other  of  those

languages".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall put the Question that those words only be left

out.  If  that Question is agreed to, then  under  the

Standing Order the whole of the words proposed in  the

original  amendment to be left out shall be deemed  to

have  been ordered to be left out - that is to say,  all

the words in paragraphs (b) and (c).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, on the other hand, the Question is not agreed

to,  then the whole of the amendment proposed  by  the

Member for Tanglin will fall and the Minister may then

proceed  with  his  amendments. I trust  I  have  made

myself clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question then, after that exordium, is "That the

words  from  '(b)' in line 37, page 82,  to  the  word

'with' in line 41 on the same page proposed to be left

out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, it seems a bit

odd  that,  of  all the Members on the Opposition,  it

takes the Member for Tanglin to tell us what we should

do in the matter of the Chinese language. If it is Mr

Sutherland, at least we can understand. He resided  in

China for a number of years and he speaks the language

quite  fluently. Nevertheless, I think the Member  for

Tanglin  must have very good intentions at  heart  and

wishes  to  see every Chinese, whether he  comes  from

Mongolia-



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Point of clarification and explanation,

Sir.  Mr  Chairman, it does happen, when speaking  of

the people who live in the area of Ulu Pandan, that  I

am  speaking  on  behalf of the  constituents  whom  I

represent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> I am not saying that the Member

for   Tanglin  was  not  speaking  on  behalf  of  his

constituency.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2318</b></font><br><br>



As  I  said, he may have the best intentions at  heart

and  wishes to see every Chinese - whether he comes from

Mongolia, Sinkiang or Tibet - able to stand for election

in  the  City Council. But I wonder if he is aware  of

the  complications of the Chinese language. There  are

18 provinces in China, that is, if we exclude three in

Manchuria, and every one of these provinces  has  many

dialects.   Take,  for  instance,  the   Province   of

Kwangtung  from  where  my forefathers  came.  It  has

Khehs,  Teochews,  Hylams  and  Cantonese.  Take   the

Cantonese  dialect alone. There are so  many  dialects

spoken  by  the  Cantonese. Although I  have  been  to

Kwangtung  many  times - prewar as well  as  postwar - and

other  parts  of  China, I found great  difficulty  in

understanding  some  of  the  people  who  came   from

entirely   different   districts   when   they   spoke

Cantonese.  Just imagine the difficulty in  trying  to

get  interpreters for those representatives who  speak

in  all  these  dialects! I think the task  is  almost

impossible.    We   have   had   some   examples    of

interpretation in the Select Committee meetings of the

last    few   weeks.   From   what   I   heard,   many

interpretations  were far from correct.  You  can  see

from  that,  that  if an interpreter  is  expected  to

interpret from languages which he has seldom heard of,

there   would   be   a   great   difference   in   the

interpretation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin says that if we limit the

language   to   Mandarin,  it  is  only  the   younger

generation who will be able to do so. I think that  is

not  entirely true. Quite a number of people  who  are

over  40 - I do not know whether the Member for  Tanglin

calls  them  young or old - and even 50  speak  Mandarin

very well. When I say that, I do not mean those in the

teaching profession. I mean the merchants, and  a  lot

of  workers too. So in this respect, I do not see  any

difficulty in getting candidates for the City  Council

elections,  bearing in mind that in the  City  Council

area  alone, out of a population of one and a  quarter

million,  we  have  950,000 and if we  cannot  get  32

members  out of the 950,000 who do not speak  English,

Malay,  Tamil or Mandarin, then I do not know what  to

say.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2319</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin will say that this argument

will also hold good for the District Councils. Yes, to

a  certain extent we agree, but then you must bear  in

mind this - that we will have three District Councils of

12  members  each - 36  in  all - and  then  we  have  a

population  which  is slightly over  a  quarter  of  a

million.



<br><br>11.45 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also the intention, if possible, to get those

people  who are farmers and those who seldom  come  to

the  city  to  stand  for elections  to  the  District

Councils.  These are the people who, I believe,  would

do a lot of good for the District Councils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this: In the rural districts,

certain areas are mainly inhabited by certain sections

of  the  people,  such as Khehs, Hylams,  Hokkiens  or

Teochews. If these people are not allowed to stand for

election,  then I believe it will be a great  loss  to

the  District Councils. Of course, if you could get  a

language which is suitable for all, it would be ideal;

but  at  this stage of development, I think  we  shall

allow  people in the rural districts who are  standing

for  elections to speak other dialects in addition  to

Mandarin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point to be borne in mind is that the

affairs  of the District Councils are definitely  much

more  simple  than  those of  the  City  Council.  The

elected  councillors possibly stay very  near  to  one

another, and if one cannot understand the dialect, his

friend  who  sits next to him in the District  Council

might  be  able to interpret for him. If that argument

is  advanced  by the Member for Tanglin for  the  City

Council, then he may even advance it for the Assembly.

I see that the Member for Tanglin is shaking his head.

Sir,  I  do not think there is any difference  between

these two places. Sir, I oppose this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang (Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Mr Tan Theng Chiang):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

in  a  country  like Singapore, I  think  it  is  most

important that the business of the City Council should

be  carried out as expeditiously as possible; and  for

administrative and technical reasons, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2320</b></font><br><br>



think a limit on multilingualism should be imposed  if

the activities of the Council are to be carried out in

an  efficient manner. It is for these reasons  that  I

consider  that  only  one Chinese  dialect,  which  is

spoken  or understood by a great number of the Chinese

population,  should  be allowed  in  addition  to  one

Indian  language, Malay and English.  If  pressure  is

brought  to  permit  the use of all Chinese  dialects,

which  are  very many indeed, then I think  we  cannot

properly  deny Indians the use of their own languages,

such  as  Hindustani,  Urdu,  Bengali,  Malayalam  and

several   other  Indian  languages.  In   cosmopolitan

Singapore,  Sir, it is important that we should  avoid

taking   any   steps   which  may   be   regarded   as

discriminatory by any section of the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position in the rural areas is entirely

different. The idea of forming rural district councils

is to bring home to the rural folks the benefits of an

efficient  administration. This  could  only  be  made

possible  if  the actual residents of the rural  areas

are given an opportunity to take part in the effective

administration  of  their  respective  areas.  It   is

difficult  to  predict  also what  the  position  with

regard  to  multilingualism will be in  a  few  years'

time. In providing for the use of any Chinese dialects

in  the rural district councils, we are venturing upon

an   experiment  which  may  so  turn  out  that   the

councillors themselves in time to come may ask  for  a

restriction  on the number of dialects  and  languages

used  if they find this is hampering their work.  Sir,

in the circumstances, I oppose the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, the Member for Pasir Panjang

gave  me  a  little lecture across the  floor  on  the

difficulties of dialects - there are so many of them - and

a  slight incursion into Chinese history, but  it  all

boils  down  to this: why should there be a difference

in electoral qualification on one side or the other of

Clementi  Road, if I may take one example to  which  I

referred?  I  can only hope that his own constituents,

who are largely concerned because they are going to be

split  into  two,  will  be  satisfied  with  his  own

explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one of my points is simply this: that the very

fact that the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2321</b></font><br><br>



have  decided to extend the city limits to include  an

essentially  rural  area, and a  largely  rural  area,

within the City Council boundaries does mean that they

should follow up their own argument logically and make

the  languages  in  both  the  City  Council  and  the

District  Councils  the same. Whether  one  should  go

further  and include large numbers of Indian languages

other  than  Tamil is another argument altogether.  Of

course,  the argument against that is that  there  are

not so many persons concerned. There is, of course,  a

large  number of persons inside the City Council  area

who  do  not speak Mandarin and who will therefore  be

barred  from standing as candidates. That is the  main

point, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The hon. Member asks why farmers on one

side    of   the   road   have   different   electoral

qualifications from the other side. Well,  the  answer

is that you have to draw a line somewhere, taking into

account  all  the circumstances of the case.  You  can

well  ask why the farmer on one side of Johore  Strait

has  Tunku Abdul Rahman as the Chief Minister, and the

other side has Mr Lim Yew Hock as the Chief Minister.

Things  go  on  like that. You cannot make  sure  that

everybody is exactly equal in every respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I could just take up one point - I do not know

whether  the hon. Member considered this: If  you  are

going  to have all the Chinese dialects spoken in  the

City  Council, presumably they are spoken in Committee

as  well; and with the number of Committees that exist

there  with  all  their functions, you  will  need  an

enormous staff of interpreters and translators to deal

with  the  work.  When you have  one  man  who  speaks

Hokkien,   you   may  have  to  have  two   or   three

interpreters  for  him; and the same  in  every  other

dialect;  and all these have to be provided beforehand

and  trained  and put into operation before  the  City

Council  elections. It will be a  poor  way  of  doing

things if you have them trained after the City Council

elections, and the City Councillors assemble and  find

themselves unable to communicate because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2322</b></font><br><br>



they are all talking in different dialects  with

no common language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enlarge the task to take in the provision of as

many as ten different sets of headphones and different

interpreters,  all  sitting  in  different  boxes  and

trying  to  make sure that they can all translate  the

Budget  or  a licence to sell hot drinks, or  whatever

point  the City Council takes up at the moment,  seems

to  me  to  be an impossible one. It would be feasible

probably  for the District Councils to function  in  a

friendly  way on relatively minor matters without  too

much  scrupulous worry about an exact  translation  of

what  they are saying. But the City Council is a  body

on  whose  vital  services, I would  remind  the  hon.

Member,  the whole island is dependent. These must  be

maintained efficiently; and operated efficiently;  and

expanded  continuously. To impose  on  that  body  the

delays  and  burdens which might be  involved  in  the

apparatus  of  translations  which  the  hon.   Member

envisages seems to me to be most unwise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, let us ask

ourselves  one  question: Why were  we  in  favour  of

extending  the language permitted to be  used  in  the

Assembly from one to four? In other words, why did  we

pass a resolution agreeing to multilingualism? Now, we

did  that  on  quite  a  number of  grounds,  but  one

important  ground  was  that we wanted  equality.  The

second was that we wanted better men to come into  the

Assembly. We also wanted the people to elect their own

representatives who should be their true  and  natural

leaders.  If we were agreed on these grounds  when  we

agreed to multilingualism, then we must see that  this

should be practised in the lower councils. I know that

many  Members before their election to this House went

into  the field canvassing, talking to the people  and

finding  out  who are the people who really  mattered.

And  if we ask ourselves - each one of us who went into

the  field - who those people are, we will come  to  one

conclusion.  They  are the people who  speak  less  of

Mandarin and more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2323</b></font><br><br>



of some dialects. It is true in the City Council area,

and it is true in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, too, that many of the candidates asked these

people  to help them in their elections, because  they

are  the influential people; in other words, they  are

the  natural leaders of the people. If Members on  the

opposite  side could quote numerous examples of  these

leaders  who, they say, are leaders and  are  able  to

speak  Mandarin, I am agreeable to four  languages  in

the   City  Council,  with  Mandarin  as  the  Chinese

language.  But  I  am convinced that  the  people  who

really have an influence on their fellows are not  the

Mandarin-speaking type. The Mandarin-speaking type are

the ones who have just graduated from schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> If we talk about school

teachers,  I  do not think they have the  greatest  of

influence. Now if the Government side is not convinced

of  this, let us take a few examples. Let us  come  to

the  boards  of  management for Chinese schools.  They

control  the schools. Why are the people on the  board

of  directors, the board of governors,  the  board  of

management? Are they Mandarin-speaking people,  or  do

they  speak  the  local dialects?  I  would  like  the

Government  side to let me have an idea  as  to  which

type  is  the  more prevalent. I can  point  out  many

schools  with boards of governors who are not able  to

speak Mandarin.



<br><br>12 noon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us take another instance. Let us take the

clans  and  associations. Again here we find  we  have

some  of  the  people  who are natural  leaders  being

elected democratically. Ask them again: Do they  speak

Mandarin?   What  percentage  of  such  people   speak

Mandarin?  You will find again that among such  people

there  are very few that can speak Mandarin.  Here  we

have  a  great number of people democratically elected

according  to their constitution, and whom the  people

say  are  their  leaders.  Yet  we  insist  on  having

Mandarin in the City Council



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2324</b></font><br><br>



in  order  to  deny  these people the  opportunity  of

serving  Singapore in a larger capacity. The  argument

that the Government is putting forward is that it will

involve  a great deal of difficulties. There  will  be

the  difficulty of interpretation. What  if  they  all

speak  in  all  sorts of languages and dialects?  They

will  not be able to get business done. Sir,  I  would

like  to draw the attention of the Government  to  how

business   is  being  conducted  in  many   of   these

associations and clans. If a person speaks one dialect

it does not mean that he knows that one dialect alone.

Invariably  he knows two or three, even four.  He  may

know  four dialects and yet not know Mandarin. And  so

if  one  dialect  is to be used, he will  be  able  to

understand it. He will be able to speak it even.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also ask the Government to find out, Sir, how

people  conduct business and meetings in their various

set-ups.  You  will find that although  none  of  them

speaks Mandarin, yet business is done expeditiously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find that if we really desire to go forward with

equality as our watchword and try to get the best  men

for all the councils, then we must permit dialects  to

be used in the City Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr

Chairman, I had not intended to speak when the  Member

for Tanglin moved his amendment. I can well understand

that, not being a Chinese, he does not understand  the

Chinese dialects well. Or he does not know the  number

of Chinese dialects. But when the Member for Serangoon

comes and gives us a discourse on the number of people

who  know  how  to speak Mandarin and  challenges  the

Government   to   say  whether  management   committee

managers know Mandarin or not, I feel that I must tell

him that most of the managers of management committees

in  Chinese schools know how to speak Mandarin. I have

come  across many of them at my meetings,  and  in  my

discussions with them they do speak Mandarin. I left a

Chinese  school  more than 20 years ago  but  I  speak

Mandarin and the language of the Chinese people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2325</b></font><br><br>



now  is Mandarin and not any other Chinese dialect.  I

think the Member for Serangoon is casting an insult on

the Chinese people when he says that they do not speak

Mandarin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Chairman, on a

point  of  clarification, Sir.  Does  the  Member  for

Serangoon still belong to the Liberal-Socialist Party?

I  heard  a very fervent plea for multilingualism  run

riot,  and  I  remember those were the very  arguments

which his Party, the then Progressive Party, zealously

refuted in those days when other Parties were pressing

for  multilingualism. I want to  make  sure  where  we

stand today.

<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Just to clarify the mind of the Member

for Serangoon, Sir. I think he must have misunderstood

what  I  was saying. I do not dispute that many people

do  speak many dialects and languages, but if you  are

going  to have a City Council where anybody can  speak

any  dialect,  you  have to set up all  the  machinery

which  may be required for the one individual who  may

speak the one dialect which nobody else could speak or

understand.  It  is no use saying  that  most  of  the

people  will be able to understand each other  in  any

dialect.  You  have  to  provide  for  every  possible

circumstance within what the law permits, and that  is

going  to  be an extremely complex task. The arguments

which  he  made are completely irrelevant because  you

have to provide for every particular case, though  the

case may not actually arise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

while  we are debating languages or dialects, I wonder

how many of the hon. Members have read the report of a

discussion with Mr Pilley of the Linguists Club-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. That report has not been

published.  It  is still in the hands  of  the  Select

Committee and no reference to it can be made.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2326</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am sorry, Sir. I wonder whether

the Member for Pasir Panjang realised actually what he

said  when he pointed out that if in the City Council,

where  we  are going to have 32 members, we could  not

get those 32 members who would confine themselves only

to the four languages here, then he would not know how

we  could  run the city. But does he realise that  the

District  Councils are smaller in size - they have  only

12  members  each.  In the District Councils  you  are

going  to  throw  open  the question  of  the  Chinese

language to the different Chinese dialects, whereas in

the  City  Council  you  are  confining  it  only   to

Mandarin. I agree with him that to get interpreters to

interpret  all these different languages  or  dialects

would  be very difficult and the interpretation  would

be  far  from correct; but I strongly feel that  there

should  be uniformity of languages as between the  two

councils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Councils come under this Bill, which is

the Local Government Bill, as much as the City Council

does. Why should we differentiate between the District

Councils, where we can throw open the Chinese language

to  the  different  Chinese  dialects,  and  the  City

Council where we have only Mandarin?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever it may be, I hold an open view,

because I feel that where the Chinese dialects or  the

Chinese   language  is  concerned,  it   is   a   most

complicated affair. Even in the Cantonese dialect,  as

the Member for Pasir Panjang said, you have many other

"sub-dialects",  as I call it, just  as  much  as  the

Teochew dialect. Now I cannot speak a few dialects  in

Teochew, although I am a Teochew myself. I may not  be

able  to  understand a certain section of the  Teochew

people. So if we are going to have all the dialects of

the  Chinese language for the District Councils,  then

how  do  we  get interpreters for them? Why cannot  we

have  uniformity  then?  Is  it  the  feeling  of  the

Government  that  in  the City Council  you  will  get

people  who  are  far  better educated  and  who  know

Mandarin,  and in the rural districts you cannot  find

people who are as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2327</b></font><br><br>



good as those in the City Council? I do not think that

is right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member for Tanglin asked: How do you draw the

boundary?  On  this side of the road you  confine  the

language  only  to Mandarin, whereas on  the  opposite

side   you  open  it  to  all  the  different  Chinese

dialects.  What difference does it make  between  this

side  of  the  road  and that side? The  Minister  for

Communications  and Works said that there  must  be  a

line  drawn. I agree or else you get nowhere. But then

a  Member  sitting on one side may know  a  number  of

dialects,  whereas the Member sitting on the  opposite

may  not.  I  think we should have uniformity,  be  it

Mandarin   alone  or  be  it  the  different   Chinese

dialects. The whole clause should be amended  to  suit

either  one  or  the other. There should  not  be  any

differentiation between the languages of the  District

and City Councils.



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I

agree  with  the  last  speaker that  we  should  have

uniformity. If we are going to allow any dialect to be

used  in  the District Councils, we should also  allow

any dialect to be used in the City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I disagree with the Minister for Education when

he  says that it is a shame for a Chinese to say  that

the  Chinese cannot understand Mandarin. I  am  afraid

there  are quite a number of Chinese who do not  speak

Mandarin,  especially the older Chinese.  The  younger

Chinese  who  have  gone to Chinese  schools  can,  of

course, speak Mandarin. But surely we are not going to

deprive  the  older  Chinese, who are  perhaps  public

spirited  and have made themselves useful in the  city

and  who would like to take part in the administration

of  the  city, of the opportunity to take part in  the

City  Council  elections simply  because  they  cannot

speak  Mandarin? I strongly support the view  that  we

should  have  uniformity  in  the  District  and  City

Councils.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar has already drawn the attention  of

his House to the fact that it was the Progressive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2328</b></font><br><br>



Party that opposed multilingualism,  and  it

would appear that the Liberal-Socialist Party are  now

more  than anxious for multilingualism. In fact,  they

are  going  beyond  what  has  been  accepted  in  the

Legislative Assembly. Sir, the fact that we are  going

to  have  a  multilingual Assembly makes it  necessary

that  we must make the other councils multilingual  as

well.  On  that basis, since the Legislative  Assembly

will  have Mandarin as its Chinese language,  we  feel

that in the City Council Mandarin, and Mandarin alone,

should also be the only Chinese language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Council and the Legislative Assembly, as

far  as  I can gather, now work on the same basis.  At

the  ordinary  meetings  they have  verbatim  reports.

Therefore it is necessary for the City Council to have

interpreters and also to have the same earphone system

as in the Legislative Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the District Councils, we envisage that

the  business conducted will be more of a friendly and

co-operative nature than that of a healthy  debate  as

we  are having in the Legislative Assembly and in  the

City  Council.  We  want the farmers  and  the  little

shopkeepers in the rural districts to participate, and

to  have every facility afforded them so that they can

contest  the elections and be returned to the District

Councils.  They  can help to bring  democracy  to  the

districts.  Sir, the District Councils will  work  for

the  first  term  on  the same basis  as  the  village

committees.  The  councillors sit around  and  discuss

points of interest and use the dialects in which  they

are  most familiar, and they will have one another  to

help  in the translation. As far as village committees

are  concerned, I think only minutes and decisions are

taken,  but  no verbatim reports. If verbatim  reports

are  necessary,  then  translators  and  the  earphone

system will also be necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I think this is for once a non-controversial amendment. I think it is an omission

from  the Bill as it stands at the moment. There seems

to be no provision for the resignation of a mayor. Sub-clause (2) simply reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the mayor is continuously absent from the City

except on account of illness, without obtaining from

the City Council leave of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2331</b></font><br><br>



absence, for a period exceeding two months he shall at

the  expiration  of  that period cease  to  hold  that

<br><br>But there can be cases where the mayor, through severe

illness  or  accident,  or may  be  personal  domestic

reasons,  would  feel incapable of  carrying  out  his

duties as mayor and that he should be in a position to

resign  without delay and enable another mayor  to  be

elected  by  the  councillors. We have suggested  that

this  resignation  should be addressed  to  the  Chief

Administrative Officer as the senior executive officer

in  the City Council because the election of the mayor

is a matter solely for the councillors themselves.

time to time authorise.".



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, the point of this amendment is simply this, that whereas we agree that the Governor in

Council may or even should decide the expenses of City

Councillors, it should be left to the City Councillors

themselves  to  decide  on  what  expenses  should  be

granted  to  the  Mayor. It should  be  remembered,  I

think,   that  the  Mayor  is  elected  by  the   City

Councillors  themselves and  that  it  is  entirely  a

matter  for themselves to elect a Mayor of  their  own

choice, and the Governor in Council does not come into

the  picture at all. There can be no interference from

the  Governor in Council with the choice of the  Mayor

by  the  elected Councillors. It therefore seems  only

appropriate  that  the allowances and  expenses  which

should be allotted to the Mayor should be a matter for

the Councillors themselves to decide.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, perhaps the hon. Member has

failed to read clauses 67 (1) (g) and (h) in page  101

which  empower  the City Council to pay  for  expenses

incurred on the occasion of public ceremonies in which

presumably the Mayor would take the leading part,  and

also  for  receiving and entertaining of distinguished

visitors who may be the guests of the Mayor. So  there

is  provision given under the Bill to the City Council

to   incur  such  expenditure  without  going  to  the

Governor in Council for sanction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 29 actually deals with the normal fixed

monthly  allowances or expenses which the Council  may

wish to grant to the Councillors and to the Mayor.  If

there  are any extraordinary expenses due to visitors,

functions or celebrations, the City Council has  power

under the other clause to pay them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2334</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, the point I would like to

make  in  reply to the Hon. Minister for Commerce  and

Industry  is  this,  that  if  it  was  felt  by   the

Government that the clause to which reference has been

made  and of which I am very well aware - clause 67  (1)

(g)  and  (h) - was sufficient, then surely  Government

could very well accept the first amendment, namely, to

leave  out  "to the mayor and", but not to accept  the

second  amendment which is to insert a new  sub-clause

(2)  as proposed. But I do not think this point  meets

the point which we wish to make. The position is this,

that the status and dignity of the Mayor is something,

I  think, which we need to establish from the start of

the institution of this office. I think I am right  in

saying that a Mayor, certainly of a City Council which

is  incorporated by Royal Charter as is  the  City  of

Singapore,  is  the  Queen's representative,  and  the

Mayor's  status is an extremely high one. In the  land

he is the First Gentleman of the City and I think this

fact needs to be taken into consideration. I think  it

would  be wrong certainly for the Minister and I think

the  Council  of Ministers to dictate as to  what  the

Mayor  should  or should not have as his expenses  and

allowances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, as I have already said, is that as

the  Councillors elect their own Mayor they should  be

given the responsibility of deciding what his expenses

should be, his normal expenses and not of course those

covered  by clauses 67 (1) (g) and (h) which refer  to

the larger functions and forms of entertaining which a

mayor  must carry out in his position as head  of  the

city.  I  think  in his position as Mayor  the  normal

expenditure of a Mayor would be higher than that of  a

City  Councillor and there would be no doubt that  the

Governor  in  Council  would  grant  a  rather  higher

allowance in his case, but I do not think there should

be any dispute on this matter. It would be undesirable

that if the City Councillors themselves felt that  the

Mayor should receive, let us say, $750 a month for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2335</b></font><br><br>



allowances  and  expenses for normal  entertaining  of

people passing through and general entertaining within

the City to the citizens of Singapore, the Governor in

Council  were  to  cut  down the  figure  to  $500  or

whatever the figure might be. I think that would be an

undesirable  position. I think the  responsibility  of

deciding  on  this particular figure  can  safely  and

properly  be  left to the City Councillors  themselves

who have, in the first instance, elected their Mayor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I think there are two types of

expenses which the Mayor of our proposed City  Council

will have. One is the expenses which he will incur  in

inviting    various    distinguished    persons    and

entertaining  them in the capacity  of  the  Mayor.  I

think, Sir, clause 29 deals with both these allowances

and expenses of that nature and I am sure the Governor

in  Council  will  take care of those  allowances  and

expenses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the other type of expenditure is that dealt with

under   clause   67  (1)  (h),  like   receiving   and

entertaining  distinguished  visitors  and  so  on  on

behalf  of  the  City Council. For that purpose,  Sir,

provision is already made in clause 67 (1) (h). But  I

do  not think for a moment, Sir, that it is right  and

proper for a City Council to decide on allowances  and

expenses  of their own, because there is a  danger  in

it.  It a particular Party gets a majority in the City

Council,  then it will be in a position  to  vote  any

money as it likes to keep the dignity of the Mayor.  I

think that will be a very undesirable practice.  I  do

hope that it will not be allowed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 87, line 42, to leave out "office or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, that this is probably a drafting

omission.  It  was overlooked during the deliberations

of  the Select Committee. I think the term "office" is

only  used  for the office of Mayor or the  office  of

Councillors  and the intention behind this  sub-clause

is that there should be disciplinary powers in respect

of persons holding a post or posts. If you refer, Sir,

to  page  77 of the Bill, clauses 11 and 12, you  will

find, I think, the term "post" is used throughout.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 90, line 22, after "Council", to insert

"excluding the Chairman".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, the sub-clause to which we are referring, sub-clause (3), reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No business shall be transacted at a meeting of a

District Council unless at least eight members of  the

District Council are present:



<br><br>Now  if the Chairman is included as one of those eight

you  could  have this position that in  a  meeting  in

which a quorum was present of only eight persons there

could  be  four elected members on the  one  hand  and

three nominated members plus the Chairman on the other

hand, so that the Chairman, with a casting vote could,

with  the help of the nominated members, arrive  at  a

decision which the elected members object to. I  think

that  is an undesirable position. I do not want to  go

into  the  merits of nominated members - it has  already

been  dealt  with - but I think the position that  could

arise is a wrong one whatever the arguments may be  on

nominated  members. Where you have  nominated  members

there  should  not arise the position, however  honest

the  decision that may be come to, whereby the elected

members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2337</b></font><br><br>



can be out-voted by the nominated members and the

Chairman.  By  the  simple  device  of  excluding  the

Chairman  as  counting towards this quorum  you  would

with  the  eight  have the position  of  five  elected

members and three nominated members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, earlier on in

the  day  the  hon. Member for Tanglin, in  moving  an

amendment  for  an increase in the number  of  elected

Councillors for the District Councils touched on  this

quorum of eight. He did say that this quorum of eight,

which is more than half the total number, is much  too

much.  It  should have been one-third and in order  to

achieve  that  one-third there should have  been  more

members.  Now by his amendment he is going to  make  a

quorum  more  difficult to comply with.  He  suggested

that if we have only eight members, eight is already a

majority of a total of 15 and it may happen that  only

four elected Councillors will be present at a meeting.

Four  elected Councillors out of a total of 12! Surely

it  is not suggested that elected Councillors will  be

less   conscious   of  their  duties  than   nominated

Councillors  who, by his suggestion, will  be  present

with  a 100 per cent strength? Four out of 12! I doubt

that   could   ever  happen  because  surely   elected

Councillors will feel - and feel quite rightly - that they

have  a  more responsible duty to perform, and at  any

meeting  of the District Councils there will  be  more

than four elected Councillors attending. We oppose the

amendment.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I concede that there is an

apparent  contradiction in what I have said  just  now

and what I said earlier about quorums, but that is  of

the  Govermnent's own making. If a larger  number  had

been accepted for the District Councils, this position

would  not arise. As to the second point of  the  Hon.

the  Chief Minister that surely as few as four elected

members would never turn up at a meeting, I hope  that

that will not occur except on very rare



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2338</b></font><br><br>



occasions, and may be it will never occur at all;  but

the position could arise. That is the point, and it is

desirable that it should not arise and that we  should

so devise this Bill that it will not happen.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, if the position

does  arise  then  the people of the district  deserve

what   they   get.   If  they  can  tolerate   elected

councillors  who do not attend meetings then  they  do

deserve  what  they get. At the next  elections  which

come round in that district they should see that these

chaps do not get returned.

Standing Orders of this Assembly but I would point out

that  the  quorum here is eight excluding the Chairman

or  Speaker, and under the present Constitution of the

Assembly  the business of Government could be  carried

on with only one elected Member present.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I beg to move an amendment,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 90, line 36, after "thereon", to insert:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;", provided that the mayor shall not be entitled to

cast a vote on such questions".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, we consider this a most important amendment, that the Mayor should not be entitled to a

vote  at  meetings of the City Council or at committee

meetings.  Our  feeling is that the  Mayor  should  be

above Party once he is elected to that office, that he

should be strictly impartial and be seen to be  so.  I

think that to have an impartial non-voting Chairman in

the  seat  of  mayor is essential for a newly  elected

Council with several languages if it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2339</b></font><br><br>



going  to  operate smoothly. I do not say, of  course,

and  I  do  not  intend to suggest, that  it  will  be

impossible  for a Mayor to be impartial and  to  vote,

but  I  think what we do want to see is that the Mayor

is   entirely  impartial  and  that  it  would  be  of

assistance  if we were to put the Mayor  beyond  Party

pressures and the Party line, so that he can carry out

what  is  best  for  the  city.  His  importance   and

influence  should  be  shown outside  the  chamber  in

guiding Councillors on important matters, because most

decisions  in local government are in fact not  really

political  matters at all, where politics  should  not

enter  in, and I think the Mayor who is placed in  the

position  of being above Party would be able to  wield

influence which otherwise would not be so easy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, if I may refer to your great office,

that  the value of Mr Speaker as a non-Party man  has

been shown in this Assembly. I think if we follow  the

principle,  and  we have accepted that  principle  and

realised  its value in this House, that for the  first

few years at any rate of the life of the City Council,

as we found in the first few years of the life of this

Assembly,  that a Mayor is placed in the  position  of

being  above  Party,  it would be extremely  valuable.

Perhaps this could be relaxed in time to come just  as

I think it is intended under the new Constitution that

this  might be relaxed if the Assembly so wishes,  but

the  traditions  and practices of a  Mayor  as  a  man

elected   from  the  people  and  elected   from   the

Councillors - these traditions and practices have  still

to  be  set up in this city, and during this  stage  I

think, as I have said, this particular amendment would

be  exceptionally valuable in the counsellings of  the

City Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, this amendment shows the

fundamental difference between our side of  the  House

and  the Liberal-Socialists. We believe, Sir, that  an

elected  man should exercise his right. He should  not

under any pretence shirk his right and, whether he  is

a  mayor or not, refuse to vote. Therefore once a  man

is elected by an electorate, nothing should be done to

take away his right of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2340</b></font><br><br>



voting  and  his right of representing the people  who

have  elected him. It is an important principle,  Sir,

and  we are not prepared to concede on this point.  We

stick  by  it, that an elected man has his  right  and

nobody should take that away from him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even the present City Council President does

exercise his vote though he is not an elected man  but

a  civil  servant. He not only exercises his  original

vote  but  he exercises a casting vote when  the  need

arises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member did make the plea that we would like

to have an impartial Mayor but I suggest, Sir, that he

is going against human nature in this. Human nature is

such  that one cannot always be impartial and even  if

you  have a Mayor from whom the vote is taken away you

will  still find that he will not be always impartial.

Besides,  what  will  happen  if  in  a  City  Council

elections  you  find two Parties returned  with  equal

strength?  Then nobody would want to appoint  a  Mayor

from his Party because if he did so it would lose  one

vote and it would then become the minority in the City

Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, apparently the only

objection   of  the  Government  side  to  this   very

constructive suggestion of the Member for  Tanglin  is

because there is a fear that human nature cannot  rise

above partiality towards Party. I think that is a very

sad   admission.  In  this  House  we  have  seen  how

important it is to have a Speaker who is impartial and

gives  everybody a chance to speak no matter on  which

side  he  is. I strongly feel that it is essential  in

the  first few years of the new City Council  that  we

should have an impartial man as a Mayor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I would just like to point out, Mr

Chairman,  that  there is a fallacy in comparing  your

position,  with  all respect, to the position  of  the

Mayor. Under a Party political programme in contesting

elections  as  we have in the City Council  the  Mayor

will  presumably be a man who has been  elected  on  a

Party  political programme and has given his  word  to

the people who have voted for him that he will try to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2341</b></font><br><br>



carry  that programme out. In the nature of things  it

is  going to be extremely difficult or impossible  for

him to retain the trust of anybody if he goes back  on

the  word which he has given; if he is pledged to seek

to  carry  out  certain objectives  and  then  has  to

refrain  from carrying them out. It may  be  that  the

Speaker  in  the House of Commons is an elected  Party

man  but  there you have over six hundred  Members  to

choose  from. Of course there is a very long tradition

of  extremely partisan Speakers long ago but gradually

they  built  up a tradition how the office  should  be

occupied and run and they have always got a spare  man

to put in. But that sort of thing does not apply here.

I  understand that the Speaker in the House of Commons

in  fact  once  he is chosen, retains his  office  and

nobody  can contest against him by agreement; he  gets

his seat uncontested thereafter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, I rise just to

express my alarm at the statement that a Party man  is

not  able to be impartial. We know that Party men will

be  elected not only to the office of Mayor later  on,

but at present they are holding important offices like

ministers. And if they cannot be impartial where  will

<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Could I have one more word, Sir? I am

afraid   the   Opposition  still  misunderstands   the

situation. A man who has joined a political Party  has

formed his opinion as to how things should be done. We

on  this  side  of  the House stand  for  a  Socialist

programme;  on the other side of the House they  stand

for  a  capitalist-socialist programme, whatever  that

may  be. And in this world, having formed your  ideas,

you  then  go  to the people and say, "I  want  to  be

elected", and having done that you act impartially  on

the  basis  of the principles which you have accepted;

but  you  cannot  then say that  although  you  are  a

Socialist by principle you will now impartially accept

that capitalism is as good as Socialism. That would be

to make nonsense of the whole thing. On



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2342</b></font><br><br>



the basis of Socialism you have to be impartial within

your  principles but you cannot be expected to abandon

your  principles and show that you have no mind or  no

power  of  decision between two matters on  which  you

have already made your choice.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, if we accept the view, as we

on  this side of the House do, that a Mayor or  rather

an  elected Councillor, once he is elected as a Mayor,

should  be  above Party - and I think  that  should  be

accepted in the interests of the welfare of the  city - then  I  can  only  say that one is  appalled  at  the

reasons  of  the Hon. Minister for Communications  and

Works.  The  Minister  said that  the  Mayor,  or  the

Councillor  when he has been elected as a Mayor,  must

carry  out  his Party programme at all costs.  Now  if

that  is to be the situation, what confidence is there

going  to  be in a Mayor who is not going to  consider

the city as a whole above Party, but is going to carry

out  his Party programme right or wrong? You are going

to  be  in  a position of a biased man giving  rulings

from the chair, and I think that is a most undesirable

position  for the City Council to be in. And  for  the

Minister  for Commerce and Industry to be saying  that

he  cannot expect a man always to be impartial only of

course  reinforces our point that the Mayor should  be

placed  in  a position above Party, as this  amendment

seeks to do.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, either the hon. Member has

misunderstood it or tries to misinterpret my statement

and  the  statement of the Minister for Communications

and Works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand what power the Mayor is going to

have  in order that he should be impartial. After all,

what  powers are you going to give to the Mayor except

only  that he is a figurehead in the City Council?  He

presides  over its meetings but he has no other  power

except this one vote which we propose to give him  and

which you wish to take out of his hands. He is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2343</b></font><br><br>



going to have the power of the President of the United

States surely. He is not going to control a body  with

such big resources and big population that you want to

make  him  so  impartial. He is going  to  be  just  a

figurehead  presiding  over  meetings  of   the   City

Council. I think the Opposition Members are trying  to

exaggerate the position of the Mayor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, Sir, emphatically state here that we on this side

of   the  House  cannot  be  impartial  to  our  Party

programme. We must be partial and carry out our  Party

programme.  If  the Opposition think that  we  can  be

impartial,  then they are mistaken. We  have  promised

the electorate to carry out our Party programme and we

shall carry out that programme as far as possible.  So

do   not  let  anybody  misinterpret  it.  We  can  be

impartial  in smaller things but when it  comes  to  a

Party programme, we cannot be impartial; we have to be

partial.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I would just like to make a

comment that if the position is that the Mayor  is  to

be   regarded  purely  as  a  figurehead,   then   the

Government are introducing something which they do not

understand.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, may I just give a solid

example  arising out of the quotations by the Minister

for  Communications and Works? He read out to us  when

the   previous   clauses  were   debated   that   City

Councillors  busied  themselves with  such  things  as

whether A should sell hot drinks or B should sell  hot

drinks.  Of course, if A happens to be a Party member,

he gets two points down and if B happens to be another

person not connected with the Party, he gets one point

up, and still A is approved, then the partiality of  a

Mayor  comes  in.  Such  partiality  can  range   from

granting a licence to sell fish in a market to  bigger

things.  I am alarmed that if this sort of affairs  go

on at high government level, it will be very, very bad

for Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I think we cannot accept the

suggestion  of  the  Member  for  Tanglin   that   the

Government  is  unaware of the responsibilities  of  a

Mayor and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2344</b></font><br><br>



that  it does not know what it is talking about.  Sir,

there are in the United Kingdom a very large number of

City and Borough Councils which have Mayors and if the

hon.  Member were to look at the United Kingdom  Local

Government  Act, he will find that Mayors  there  have

votes.  I think it is a very misleading suggestion  to

make  that we are on the wrong track. I think the hon.

Member is trying to figure the Mayor of Singapore as a

piece  of  wood.  I  do  not  think,  Sir,  that   the

Government can agree to that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.

resolution in respect of any particular meeting".



<br><br>Perhaps I have your permission, Sir, to refer

indirectly to the next amendment which is to some

extent connected. It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 91, line 10, to leave out "and" and insert

"or".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is quite a small amendment and I think

these words are in fact unnecessary in their context;

the sub-clause will then read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Such minutes shall, unless the local authority by

Standing Orders shall otherwise decide, be open to

inspection by the public...".



<br><br>Now,  it  seems to me that it is better for the  local

authority  to decide by Standing Orders throughout  as

to   whether  or  not  minutes  should  be   open   to

inspection. The normal practice is that the minutes of

every  ordinary meeting of a local authority are  open

to inspection; in fact, they are gazetted but not that

the minutes of proceedings of every committee are open

to  inspection. It seems to me better  to  make  these

provisions under Standing Orders which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2345</b></font><br><br>



would  define  the type of meeting by  such  terms  as

"ordinary"  meeting or "special" meeting  rather  than

that  there should be a resolution in respect  of  any

particular meeting that it is not intended to have the

minutes  open to inspection. I think that  might  give

the  wrong  impression  to the  public  that,  when  a

certain matter was being debated, the City Councillors

were  not desirous of allowing the public to know what

was  going  on  but if that is covered as  it  can  be

covered  by Standing Orders, that impression could  be

avoided. In the same way, I think the word "or" in sub-clause (3) is preferable to "and". The sub-clause will

then read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Such minutes or parts thereof may be published in

the  Gazette or in such other manner, if any,  as  the

local authority may decide."



<br><br>For  the  same  reason, that "such  minutes  or  parts

thereof" in sub-clause (3) refer to sub-clause (1) :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Minutes of the proceedings of every meeting of a

local authority and of every committee thereof...".



<br><br>Now, as I have said, in point of fact, the minutes  of

every  committee  meeting are  not  published  in  the

Gazette. They are kept confidential and it is only the

resolutions of that committee that are published and I

think it is desirable to keep to that practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 92, to leave out lines 18 to 22.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems to me that this particular sub-clause

(4) is redundant if you take it in connection with sub-clause (1). Sub-clause (1) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A member of a local authority shall not vote or be

present  at  the discussion of any matter  before  the

local  authority  or  a  committee  in  which  he  has

directly or indirectly by himself or by a partner  any

pecuniary interest:"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-clause (4), it seems to us, is repetitive:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A local authority may by Standing Orders provide for

the  exclusion  of a member of that authority  from  a

meeting of the authority whilst any contract, proposed

contract  or  other matter in which  he  has  such  an

interest as aforesaid is under consideration."



<br><br>It  may  be remembered that this clause 45 was amended

by  the  Select Committee and it seems to us  that  in

making the amendment, it was overlooked that this sub-clause (4) is actually covered by sub-clause (1).

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2347</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, the point of this amendment is, we feel that the sanction of the Minister - I was almost

going   to   use  the  word  "interference"   of   the

Minister - should  be  excluded from undertakings  other

than   the   main   public  utility  undertakings   of

electricity,  water or gas. We do  agree  that  it  is

right  that  the  local  authority  should  not  sell,

exchange  or  let  on leave any of these  three  major

public  utilities  without  the  Minister's  sanction.

These are vital to the daily lives of everyone on  the

island  and any change should, of course, be carefully

considered  but  we see no reason for  the  Minister's

sanction being required in minor undertakings such  as

markets, swimming pools, hawkers' pitches, and  things

of  that  kind. If the local authority  has  power  to

build  a  market  or  a swimming  pool  from  its  own

resources,  as  it can under clause  60  (1),  without

sanction, it should have powers to dispose of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this was debated in Select Committee, it seemed

that Government had failed to give any reasons for the

Minister to retain his powers in respect of every kind

of undertaking and when I asked examples of what other

undertakings  the Government had in mind,  the  answer

came, 'There are none.'



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Stewart:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, in connection

the  Member  suggests  into the powers  of  the  local

authority by the Minister. In fact, a similar power of

the  Minister  exists in the present City  Council;  I

think  it  is section 366 but, Sir, on reconsideration

of  this amendment, I am pleased to say that we accept

the amendment of the Member for Tanglin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 101, to leave out lines 23 to 25.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three lines refer to paragraph (d) of sub-clause (1). Sub-clause (1) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Local authorities are authorised to expend the

appropriate  local  authority fund for  the  following

purposes:-"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And (d) refers to:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"the acquisition, construction or establishment and

maintenance,  supervision and control  of  systems  of

public transport;".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to us, Sir, that this clause is now an

anachronism.    Government's    promise    was     the

nationalisation of public transport and the removal of

its  control from the City Council. First  steps  have

been  taken  in  this  direction:  bus  companies  and

services are now under an omnibus licensing authority.

So  if  the  Government  is in earnest  regarding  its

promises,  it  seems to us that this  clause  has  now

become redundant and need not be retained in the Bill.

If  the Government does not accept this amendment,  it

seems  to us an indication that they are having second

thoughts  about the whole question of public transport

and that they had pledged themselves to a policy which

they do not propose to follow.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Chairman, I do not want to waste

Singapore Traction Ordinance. If you would like, I can

refer  to it; otherwise we can accept that it provides

reasonable grounds for retaining this power.

<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Yes, Sir. The section is of course the

one  which  empowers  the  City  Council  to  buy  the

Traction Company. Section 29 of the Singapore Traction

Ordinance reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The City Council may within six months after the

fifth day of June, 1955 or within six months after the

expiration of any subsequent period of seven years  or

within  three months after the making of any Order  by

the  Minister  under  either of  the  two  immediately

preceding sections by notice in writing to the Company

require  the Company to sell and thereupon the Company

shall sell to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2349</b></font><br><br>



the   City   Council  the  whole  Undertaking,   land,

buildings,   generating  stations,  substations,   car

sheds,  works,  materials, stores,  rolling-stock  and

plant  of  the Company as a going concern.  The  total

price failing agreement shall be fixed by arbitration,

and  in  arriving at such total price  the  Arbitrator

shall  have  regard to the fair market  value  of  the

Undertaking,  as  a  going concern,  but  without  any

allowance being made for compulsory purchase."



<br><br>The hon. Member will appreciate that that Ordinance is

a   specific  Ordinance  referring  to  the  Singapore

Traction  Company. To take away from the City  Council

the  power  to  expend money for this purpose,  whilst

leaving   in  the  Traction  Company  Ordinance   this

provision,   would  be - in  colloquial  terms - to   make

nonsense  of the situation. I think there is  a  legal

point but I would not care to expound a legal point in

this  distinguished  company.  Briefly,  you  have  an

enablement under one Ordinance and you had better have

the  corresponding  enablement  under  the  other.  The

question of whether the enablement is going to be used

or not is rather by the way.

section 78 of the Ordinance",



<br><br>which we agreed should, in fact, be section 79.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, this clause refers to the period of redemption of monies borrowed by the City Council

under  clause 78 of this Bill. Money can  be  borrowed

for  any of three purposes, as given in sub-clause (1)

of clause 78:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(a) the acquisition of any premises which the City

Council may acquire under this Ordinance or  any

other written law for the time being in force;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the erection of any building which the City

Council has authority to erect;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the execution of any permanent work, the

provision  or renewal of any plant or equipment,

the provision or replacement of any vehicles, or

the doing of anything which the City Council has

authority  under  this  Ordinance  to   execute,

provide  or  do  if,  in  the  opinion  of   the

Minister, the cost of carrying out that  purpose

ought to be spread over a term of years:"



<br><br>Now, Sir, there are three restrictions in clause 81 as

regards the period of redemption. Firstly, the  period

shall  not  exceed  60 years in any case.  With  this,

after due consideration, we are prepared to agree. The

second restriction is that the period shall not exceed

the estimated life of the purpose: that is to say, for

example,  40 years in the case of a power station.  We

agree  that  this  is  financially  sound.  The  third

restriction  is that the period shall not  exceed  the

period of the loan under clause 79 of the Bill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2351</b></font><br><br>



which  loan under clause 80 shall be charged  on  City

Council  revenue. It is this restriction to  which  we

object  and which we seek to remove, bearing  in  mind

that  long-term  loans are not easy to  raise  in  the

Singapore  market and that short-term loans for  long-term  projects are all that can normally be hoped for.

Let  me  now  illustrate what happens. Let us  suppose

that  the City Council wishes to raise a loan  of  $10

million to extend the power station; the life  of  the

asset  or  this extension being, let us say, 40  years

and the period of the loan 10 years. If the period  of

redemption  is  related to the  period  of  the  loan,

namely  ten  years, then apart from considerations  of

interest, a refund has to be made under clause  82  of

$1  million  per  year  from your electricity  revenue

account.   On  the  other  hand,  if  the  period   of

redemption  is related to the period of the  estimated

useful  life  of  the project, namely 40  years,  then

apart  from  considerations of interest, a  refund  of

only  $250,000  per year has to be  made.  This  is  a

saving  of $750,000 per year in your revenue  account.

What  is  the result? As a result of this saving,  the

unit  price  of  electricity can be  reduced  and  the

present   generation  is  not  being   made   to   pay

unnecessarily  heavily  for  the  benefit  of   future

generations.  The unit price of electricity  not  only

can  but  ought to be reduced in this way and I  would

suggest,   particularly,  for   industrial   purposes,

because  if  the  Minister for Commerce  and  Industry

could attract industrialists to set up factories  here

today,  as  indeed is the policy of the Government - one

of the inducements being an adequate supply of cheaper

power - we should be better off not only now but in  the

future  and we would therefore be in a better position

to  raise  further loans in the future. The very  fact

that  the City Council has to redeem loans within  the

period of the loan and not within the estimated useful

life  of the purpose does tend to handicap much needed

development.  Not only the present generation  suffers

by having to pay an inflated price for electricity,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2352</b></font><br><br>



but  the  future  generation suffers through  lack  of

industrial  expansion today. The amendment  before  us

will   remove   this  unnecessary  and   short-sighted

restriction.

<br><br>3.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Mr

Chairman, I should say, before I start to reply to the

hon.  Member, Sir, that of course the proviso to which

he objects does not preclude short-term borrowing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, under the existing

Municipal  Ordinance, the City Council is  obliged  to

arrange for the redemption of a loan within the period

sanctioned  for  the repayment of  a  loan.  In  other

words, the period of redemption must be not more  than

the period for repayment. The period of redemption  is

not  related  to  the useful life of the  purpose  for

which the loan is raised. This would be clear from the

minutes of the Parliamentary Bills Committee which are

quoted  on page 38 of the Sessional Paper L.A.  10  of

1957, that is, the book containing the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before proceeding further, Sir, I should perhaps

make  it quite clear that a distinction has been drawn

in  this  Bill between redemption and repayment.  This

distinction  was  not made in the  existing  Municipal

Ordinance.   Unless   this  distinction   is   clearly

understood,  discussion of the  clauses  of  the  Bill

referring  to loans will be largely meaningless.  Here

again,  I  would  refer to page 38  of  the  Sessional

Paper.  Repayment is the physical act of repaying  the

subscribers  to  a loan. Redemption  in  this  context

refers  to  the arrangements made by the  borrower  to

provide funds for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2353</b></font><br><br>



repayment and I hope this distinction is clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some time, financial officers of the City

Council  have  considered  that  the  terms   of   the

Municipal  Ordinance  are, in  certain  circumstances,

unnecessarily restrictive on the Council's  powers  to

raise and redeem loans. Short-term borrowing has  been

rendered  difficult  because of  the  difficulties  of

redeeming  a loan over the short period for  which  it

has  been raised. In some cases, where money has  been

raised  for a purpose with a long useful life, it  has

not  been possible to redeem the loan over that period

although  there may have been a strong case for  doing

so. In this latter connection, however, I must make it

clear  that  at  no  time has it ever  seriously  been

suggested that a loan should be redeemed over a longer

period than 60 years even although the useful life  of

the purpose for which the loan is raised may appear to

be  more  than 60 years. I must emphasise this.  Sixty

years is a very long time: in fact, two generations or

the  lifetime  of an average man. There are  very  few

purposes which have a useful life even approaching  60

years. By useful life, I mean the period of life of an

asset   before   it  requires  major  expenditure   on

replacements or to modernise it or adapt  it  to  meet

current  requirements. Even in the case  of  permanent

buildings, it would be a rash man who would  say  with

complete confidence that the useful life, that is, the

period   of  life  before  repairs,  adaptations   and

modifications were required, was over 60 years. Again,

since these modifications would normally require fresh

capital,  it  would  be  unfair  that  any  particular

generation  of  consumers should be saddled  with  the

financial  consequences  of their  great-grandfathers'

undertakings as well as their own. For these  reasons,

it  has never been seriously suggested that the period

of redemption of any loan should exceed 60 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, the financial officers of the

City   Council  have  been  anxious  to  obtain   some

relaxation  of  the restrictions placed  on  the  City

Council's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2354</b></font><br><br>



powers  of  borrowing  and funding  by  the  Municipal

Ordinance. When clause 81 was drafted - at this stage, I

should  say  that the financial clauses of  this  Bill

were  all drafted by the City Treasurer and have  only

been  subjected  to minor modifications  since - it  was

provided   that  every  sum  borrowed  under   section

78 - which should read 79 - shall be redeemed within  such

period not exceeding 60 years as the City Council with

the sanction of the Governor in Council may determine.

In short, clause 81, as it appears in the Bill without

the proviso.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this clause came to be discussed with the City

Treasurer, it was readily agreed that a proviso should

be  added  to  the effect that such period  shall  not

exceed  the  estimated useful life of the purpose  for

which  the money has been raised. Quite obviously,  it

would  be most imprudent to fund a loan over a  longer

period  than the useful life of the purpose for  which

it  had  been  raised and I am sure that hon.  Members

will agree unanimously on this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far so good. It had, at this stage, been agreed

by all parties concerned that clause 81 should read as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every sum borrowed shall be redeemed within such

period  not exceeding sixty years as the City Council,

with  the  sanction of the Governor  in  Council,  may

determine: Provided always that such period shall  not

exceed  the  estimated useful life of the purpose  for

which the money has been raised."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, however, it had become clear that the

matter  was not quite as simple as it would  at  first

appear.    There    were   certain   very    important

considerations  which  had to be  taken  into  account

before giving the City Council the powers contained in

this  clause. Firstly, the policy relating  redemption

to  useful  life rather than to the period of  a  loan

means  that  on  the  due date of payment,  the  money

available  in the sinking fund will be less  than  the

amount  required for repayment. It also  assumes  that

the  borrowing  authority can count on being  able  to

float a loan to pay off the original loan whenever  it

is  required.  This,  of course, is  the  position  in

England where there is a highly developed loan  market

and where local authorities can count



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2355</b></font><br><br>



with reasonable certainty on being allowed and able to

float  a  loan  wherever  it is  required  but  it  is

doubtful if the situation will ever be quite the  same

in  Singapore.  One is, of course,  looking  into  the

future  and  speculating  rather  than  speaking  with

certainty  about conditions which may then  exist.  It

does, however, seem at least uncertain whether in  the

foreseeable  future conditions in  the  local  capital

investment  market will be such that the City  Council

could  count with certainty on being able to  float  a

redemption loan at any given date. In the first place,

the  City Council has already a substantial burden  of

debt.  This is bound to increase considerably  in  the

future and the local investing public will in the  end

be  very  heavily committed in respect of City Council

loans  with  possibly  a corresponding  reluctance  to

become further committed. Again, the amount of capital

available  for  investment will not be  unlimited  and

there  is  certain  to  be  competition  for  what  is

available.  In all these circumstances,  it  seems  at

least doubtful that the City Council will always  find

it  easy  to float the loans it requires. It  may,  in

fact,  find  it extremely difficult. This is  a  point

which has to be borne in mind before agreeing that the

City  Council  should embark on a new policy  of  loan

redemption which is dependent for success on the ready

availability  of  loan  money.  Secondly,  it  appears

probable  that if any relaxation of the  present  safe

funding policy of the City Council is allowed  in  the

interests of the present generation of ratepayers  and

consumers,  the  Council will be under great  pressure

from political interests to exploit the relaxation  to

the  uttermost and this pressure will be passed on  to

the  Government. Thirdly, account must be taken of the

possible  effect of a radical change  in  the  funding

policy on the credit of the City Council. So far,  the

Council has not had very much trouble in obtaining the

loan  money which it has required. It has had  a  free

run  of the Singapore market without competition  from

the  Government or other borrowing authorities. It was

borrowed for revenue producing purposes. The financial

policies of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2356</b></font><br><br>



Council  have commended themselves to the  public  and

perhaps,  as  important as anything else, the  Council

has  been  obliged by law to redeem the loans  within

the  period  for which they were raised. Assuming  the

continuing liability of the Council, subscribers  have

always been sure of their cash. If this funding policy

is   changed   and   if  a  new  policy   is   applied

indiscriminately to all loans, potential  subscribers,

having intimate knowledge of the local loan market and

of  possible conditions in the future, might  possibly

be  frightened  off.  This factor cannot  be  ignored.

Fourthly,  there is no gainsaying the  fact  that  the

soundest  and  most  prudent policy  which  any  local

government  authority  with a large  loan  development

programme  can  follow is to redeem as many  loans  as

possible within the periods fixed for repayment. As  I

say, there is no gainsaying this. Lastly, although the

City  Council enjoys a large measure of autonomy,  the

fact remains that Government does, in the last resort,

underwrite  its  loans. This gives  the  Government  a

special interest in the loan policies of the Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these measures which I have just mentioned were

discussed at great length with the City Treasurer  and

balanced  against  the desire and  need  of  the  City

Council for a more liberal loan redemption policy than

as  at  present allowed under the Municipal Ordinance.

In  the end, a conclusion was reached that it would be

unwise  to  give  the Council carte  blanche  in  this

matter, that the normal policy should continue  to  be

to  redeem  loans wherever possible within the  period

fixed  for repayment, that any extension of the period

for  redemption should be an exception rather than the

general  rule and that when such exception  was  made,

the  extended period should not exceed the useful life

of  the  purpose or 60 years whichever was the lesser.

Clause   81,   as  drafted,  gives  effect   to   this

conclusion.  It does not exclude the relation  of  the

period  of  redemption  to  the  useful  life  of  the

purpose. It merely says that this will be allowed  not

generally but in special cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel sure that in view of the special

considerations which I have mentioned,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2357</b></font><br><br>



hon. Members will agree that it is desirable to define

the  limits of loan redemption policy as has now  been

done in clause 81.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been asked in what circumstances will the

Governor  in  Council  exercise  discretion  in   this

matter.  In  other words, what would  be  the  special

circumstances?  This  question  cannot  of  course  be

answered  specifically. It can  only  be  answered  in

general  terms.  Generally, the special  circumstances

will,  I  imagine,  be dictated by the  needs  of  the

Council  to  obtain loan money at any particular  time

and  by the state of the loan market at that time.  If

funds  are essential and can only be obtained on short

term  on  reasonable terms, then the Council would,  I

imagine,  normally  be allowed to float  a  short-term

loan  and  fund  it over the life of the  purpose  for

which  it  was required. If, however, money  could  be

obtained at reasonable rates for a period which is not

too  far  short of the useful life of the purpose,  as

has  happened not infrequently in the past, permission

would  not  be  granted.  As I  say,  however,  it  is

difficult to speak in other than general terms on this

matter. Many imponderables are involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the circumstances which I have outlined,

Government cannot accept the amendment.



<br><br>3.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I suppose that Financial

Secretaries by nature and by training must be full  of

gloomy forebodings of the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are one or two points I would like to make

indeed in answer to the Financial Secretary, and there

are  one  or  two points which he has not answered  to

what I stated at first, and I hope he will answer them

later  on. The first point is this, of course, that  I

did  state quite clearly that we agreed with the first

restriction, as I called it, under clause 81, that the

period  of  60 years should be the limit. Secondly,  I

also  made it clear that we agreed that the period  of

redemption should not exceed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2358</b></font><br><br>



the  estimated useful life of the project and  in  the

example  I gave of an extension to a power station,  I

quoted  the  period of 40 years. So  that  we  are  in

agreement with the first two restrictions but what  we

are not in agreement with is the third relating to the

relation of the period of redemption to the period  of

the loan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Financial Secretary did say that it would

be unwise to give carte blanche to the City Council in

this  matter. Of course, the City Council is  not  now

being  given carte blanche at all because it is  quite

clear  in  clause  78 that the City Council  may  only

borrow  with the sanction of the Governor in  Council.

It is quite clear in clause 81 that every sum borrowed

shall be redeemed within such period not exceeding  60

years  as the City Council, with the sanction  of  the

Governor  in  Council,  may  determine.  There  is  no

question therefore of giving carte blanche to the City

Council as the Governor in Council has the last word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as I say, I think the Financial Secretary

regards  the  future with too great pessimism  and  to

assume  that loans cannot be raised in the  future  in

Singapore  in the way it has been in the  past  is,  I

think, far too pessimistic an outlook. He said that he

was  doubtful  whether they can  float  loans  in  the

future as they did in the past. Now, if there is to be

no  floating of loans in the future in Singapore, then

we  may regard that as the end of Singapore. So  I  do

not  think that argument can carry very great  weight.

The thing is that, as I explained, through the keeping

up  of the price of electricity or the price of water,

through having to keep the period of redemption to the

period of the loan, we are hamstringing the future. If

we  could  reduce the prices of electricity  or  water

(and I know this is a matter in which the Minister  is extremely interested), then by expanding our  industry

through these decreases today, we will make the  whole

financial position of the Colony more buoyant  in  the

future.
