<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head T of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100." - [Mr Hawazi Daipi].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head T - Ministry of Manpower. Dr Lee

Boon Yang.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Sir,

yesterday,  just  before the moment of interruption,  Mr  Low

Thia Khiang raised several supplementary queries.  Thank  you

for allowing me the opportunity to respond to him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked what is the scale of the problem of the older

workers.  Overall, we have about 330,000 workers who are aged

40 and above and who also have less than secondary education.

So  this is the group that we are focusing on - older, lower-educated  workers.  The unemployment rate for this  group  of

older  and lower-educated workers is about 3%, which is close

to the resident unemployment rate of 3.4%.  But the fact that

their   unemployment  rate  is  lower   than   the   resident

unemployment  rate of 3.4% is no cause for comfort  actually,

because this is the group that is, in fact, vulnerable as the

economy  continues to restructure.  At this age,  with  their

low  skills,  if  they  should lose  their  jobs,  they  face

increasing difficulty getting re-employed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at the end of last year, as I mentioned yesterday,

about  40,000 people had undergone training under the  Skills

Redevelopment  Programme.  The Member said  that  he  thought

only  about 23% of them are the older workers.  I would  like

to  point  out  that,  out of these 40,000  people  who  have

undergone SRP training, about 30% are aged 40 and above.  But

this, again, is also not representative because, in fact, the

group  of workers who are aged 40 and above represents  about

45% of the resident workforce.  So they are, in effect, under-represented in the SRP training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member finally asked whether we are satisfied with

the  response of older workers to our call to go  for  skills

upgrading.   The answer is no.  We want to see more  of  them

coming forward to undergo skills training and retraining,  so

that  they  can be better prepared for the changes  that  are

waiting for us, ie, the changes that are bound to come.  That

is  why  the  Government  has allocated  more  resources  for

manpower development.  In our programmes - whether it is  the

Skills  Redevelopment Programme, National Skills  Recognition

System or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>

under  the new programmes that we will introduce as  part  of

the  Lifelong  Learning Endowment Fund -  we  will  focus  on

programmes and activities that will enable more of the lower-skilled  and  older workers to upgrade their skills  so  that

they can be better prepared for the new economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, may I have your

permission to seek one clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> One last question. We are running out of

time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I would like to know from the

Minister  whether or not enough efforts have  been  put  into

reaching this group of workers to take up the skills training

or re-employment opportunities.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, we are putting a tremendous

amount of resources into this area of upgrading the skills of

the  older  workers.   We work very closely  with  the  trade

unions  and the employers to ensure that the older  group  of

workers  is  well  informed of the various  skills  upgrading

opportunities  available to it.  But I would  also  reiterate

that we will continue to put in more effort, and we need more

effort, to reach out to this group.  We also need the support

of  community  groups to help us to spread the  message  that

skills  upgrading  is important, in order to  cope  with  the

changes in the economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I would like to speak

on the issue of foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I empathise with, and support, the Minister for

Manpower  when  he  said yesterday that  Singapore  needs  to

welcome  foreign  talent even while we search  for  more  and

better  ways  of enhancing the employability of our  workers.

Let  me  state  at  the  outset that I support  the  existing

foreign  talent and foreign worker policies.  We  need  these

guest  workers in order to enlarge the economic pie  for  our

people as we are short of workers to enjoy sustained

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>

economic  growth.  I maintain, however, that in some  sectors

and  industries, the Ministry should encourage more companies

to  redesign job functions so that our older workers can take

advantage of the available jobs, instead of taking  the  easy

way  out by bringing in foreign workers, especially after our

own  workers  have gained new skills that may be relevant  to

our companies in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, foreign workers form a section of

our  working population whom we sometimes forget, even though

we  see and interact with them on a daily basis.  They  clean

our  neighbourhoods,  and  work on  our  factory  floors  and

construction  sites.  In fact, about 100,000 households  host

them  as domestic helpers, who cook and wash for our families

and  mind our children.  For the contribution that they  have

made to our prosperity and well-being, we must, as a society,

take  care  of the welfare of foreign workers, who  now  form

about 1/4 of our workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a union official, I would say that my views on

this matter have largely been shaped by the social mission of

the labour movement, which is led by NTUC, in taking care  of

the  welfare of workers here, both local and foreign.   While

the  majority  of employers treat the foreign  workers  well,

unfortunately,  there remains a small minority  of  employers

and  employment agencies who mistreat and abuse their foreign

employees,  through  physical  abuse,  breach  of  previously

agreed  terms  and conditions, and the lack of  proper  basic

amenities  like housing.  Foreign workers must  be  protected

against   such  errant  employers  and  employment  agencies.

Singapore is a civilised nation where morality and  the  rule

of  law prevail.  We have a responsibility to defend the poor

and the helpless amongst us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the report published yesterday by the newspaper,

Today,  brings  to  light some of the problems  that  foreign

workers  in Singapore face.  Entitled "Exploiting the  Weak",

it  brings  to  mind  the problems that unsuspecting  foreign

workers may face when they come to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>

Singapore.   It  is  true  that  some  of  these  abuses  and

mistreatment  may  have started right in their  home  country

but,  all  the  same,  Sir,  we must  ensure  that  those  in

Singapore  who abuse and mistreat the foreign workers  should

be  taken  to  task.  I would like to ask the Minister  about

disputes  involving  foreign  workers  and  action  taken  on

employers  who had mistreated their workers in the  past  one

year at least, whether there has been a large increase in the

number   of   complaints  against  employers  and  employment

agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am aware that MOM has proper channels for foreign

workers seeking redress against abuses.  I have also read  in

the press that penalties against abusive employers and errant

employment agencies have been stiffened.  These measures  are

laudable.   But I would like to put the issue into a  sharper

focus by suggesting to the Ministry of Manpower that the  law

should  discriminate clearly the instances where the  foreign

worker may have unknowingly broken the law.  The law must  be

unambiguous against offenders.  The law should also take into

consideration   that  foreign  workers  who,  for   instance,

overstay  may have done so because their passports were  kept

by  their  employment agencies or their employers.  In  these

instances,  the  law must also punish the  employers  or  the

employment  agencies  that are responsible  for  leaving  the

foreign workers stranded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign domestic workers, in particular, may be at the

mercy of employment agencies that find opportunities to  levy

exorbitant fees on these foreign workers.  I acknowledge that

some  of the cheating could have been committed in their home

country, even before the foreign worker set foot on our soil.

However, the Ministry of Manpower should monitor this  matter

closely, because the recruitment fees are levied on them when

they  first  take  up  a  new assignment  in  Singapore.   In

addition,  if  they change employers, or are  repatriated  to

their  own countries, they could be asked to pay unreasonably

high administrative charges to the employment agencies.  Yes,

we  can  say  this is a case of "willing buyers  and  willing

sellers" of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>

services here, but the Ministry should conduct regular checks

on maid agencies which charge prospective employers a low fee

and  then pass the cost of recruitment to the maids  who  may

not  get  their full salary.  In fact, they may get  even  as

little as $10 for as long as six months, because they have to

repay the fee to the agency through the employer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this light, may I request the Ministry of

Manpower  for an update of the measures taken to  ensure  the

protection  of  foreign domestic workers in  particular,  and

work  permit holders in general.  I understand that MOM  has,

as of 1998, required employment agencies to attend a training

course  at  the  Singapore  Polytechnic  before  giving  them

approval  to  recruit foreign workers.   May  I  request  the

Manpower Minister for his views on the usefulness of  such  a

course and whether it has produced the desired results.   Can

the Minister consider subsidising the training of maids here?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Hawazi, can I ask you to shorten your

speech?  We are running very far behind time and I intend  to

drop  the  "guillotine" on this Head  strictly  at  1.28  pm,

regardless  of  whether there are any  Members  who  wish  to

speak, in order that we can proceed to the other amendments.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, let me just conclude by saying

that  there  is  a  large number of foreign  workers  in  the

construction  industry.  I would like  to  ask  the  Minister

whether  we  have peculiar problems in the industry  that  we

should address.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Sir, there are

industries  that  are  highly reliant  on  unskilled  foreign

workers.   Many  Singaporeans complain that  because  of  the

importation  of  cheap labour, they have  been  displaced  by

these  lower-paid foreign workers.  My residents  in  Kampong

Glam  constituency are also frustrated with the  congregation

of  foreign workers in the HDB housing estates at Beach  Road

and Rowell Court.  These unskilled foreign workers bring with

them bad social habits and behaviour.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, employers must be asked to upgrade their operations

to reduce reliance on unskilled foreign workers.  The foreign

worker  levy  is  one  useful tool,  but  we  must  also  ask

employers  to provide better accommodation and other  welfare

amenities.   I  would like to ask the Minister  for  Manpower

what  steps  are  taken to reduce the reliance  on  unskilled

foreign workers, to provide the opportunities for Singaporean

workers,  without compromising and affecting the  ability  of

our  factories and the manufacturing service sectors to  meet

the manpower needs of the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another category of foreign workers are the maids. I am

concerned with the declining quality of the maids coming from

far away provinces, and what steps are taken to improve their

quality and training.  Is it possible now to allow management

corporations in condominiums to be employers of maids so that

they can be better utilised?

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in addition

to  the points made earlier, I would like to ask the Minister

to  review  the way in which foreign workers are brought  in.

The  present  system of using agents is exploitative  because

workers come in, with promises and hopes, and they sold their

property, borrowed huge sums of money to come in, just to get

out  of  the poverty trap.  The agents make money by bringing

the  workers in, so the more workers they bring in, the  more

money they make and, therefore, they try to bring in workers,

even illegally.  This is treating people like a commodity  as

with  other goods and services, which is not appropriate with

the civilised nature of our society.  Can we work out ways to

by-pass  agents, or at least make it difficult for agents  to

profiteer from treating humans as a commodity?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few days ago, I heard that there are big

companies  which are allocated foreign workers and when  they

do not

have  work, they send them to other people and collect money,

or  just  to  ask them to do their work. And sometimes,  when

their  work permits expire, the workers do not know about  it

because  they do not have their passports with them and  they

are  considered illegal immigrants, if they are  caught,  and

the  other  employers are also in trouble.   So  we  need  to

tighten up this allocation arrangement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that generally the living conditions of our

foreign  workers have improved.  When you go to  construction

sites,  their  housing  conditions have  improved.   Quite  a

number   of  employers  have  also  improved  their   housing

conditions,  which  are positive.  But there  are  also  many

workers   here   who  do  not  know  of  their   rights   and

responsibilities, including those on employment  pass.   They

come here on contracts, and when their terms and salaries are

changed,  they  cannot  do very much.   And  foreign  workers

earning above a certain salary have difficulties in getting a

redress.   Maybe  we  should also try to apply  ourselves  to

solve  this  problem.  Just as we were  able  to  reduce  the

accident rate of foreign workers in construction sites, I  am

sure if we put in the effort, there would be results.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like the Minister to review the way foreign

workers  are sent back.  Nowadays, it is very easy.  Somebody

just  has to cancel the work permit and the worker goes back.

On  a number of times, we read that they protest because they

said  they  have not been paid their wages, that are  due  to

them.  Could we have a better check and balance so  that,  at

least,  the employers do not exploit them and send them  away

and save money?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point that I would like to make is that I am

very  happy  that the Minister, in his reply yesterday,  said

that  he  would  be  making sure that the number  of  foreign

workers  coming in would be controlled so as not  to  deprive

our workers of jobs.  This is particularly necessary when  we

have  such a high number of unskilled older workers.  I think

we  should  make sure that our local wages are not  depressed

and our terms and conditions of employment are not lessened.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Sir, with globalisation

and  rapid  economic reform, the Ministry of Manpower  should

help industries that are heavily dependent on foreign workers

to   reduce  its  dependency  by  raising  productivity,  and

encourage  these  industries to adopt innovative  methods  to

redesign and re-engineer the work processes. We will have  to

import more foreign workers if we do not restructure our work

processes  and redesign our jobs fast.  Today, the number  of

foreign  workers in Singapore is very large.  We  have  about

500,000  foreign workers, including 140,000 foreign  domestic

maids.   We  should  substantively reduce our  dependence  on

foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know what plans does the Ministry have

to  facilitate job redesign and re-engineering  and  how  the

Manpower  Development Assistance Scheme  (MDAS)  can  support

such  initiatives  and  how  the  Man-Year-Entitlement  (MYE)

system has helped address the issue of foreign workers in the

construction sector.  Has it helped to redress the  issue  of

employers  taking advantage of our foreign  workers,  ie,  to

stop  the  illegal  employment practices and  abuses  in  the

construction sector?  Would the Ministry consider  shortening

the  time-frame in tightening the MYE further?  The  Ministry

should  also  review  the  present  work  permit  allocations

system,  such as changing the existing sectoral approach  and

re-classifying the foreign workers' needs and entitlement  of

the various industries by their job requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I move on to the next cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, according to

statistics,  we have more than 900,000 families in  Singapore

employing  a total of more than 140,000 foreign maids.  There

is a necessity for us to seriously look into this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there are so many foreign maids in Singapore, what

kind  of  social influence would they assert on our  society?

Just  like our highway system, I do not think we should fully

depend on the ERP to control

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>

our  traffic  flow.   I  think  MOM  should  also  have  some

effective  measures  to  check  this  dependency  on  foreign

workers  and  not  depend entirely on the  mechanism  of  the

foreign  workers  levy  to check our people's  dependency  on

foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should also review the foreign workers levy.

This  is  very  important because the  foreign  workers  levy

serves  the  purpose of balancing our workforce in Singapore,

so  that the cost of employing foreign workers is not too far

below from the cost of employing local workers. Otherwise, we

would  not  be  able to prevent the employers from  employing

these  cheaper  foreign workers, and at the same  time  exert

pressure on the wages of our local workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we relax the levy on foreign workers, the employers

do  not  share the savings with their workers.  I  understand

that  most workers are given just  $30 to $40 extra by  their

employers.   As a result, there is a big difference of a  few

hundred  dollars  between  the wages  of  the  local  skilled

workers  and those of the  foreign skilled workers.   I  hope

that  something could be done about this matter so  that,  on

one  hand, the welfare of the foreign workers could be looked

into,  and on the other hand, the difference in wages between

the local workers and foreign workers will not be widened.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, last November,

the  Minister  said that he shall review the foreign  workers

and  foreign domestic maids levies, depending on the economic

climate this year.  By the generous give-away and the cut  on

tax  rate, the Government, has, in fact, signalled that there

may  be  an economic downturn this year.  So, it is also  not

wrong  for  the Minister to think likewise and cut  the  levy

rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current levy rates for workers range from $30-$470

per  month.   The  levy for maids stands at $345  per  month.

These  rates  are a burden on the SMEs and on the housewives.

There  has been much talk of our SMEs finding it tough to  do

business,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>

partly  due  to  the  high fees and  levies  imposed  by  the

Government.  The Minister should review the workers levy  and

see  whether  he can reduce them to help our SMEs  tide  over

this  lull period.  As for the working mothers, the  Minister

without  Portfolio said that they enjoy double  tax  reliefs,

which   can   be   offset  by  domestic  maid   levy.    But,

unfortunately, this relief is not enjoyed by single  fathers,

and  I believe, also single mothers.  Sir, there shall  be  a

surplus  and  I do not see why the Government  is  not  in  a

position to reduce these levies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in particular, the maid levy is a hardship for

working  mothers.  Many working mothers go out to  work,  not

out  of  choice, but are forced to do so because of the  high

cost of living. They have to work to supplement the household

income, otherwise, they cannot make ends meet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also ask the Minister to review whether tax

relief on maid levy can be given to single working mothers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, since there is really not much

time  left, I would have to be very brief in my reply.   They

have  raised so many questions and I may not be able to  deal

with all the points that were raised in the short time that I

have  available.  If they do not get an answer directly, they

can  always raise it again on another occasion.  If it  is  a

Question for Oral Answer, I would certainly try to give  them

a fuller answer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi basically supports the foreign worker policy,

but asked whether we can do more to get employers to redesign

their  jobs  so  that  more of these jobs  can  be  given  to

Singaporeans  and  cut down on the dependency.   Essentially,

the  point  was also made by Mr Loh Meng See.   Yesterday,  I

have  already explained what we are trying to do to encourage

employers to look more closely into improving their  business

model, redesigning their jobs, so that they can tap on a pool

of Singaporeans who are available for these jobs, rather than

just turn to foreign workers as a first option.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh asked what can the Manpower Development

Assistance  Scheme do to facilitate such job redesigns.   The

answer  is that we can do quite a lot, because with MDAS,  we

can help industries that want to carry out re-engineering and

job  redesign,  and therefore requiring a different  type  of

workers,  to  have the workers trained for  their  new  jobs.

MDAS  can  come  in  and  assist  such  industries  with  its

training.  For instance, in the cleaning industry, commercial

cleaning  companies have come together to form a  Centre  for

Cleaning Technology.  It is located at the Bukit Merah Skills

Development  Centre  and  we  are  training  several  hundred

workers  who  are  doing jobs in the cleaning  industry.   We

would  continue  to  expand the intake of  workers  for  such

training so that they can go out and do a better job, and  be

more  productive workers.   Our experience with some of these

workers who have already been through the training courses is

that  they  have been able to do a better job and,  in  fact,

many  of them have been promoted in their companies to  do  a

higher  level job.  We certainly would do more, in  terms  of

job redesign, in order to ensure that foreign workers are not

the only solution to companies that require this category  of

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi and several other Members also said that we

must  take care of the foreign workers who are in our  midst.

We  have,  today,  nearly  500,000 foreign  workers  on  work

permits  here in Singapore.  I agree with him that  they  are

here  to  do  a  job,  they contribute to  our  economy.   We

Singaporeans,  whether as an employer of a  foreign  domestic

worker  or  a  company that employs hundreds or thousands  of

foreign  workers, have to be responsible and we have to  look

after  the welfare, housing, accommodation and all the  other

needs of the foreign workers while they are here.  We take  a

very  serious  view  of employers who, for whatever  reasons,

mistreat  their  foreign  workers.   Basically,  all  foreign

workers,   like  local  workers,  are  protected  under   the

Employment   Act.   Those  employers  who  are   abusive   or

exploitative face action under the Employment Act,  or  under

some other laws.  For instance, in the case

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>

of  foreign  domestic workers, who are  not  covered  by  the

Employment  Act, the Penal Code was amended in  May  1998  to

enhance the penalty by one and a half times against employers

who commit offences against their foreign domestic workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers who mistreat their foreign workers in the

economic  sector,  for  instance,  face  sanctions  from   my

Ministry once such abuses are detected, for example,  refusal

to  pay  salaries  to the foreign workers, a  point  that  Mr

Thomas mentioned.  My Ministry will certainly be able to step

in to help them. We have a Foreign Workers Unit in the Labour

Relations  Department  that  will  help  foreign  workers  to

resolve  any  disputes  that they have  with  employers.   Mr

Hawazi asked whether these disputes have actually gone up  or

not.   We receive, on average, about 400 complaints or  so  a

month from the foreign workers that are present in Singapore.

By  and  large,  we have been able to resolve most  of  these

complaints.   The numbers have gone up over the years  simply

because   the  base  of  foreign  workers  in  Singapore   is

increasing.   But  I  would not say that they  have  gone  up

drastically.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of overstaying when employers retain the

foreign  worker's passport and the foreign worker unknowingly

commits an offence of overstaying, my colleague, the Minister

for  Home  Affairs, had reiterated last week that no employer

has the right to retain a foreign worker's passport. In fact,

employers  should  not do so.  And there  is  no  reason  why

foreign  workers unknowingly overstay, because they know  the

terms  of their work permit that were granted to them.   They

know  that they should not stay beyond the validity of  their

work  permit.   And if the employer cancels the work  permit,

they  would  be  kept  informed by the employer,  because  no

employer  will  just cancel the work permit and  deliberately

keep it a secret from the foreign worker.  The reason is that

once  the  work  permit is cancelled,  the  employer  has  an

obligation to repatriate the foreign worker,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>

failing  which he will face forfeiture of the security  bond,

which  is $5,000, if he does not successfully repatriate  the

foreign worker after cancelling the work permit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you will find that the measures that are put in

place,  in  fact,  help to expedite the repatriation  of  the

foreign worker, and also provide a reasonable protection  for

the  foreign  worker.  It prevents employers from  abandoning

their foreign worker by willy-nilly just cancelling the  work

permit  and  not informing the foreign worker.  They  have  a

very  short window, after the work permit has been cancelled,

to  repatriate  the  worker and to produce  evidence  of  the

repatriation, so that the security bond can be cancelled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas Thomas made the point that some of our

employment agents are exploitative.  They just bring  in  the

foreign  workers  and collect the money from  them.   Can  we

bypass the employment agents?  We have to understand the role

of  the  employment agents.  They serve as  an  intermediary.

There  are  people  in Singapore who want to  employ  foreign

workers, whether it is a company or an employer of a domestic

worker.  How do they go about getting the kind of person that

they  want  and  where from?  It is very difficult  for  many

employers, especially if we talk about employers of  domestic

workers,  on  their  own to recruit a foreign  worker.   Some

people  have been able to do this, because they have contacts

and  friends  overseas and so on and so forth.  But  for  the

vast  majority, they would not know where to start  on  their

own.  So they go to an agent.  The agent actually fulfills  a

useful role as an intermediary to bring foreign workers  into

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are aware that some agents may not abide by

all  the rules and regulations that are imposed on them.   We

monitor  their operations closely, so that in case we  detect

any violation, we will certainly act against them.  Under the

Employment  Agents  Act, we can revoke  their  licence,  even

forfeit the security deposit that they have placed with us if

we  detect evidence that they have acted against the interest

of  the  employer in Singapore, or acted against the interest

of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>

the foreign workers whom they have brought in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas also made the point that some foreign workers

come   in  and  work  under  certain  terms  and  conditions,

including those who come here on employment passes, and  they

should be better informed.  If they come in on specific terms

of  employment and if they feel that the employer had somehow

changed  those terms and conditions of employment,  they  can

always  turn  to my Ministry for assistance.   We  offer  the

services of the special Foreign Workers Unit to help  workers

who  face such difficulties.  And I said earlier on, we  deal

with about 400-odd appeals a month, and if there are any such

workers  who  feel  that their employer  is  trying  to  take

advantage  of  them by changing the terms and  conditions  of

employment, we will be very pleased to assist them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have responded to Mr Loh Meng See's point

just  now  about getting employers to redesign jobs  to  make

sure  that  we do not become overly dependent.   As  for  the

Member  for Kampong Glam, he feels his residents' unhappiness

with the congregation of the foreign workers in various parts

of  Kampong  Glam.  I agree with him that this is a  problem.

That  is  why we are trying to manage the number  of  foreign

workers in Singapore.  We use a variety of measures.  Several

Members have spoken about the foreign workers levy.  That  is

one  of the key measures that we have in hand to moderate the

demand  for  foreign  workers.  Without the  foreign  workers

levy,  we will have a greater number of foreign workers  here

in  Singapore.  The demand is almost insatiable, in a  sense,

because  today  we  have more than 140,000  foreign  domestic

workers.  And without the foreign workers levy, for instance,

we  are  going to have a  higher number  because  the  income

level of Singaporeans has continued to go up, notwithstanding

the  economic crisis.  In fact, during the economic  downturn

in  1998, the number of foreign domestic workers continued to

increase by about 5% over the year, although the increase

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>

was at a slower rate compared to previous years.  So we use a

mixture  of  dependency ceiling and foreign workers  levy  to

regulate and to control the demand for foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have, in fact, spoken about the

accommodation  for foreign workers.  I think  this  would  be

mainly  the foreign workers in the economic sectors, such  as

those  in  the  construction industry and  the  manufacturing

sector.   For  those  who  are in  the  households  of  their

employer,  the  foreign  domestic  workers,  of  course,  are

provided  with  accommodation in the homes of  the  employer.

Accommodation is therefore not a problem.  But for  those  in

the   economic  sectors,  one  of  the  undertakings  of  the

employer,  when  they  bring in the  foreign  worker,  is  to

provide  suitable  accommodation.   And  we  have  a  certain

standard  about  the  kind  of accommodation  which  must  be

provided  on  the  worksite, for instance, so  that   foreign

construction  workers  are  entitled  to  reasonable  housing

standards  if  they are placed in worksites.   Alternatively,

the employers will have to provide rented accommodation.  And

there  are  also rules about how many people you can  put  in

rented  accommodation, whether it is  in  a  room,  house  or

apartment.   The  Building Control Authority  will  regularly

check  if  there are employers who are abusing this provision

and overcrowding their foreign workers.  They will also check

the worksite housing provided for the construction workers to

ensure  that  this complies with all the sanitary  and  other

environmental requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we will continue to study this issue,

because having more than 500,000 foreign workers in our midst

is  a  tremendous challenge, in terms of accommodating  them.

While  some foreign workers are accommodated on the worksite,

increasingly, worksites are organised in such a way  that  it

is  very difficult to accommodate them.  So they have to look

for off-site accommodation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is working closely with the Ministry of

National Development to identify more areas of land which can

be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>

set   aside  for  housing  foreign  workers.   And   we   are

encouraging the private sector to come forward to  invest  in

such  short-term  housing  for foreign  workers.   This  will

provide  much better accommodation.  Already, some  companies

have  invested  and developed such dormitory housing.   There

are  several of these scattered around the island,  and  they

are available to employers who want to place their workers in

such dormitory housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have asked about the foreign workers

levy.   As  I  have  explained, it is a key  feature  of  our

foreign  workers  policy  to use  the  levy  as  a  means  of

regulating  the demand.  We will continue to use the  foreign

workers  levy to  regulate the demand.  In the  case  of  the

point  raised  by  Mr Yeo Guat Kwang on the two-tier  foreign

workers  levy  - the skilled workers on a lower levy  at  $30

and  a  higher  levy for the unskilled workers   -   we  will

continue to use this in order to encourage more employers  to

recruit  skilled workers who can do a bigger and better  job;

therefore, resulting in a lower demand for actual  number  of

foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will leave it to the employers when they employ

skilled workers on the lower levy to set their wages for  the

skilled  workers.   It is a policy of Government that  we  do

not interfere in the labour market to determine wages.  Wages

are  on a "willing buyer, willing seller" basis, and we leave

the  setting of wages, both for local and foreign workers  to

market forces to determine.  However, our experience is that,

in  fact, the skilled foreign workers generally do receive  a

higher  salary  than the unskilled foreign workers.   So  the

lower  levy therefore has resulted in employers paying  their

skilled workers a higher wage, which is in line with what  we

have in mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo also asked whether we can review the sectoral

approach in locating the foreign workers.  The answer is yes,

we  do that.  From time to time, we do make adjustment to our

overall  sectoral approach for allocating foreign workers  to

accommodate  the  special needs of certain  industries.   For

instance, now that we are promoting the construction industry

to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>

use  more off-site fabrication, we will be looking at how  we

can   assist   those  who  are  undertaking   such   off-site

fabrication work to have access to foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also looked at the process in the petrochemical

and   pharmaceutical  plants   -   these  are   the   process

engineering companies  -  to see how we can better manage the

pool  of  foreign workers in this industry.  We have  allowed

them  to  use  the workers who are doing process construction

work   to   also  carry  out  process  maintenance   because,

essentially,  they are workers with the same set  of  skills.

So  instead of having two different sets of workers,  one  to

do  construction  and  the  other  to  do  maintenance  under

manufacturing, we have merged the two schemes,  so  that  the

petrochemical  plant can depend on just  the  same  group  of

foreign workers to do both construction and maintenance.   In

this  way, we are responding and we will continue to look  at

the needs of other sectors that warrant special adjustment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members look at it in this way that there is an

overall  framework  to regulate foreign workers,  both  using

dependency ceiling and levy, then I hope they understand  why

the  levy  remains an important tool to moderate the  demand.

And  in the case of the foreign domestic  workers, the demand

has   continued  to  go  up,  notwithstanding  the   economic

downturn.   Over the years, we have increased the  number  of

foreign  domestic workers dramatically.  We started out  with

hardly  any  in  1978.  Today, we have more than  140,000  of

them.   I  believe that we will continue to have to  use  the

levy  as a mechanism to regulate the demand.  And as  I  have

said  recently on a number of occasions, the foreign  workers

levy,  including the foreign domestic workers levy,  will  be

reviewed later this year, after we have a better feel of  how

the economy is responding to the changes around us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, I think Mr Loh Meng See mentioned

the   point   about   allowing  management  corporations   of

condominiums,  for  instance,  to  recruit  foreign  domestic

workers.   I  think  we  have discussed  this  issue  before,

whether we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>

can  allow  commercial companies to recruit  women  from  the

neighbouring countries and to deploy them to work as domestic

workers  in  the  homes of Singaporeans.  There  are  several

issues  here.  We have considered this idea on  a  number  of

occasions, whether or not we should allow such services to be

offered.  But there are problems like, for instance, who will

be  held  accountable  for housing this additional  group  of

foreign workers, and the propensity for abuse when you  allow

employers, employment agencies or a company to recruit  large

numbers  of  these foreign women to come to Singapore  to  do

this  kind  of work.  On balance, we decided that  we  should

retain  our  present arrangement whereby the women  from  the

neighbouring countries who do this domestic work are assigned

to   a   specific   household   where   they   are   provided

accommodation.  We can hold the employer responsible  and  we

can  ensure that the foreign domestic worker's welfare is not

jeopardised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have covered most of the points.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, according to the Yearbook of

Statistics 2000, in 1999 our workforce was about 1.9 million,

but  CPF  contributors were only 1.22 million.   There  is  a

difference  of  760,000 people, which  even  after  deducting

foreigners  and  foreign workers, we  will  end  with  a  few

hundred  thousand Singaporeans not contributing to  CPF.   In

fact,  in  the December 2000 Manpower News, it says 3.35%  of

workers  in private sector establishments are under  contract

for service, which means they do not contribute to CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPF is the main safety net in Singapore. Not being a

member of CPF means these people may have difficulty with old

age  funds,  medical  care,  home  ownership,  education   of

children,  and  the other things that Central Provident  Fund

covers.  These are important things.  I would like to ask the

Minister how the Ministry is going

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>

about  to  try and get more people to be brought  in  as  CPF

members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this. If we look at the demography

of  Singaporeans, more of us are getting older, that part  of

the  baby  boomers are retiring which is a large number,  and

they will draw out CPF funds, but the people coming in may be

less.   Will this result in a net outflow of funds from  CPF?

And  if  more  CPF funds are coming out than going  in,  what

would be the consequence of this negative cash flow for CPF?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to say is that many of us CPF

members  are  investing in the stock market.  Most  of  these

investments are challenging and very interesting, but not all

of  them  made  money.   But when you  lose  money  with  CPF

savings,  you are actually eating into your old age  security

and  safety  net.  While, on the other hand,  investment  has

risks, I think we should still help our members to make  wise

decisions and also give them information on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we should also review the social safety net,

because CPF has got its limitations.  We keep hearing that in

the new economy, workers will have to change jobs more often,

which means they lose their jobs more often, and the law says

that  if you work less than three years, you are not entitled

to  retrenchment benefits.  But even if you  are,  there  are

companies  which  do not pay retrenchment  benefits.   So  if

people  lose  their  jobs in between jobs,  we  do  not  have

adequate  social safety measures for them.  I would  like  to

ask  the  Ministry whether it could also look into  providing

more  comprehensive and wider coverage of the  social  safety

net.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, there are about 10 minutes left

on this amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, before I begin, can I ask a

clarification  from  the Minister?  He says  that  there  are

500,000  foreign  workers.   Does  that  number  include  the

140,000 domestic maids?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Yes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> So 500,000 is the total. Therefore,

the  total  number  of foreign workers in Singapore  is  only

about 500,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have got a cut on restoration of CPF. The Asian

crisis  hit Singapore in July 1997.  The Government formed  a

Committee to recommend cost-cutting measures.  Among the cost-cutting measures recommended was a 10 percentage cut  in  the

employer's  component of the workers' CPF.  This  is  a  very

drastic measure to take.  The Government sought this route to

save the economy of the nation.  The workers sacrificed their

wages.   As  a  result, costs were lowered and this  made  it

possible for the economy to pick up and also for the  country

to achieve a 9.9% growth last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the workers want to know how much in total they

have sacrificed in terms of their wages, and how much of  the

profits  made  by the industrial sector are as  a  result  of

their sacrifices made, and how much of those profits made  by

businesses have gone to the Government in terms of taxes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the workers' movement must surely deserve some kind

of  a  reward  for  their excellent work they  have  done  to

persuade  the workers to accept a huge 10 percentage  cut  in

their CPF.  I would like to ask the Government to give, as  a

reward,   a   one-time  grant  to  the  labour  movement   in

appreciation  of the sacrifices of the workers  to  help  the

Singapore  economy to pick up during the last  two  years  of

recession.  The grant could be a one-time grant and  be  used

for  training  the workers, in addition to what  has  already

been given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full restoration of CPF has still not been

implemented.  The restoration has only reached 16  percentage

points  of the employer's component of CPF.  I hope the  full

restoration  to  the 20% CPF can be done  quickly.   Can  the

Minister perhaps give an indication of when this can be done?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, Mr Thomas Thomas raised several

questions on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>

CPF.   He asked what would be the impact of the negative cash

flow  - fewer contributors, as part of the ageing population.

Let  me say that there is no cause for alarm.  Over the  last

five  years,  the  Central  Provident  Fund  has  experienced

positive  cash  flow,  although  the  net  inflow  has   been

dropping.   It has been dropping not because of a  crisis  or

because  of  losses.   In  fact, the Central  Provident  Fund

system  is fully funded by the members themselves.  It  is  a

system where the payout for the members, when they reach  55,

is  drawn  from all the savings that they have  been  setting

aside during their working life.  So there is really no cross-generation  subsidy or overlap.  Today's retirees  or  senior

citizens, when they reach age 55 and draw on their  CPF,  are

actually drawing on the savings that they put aside  and  not

drawing on somebody else's accumulated savings.  Hence, there

is  no  need to be concerned even if CPF Board should show  a

decline in the net fund inflow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason why the net fund inflow is declining is

that  the population is ageing and, as Mr Thomas pointed out,

there  are  now  more  older workers, and  also  because  the

Government  has liberalised the use of CPF.  So  members  can

now  withdraw  nearly  all of their CPF  savings  to  invest,

whether  it  is purchasing shares or investing  in  insurance

policies  or  some  other  forms  of  investment.   We   must

therefore expect a higher rate of withdrawal from CPF, unlike

in  the  past where all the CPF money could not be  withdrawn

until  you  reach  age 55.  Today, even before  age  55,  the

member is able to withdraw the money not just for housing  or

medical needs, but also for their investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I would like to reiterate that although the net

fund  inflow has been declining, there is no cause for alarm.

It  is  not  a sign of impending crisis or inability  of  the

Central  Provident  Fund Board to meet its  obligations,  but

rather  a  reflection of the ageing workforce  and  also  the

restructuring of the CPF system, with more investment options

for the members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas also expressed concern whether the social

security net is adequate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>

or  not.   I  think we have used the CPF as a very  effective

mechanism  to  ensure that our workers are prepared  for  any

sudden  economic downturn, not only just by way of  adjusting

the  CPF  contribution rate but also ensuring that there  are

savings for the rainy days.  We will continue to use the  CPF

as  a  principal  means of social safety net  by  encouraging

workers  to  save  as  much as they  can  when  they  are  in

employment.  Of course, the most important thing here  is  to

ensure   that  the  workers  stay  employed  and   keep   our

unemployment  rate low, so that nearly all  Singaporeans  can

have  jobs  if  they want.  The fact that we  are  discussing

about  foreign workers - there are more than 500,000  foreign

workers  in  Singapore and even if you discount  the  140,000

foreign domestic workers, you have 360,000 foreign workers in

the  economic  sector  - means there  are  jobs  aplenty  for

Singaporeans if they want to take on these jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think creating employment is the best social safety

net  as it ensures that all Singaporeans who are able to work

have  the  skills  for the job are able to  make  a  positive

contribution  to  the economy.  That is much  more  important

than considering other options.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to CPF investments, yes, some CPF members

have  lost  money; others have also gained.  By  liberalising

the  CPF system, we have encouraged members to make their own

investment  decision.  In the process, some  would  make  bad

decisions,  but they have to accept the cost for making  such

bad   decisions.    We  believe  that  over   time,   prudent

investments will enable more CPF members to enhance their old

age  savings, and that this is something that has got  to  be

acquired.  People have to learn how to manage their  savings,

whether  it  is their own cash savings or their CPF  savings.

The Board itself will provide more information to CPF members

so  that they can be better informed with regard to investing

their savings.

minutes for this discussion.  Dr Lily Neo.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head T of the Main

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of our old HDB flats have been upgraded to

ensure   that  they  do  not  degenerate  into  an  unsightly

dilapidated state.  Old private estates deteriorate  as  well

and they should be similarly upgraded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am heartened therefore when the Ministry of National

Development  on  17th  October  2000  released   its   Estate

Upgrading Programme (EUP) and had chosen five private estates

as  the  first batch for this programme.  However,  such  EUP

only  applies  to public areas and does not cover  "works  on

private  land  and  facilities, including  common  areas  and

properties  of  condominiums and private apartments".   Going

further   and  having  these  old  condominiums  and  private

apartments  upgraded  as well would be even  better  for  the

estates.   Whilst the private owners themselves are  expected

to bear the expenses for this, I feel that the onerous burden

for such payments should be facilitated.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, owners whose HDB homes are owner-occupied and

who  are below 55 years of age can withdraw their CPF savings

in  the Ordinary Account to pay for the upgrading.  As an  MP

who has many residents who are private condominium owners,  I

hear  their  frequent  calls for the  use  of  available  CPF

savings  to  offset  the costs of upgrading  their  property.

Dwellers  in  the private estates feel that  they  should  be

given the same kind of privileges and be allowed to use their

CPF  savings  to upgrade their homes.  Many of  my  residents

have   argued  that,  similar  to  upgrading  of  HDB  flats,

upgrading of their apartments is a form of asset enhancement,

as  the  value of their flats will be enhanced.  Furthermore,

upgrading  would  allow them to enjoy the better  quality  of

life enjoyed by their cousins in upgrading HDB homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a pressing problem and is especially so for

some  of the older developments which are in a very sad state

of  disrepair.   It  is quite difficult,  indeed,  to  garner

enough  support from their residents to carry out  any  major

upgrading  project,  especially when it involves  substantial

expenditure.   Allowing the use of available CPF  funds  will

certainly reduce the awesome burden of any outright  payments

for  the upgrading.  This is even more significant for owners

of  the older condominiums who are elderly or retired and may

not  be able to afford to contribute the thousands of dollars

involved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beseech the Minister for Manpower to look into the

above issue.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, during last year's budget, the

Minister  of  State,  Mr  Othman Eusofe,  told  us  that  his

Ministry  is  in  consultation  with  NTUC,  SNEF  and  other

agencies  on  the ratification of ILO Conventions.   I  would

like  to  ask him on the progress of these consultations.   I

hope the Government will ratify the ILO Conventions as in the

Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights of   Workers

as  soon  as  possible.  Delay in ratifying will  convey  the

impression that there is an abuse of labour, and it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>

blatant  and widespread here, which is not true.  Delay  will

therefore  affect  our  image and would  attract  unwarranted

attention.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, let me reiterate that the

primary  objective of the CPF is to provide for the  members'

old  age.  We have always not allowed the use of CPF  savings

for  upgrading or renovating properties, whether  it  is  HDB

flats  or  otherwise.  An exception was made for the  nation-wide HDB Main Upgrading Programme because this is basically a

Government  initiated  programme  to  rejuvenate  old  public

housing  estates and also to enhance the assets of  citizens.

Because  the  cost  of  upgrading is  much  larger  than  the

payments made by the home owners themselves in the course  of

the  Main  Upgrading  Programme, the home  owners  receive  a

sizeable  subsidy from the Government.  Hence, it is unlikely

that  the upgraded flats' market value will fall below  to  a

point  where  they  are  unable to  recover  what  they  have

invested through their CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the privately initiated refurbishment or

upgrading, whether it is HDB or private residential  estates,

such as condominiums, the owner has to bear the full cost  of

such  renovation or refurbishment.  Therefore,  if  we  allow

them  to  withdraw  from their CPF, you will  find  that  the

amount  to be withdrawn is going to be much larger than  what

is  required  for the share of the Main Upgrading  Programme.

Furthermore,  it will also be very difficult to regulate  the

frequency of upgrading and renovation as well as to spell out

exactly  the conditions under which CPF can be used for  such

upgrading.  So we are concerned that the liberal use  of  CPF

savings for flat upgrading, or renovating private residential

properties, will result in premature withdrawal of a member's

old age savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I also want to point out that people living

in a private housing estate are generally in the upper income

bracket.   On the other hand, CPF contributions  have  got  a

cap.   No CPF contributions are required for that portion  of

the salary above $6,000.  Only the portion below

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>

$6,000  attracts CPF contributions.  Therefore, those  people

who  are earning more than $6,000 per month should have  more

personal savings apart from what is already saved in the  CPF

accounts.   Their CPF savings will also represent  a  smaller

proportion of their total savings available to them.   So  it

is  therefore  not  unreasonable to expect  those  living  in

private properties who want to carry out home renovations  to

do  so  with their personal savings, rather than  to  tap  on

their CPF savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned that some of these are older

people  living in private properties, condominiums and landed

properties,  and some of them may well be retirees.   Let  me

point  out  that  if  they  are  retirees,  they  would  have

withdrawn most of their CPF from age 55 onwards, and if  they

have  invested  the  CPF,  or if they  have  put  them  aside

carefully,  then  certainly they would have sufficient  funds

left  to renovate or upgrade their properties.  Anyway,  they

would have very little CPF left in their CPF accounts, except

for the Minimum Sum.  That would not be of much help even  if

we  allow  the  retirees to use the money  to  upgrade  their

properties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas asked about ratification of ILO Conventions.

Let  me point out that we have ratified two of the eight core

conventions.   These are the Convention 98 on  the  Right  to

Organise a Collective Bargaining and Convention 29 on  Forced

Labour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we announced that we will ratify Convention

182  on  the Worst Form of Child Labour.  We have no  problem

complying  with  this latest of the core Conventions  on  the

Worst Form of Child Labour and we will proceed to ratify this

Convention  in  June  this year at the  International  Labour

Conference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will ratify ILO Conventions taking into consideration

our  economic circumstances and national interest.   I  would

also  like  to  point out to the Members  that  not  all  ILO

Conventions are ratified by every member state.  For example,

the United

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>

States  has  to-date ratified only 13 Conventions,  including

only two out of the eight core Conventions.  We have ratified

<br><br>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conventions, including two of the eight core Conventions.

So  in comparison, we are not doing too badly.  And the point

that  he made about the impression that the workers are being

oppressed  in  Singapore  is a totally  wrong  and  unfounded

impression.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to study the ILO Conventions and seek

to  ratify  those that do not conflict with our national  and

workers'  interests.   When we do so,  we  will  consult  the

National   Trades  Union  Congress  and  also  the  Singapore

National Employers' Federation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (3), Mr Chng Hee Kok is not

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head T of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code TD 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Unions Act needs to be reviewed in order to

strengthen tripartism and also to strengthen the trade  union

movement.   I see unions are recognised as an effective  body

and have contributed to our economic and social developments.

There  is urgency in reviewing this for a few reasons.  There

is  now  the  Singapore Business Federation  in  place,  with

compulsory  membership  for certain types  of  employers  and

companies,  which  would strengthen  the  employers'  leg  of

tripartism  which  is good and proper.  There  are  arguments

which have been heard.  I buy those arguments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we also have to use the same arguments for labour

movement because the unions are in a very peculiar situation.

The union does not have the right to organise all classes  of

workers.   They only can take workers who have a contract  of

service, not contract for service.  But even then, there  are

categories of workers to be exempted.  We are not allowed  to

organise.   The  other point is that the union  is  the  only

organisation that renders its

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>

service  for  free.   Yesterday, during  the  debate  on  the

Ministry  of Finance, we were told that social responsibility

also  includes  the  charging of fees for services  rendered.

But  for  unions, when we negotiate collective agreements  or

NWC  recommendations, a large number of workers benefit  from

it,  a  lot of employers benefit, but no fee is charged.   So

there is a big problem of free riders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting we have a closed-shop principle

because that violates the freedom of association, but we  can

still look at the laws to see whether we could have an agency

fee  basis  that those who benefit from it pay something  for

it.   In  that  sense, it would be fairer.  There  are  other

provisions of the Trade Unions Act which are restrictive  and

which  actually make it difficult for unions to work.  Rather

than  go  through  all the arguments and provisions  here,  I

would suggest that we have a national committee to look at it

and  see  how we could strengthen tripartism by strengthening

the  trade unions movement and other associated laws in order

that  workers will have a greater say and influence.  If left

alone,  even  in  the  normal course of events  of  employers

versus the workers, employers have greater influence.  It  is

with  the  assistance of Government, the rules and  framework

that  there is a balance of power.  So we should really  look

at  the  laws to make sure that these things are strengthened

so that we could get on with the business of making Singapore

more  prosperous  and a better place for everyone,  including

companies which want to make more money and workers who  want

to have a better life.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe):</b> Sir, first, let me take the portion of the

question on the amendment to the Trade Unions Act.  Mr Thomas

has suggested that the union rules be liberalised to make  it

easier  for unions to operate.  Let me just mention that  the

Trade Unions Act was indeed reviewed last year and amendments

were  made  in  consultation with the National  Trades  Union

Congress and the Singapore National Employers' Federation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these amendments will give greater flexibility to

the  unions in their decision-making process, and also in the

way  they use the union funds.  In fact, union administration

has  been  made  easier with the introduction of  information

technology and, subject to the provisions, unions are free to

alter  their union rules, with the approval of their members.

Since  the amendments to the Trade Unions Act were introduced

only recently in December last year, at this stage, we do not

see a need to further review the Trade Unions Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his point about tripartism, I agree that tripartite

cooperation  among  the Government, the employers  and  trade

unions  over  the last three decades, has played  a  critical

role  in  maintaining industrial harmony and in  bringing  in

significant  benefits to the economy, the employers  and  the

workers.   It  helped  to  generate a national  consensus  on

important employment and industrial relations issues,  helped

to  formulate collective responses to deal with the  economic

crisis,  and  therefore, it has become a  strong  competitive

advantage  for  us,  particularly as a  choice  location  for

investments resulting in economic growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas Thomas spoke about the formation of the

Singapore Business Federation (SBF) which represents  a  wide

spectrum of employers, both the MNCs and the local companies,

and  his concern that this may affect the existing tripartite

relationship  among  the  three local  partners.   Employers'

interests   will  continue  to  be  represented  at   various

tripartite  bodies,  including the  National  Wages  Council.

And,  with  more  resources  and  better  coordination,   the

Singapore Business Federation will, in fact, be in  a  better

position to strengthen the tripartitie nexus and bring  about

economic  growth, better jobs, as well as an  enhancement  of

our  workers' welfare.  That the bigger businesses will  have

to  contribute  to the SBF will not mean that big  businesses

will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>

dominate  our  tripartite forums.   We  will  always  seek  a

balance to ensure that the interests of employees in the  big

or small companies are met.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas Thomas proposed that a fee be levied on

workers  who  are non-union members, before they could  enjoy

the  same  terms  and benefits as provided in the  collective

agreement.   I  do  not think that this is appropriate.   The

imposition  of  such  a  fee will be tantamount  to  coercing

workers to join the trade unions, and this would run contrary

to  the principle of freedom of association.  I think  it  is

also  tantamount  to  forcing employers  to  pay  their  non-unionised  workers less than union members.  While  they  are

not  union  members, they may well be doing the same  job  as

union  members.  So it is unfair to compel employers  to  pay

them less before they have opted to join the union or pay the

agency fees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the majority of collective agreements already

contain   provisions  prohibiting  non-union   members   from

enjoying   more  favourable  benefits  than  those   in   the

collective  agreement.  In other words, employers cannot  pay

better  benefits to non-unionised workers.  I think  this  is

reasonable.  It also ensures that employers cannot  undermine

the  efforts of the unions by offering non-unionised  members

better  terms  and conditions of employment.   I  think  this

provision,  already in place, places the trade  unions  in  a

good position to take advantage of the wide variety of social

benefits which they can offer to promote union membership.  I

believe  that  there  are many benefits,  apart  from  better

protection in employment, that workers would miss out if they

do  not  choose  to  join the unions.  Trade  unions  should,

therefore,  leverage on these benefits  as  an  incentive  to

encourage  more workers to join them, instead of  imposing  a

fee  as  a  means to increase their membership.  This  sounds

like  paying  a membership fee without the full  benefits  of

membership.   So,  in my view, it is a regressive  step  and,

therefore,  I  do  not  think that  we  should  support  this

proposal  for an agency fee, as I do not think it serves  the

interests of the labour movement in the long run.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, I would just like to make the

point  that I find it a bit of a contradiction that  when  it

comes  to employers and businesses, it is all right to impose

a  levy, but when it comes to workers' organisations,  it  is

not so.  With those comments, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head T of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code TG 1000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have spoken on this topic on several occasions

before,  and  this  matter has also been a topic  of  concern

raised by the Auditor-General in his earlier report.  I  have

come across many instances when workmen involved in workplace

accidents have had to wait for more than a year in order  for

them  to  get the insurance company to pay the money  due  to

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, I have two such meet-the-people session

cases.  These workers have had to be hospitalised and be away

from  work.   Their family income is affected and they  incur

all  kinds  of  penalties by the Town  Council  and  HDB  for

arrears.  These are not cases where there is any dispute that

compensation is due, or over the amount.  The workman suffers

injury  and  he is waiting and waiting to be paid.   Can  the

Minister  cut  short  any  bureaucratic  logjams  that   have

happened so often?  I also notice that usually the cases  get

settled  quite fast after I raised them in the  Committee  of

Supply, but it happens again and again.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, workmen

compensation  claims  are divided into  temporary  incapacity

(TI), permanent incapacity (PI) and fatal cases.  Sir, in the

year  2000, the average time taken to assess TI, PI and fatal

cases  is  two,  nine  and  six  months,  respectively.   The

permanent  incapacity cases take a longer time to process  as

they require medical reports as a basis to determine

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>

the  amount of compensation payable.  Medical reports usually

take  four  to  six months to be completed, as the  assessing

doctor  has  to be satisfied that the incapacity suffered  by

the  workman  has  stabilised and no further  improvement  or

deterioration is likely.  In some cases, medical  assessments

have  taken more than a year.  This is mainly because of  the

seriousness  of  the  injuries.  The  length  of  time  taken

depends  also  on the speed of recovery of the  workman,  and

this  is something not within the Ministry's control.  It  is

entirely in the hands of medical professionals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay mentioned that he has brought up some cases on

permanent incapacity.  One involves the case of a welder  who

sustained  serious arm injury during an accident at  work  on

29th  July 1999.  His permanent incapacity was only  assessed

by his doctor in December 2000, more than 16 months after the

accident.  However, while his permanent incapacity was  being

assessed,  he was paid temporary incapacity compensation  for

the  period he was on medical leave.  This is up to a maximum

of  one  year.  His case has since been settled  and  he  has

received  his compensation amounting to $22,050 on 7th  March

this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other case involves a stevedore who sustained a

serious  leg injury at work on 1st January 1999.  His  doctor

only  confirmed the permanent disability suffered by  him  in

August 2000, ie, 20 months after the accident.  This case  is

complicated  by the fact that the employer is  uninsured  and

has  denied that the injured workman is his direct  employee.

So  this case will have to be set before the Labour Court for

a determination, and hearing has been set for 26th April this

year.  Prosecution will be taken against the employer, if  it

is  found that the injured worker is indeed his employee  and

he  has  failed  to  insure his workmen under  the  Workmen's

Compensation Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry understands the concern that injured

workers  and their families may suffer hardship while waiting

for  their claims to be assessed.  However, I would  like  to

inform the House that whilst

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>

waiting  for  his  permanent incapacity to be  confirmed,  an

injured   workman   is   entitled  to  temporary   incapacity

compensation as provided for under the Workmen's Compensation

Act.   For  this, he is entitled to full earnings  up  to  14

days, if granted outpatient sick leave, and up to another  60

days, if granted hospitalisation leave, giving a total  of  a

maximum  of  74  days altogether.  And,  if  he  still  needs

medical leave beyond this period, he would be entitled to 2/3

of  his  wages up to one year, from the date of the accident.

This  means that he will have some compensation paid  to  him

while  waiting  for his case to be settled.   These  payments

would  help  to  alleviate the financial  burden  of  injured

workers, pending the final outcome of their cases.  In  cases

where  workmen  are unable to secure the TI  compensation  or

where the medical leave exceeds one year, we normally help by

referring the case to the MCDS for financial assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has been making conscious efforts to

expedite the settlement of claims and to ensure that payments

of  compensation  are  made  within  the  legally  stipulated

deadlines.   A system to monitor all payments of compensation

for  fatal  and  PI claims, and to issue demand  letters  and

reminders  where  payments are not made, was  implemented  in

June  1998.  Sir, we will continue to explore initiatives  to

further  expedite  the  assessment  and  payment  of  claims.

Recent  initiatives  undertaken by the Ministry  include  the

redevelopment of the work injury compensation  system.   Sir,

this system will be ready by the year 2002, and will help  to

expedite  claims by automating processes as far as  possible.

In  February 2001, the Ministry launched a training programme

to  educate  employers  on their responsibilities  under  the

Workmen's  Compensation Act, ie, to insure their workmen  and

to report the accidents on time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are also reviewing the Act to put in place

measures  and  penalties to deter practices which  delay  the

settlement of claims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (6), Mr Chay.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head T of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code TM 1000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has announced that we will

be   spending   $30  million  on  the  Manpower   Development

Assistance Scheme this year to help everyone in the workforce

upgrade their skills and knowledge.  Essentially, this  is  a

co-funding  scheme for skills redevelopment  training,  life-long  learning  and strategic conversion.  I  will  stick  to

skills redevelopment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To redevelop our workers' skills, they have to undergo

some course or programme at some stage, at our ITE, presently

at  Bukit Merah.  They will also have to make an application,

then  they  will  have  to  go and look  for  some  surrogate

employers  to  get  funding from CDC or  NTUC  for  approval.

These  programmes will be modular and recognised towards  the

skills set for skills recognition.  As this is something that

is  going  to  be  life-long,  can  we  not  get  the  Skills

Redevelopment Programme Centre to be a one-stop  centre  that

is  visibly  present in all the heartlands, bearing  in  mind

that the larger workforce that we are targeting at would have

to  apply,  and we need time to process and also we  need  to

minimise   the  inconvenience  to  them?   These  application

centres  could be widely permeated at the community level  so

that  members  of  the  community would  know  of  its  ready

availability  and its ease of application.  It should  be  as

easy as signing up for a course at the CC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these skills redevelopment application

centres  that I have mentioned, the training centres can,  of

course,  be differently located because they need specialised

equipment.   With the visible presence of these SRP  centres,

we can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>

reinforce  this life-long learning culture in the  community,

serving  its  purpose of life-long skills  redevelopment  and

retraining.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, Mr Chay has

highlighted the need for training opportunities and  also  to

make   them   easily   accessible,  and  he   suggested   the

establishment  of  a  one-stop facility,  especially  at  the

community level, to help workers get training. We also  share

his  concern.  In fact, we have set up, in last July, a  one-stop career centre and the centre aims to help individuals to

make  better employment and training decisions, and  also  to

help  offer  employment assistance and coaching  services  to

those  who require help in securing employment.  To  make  it

more convenient, we are developing a Career Associate Network

with like-minded organisations, such as self-help groups  and

the  community bodies, to set up similar facilities at  other

locations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bukit Merah Skills Development Centre is an old ITE

centre.   It is now open and we will open similar centres  in

other  locations  and  work together  with  community  clubs,

community centres, as well as Residents Committees, to  bring

actual  training  courses further down the  community  level,

particularly, as he mentioned, SRP training.  In fact, during

the   last   economic  downturn,  we  worked  with  Community

Development  Councils  and the NTUC  to  make  available  job

assistance and also organised employment facilitation  events

at  the  community  level, and this  includes  ensuring  that

workers  have  opportunities to  attend  SRP  training.   The

concern  is not so much on the existence of these facilities.

This  has  been addressed in the earlier part of the  debate,

but how we change mindsets, particularly of our older workers

and  of employers and how to get them to bring themselves  to

make  better  use  of  facilities that  are  available.  This

requires the help, not only of the employers and the  unions,

but  I  think,  the general community.  We need  to  get  the

message  down  that  whatever  employment  they  are  in,  it

requires them to upgrade their skills and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>

education.   This mindset change, this psychological  change,

is very necessary.  While we will provide and expand on these

facilities with the $200 million MDAS fund, we will  continue

to make it more readily available for them to make use of all

the facilities, community centres, IT centres and expand them

as best as we can. At the end of it, we must get the workers,

particularly the older workers, to make use of these training

facilities that are available and to make better use  of  the

opportunities to be trained.  I think this is  the  only  way

whereby they can continue to remain employable and also enjoy

better careers and better jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from time to time, some of our neighbours have

criticised Singapore for all kinds of things we have done  or

not  done, eg, for not doing more in economic assistance and,

for  doing  too  much  in  maximising  our  position  as  the

financial  and communications hub for the region.  For  being

the  "little red dot" on the one hand, and on the  other,  of

being the over dominant port.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let it be known that Singapore has the interests of

the region at heart.  We cannot relocate and shift out of the

region.   We  are here, for better or for worse, we  are  all

part  and  parcel of the region.  If the region prospers,  we

will  also  prosper.  It is, therefore, in our interest  that

our  neighbours  prosper.  It is a  win-win  situation.   Our

motto, therefore, is "Prosper thy neighbour".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important issue is the distribution and balance of

power in the region.  This is of key strategic concern to all

the  countries.  There is consensus that in the post Cold War

era, the strategic situation is not bipolar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two perspectives on this. One is that of an

emerging  multi-polarity,  with  the  United  States,  China,

Japan, Russia and India as players.  In theory, China, Russia

and  others  could form a coalition to balance  the  US-Japan

alliance, should the latter grow too domineering.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other perspective is an American pre-eminence, which

is the present trend, but one that is not accepted readily by

China, India and Russia.  There is,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>

therefore,  this tension which is manifested in  the  various

diplomatic offensives in recent years, particularly by  China

and  India, and more recently, by Russia, and the debate over

the National Missile Defence (NMD).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the horizon, all notice that China is emerging as

a  great  power,  and the Americans are increasingly  viewing

Beijing  as  a strategic rival.  Japan appears to be  slowly,

but  surely,  shedding  its post-war inhibitions  to  play  a

larger  role  in the Asia Pacific region. Sir,  what  is  the

likely  impact  on Southeast Asia if all these  great  powers

were to assert themselves?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Asia and Pacific, therefore, we will be affected one

way   or   the  other  by  any  changes  in  this  triangular

relationship of the United States, China and Japan.  In fact,

China  recently increased its defence expenditure  by  nearly

18%. The US expressed its concern, and said it would continue

to  sell weapons to Taiwan.  How will China conduct its trade

and  foreign  relations after its entry into the World  Trade

Organisation?   The  answer  to this  question  would  surely

affect the power configuration in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we now have a new Republican President in the White

House.  Will  President George W Bush and his  team  be  more

sympathetic  to  Taiwan  and be more critical  of  the  human

rights  situation  in  China?  Will the  US  continue  to  be

engaged in the region, maintain its military presence and fly

the flag, and thereby play a role in the balance of power  in

the region?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Southeast Asian region is beset with economic

problems  and traumatized by internal upheavals.  Governments

come and go swiftly, and in some parts, no one is sure who is

in  power.   Singapore  is in danger, or  in  the  unenviable

position, of being the good house in a bad neighbourhood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Control Risks Group, which assesses a country's

security  and  political risks, reports  that:   "Singapore's

economy and much of its prosperity is dependent

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>

on  it  serving as a haven between the increasingly turbulent

region.   While  the  Singapore  Government  can  manage  the

internal  implications of this paradox, it can do  little  to

alter the powerful political and social forces affecting such

key   neighbours  as  Indonesia  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,

Malaysia."   The challenge for Singapore then is  to  balance

the  needs of foreign investors seeking a secure base in  the

region, while maintaining good relations with often difficult

neighbours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is an oasis of peace and stability, but

some neighbours are still reeling from the after-shock of the

Asian economic crisis. The Chinese character for crisis, "wei

chi",  projects  danger  as well as opportunity.   There  are

elements of opportunity of hope in the midst of danger.   How

can Singapore then minimise the impact of danger and maximise

that of opportunity for progress?  This is not dissimilar  to

the  English  proverb  that every dark  cloud  has  a  silver

lining.   These  axioms from both East and West  are  perhaps

helpful  or  instructive when we view the regional turbulence

swirling around us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I would like to ask the Minister for his

strategic  overview  and  assessment  of  the  problems   and

prospects in our region.  I hope the Minister can give  us  a

forecast of likely political storms, and tell us if there  is

any  chance of sunshine or rainbow breaking out in the region

in the coming years.  I know that it is difficult to forecast

the  political weather.  Political turbulence,  by  its  very

nature, is very unpredictable.  It would be helpful, however,

if  the  Minister can give us his assessment of the political

weather  and  chart  out  for us the rocks  and  the  shallow

waters.  How can Singapore sail through potentially dangerous

waters?   What  can  we  do  as a nation  to  promote  peace,

stability  and security in our region?  Further, how  can  we

share and educate Singaporeans on the dangers and pitfalls in

the region, without alarming the public and the investors?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ASEAN has featured prominently these last 30 years

in   matters  of  peace  and  stability  in  Southeast  Asia.

However, since

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>

the  financial  crisis,  questions  have  been  raised  about

ASEAN's very future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frequent leadership changes in the ASEAN countries,

and  the  rapid  admission of new members  into  ASEAN,  have

prompted  analysts  around the world to doubt  whether  ASEAN

itself will be able to act cohesively, and expeditiously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The domestic political stability and political

transition  in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand  and,  to

some  extent, Malaysia, have cast a shadow over the prestige,

clout  and  capability of ASEAN and its ability  to  maintain

regional   stability  and  play  a  positive  role   in   the

international arena.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has ASEAN become too large with 10 members, though some

may   say  it  is  perfect  10?  The  question  is:   is   it

increasingly difficult for ASEAN to speak with one  voice  in

the  world  forum?  ASEAN has been a useful vehicle  for  the

countries in the region and it is imperative for all  the  10

ASEAN countries to ensure that it remains so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge is, therefore, on how to reinvent and

reinvigorate ASEAN, so that it can play new roles in the  new

millennium,  forge  unity amongst member countries  and  work

towards  the  promotion  of  peace,  stability  and  economic

progress in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish, in particular, to ask the Minister for his

assessment  on the outcome of the ASEAN Informal Summit  held

in  Singapore  recently and the recent ASEAN-EC  meeting,  as

well  as his comments on the ASEAN+3 formula, ie, ASEAN  plus

China,  Japan and South Korea, whether ASEAN+3 will take  off

and become a platform for action in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next question is: has political uncertainty impaired

the  ASEAN Regional Forum, the only multilateral platform  in

Asia-Pacific, to address security issues?  Has the  ARF  been

able   to   move  beyond  confidence-building  to  preventive

diplomacy in its role?  Is there still a role for the ARF  to

address  the  security  issues and the problems  of  regional

hotspots in the Asia-Pacific region?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, many of the ASEAN

members  are still recovering from the 1997 economic  crisis.

There  is  still  great  disparity in  social,  economic  and

political developments in the various ASEAN countries.  There

is  even  a  perception amongst observers  that  ASEAN  lacks

dynamism  and  unity of purpose because of members'  internal

problems  and  priorities.  In addition, it has become  clear

that  Northeast  Asia has become the new centre  for  foreign

direct  investments. With China's entry into the World  Trade

Organisation,  we  can see a bigger pool of investments  from

Southeast Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for an update on

the  state of affairs within ASEAN.  In particular,  I  would

like  to  ask  the  Minister on how ASEAN is coordinating  to

attract foreign direct investments to the region.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask the Minister on the

prospects  for the ASEAN+3 process developing into some  kind

of  an East Asia summit.  In particular, I would like to  ask

the Minister whether ASEAN would lose its identity in such an

East  Asian summit where it can be overwhelmed by the  larger

East Asian countries.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, in the late 1990s, we found an

ASEAN  vastly different in spirit from the ASEAN of the early

1990s.   In  the early 1990s, ASEAN was held up as  the  next

best example of regional cooperation, next to the EU.  It was

confident,  bold,  innovative  and  taking  active  steps  to

strengthen  its  regional cooperation and cohesiveness.   One

such  example  was the formation of the ASEAN Regional  Forum

(ARF)  in  1994,  which sought to be the forum  for  regional

security  cooperation and activity.  The early  1990s  saw  a

period  of  high  growth rates for all ASEAN  countries,  and

there was a feeling of euphoria, and ASEAN was respected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic crisis of 1997/1998 and its lingering

effects on many individual

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>

ASEAN  countries  would appear to have dented  the  unity  of

ASEAN  states,  as  political and  economic  instability  has

forced  each  member state to become more involved  in  their

internal  affairs,  at  the expense of regional  cooperation.

Instead  of  coming together, the economic crisis  seemed  to

have  pushed  ASEAN states apart, and they  are  focusing  on

their own internal problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could the Minister give us his views on the state

of cohesiveness and unity currently within ASEAN?  This is  a

critical time for ASEAN with the inclusion of four new member

states  in  the last five years, especially since  these  new

member  states  are also economically under  developed.   How

have  the  older  ASEAN states been able to  help  these  new

members to integrate?  Can the Minister comment on how  ASEAN

can  prevent  a  two-tier split into  the  economically  more

developed regional members of ASEAN on the one hand, and  the

economically less developed new members on the other?

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, I thank Dr Ong Chit Chung, Chairman of the GPC, Mr

Ravindran and Mr Hawazi for their comments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first touch on Dr Ong Chit Chung's points about

the overview of the strategic situation in our region. He  is

right when he says that there have been very dramatic changes

in  the  regional landscape.  The South East Asian region  is

going through very troubled and uncertain times.  North Asia,

as some Members pointed out, is proving to be more attractive

to  investors.  There is a new administration in  the  United

States.   There  are old flashpoints such as  the  unresolved

disputes  in South China Sea and the cross strait  relations,

which  have  not disappeared.  And we have also  seen  inter-ethnic tensions in various places in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was listening to the debate in the past few days on

MTI  as  well as the Ministry of Defence, there were  certain

recurring  themes by both the Members and the  Ministers  who

replied.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>

recurring  theme was precisely about the uncertain  strategic

situation we find ourselves in.  And now again, in MFA,  this

point  is raised.  What does it show?  I think it shows  that

the  regional  backdrop is relevant, not just one  aspect  of

Singapore's development, it affects many facets of  Singapore

-  economic, security and defence, as well as foreign policy.

We   are   affected   by   the   external   environment   and

circumstances, many of which are beyond our control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung asked me to forecast the political

weather.   How  I wish we had a crystal ball!  There  are  so

many  developments in countries around us,  the  outcomes  of

which are uncertain, but the outcomes of which will certainly

affect  us, to a lesser or greater degree.  All I can say  is

that we have to be alert to the external developments and  in

various  facets  of our policies, we have  to  be  agile  and

nimble in making adjustments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members rightly pointed out that the region in South

East Asia is going through a very difficult period.  Even  as

we  speak  now, today, ASEAN's largest member, Indonesia,  is

grappling  with  serious  domestic,  political  and  economic

problems.  With recent changes in government, the Philippines

and  Thailand have also seen the emergence of new leaders  as

well  as  Foreign  Ministers.  With all these  uncertainties,

political   and  economic  problems  taking  place,   foreign

investor confidence has yet to return to the region.   But  I

would say, in reply to those who spoke about ASEAN, Singapore

is  committed  to  ASEAN, and we will  work  with  others  to

overcome the present difficulties, to keep ASEAN on track  in

important  projects,  such as AFTA.  At the  fourth  informal

summit  in  Singapore,  there was an  agreement  amongst  the

leaders,  but also amongst the ASEAN+3, to cooperate  towards

integration of ASEAN.  I will come to this in a moment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within our limited resources, Singapore tries to play

the  role of a catalyst in ASEAN's recovery, and we  do  this

through  various projects, such as the initiative  for  ASEAN

integration, the e-ASEAN initiative

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>

to help all of ASEAN engage in the new economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearer home to Singapore, we are witnessing political

changes  in  both  our neighbouring countries.   As  I  said,

Indonesia  is undergoing a difficult political transition  in

the  face of economic, social, religious and ethnic problems.

Such  pressures have caused Indonesian leaders  sometimes  to

lash out against us from time to time.  But Members will note

that  we  have  not reacted emotionally.   We  have  put  out

measured factual statements setting out our position  on  the

facts.   We  have to take a long-term view of  our  relations

with Indonesia, and we will continue to approach relations in

a calm and measured manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Malaysia, we are also witnessing political changes,

and  as  Malaysia deals with its domestic challenges, Members

would  have  also noted the series of ups and  downs  in  our

relations with them in the past year.  Notwithstanding  these

events,  the leaders of both sides have maintained close  and

frequent  contacts  and have been able  to  put  such  issues

behind  us quickly in favour of moving ahead in our bilateral

relations.    With  both  Indonesia  and  Malaysia,   despite

occasional  differences, which are unavoidable  because  they

are  close  neighbours, let me say that we will  continue  to

build  on  our relations on the basis of sovereign  equality,

and  we  will  cooperate  wherever  possible  towards  mutual

benefit.   I  have noted what Dr Ong Chit Chung  said  and  I

agree  with  him that it must be on the basis of prosper-thy-neighbour.  And indeed we believe that such contribution  can

contribute  towards  lifting  our  region  from  its  current

uncertainties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung pointed out that North East Asia is

showing  good  signs of economic growth and healthy  recovery

from  the  economic  crisis.   The  tensions  in  the  Korean

Peninsula   have   been  easing  in  the  past   year.    Not

surprisingly, therefore, foreign investors are more attracted

to  North  East  Asia  than South  East  Asia,  and  this  is

precisely  what I have flagged to my colleagues in the  ASEAN

Foreign Ministers' meeting, that we have to take

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>

note  and we have to get our act together in ASEAN.   China's

impending entry into the WTO will also present challenges and

opportunities for countries in this region.  Let me add  also

that  India  is also rising as an economic force  with  their

centres of excellence in the field of information technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung mentioned the United States

administration.  Their key foreign policy directions have yet

to  be revealed, but it appears that they will remain engaged

and committed in Asia.  US policy in Asia, I completely agree

with  Dr  Ong Chit Chung, will affect the existing triangular

relationship  between the US, China and Japan, a relationship

which  underpins the strategic situation in the Asia-Pacific.

So we have to monitor this closely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these then are some of the matters in the radar

screen,   so   to   speak.   With  all  these   changes   and

uncertainties taking place in this region, what can we do  in

these uncertain times?  I think there is no point in wringing

our  hands  and lamenting on the problems in the region.   So

during  this interregnum in ASEAN, I believe we  have  to  be

forward  looking  and to work with like-minded  countries  in

ASEAN  as well as some of our dialogue partners to keep ASEAN

on  track, and we have to prepare for the day when the region

recovers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have to take a twin track approach, what Dr

Ong Chit Chung referred to as a balancing approach.  In other

words,  while  we take a long-term view of our commitment  to

ASEAN,  we also have to press ahead in reaching out to  other

key  countries  and economies in the world.   Being  a  small

country  in  an  increasingly globalised world,  we  have  no

choice  but  to engage global markets to make the  world  our

hinterland.  This is not new and has been our approach for  a

long  time.  I would say, together, these two facets make  up

the  twin track approach in our foreign policy.  ASEAN is  of

primary importance, but of equal significance is our need  to

reach out and engage

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>

with the rest of the world.  Let me say that Singapore's  FTA

negotiations with Australia, Japan, Mexico, New  Zealand  and

the  United States can be said to come under this other  part

of our twin track approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung made an interesting point when he said

that it is important for our people to be knowledgeable about

what  is  happening in the region.  I completely  agree  with

him.   Why  do  I  agree with him?  Because of  the  external

situation we find ourselves in, and it will definitely affect

Singapore.  I  think Singaporeans, as a community,  ought  to

take  an  interest  in what is happening beyond  our  shores,

especially in our immediate region.   And if Singaporeans  at

large  are well acquainted with the issues in our region  and

have a realistic view of developments, I believe they will be

better  equipped  to  deal with any  developments  that  take

place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me turn to the various comments made about

ASEAN.   I would start, first, by recounting why is  it  that

many  commentators and writers dubbed ASEAN, some years  ago,

as  one  of  the  most successful regional groupings  in  the

world.   I  think there were two reasons.  First  members  of

ASEAN were doing well economically.  Some were dubbed as  the

"tigers" or rising economies in Asia.  Secondly, most of  the

countries  were experiencing periods of political  stability.

With the regional crisis, things have changed.  Countries are

experiencing  both  political and economic uncertainties  and

instability.   So  if  you ask me now, I  think  it  will  be

misleading to paint any rosy picture for ASEAN.  In fact,  at

last year's ASEAN Foreign Ministerial Meeting, Singapore made

a  speech  which  was described aptly as a wake-up  call  for

ASEAN.  But, at the same time, I would caution against taking

an unduly pessimistic view of ASEAN.  We have to view matters

in  historical  perspective.  And when we look  back  at  the

initial  years  after  ASEAN was  founded,  there  were  many

pundits who predicted that ASEAN would not last more  than  a

few  years.   They described ASEAN as being  a  group  of  so

disparate countries, so divergent, that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>

we were the "Balkans of Asia".  But we have lasted, developed

and evolved into the organisation that we are now.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN continues to remain a resilient organisation. It

has  nurtured certain habits of cooperation.  There are  some

good institutions in ASEAN beyond the meetings of the Foreign

Ministers.   There are the meetings of the Finance,  Economic

and  Environment Ministers.  Through this network of meetings

between  Ministers  and officials, there has  been  over  the

years   a  certain  camaraderie,  understanding  and  working

relationship  between ASEAN leaders and officials.   I  think

the  ASEAN  meetings are also important for this interaction.

We  agreed  last  year that we should cut  down  as  much  as

possible  the  pomp, the ceremonial part of ASEAN,  and  move

into  a  more business-like functional mode.   Therefore,  we

have held retreats, sometimes without officials.  And we have

also  agreed  that  in between the annual Foreign  Ministers'

meeting, there will be a meeting of Ministers in Retreat, and

this will be held sometime soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will repeat that Singapore will work with others in

ASEAN during this interregnum.  During this interregnum, what

is  essential  is to keep the organisation together.   It  is

important  because  there  are many  new  leaders,  many  new

Foreign Ministers, who have emerged in ASEAN, and we have  to

stay on track on important initiatives like AFTA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members asked about the recent informal summit which we

hosted  in  Singapore.  I think that it  was  a  very  useful

meeting, coming as it did, during this uncertain period.  The

leaders  set  clear  directions by making  ASEAN  integration

their  priority.  Another point that was emphasised just  now

was on how do we avoid a two-tier ASEAN.  Working closely  to

integrate  our  10  markets  and  making  our  economy   more

competitive  will certainly help reduce the gap within  ASEAN

and  make ourselves more cohesive.  There was agreement  that

those who are better off should help the less

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>

developed in ASEAN.  As far as Singapore is concerned, we are

fully  committed  to working with ASEAN to  assist  the  CLMV

countries (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the leaders agreed on an important

project  called  the "Initiative for ASEAN Integration".   To

catalyse  this initiative, Singapore proposed  a  package  of

proposals  on human resource development, education  and  IT.

The  leaders  also signed the e-ASEAN framework agreement  as

ASEAN's  clear response to the global information revolution.

Prime  Minister Goh argued that e-ASEAN would transform ASEAN

into  one  seamless  and  borderless market,  instead  of  10

fragmented markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not go too great into the details of the

Initiative  for ASEAN Integration.  But let me say  that  the

package of proposals announced by the Prime Minister  at  the

informal  summit is made up of two parts: skills  development

and  educational development, which will stretch over a five-year  period involving $59.5 million.  It involves,  firstly,

skills  development training institutes being established  in

Cambodia,  Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam.  Secondly, a  five-year

package   of  IT  "Train-the-Trainers"  courses   for   these

countries.   Thirdly,  an  Education  "Train-the-   Trainers"

Programme,  focusing  on  teacher  and  trainer  development.

Fourthly, doubling the number of Singapore scholarships under

the  Singapore  Cooperation  Programme  from  30  to  60  per

academic  year.   Finally,  they are  also  planning  student

exchange  programmes  at  both  secondary  school  and  youth

levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of ASEAN touched on by Members is ARF. I

would  say  that the ARF remains a very important  forum  for

discussing  security-related issues in  South-east  Asia  and

ASEAN.   This is driven by ASEAN because every ARF is chaired

by  ASEAN.   What  are  the prospects for ARF's  development?

From  Singapore's point of view, we want to nudge  ASEAN  and

other  countries  to  move the ARF faster towards  preventive

diplomacy.  In other words, move from the stage of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>

confidence-building measures to preventive diplomacy.  But we

also have to be cognisant of the fact that we must do so at a

pace  comfortable to other members of the ARF.   So  we  will

with  others  see how we can get a consensus to advance  from

confidence-building measures to preventive diplomacy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung asked about ASEAN-European Union

meeting.   As  you  know, this meeting was stalled  for  some

time.   It  was  to be held in Europe.  There was  a  problem

because  the Europeans, due to the common policy on  Myanmar,

declined  to give a visa to the Foreign Minister of  Myanmar.

ASEAN,  of  course, would not allow itself to be divided  and

turned  up  there without Myanmar.  So there was an  impasse.

There were discussions which led to this formula, leading  to

the  ASEAN  and  EU Foreign Ministers' Meeting in  Vientiane.

The  meeting  proceeded with all the ASEAN Foreign  Ministers

being  there, including Myanmar.  Our approach to the EU  was

that  if  they  had a problem with Myanmar,  if  they  had  a

foreign  policy about Myanmar, by all means, engage  Myanmar,

but  do  not  let that derail or jeopardise the long-standing

ASEAN-EU   relationship.   I  believe  this  call  struck   a

resonance with many members, as a result of which, after  the

ASEAN-EU meeting in Vientiane, they have agreed that the next

meeting will be held in Europe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ASEAN+3 process, it has been going on for some

time.   In  other  words,  it is held back-to-back  with  the

Summit, where ASEAN leaders meet with Japan, China and Korea,

separately  as  well as collectively.  Members asked  whether

this  would  lead,  in future, to closer cooperation  between

ASEAN and the plus-three countries.  I would say, yes, it  is

already  happening, and these meetings that we have  annually

symbolise  the close cooperation between ASEAN and the  plus-three  countries.  With each country (Japan, China or Korea),

sitting  down  with  ASEAN,  we  review  many  projects   for

collaboration and cooperation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of an East Asian Summit, of course, merits

consideration in the longer term.  In principle, I  think  it

is a good idea, but our preference is for a gradual approach.

Because,  as  Mr  Ravindran mentioned, there are  some  ASEAN

countries  who  are  concerned about the  plus-three  process

becoming  an  East  Asian Summit too  quickly.   We  need  to

address this and build up comfort level in the process,  both

within  ASEAN and among the plus-three countries.  It is  not

just  a  question  as  to  whether it will  diminish  ASEAN's

relevance  and  role  in East Asia.  But for  the  plus-three

process and the summit to take place, ASEAN, first, will have

to establish itself again and get its act together.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore and Malaysia are

close  neighbours.  Some say too close for comfort.   But  we

cannot  escape the proximity imposed by geography  nor  alter

our  historical  past.   Willy-nilly,  we  have  to  live  as

neighbours, as best as we can be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore-Malaysia relations have been characterised as

two  neighbours living in semi-detached houses, but separated

by  a  common  wall, as the Malaysian Deputy  Prime  Minister

Datuk Seri Abdullah Badawi puts it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or as Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong amplifies, it is like

living   in  two  semi-detached  houses  located   within   a

condominium estate and sharing common facilities, with common

responsibility  as well.  In such a setting,  the  neighbours

get together to socialise and build up friendship and get  to

understand and appreciate each other better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, relationship between Singapore and Malaysia

has  its ups and downs.   The bottomline is that it is in the

interest  of  both countries to work together to resolve  any

difficulty  and build up our common ground and understanding.

All  can  be winners together.  It can be a win-win situation

for both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent visit to Singapore, the Malaysian Deputy

Prime Minister, Datuk

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>

Seri  Abdullah  Badawi said, "Singapore and  Malaysia  should

improve  our trade relations, to prosper together and  ensure

peace  in the region."  In this context, we learn with  great

interest  that  Singapore  and Malaysia  are  continuing  the

negotiation on the package of outstanding issues between  the

two  countries, and Singapore has agreed to extend  the  10th

February  2001  deadline for the relocation  of  the  Malayan

Railway station in Tanjong Pagar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent interview with the press, Prime Minister Goh

Chok  Tong said that "we have given our proposal to  Malaysia

and we have informal feedback that they are responding to the

proposal."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore wish to ask the Minister on the progress and

outcome  of  such negotiations, and when does he  expect  the

negotiations to be concluded.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, the recent visit by the Deputy Prime

Minister  of  Malaysia to Singapore has created  a  sense  of

optimism  that  the bilateral relationship  between  our  two

countries  has turned around for the better.  At the  end  of

the  visit, the Malaysian DPM also indicated that outstanding

bilateral  issues  could  be  resolved  with  some   urgency.

However, no deadline has been disclosed for the resolution of

the outstanding bilateral issues by both sides.  I would like

to  ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to give an update on

the  state  of  bilateral relations with  Malaysia  and  also

whether any deadline has been set for the resolution of these

outstanding issues.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, the points that I

wanted   to  raise  on  the  bilateral  agreement  with   the

Malaysians  have already been addressed by Dr Ong Chit  Chung

and  Mr Ravindran.  I would just like to ask the Minister  to

provide  the  House  with an update on the  recent  Malaysian

government's  proposal  to construct an  underground  railway

tunnel  under the Johor Straits from Johor Baru to Singapore,

and on to the Kranji MRT station.  Could the Minister give us

an  update  on  the  Government's response to  the  Malaysian

proposal?

<br>2.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The relationship between Singapore

and Malaysia has its ups and downs.  With the recent visit of

the  Malaysia's  Deputy Prime Minister, Datuk  Seri  Abdullah

Badawi,  to  Singapore,  the  relationship  between  the  two

countries has taken a notch up.  I am certain that with  more

visits  of  officials  of  one  country  to  the  other,  the

relationship  between Singapore and Malaysia  can  be  better

improved.   So far, we can see that the visits are only  made

by  the very top officials of one country to the other.   The

Senior Minister visited Malaysia last year and this year, the

Malaysian  Deputy Prime Minister reciprocated  the  visit  to

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are seven MPs who are speaking on this

amendment  on  Singapore  and Malaysia  relations  and  I  am

certain that all the points that I shall be speaking on  this

amendment shall be covered by the other speakers.  So I shall

only use this opportunity to make one proposal to advance the

cause  of  Singapore-Malaysia relations.   I  would  like  to

propose   that   our   Government  approach   the   Malaysian

counterparts  to arrange on a regular basis,  say,  annually,

friendly  visits and friendly games between the officials  of

the Government institutions, departments and statutory boards

and Members of Parliament of the two countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposal is nothing new. Amongst the lawyers,

lawyers  and  judges of our two countries  have  already  had

regular annual friendly games for many years.  Our Members of

Parliament  had, in fact, several years ago, as  I  remember,

friendly games meet with Members of the Malaysian Parliament.

I do not know why that friendly games meet was not continued.

I hope that it shall be revived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also heard just now that the ASEAN Ministers

often  hold  retreats.  I think the more meetings would  only

augur for the better.  If too many meets are not practical, I

would  certainly  suggest  that the  meeting  of  Members  of

Parliament between the two countries be revived.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, the subject of our

relations  with  Malaysia is often discussed and  debated  in

this  Parliament.   In the short time as  a  Member  of  this

House,  I have witnessed the many high points and low  points

in  our relations with Malaysia.  Whatever it is, I recognise

that the destinies of the two countries are intertwined.   We

have  close physical proximity with each other and we have  a

common  cultural  heritage.  The reality is  that  we  cannot

choose to walk away but to learn to live with one another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that our relationship with Malaysia in recent

months has once again been on the upswing.  This is evidenced

by  the exchanges of visits by Ministers on both sides of the

Causeway.  Like my colleagues before me, Sir, I would like to

ask  the  Minister  to give us an update on the  relationship

with  Malaysia, and if we are in any way closer to  resolving

the outstanding bilateral issues between us.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Since my colleagues have already asked

many of the issues that I want to raise, I would just like to

focus  on  the importance of good relations between Singapore

and Malaysia and how we should not allow the bilateral issues

to  affect our common good and common interest.  When  Deputy

Prime  Minister,  Abdullah  Badawi,  came  to  Singapore  and

requested that the deadline of the relocation of the  CIQ  as

well  as  the  POA on redevelopment of land used  by  KTM  be

extended, we agreed.  But I did not recall that we have set a

new  deadline  for the resolution of the issues.   I  do  not

think we can negotiate all these issues forever.  Is there  a

timeframe that we are working on?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

there  are  two  dimensions of Singapore-Malaysia  relations.

One  is  at the official level between governments  which,  I

think,  is very close and strong.  But I would like to  touch

on  the  other  dimension which is a personal  level  between

people to people which, I think, is somewhat more complex and

problematic.  And this is because of the perception gap  that

exists between what we think Malaysians think of us which can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>

be very vastly different from what Malaysians really think of

us.   This  applies to some other countries in the region  as

well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is precisely because of that, relations with Malaysia

can  be quite unpredictable because, more often than not,  it

depends  on  the domestic political climate and  environment.

Therefore,  the  forging  of people  to  people  relationship

between  the  two  countries must  be  adopted  as  the  most

sustainable  strategy for us.  Here,  we  have  a  number  of

problems.  One is how do we progress in our relationship, one

from a state where we share many common things together,  our

historical  heritage, our culture, our way of  life,  to  one

where  increasingly these common factors will diminish as  we

become very different people and evolve our own way of  life,

sometimes conflicting but in competition with our neighbours.

Then can our relations with Malaysia, and maybe the region in

general,   be   strengthened   precisely   because   of   our

differences?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the erosion of these common factors indicate, like

many   have   interpreted,   as  a   deterioration   of   our

relationship?  Many would like to view Singaporeans as  being

more  Western  and  Asian, being legalistic,  not  warm,  too

sensitive  and  too  serious.   But  the  answer   is   that,

precisely,  we have no other choice because we  are  what  we

are.   But  we have to do more so that Singapore, our  values

and   our  way  of  life  become  better  understood  by  our

neighbours.   And  this should be done at  all  levels.   For

example,  we need to enhance efforts through the Ministry  of

Foreign Affairs, and through its diplomatic missions, who can

play  a  key role to really reflect our way of life  and  our

values.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, we also need to do more to learn and understand

about  our  neighbours, learn about their culture, appreciate

their way of life, their customs and tradition.  More of  our

people should learn and speak the language of our neighbours.

For example, some simple suggestions.  We can issue guides to

our citizens about simple dos and don'ts when they travel  to

the  region  which  could create a lot of goodwill  and  good

image for our people

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>

as  they  travel  abroad  because people  do  complain  about

Singaporeans when we travel abroad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I want to give a simple experience I had. It did

not  happen in Malaysia, but, recently, in Chiang Mai.  I was

there.   I  was at a night market and I observed a  Singapore

family  trying  to bargain with the handicraft stall  vendor.

And  unaware  to the Singaporean, he was making  bad  remarks

about  the  poor quality of the product that he  intended  to

buy.  He was about to walk away from the stall thinking that,

by  doing  so, he would get a much better discount,  but  all

this while, not realising the vendor was extremely displeased

with  his  behaviour.   I do not think that  the  Singaporean

couple  really understood what it meant.  And I  wonder  what

the  vendor  thinks of Singaporeans because these scenes  are

played day in, day out at Chiang Mai night market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my wish really is that the Foreign Ministry should

make  the  forging  of good relations, understanding  of  our

neighbours,  the  personal responsibility  of  every  citizen

because we have an important role to project our way of  life

and values to the people in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head O (cont.) -

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I wish to thank the Members

who spoke on our relations with Malaysia.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall that at the last Committee of Supply debate one

year  ago, I then described our bilateral relations as  being

in  a "holding pattern".  Since then, Members would know that

there   have  been  several  developments  in  our  bilateral

relations with Malaysia.  I would say that, on the whole, the

atmospherics of bilateral relations have improved  since  the

Senior Minister's visit to Kuala Lumpur in August last  year.

Malaysian  Foreign Minister, Datuk Syed Hamid, had  described

the  visit  as  an  opportunity for strengthening  relations.

This  improved  atmosphere,  in  turn,  paved  the  way   for

increased    bilateral   contacts   between    leaders    and

parliamentarians on both sides.  Yes, there was a hiccup over

Malaysian  reactions to Prime Minister Goh's  speech  on  the

position  of Malays in Singapore, but it did not  change  the

overall tone of the improving relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent visit by Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister,

Datuk  Abdullah  Badawi, to Singapore in February,  at  Prime

Minister  Goh's  invitation,  also  helped  to  improve   the

relationship.    Deputy  Prime  Minister  Abdullah   Badawi's

delegation  comprised  several Cabinet  Ministers  and  Chief

Ministers.   In fact, he and his delegation met many  of  our

leaders,  including  the  Prime  Minister,  Senior  Minister,

Deputy  Prime  Minister  BG  Lee Hsien  Loong,  Deputy  Prime

Minister Dr Tony Tan, and several of our younger leaders  and

parliamentarians.  The visit succeeded in throwing up several

ideas  for  bilateral cooperation.  For example,  both  sides

agreed  on  the  need  to develop contact  points  that  will

involve  Malaysians and Singaporeans of various  groups,  eg,

youth  groups, student groups, parliamentarians, as  well  as

business  people, so as to bring Singaporeans and  Malaysians

together  on  an informal basis for greater interactions.   I

will  come  back to this later when responding to Mr  Chiam's

remarks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi and Prime Minister

Goh  also  discussed  the  package of  outstanding  bilateral

issues.   Members would have read that Malaysia had requested

to move its

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>

railway  station from Tanjong Pagar to Kranji.  We  have,  in

principle, agreed to the request, and the details would  have

to  be sorted out.  In connection with this, we have also, in

principle,  agreed to the construction of  a  tunnel  between

Johor and Kranji.  Both sides stressed the need to settle the

issues  in the package as soon as possible, so that we  could

put them behind us and move relations further forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this question of package, Dr Ong Chit Chung and

several  other MPs asked what is the progress and  whether  I

saw any prospect of any agreement being reached.  Dr Ong Chit

Chung  recalled  that  the Prime Minister  said  in  a  press

interview that Singapore had given our proposals to  Malaysia

and he had informal feedback that Malaysia was responding  to

the  proposals.   I  wish to say, Sir, that  we  have  indeed

received  a  reply  from Dr Mahathir to the Senior  Minister.

This  reply, dated 21st February, was received by my Ministry

on  7th  March.  As we received it only a week  ago,  we  are

still  studying it.  Our preliminary study shows  that  there

are variations on some points between Dr Mahathir's reply and

Senior  Minister's understanding with Dr Mahathir during  his

visit to Kuala Lumpur on 15th August last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first blush, the differences do not appear that

great.   However,  on  water, we have to study  the  proposed

price  at which we purchase water from Malaysia under  a  new

agreement  that  will cover the period 2011  and  2061,  and,

next,  for the period after 2061, when the Johor River  Water

Agreement ends.  Another matter is the mix of treated and raw

water,  although the volume or quantum will remain the  same,

as at present.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are matters that need to be resolved and put into

a  form  of  words in an agreement before we can finally  put

outstanding matters behind us.  Sir, I would say  that  after

all  these  years  since  1997, there  is  now  some  forward

movement  on  the  bilateral package that  can  hopefully  be

finalised in the coming

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>

months through the same give-and-take on both sides that have

got us closer to a settlement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me stress that apart from the

supply of water, there are also other outstanding items  that

need   to  be  settled  at  the  same  time,  such   as   the

reinstatement of airspace arrangements for RSAF flights,  the

location  of Malaysian CIQ, the development of MRA lands  and

CPF  monies  of  Malaysians.  These have to be  agreed  as  a

package.   Both sides should, therefore, strive  to  conclude

the deal as soon as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran asked whether any deadline has been set

with  regard to the POA.  I think it is worthwhile recalling,

Sir,  that  under the 1990 POA, both governments agreed  that

the  KTMB  railway station would be vacated  and  moved  from

Tanjong Pagar to Bukit Timah in the first instance, and  then

to  Woodlands within five years when the MRT station  reaches

Woodlands New Town, which it did on 10th February  1996.   In

June  1997,  the Prime Minister informed this  House  of  his

proposal for a framework of cooperation between Singapore and

Malaysia  to  get  around the impasse over  the  POA.   Prime

Minister  Goh said he was prepared to vary the terms  of  the

POA  within a framework of wider cooperation between the  two

countries,   in  other  words,  on-going  bilateral   package

negotiations.   So,  in  answer  to  Mr  Ravindran,  this  is

precisely what is happening.  We are discussing the water and

other issues in connection with the POA.  When the Malaysians

move  to  Kranji, of course it will be a variation, but  this

must  be  done  in  the context of the  other  issues  to  be

resolved.  In other words, it is a total package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Prime Minister informed Deputy Prime Minister

Abdullah Badawi that Singapore agrees to the request to  move

the  station  to Kranji.  He was prepared to extend  the  POA

deadline so as to allow more time to sort out details.   But,

of  course,  there has to be a finality to the process.   And

since  the  Malaysians  said they need  more  time,  we  have

agreed.  Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>

himself said, and I quote, "Both sides will work on an urgent

basis  and  will  try  as  hard as possible  to  come  to  an

agreement."   And  I  have  just  referred  to   the   latest

development, Dr Mahathir's letter to Senior Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi, in that regard, asked whether we have not

given a new deadline, it cannot go on forever, and so on.   I

would  respond by saying that both sides are keen to  resolve

the  package of bilateral issues as soon as possible so  that

we  can  put  these issues behind us.  Although there  is  no

specific  timeframe which we have set, I wish to assure  this

House  that there is a sense of urgency on both sides.   Both

sides want to resolve these issues as soon as possible.  This

is  a  step  forward.  I would say, therefore,  let  us  take

things  one step at a time, and Members, I am sure, know  the

Singapore  Government's firm position on the legal nature  of

the  obligations under the POA.  We have made that  clear  in

this House as well as to the Malaysians.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong asked about the underground tunnel

proposal.   As  I mentioned just now, we have, in  principle,

agreed  to  the idea of the tunnel proposal.  But, naturally,

there  are many technical details to be ironed out, which  we

are  awaiting and, therefore, I am not able to  go  into  the

details at this stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On bilateral relations generally, Mr Zulkifli and Mr

Chiam  made  certain suggestions.  Mr Zulkifli  gave  certain

proposals  and  ideas,  which I take  as  increasing  greater

understanding  between the peoples of neighbouring  countries

as well as other countries in the region.  Some of his ideas,

I  am sure, can be taken up by the various agencies, such  as

his  idea  of  do's  and  don'ts.  We  can  ask  the  Tourist

Promotion  Board to look into it.  I would say  offhand  that

his  ideas  are well intentioned and we will have a  look  at

them.   But  the  main point I want to make is  that  Members

ought  not  view  the development of good  relations  between

Singapore and other countries as the sole preserve or duty of

the  Ministry  of  Foreign Affairs or  any  other  particular

Ministry, or of the Government.  I have always held

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>

the  view  that the betterment of relations and the promotion

of  goodwill  between  Singapore and other  countries  partly

depends  on government-to-government interactions,  but  very

much   also   depends  on  people-to-people   relations   and

interactions, and it is in that context that  I  move  on  to

what Mr Chiam said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam has made some equally well-intentioned

suggestions.   I welcome his suggestions.  Like Mr  Zulkifli,

he   has   emphasised  people-to-people  contacts.    It   is

consistent with what I have said.  I also agree with him that

if  there  are  to be visits between Malaysia, Singapore  and

other  countries, it should not be just confined to  the  top

leaders.  He is absolutely right.  But let me assure him that

with  regard  to Malaysia, for instance, these contacts  have

actually been beyond Government.  For example, apart from the

Bench  and Bar Games, I know that the universities  have  had

regular  contacts.  In fact, at the last Games  in  Malaysia,

the   university  contingent,  I  believe,  was  led  by  our

President  in  his  capacity as Chancellor  of  the  National

University   of  Singapore.   There  are  also   many   other

interactions between our professional and uniformed services,

eg, the Police, the Armed Forces, and the Foreign Ministry to

Foreign Ministry Games.  I believe MINDEF has games with  its

counterparts.  The civil services also have their games.  So,

I agree with him.  This is going on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, we should explore various other ways of

enhancing  these contacts.  And this is precisely what  Prime

Minister Goh and Deputy Prime Minister Badawi discussed  when

they emphasised the idea of developing points of contact.  So

we  would  certainly want to go in that  direction.   I  also

agree  with  him that we should promote further  interactions

between our Members of Parliament and their backbenchers, and

I  heard  recently  that there were to  be  some  golf  games

between our backbenchers and their MPs, and we would strongly

encourage that.  I know we have a backbenchers' club and  the

Singapore Parliamentary Society. Whether through this vehicle

or  even  informally outside this channel, I would  encourage

Members to meet.  So whether

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>

it is between the civil services, professional organisations,

non-governmental   organisations,   the   totality   of    it

supplements  the  formal  government-to-government  bilateral

contacts.   In  fact,  the informal contacts  and  people-to-people   relationship  sometimes  may  be  equally  important

because  they are not saddled with bureaucracy and  forms  of

protocol,  they  can  speak more frankly  and  more  informal

contacts.  I would therefore welcome the suggestions  in  the

spirit in which it was given, not only for Malaysia, but also

other countries in the region.

<br>3.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the

Minister for his reply on Malaysia-Singapore relations and am

glad that progress is being made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we move on to Indonesia. Indonesia is our big

neighbour  to the south.  Standard and Poor's, the  financial

agency, citing political unrest, has cut the long-term rating

for  Indonesia  to negative.  This downgrading  reflects  the

increasingly uncertain socio-political situation in Indonesia

and has negative implications on the economic performance  of

the country.  The rupiah has also fallen to 10,000 to the  US

dollar, hitting a 29-month low.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are separatist movements in Aceh and Irian Jaya,

and  in  Kalimantan,  the Dayaks have massacred  hundreds  of

Madurese.  Law and order is breaking down in some parts,  and

there could be problems of refugees fleeing and seeking  safe

havens elsewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such developments in Indonesia, Singapore has to be

watchful  and  has  to keep track of all  these  events.  The

golden  days of Singapore-Indonesia relations, in retrospect,

were  when President Suharto was in power in Indonesia.  Then

we had President Habibie, who called us the "little red dot".

We   thought  we  would  fare  much  better  with   President

Abdurrahman  Wahid, but it was not to be.   There  were  also

twists and turns.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite this, are there new areas in which the two

countries  can  cooperate to our mutual benefit?   Are  there

potential  problems we are likely to encounter in the  coming

years?   We  wish  Indonesia every success  in  its  economic

restructuring, and hope that Singapore and Indonesia can work

closely together to our mutual benefit.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, Indonesia continues to be compounded

by  a myriad of economic, social and political problems.  The

implementation  of  regional autonomy  had  meant  that  many

decisions would be made locally at the regional level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in Indonesia is precarious and volatile.

I  would like to ask the Minister, in the light of all  these

circumstances:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) What is the state of our relations with Indonesia;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) What is the usage of all the financial assistance

packages that we have so far offered to Indonesia; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) What is the impact of regional autonomy within

Indonesia  and  how Singapore intends to position  itself  to

deal with many of the regional governments near us, like Riau

province, South Sumatra province and Jambi province?

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, our relations with Indonesia have

gone through several phases from the time of our independence

up  to  now.  On the whole, our past relations with Indonesia

were  close, warm and friendly.  In marked contrast, we  have

seen,  in  the last three years, two Presidents of  Indonesia

personally  attacking Singapore and questioning our  attitude

and perceived unhelpfulness towards Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although relations seem to have been smoothened out with

the  recent launching of the multi-million dollar gas project

between  the  two countries, not surprisingly,  the  November

episode has left a bad taste.  On the whole, I would say that

I  agree  with the Minister and support the position  of  the

Minister in stressing that we should take a long-term view in

our relations with Indonesia.  Can the Minister update us  on

the current state of relations

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>

with  Indonesia  and the developments there?   An  Indonesia,

that  is  strife-full, as it is now,  is  not  good  for  the

region, and not good for us.  An Indonesia that is broken  up

must be worse.      From interactions with the residents  and

fellow  Singaporeans, I get the sense that Singaporeans  want

to  know  about  the  prospect of  our  largest  neighbouring

country remaining united. What is the view of the Minister in

this matter?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, in my reference to the strategic

situation,  I  said  that Indonesia is still  grappling  with

serious political, economic and social challenges.  New power

centres have emerged in Indonesia's political landscape.  The

Indonesian  Parliament  (DPR) has assumed  a  more  assertive

check  and  balance  role  on the  government.   Furthermore,

problems  of  security and stability have not  abated.   Last

Christmas  eve,  there were bomb blasts in  major  cities  in

Indonesia.  Members must have read of all the reports of  the

serious problems of killings in Kalimantan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, these political and security developments, together

with the Indonesian government's differences with the IMF, do

affect  economic recovery and investor confidence.   Feedback

from investors is that they will continue to adopt a wait-and-see  attitude  until they are comfortable with the  political

and   security   situation  in  Indonesia.   The   Indonesian

government  has  to deal also with the evolving  relationship

between  Jakarta  and  the provinces.  One  challenge  is  to

manage  the  implementation of the  regional  autonomy  laws,

something  that Mr Ravindran alluded to.  This is  a  complex

exercise and would have implications on the shape and  future

of government structure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members asked about the state of our bilateral

relations.   I  think  Members know that our  relations  with

Indonesia have seen a rough patch recently.  They would  have

noted  the allegations that President Abdurrahman Wahid  made

against  Singapore  last November and, as  I  have  said,  we

reacted by putting up factual statements in a measured manner

to  point out the inaccuracies of these allegations.  We  set

their record straight.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On bilateral relations, our position is clear. We have

always valued our relations with Indonesia.  The fundamentals

of  that  relationship, built up over 30 years of  friendship

and  close cooperation, are strong.  However, there  will  be

ups  and  downs along the way.  We have to take  a  long-term

view  of  relations between Singapore and  Indonesia  and  we

should therefore be prepared to ride out any difficulties  as

they  come along in this bilateral relationship.  At the same

time,  we  must  keep  ourselves open  to  opportunities  for

cooperation  with Indonesia. Therefore, our  approach  is  to

work  for mutually beneficial ties in the long-term,  on  the

basis that we are sovereign equals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia is strategically important, not only to

Singapore,  but also to the region and ASEAN,  a  point  that

several Members have made this afternoon.  Naturally, we hope

that  the  situation in Indonesia will improve quickly.   But

please  remember  that  Singapore is a  small  country,  with

limited  resources.   On  our own, we cannot  help  Indonesia

overcome its economic problems. What we can do is to  play  a

catalytic   role.   Our  economic  assistance  to  Indonesia,

something that Mr Ravindran mentioned, has to be seen in this

framework.  We  hope  that it might encourage  other  foreign

investors to follow Singapore's lead and invest there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should mention the recently concluded Asamera gas

deal, worth US$8 billion over 22 years.  It is one example of

our  long-term commitment to cooperating with Indonesia.  The

fact  that  President Wahid came personally to  Singapore  to

witness  the  First  Gas ceremony - and that  was  after  his

outburst  -  is  a  recognition of such  mutually  beneficial

projects of cooperation.  Only last month, we signed  another

agreement  to  purchase gas from Sumatra worth  US$7  billion

over 20 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other developments include Senior Minister's recent

visit  to  Jakarta  to attend a meeting of President  Wahid's

International  Advisory Panel.  He did so on the  basis  that

Singapore-Indonesia relations must be kept  steady,  whatever

temporary upsets there may be.  Minister George Yeo

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>

also  visited South Sumatra and Riau provinces last month  to

explore economic opportunities there.  That again is relevant

to  what  Mr  Ravindran  talked  about  in  cooperating  with

provinces.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for what Mr Ravindran specifically asked for about

regional  autonomy,  let me say that  regional  autonomy  was

introduced in Indonesia by law only on 1st January 2001.  The

rules  and  laws governing regional autonomy  are  still  not

clear.  The central government and the provincial authorities

are  in  the process, I believe, of fine-tuning this process,

so as to ensure an effective and efficient system of regional

autonomy.  I think it will take some time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From our perspective, I would say that the conduct of

diplomatic  relations, as in the case of other countries,  is

with  the central government in Jakarta.  Any steps  that  we

take  to  establish links with the provinces will  be  within

this broader framework of bilateral relations with Indonesia.

Of  course,  with  regional  autonomy,  we  can  expect  more

Singapore  businessmen to explore business  opportunities  in

the   region   and  to  deal  directly  with  the  provincial

authorities.   Riau  will  be especially  attractive  to  our

businessmen  because of the region's proximity  to  Singapore

and  the  already extensive links which many of  our  private

sector has in that area.  In anticipation of the increase  in

Singapore's interests in the Riaus, we have recently  decided

to  open  a  Consulate and Trade Office  in  Pekanbaru.   Our

Consulate in Pekanbaru will also provide consular services to

a growing number of Singaporeans visiting the Riau provinces.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, despite an unfortunate blemish in

our  records that took place nearly 60 years ago,  Singapore-Japan  ties  have  always  been  characterised  by  warm  and

friendly  exchanges,  both  at the  level  of  the  political

leadership  and  on  a  people-to-people  basis.   The   good

relationship between the two countries is perhaps  helped  by

the  common elements that exist between them.  To begin with,

both countries lack

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>

natural   resources  and  are,  therefore,   almost   totally

dependent  on  trade  with  the outside  world  to  meet  its

requirements.  In this regard, freedom of navigation  through

the  Malacca  Straits is of vital strategic  importance,  not

only  for  us, but for Japan as well.  The two countries  are

also  caught  up  by  the  potentially  explosive  nature  of

politics  in  their  respective  regions.   In  the  case  of

Northeast  Asia,  Japan is concerned with  the  way  the  two

Koreas  settle their long-standing differences and is  hoping

that  war  would  not  be  the solution  of  choice  for  the

unification of the two countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, in Singapore, small as it may be for

us,  we  are an oasis in the region, troubled by the internal

strife  and  differences.  More importantly, Singapore  could

potentially be caught up with the struggle for control in the

Spratly  Islands.   In  Southeast Asia, Japan  has  important

reasons  for  staying engaged. First, Japanese investment  in

Southeast  Asia has been rather substantial.   In  Singapore,

the  Japanese  investment  alone for  year  1999  was  $1.179

billion, as opposed to $708.2 million in 1990. Secondly,  the

Malacca  Straits is of strategic importance to Japan,  as  it

provides a means by which trade between the East and West  is

facilitated.  I believe, Sir, that the bulk of  Japanese  oil

imports passes through the Straits of Malacca.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, in Japan's interest that Southeast

Asia remains stable in the long run. Singapore and Japan  can

be effective partners in promoting peace and stability in the

region.  The on-going discussions between Japan and Singapore

in  respect of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is something that

many  watchers are interested in.  At the core of the FTA  is

the  underlying  belief  that  free  trade  between  the  two

countries  would  serve their respective  economic  interest.

This can be a model for the other countries in ASEAN as well,

contrary to what others may think that the FTA with Japan  is

a back-door entry to AFTA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the Singapore-Japan FTA, if adopted by the other

countries in the region, may serve to provide a new

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>

platform  for economic growth and, in the long run, form  the

basis  of stability in the region.  I would, therefore,  like

to  ask  the  Minister to give us an update on  the  on-going

discussions  with Japan on the FTA and whether or  not  there

are obstacles, if any, that will affect negotiations, and  if

the FTA can be signed by the end of the year.

<br>3.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I rise to

speak on relations with Australia and New Zealand.  If I may,

I would like to place in the context of much of the foregoing

conversation.   Obviously, our focus  is  on  ASEAN  and  our

immediate  neighbours.   And  as  we  look  across  the  Asia

Pacific,  we look more at America and to North East  Asia  in

the ASEAN+3.  But I believe that relations with Australia and

New Zealand do require emphasis.  This is not to say that  we

have  bad  ties.  In fact, we have good ties with  these  two

countries.   But I would encourage the Ministry not  to  over

focus on our problems and forget our friends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a multi-Ministerial exchange with Australia, and

we  have  already  concluded a bilateral free trade agreement

with  New Zealand, and both these countries are part  of  the

Five  Power  Defence  Arrangements (FPDA).   They  are  ASEAN

dialogue  partners too.  But, lately, there  have  been  some

concerns.  There was an attempt for consideration to link the

ASEAN Free Trade Agreement to the Australia-New Zealand  CER.

However,  this  was  rebuffed  by  some  ASEAN  members,  not

Singapore,  but we were unable to change the  minds  of  some

others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that we on our part must do what we can to

strengthen and deepen our ties with these two countries.   My

first suggestion is that we should build on the foundation of

good inter-governmental ties, to include ties outside of  the

government,  such  as universities, think  tanks,  youth  and

sports.   We  should deepen the interaction between  our  two

societies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, beyond deepening, we should also widen the

circle.  Sir, Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>

sometimes takes a lead in inter-regional discussions, such as

the East Asia-Latin America Forum, which the Minister will go

to in March.  On this occasion, we will include Australia and

New  Zealand with the so-called East Asian lot.  And I  think

this  is  an important step to try and include them  with  as

many  people as possible.  Other things can be done too  when

we   work  to  integrate  the  new  ASEAN  members.   Perhaps

Singapore, working as a catalyst, can work with Australia and

New  Zealand to give assistance to some of these new members.

Or  as  DPM  Tony Tan said, in the debate on the Ministry  of

Defence,  that  if  we  want to contribute  to  peace-keeping

training, we should do so with Australia and New Zealand, and

other like-minded countries in ASEAN and in North East Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third suggestion relates to the ASEAN+3 process.

Clearly, Sir, this is an important process.  North East  Asia

are  important partners.  But I think creative efforts should

be  made to link this to Australia and New Zealand.  They  do

not have to become part of the ASEAN+3 process, but they have

to  be part of what I would call "variable geometry", the way

of  looking at the whole region into various sub-groups which

can overlap at times.  I think this is very important because

the  functionality  of  our economics and  security  and  our

interdependence is linked to Australia and New Zealand.   And

I  also  believe  that  the inclusion of  Australia  and  New

Zealand  in  some of these different groupings  would  better

recognise them as part of the region, and rescue and save  us

from any hint that ASEAN+3 is basically a form of racism,  in

that  we  are all non-white somehow.  And I think  that  this

idea  of variable geometry is an important one. The Minister,

in  his  earlier remarks, referred to the two track approach.

Perhaps we are talking about the same thing. In this, we look

at  ASEAN, ASEAN+3, APEC, more broadly, but then we come back

to a network of other relationships.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to close these three suggestions just on a

very  simple point, Sir.  This is that as we are pursuing  so

many different tracks or this variable geometry, I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>

must  wonder  whether  the Ministry of  Foreign  Affairs  has

sufficient resources.  This keeps people very busy.  From the

budget, I see that the Ministry is relatively small.   And  I

want the Minister to consider whether more resources will  be

needed.  I think many Singaporeans, at the ordinary level, do

not  fully  appreciate the importance of the  work  that  the

Ministry  of  Foreign Affairs does.  I think the  crisis  has

shown  us however that relations and security and good comity

between nations are important.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Dr Ow Chin Hock):</b> Sir, I agree with Mr Sin Boon Ann that Japan is a very

important country to the region.  Indeed, Japan has played  a

crucial  role in industrialising the region in the  past  30-plus  years.   It  is  a  major trading  partner  and   major

investor  in the region, bringing with it capital, technology

and   employment.   Although  it  is  faced   with   economic

difficulties in recent years, Japan is likely to  recover  in

the  longer  term.  Japan will continue to play a significant

role  in the development of regional cooperation, as  it  has

done in the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Japan announced a US$15 billion package to

help narrow the global digital divide, focusing on Asia.   At

the ASEAN+3 informal summit in Singapore, the "Mori e-Action"

was  launched  to  bridge the developmental gap  between  the

newer  and  older  ASEAN  members.   Singapore  is  currently

working closely with Japan to implement these projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our relations with Japan are excellent. Japan is

important to us, both economically and strategically.   Japan

has  been  Singapore's third largest trading partner  in  the

past  three  years.  Our trade volume increased  from  S$40.5

billion in 1998 to S$57.9 billion last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has put in much effort to engage Japan in the

region.   Bilaterally,  in  the  past  three  years,  several

bilateral  initiatives were launched  with  Japan  to  create

institutional   links  between  our  two  countries.    These

initiatives include the annual MFA-Gaimusho Dialogue;  the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>

Japan-Singapore  Partnership Programme 21 for  third  country

technical  cooperation; the Diplomat Exchange Programme;  the

Japan-Singapore  Symposium; the SIF's Raffles  Programme  for

visits  by  top  Japanese  bureaucrats;  the  Japan-Singapore

Business    Council;   the   Japan-Singapore    Parliamentary

Friendship  League;  and  the Japan-Singapore  Action  Agenda

Committee.   The wide range of linkages together with  trade,

investment  and  tourism  helps to  promote  people-to-people

contact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also work closely with Japan in regional and

international fora, such as the ARF, APEC and the UN.   As  a

major trading partner and investor in the region, Japan has a

large stake in the well-being of the region.  In the last few

years,  we  have seen the efforts Japan put in  to  help  the

region  recover from the Asian financial crisis.   Japan  was

the  main  contributor  to  rescue packages  to  the  region,

through the US$30 billion Miyazawa Plan.  Japan has consulted

closely with regional countries as events unfolded, so as  to

assess developments and coordinate policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the specific point of freedom of navigation in the

Straits  of Malacca, our position is clear on this particular

issue.   The  route  through  the  Straits  of  Malacca   and

Singapore is the shortest sea lane between East and West.  It

is also the most cost efficient and preferred sea lane.  Most

of  East Asia's oil imports from the Middle East pass through

these  Straits.  It is therefore in the interest of not  only

Singapore  and Japan but also the global community to  ensure

that  freedom of passage through the Straits of  Malacca  and

Singapore  is  preserved.  Singapore will  continue  to  work

closely  with Japan and other countries to ensure the freedom

of navigation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin referred to the free trade agreement negotiation

with  Japan.  A major boost in our relations was  when  Prime

Minister  Goh and Prime Minister Mori agreed last October  to

launch  the Japan-Singapore Economic Agreement for a New  Age

Partnership  (JSEPA)  in  January  2001,  and  conclude   the

Agreement no later than 31 December 2001.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>

There  have been two preparatory meetings and a formal  round

of negotiations so far.  Progress has been good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the JSEPA will help engage Japan and anchor its

interest  in  the region in the long run.  This will  benefit

Singapore  and ASEAN.  At the time when Europe  and  Americas

are  increasingly moving towards closer economic  integration

and  market liberalisation within their regions, Asia  should

not be left behind as a result.  Asia should push for further

economic integration.  The JSEPA is a step in the direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement, once concluded, will further strengthen

our   economic  linkages  and  promote  bilateral  trade  and

business.   The inclusion of new-age elements like ICT  would

also  open  new  platforms for economic activities.   On  the

whole,  the  JSEPA will provide ample opportunities  for  our

peoples  at  all levels to interact with and know each  other

better.   This will contribute to the widening and  deepening

of our bilateral relations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to Mr Simon Tay's points on relations

with  Australia and New Zealand.  As he said,  Singapore  has

excellent relations with both Australia and New Zealand, with

long  standing cooperation in diplomacy, defence,  trade  and

education  and also in multi-lateral fora such  as  the  ARF,

APEC  and the Commonwealth.  We are members of the Five Power

Defence  Arrangements, and Australia and New Zealand  provide

training   facilities   for  our  SAF.    Regular   bilateral

leadership exchanges have further reaffirmed our close  ties.

Several  bilateral initiatives were launched in recent  years

to strengthen these ties at all levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the new initiatives, the most important ones are

perhaps  free trade agreements.  Our decision to  enter  into

bilateral  FTAs with Australia and New Zealand is taken  with

the interest of the region in mind.  We hope that Singapore's

FTAs with Australia and New Zealand will act as a catalyst to

the  AFTA-CER-CEP,  and greater economic integration  between

the  two  regions.  This will best serve our overall interest

and an enlarged integrated

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>

region   will   greatly  increase  business  and   investment

opportunities  in  the  region, and  also  boost   investors'

confidence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Australia-Singapore Free Trade Agreement. Prime

Minister Goh and Prime Minister John Howard jointly agreed to

launch  negotiations  for  the  Australia-Singapore  FTA   in

November  2000  on  the  site of  the  Brunei  APEC  Economic

Leaders'  Meeting.   Two way bilateral  trade  in  goods  and

services  was more than A$13 billion last year.  The proposed

FTA  serves  to  further build on the  strong  and  expanding

economic    partnership   between    the    two    economies.

Strategically, the Australia-Singapore FTA acts as a catalyst

to  APEC's integration and the realisation of the Bogor goals

of  free and open trade and investments across the Pacific in

the next decade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the agreement between New Zealand and Singapore

on  closer economic partnership was signed by Prime  Minister

Goh  and  Prime  Minister Helen Clark in  Singapore  on  14th

November last year, after about a year of negotiations.   The

agreement came into effect on 1st January 2001.  The ANZ SCEP

is  a  comprehensive agreement covering trade  in  goods  and

services,   investment  and  Government  procurement,   among

others.   The agreement provides certainty and predictability

for  Singapore businesses and investors.  The agreement  will

open  up considerable opportunity for our business community.

Trade Ministers from both sides will meet every two years  to

review and expand on the commitments under the agreement.   A

general review of the agreement will be conducted in 2005.

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the two trade agreements, or FTAs, we

have  the  Singapore-Australia Joint  Ministerial  Committee.

The  Joint  Committee is a rather unique initiative  evolving

from  the  Singapore-Australia New Partnership  announced  in

1996.   The  Joint Economic Committee which meets  every  two

years  is led by the Foreign Ministers and includes two other

Ministers in charge of trade and defence

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>

from  each side.  Australia will host the third SAJMC meeting

this  year.   The  joint meeting, which has met  twice  since

1996, serves to further strengthen relations and set concrete

direction  to  realise the new partnership between  Singapore

and Australia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to some specific suggestions by Mr Simon

Tay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, strengthening ties outside governments. I

agree  with  him.   In  fact, there are strong  ties  between

universities,  think-tanks  and NGOs  between  Singapore  and

Australia, and New Zealand.  Let me add, as far as  Australia

is  concerned, we have a Young Business Ambassador  Programme

as  an  example.  With New Zealand, we have a Work Attachment

Programme.  In other words, Singapore also has extensive non-government links with both Australia and New Zealand.  People

to  people linkages are thick and there are several bilateral

projects.  I have just named a few examples.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, assistance to new ASEAN member countries.

Singapore  has worked closely with Australia and New  Zealand

to assist new ASEAN member countries.  Both Australia and New

Zealand  are constructive and active participants in the  ARF

and  ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conferences.  Australia  and  New

Zealand   have  also  indicated  interest  in  working   with

Singapore  on projects relating to the initiative  for  ASEAN

integration  such  as  on  IT,  so  as  to  help  breach  the

environmental gap between newer and older ASEAN countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I believe that Mr Simon Tay referred to links

with  ASEAN+3.  Let me say that we do not preclude  any  such

flexibility.   Indeed, APEC is an established  forum  linking

Australia   and  New  Zealand  with  ASEAN  and  East   Asia.

Australia  indeed was instrumental in fostering the  creation

of  APEC  and  hosted the first APEC Ministerial  Meeting  in

Canberra  in 1989.  APEC remains the only forum which  brings

together both sides of the Pacific each year, leaders from 21

economies from ASEAN, North East Asia,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>

North  America,  South America, Australia  and  New  Zealand.

They  meet together informally to discuss economic and  other

important issues.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I do believe, in the case of

Singapore,  that  small  is beautiful.   Notwithstanding  our

minuscule  size, Singapore has clinched a seat in the  United

Nations  Security Council.     I am glad that our  hopes  and

dreams over the last few years have been realised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask what is the agenda of Singapore in

the  UN  Security Council.  What are our roles and priorities

in  the  UN Security Council?  To what extent will Singapore,

as a representative, be able to reflect the security concerns

of ASEAN and our region?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have we channelled more resources, including manpower,

to  our UN mission in New York, so that it can function  even

more effectively in the Security Council?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has participated in UN peace-keeping missions

since  1989.   We  had sent small contingents  to  UNIKOM  in

Kuwait and UNTAC in Cambodia.  We have done well.  The latest

is the UN-sanctioned INTERFET mission in East Timor, where we

have sent medical and logistical support teams.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister whether Singapore intends to

increase  the  scope and quality of our participation  in  UN

peace-keeping  missions  in  the future,  when  opportunities

present themselves?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, we were voted into the membership

of  the UN Security Council in October 1999.  Election to the

membership of the Council is indeed an honour for us  and  at

the  same time, it is a milestone that indicates that we have

matured  as  a  member  of the international  community.   As

Council  member,  we  have  additional  responsibilities   to

shoulder.   I  have  no  doubt  that  we  will  shoulder  and

discharge our responsibilities with distinction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been more than a year since we assumed membership

of  the  Council.   No doubt, many events  have  taken  place

since.   I note that in recent times, the UN Security Council

has been forced to play

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>

an  increasingly active role in managing the trouble spots in

the  world.   In particular, I note that there  has  been  an

increasing number of peace-keeping missions and mediation  of

violent disputes by the UN.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to give us, first, an

update  as to the lessons we have learned as a member of  the

UN  Security Council, and secondly, the kind of role  we  are

expected to play in the international community following our

tenure as a member of the Council.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I thank Members who have spoken

on  the  Security Council.  We were elected to  the  Security

Council by a good margin, 168 out of 173 votes.  Actually  we

have only been on the Security Council for three months, not,

as  Mr Sin Boon Ann said, more than a year.  On the very  day

we assumed the membership of the Security Council, because of

the system of alphabetical rotation, we also became President

of  the  Council  for  the  month  of  January.   As  Foreign

Minister,  I  chaired some of the meetings  held  during  the

month in New York.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the lessons? I think that so far, although it

is  only  three  months that have passed, it  has  been  both

educational, instructive but also humbling - humbling because

I  think it reminds us that we are a small country.  The fact

that  we are on the Security Council has not changed it,  and

we  will still be a small country after we step down from the

Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung asked what is our agenda for this

Security  Council.   Actually,  the  agenda  is  set  by  the

turbulent world events that will occur during these two years

when  we  are on the Security Council.  This means  that  our

team  in New York and our team in headquarters, MFA, have  to

be  well  informed, including on many issues which previously

might  not have been major items in our radar scope but these

are  major items for many countries and they come up  in  the

Security Council, and positions have to be taken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still on the lessons learned during this short period of

three months, I think it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>

clear  to  us that the influence of the permanent members  of

the Security Council (what they refer to as the P5 countries)

weighs heavily on nearly every issue of the Security Council.

This  is not only due to their big power status or their veto

power but, in addition, their global reach to the control and

use  of  international media and access to information around

the  world,  particularly in conflict  situations.   Most  P5

countries consult each other quite closely and try to forge a

common  position.  And they are able to do this for a  number

of  issues,  but  in some issues they have differences.   The

recent  air  strike  against Iraq and the  no-fly  zones  are

examples  where  Russia  and China  took  a  strong  position

against  the  United  States and United Kingdom,  and  France

expressed rather strong reservations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that the P5 exerts a tremendous role in the

Security Council, does this mean that elected members in  the

Council,  who are elected only for two years, like Singapore,

have  no role to play?  I do not think so.  An elected member

can  bring  to the Council certain perspectives  of  a  small

country  or  a  different perspective of  a  country  from  a

different region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give one example, and that is, when we became

President of the Security Council, like all presidencies,  we

were expected to organise a debate along a theme.  We had  to

think  of  a  theme, suggest it to the other members  of  the

Council, who of course have to agree.  And Singapore proposed

that  the  theme  for the Security Council debate  under  our

presidency  should  be  on  the role  of  troop  contributing

countries in peace-keeping operations.  This was agreed to by

both  the  P5  and  the  other elected members  or  the  non-permanent  members.  We chose that theme because there  is  a

real  concern  in peace-keeping operations that the  Security

Council takes a decision to establish peace-keeping operation

in  any particular conflict situation.  Nobody else can  take

the decision.  It is the Security Council, under the Charter.

The  Security Council takes the decision, then the Secretary-General invites countries called Troop Contributing Countries

(TCCs) to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>

provide  contingents,  and  the PKO  is  launched.   But  the

grievance  of  many TCCs is that after the PKO  is  launched,

there  is very little consultation with them, there  is  very

little  feedback  obtained  from  them,  and  sometimes   the

mandates  of  the  PKOs are changed by the  Security  Council

without consultation with countries who have ground forces in

that  conflict  situation, and sometimes, they  say,  to  the

detriment of the safety and well-being of their soldiers.  So

there  has been this disconnect between the Security Council,

the Secretariat and the Troop Contributing Countries, and  we

thought it is good to have a session where all the members of

the  Security Council, plus the TCCs, can speak.  And we  had

this  debate  and I think, with some humility, the  consensus

was  that it was a very good idea, it was a good debate,  and

it  was  not  just a rhetoric, as at the end of the  day  the

Security  Council  decided to establish a  Working  Group  on

Peace-keeping.  This working group will look further into the

proposals  that were raised at the open debate  and  see  how

they can be implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I just cite that as one example of how a non-permanent member can play a constructive role. If there are

other  areas in which Singapore during its term in two  years

can  similarly aid debate and discussion on such matters,  we

will be happy to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Dr Ong Chit Chung's question whether, now that we

are   in   the  Security  Council,  we  would  increase   the

participation in the number of PKOs and would our quality  of

participation change or increase, I would say that the answer

to this question will have to be delinked from our membership

in  the  Security Council.  This is a point that I have  made

many times, but I have to say it again.  The fact that we are

in  the Security Council does not mean that suddenly we  must

participate  in  a  flurry of activities, whether  in  peace-keeping, whether in giving aid, triple our aid or double  our

aid,  or  whether  we should set up more diplomatic  missions

just because we are in the Security Council.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We take a longer term view in our foreign policy. So

the  answer  to the question whether we support peace-keeping

operations is, yes.  As a responsible member of the  Security

Council and the UN, it is in our interest to show support for

well  thought-out  peace-keeping  operations  of  the  United

Nations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we participate? The answer is that we have

participated in some 10 peace-keeping operations since  1991,

and  72  members of our Armed Forces and Police are presently

serving  in  three peace-keeping missions, and DPM  Tony  Tan

mentioned  this.   Will we participate in more  peace-keeping

operations?    This   is  something  that   the   Government,

particularly,  MINDEF and MHA, will certainly  consider.   It

must  depend,  first,  on  the nature  of  the  peace-keeping

operation  and  the  situation  in  which  it  is  conceived.

Second,  obviously,  it  must also depend  on  the  resources

available, both MINDEF and MHA.  But beyond that, I  am  not,

at  the  moment, able to give any commitment as to which  new

PKOs we will participate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Members for their very supportive comments about

Singapore's  participation  as  a  member  of  the   Security

Council.   I take it as a very challenging task for Singapore

and  this  is probably once in a blue moon kind of situation.

We  will  do our best to live up to the expectations  of  not

only Singaporeans but other countries who have voted us in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his comments and question on resources, yes, we

have sent extra officers from MFA and also personnel from the

Ministry of Defence to augment our team in the UN during this

two-year period.  They are doing an excellent job in  working

together with MFA headquarters and other agencies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I rise to ask the Ministry to

consider  a  review  of major human rights  treaties  and  to

consider Singapore's accession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore aims to be a democratic society based on

justice  and  equality.  That is part  of  our  pledge.   Our

judicial system

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>

is  highly rated.  Some Government leaders have from time  to

time  spoken  on  Asian values and how an Asian  approach  to

human  rights  might defer from Western  values.   They  have

however  acknowledged that some human rights  are  universal,

such as the protection against slavery or against genocide.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.20 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Singapore has acceded to three human rights

treaties.     They    are    the    Convention    for     the

Elimination/Protection against Genocide,  Convention  on  the

Rights of the Child and Convention on the Elimination of  All

Forms  of Discrimination against Women.  First, I would  like

to   ask  the  Minister  what  the  experience  has  been  in

undertaking these Conventions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Sir, I would like to encourage the Government to

change  laws  and  policies to give  these  Conventions  full

effect.  We have generally done so whenever we have taken  on

an  international  commitment, for example, WTO  commitments.

We  changed our intellectual property laws to keep  in  touch

with the trade-related property regime under WTO.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, it concerns me that we have not fully

acceded  to  some  of the things required by  the  Convention

against  Genocide.  In particular, Article 5 of the  Genocide

Convention  requires  that genocide be  made  a  crime  under

Singapore law.  Clearly, Sir, murder is a crime in Singapore.

But  that  is not the same crime as genocide and  it  is  not

clear  today  whether  Singapore  courts  would  enforce  the

international  crime of genocide.  I use that  simply  as  an

example.   I would like us, having signed these treaties,  to

ensure that all our laws and policies comply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Sir, is that having signed on to these

treaties,  I  would encourage the Ministry to make  Singapore

citizens  and  civil society groups more  aware  and  have  a

better understanding of these Conventions.  Some are somehow

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>

under  the  impression  that we do not observe  human  rights

conventions at all and this clearly should be changed.  As  I

said  at  the  start, we generally have a good  human  rights

record and should help our citizens understand it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third and final point, Sir, is that I hope our

Government would seriously consider other major human  rights

treaties  and  consider  acceding to  them  in  future.   Two

examples   that   come  to  my  mind  are  the  International

Convention  on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination  and,

secondly,  the  Convention against Torture.   On  the  first,

particularly  on eliminating racial discrimination,  that  is

something Singapore should be proud of and should aim to  set

world  standard.   And  we  should consider  joining  in  the

international  community's effort in  upholding  these  human

rights.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, may I know how much time we have

under this amendment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> About 10 minutes for the whole amendment.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Thank you. Sir, Mr Simon Tay made

three points.  First, whether we can sign international human

rights treaties.  He noted that we have signed some treaties.

I  take it he is really arguing that there are other treaties

which  we  should sign and he has asked what is our state  of

review  of this.  Secondly, he has made the point that,  when

we  do  sign  and accede to the conventions, we  should  also

expeditiously enact legislation to implement those  treaties.

Third,  he  made  the  point about publicising  the  relevant

policies under the treaty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take each of these points. On his first point,

yes,  we  do  systematically review the various international

conventions   and  treaties,  including  the   human   rights

treaties, because they are not the only treaties.  There  are

many  other  treaties.   And we have  a  mechanism  involving

several Ministries which will review these treaties.  When we

can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>

accede  to the treaty, we do so but only after a very careful

examination of the situation.  By that, I mean it is not that

we  do not want to accede to the treaty.  But our approach is

that,  when we adhere to an international treaty, we want  to

be  sure  that  we will be able to implement  the  provisions

faithfully,  or put it the other way, we do not  want  to  be

accused, after we have become a state party, that we  are  in

breach of the provisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, before we take the decision, we consult all

our  agencies.   Are we able to implement this  treaty?   And

only when we conclude that we will be able to do so, then  we

proceed.   And  we are party to several of the  human  rights

conventions,  like  Genocide Convention,  Convention  on  the

Elimination  of  All Forms of Discrimination  against  Women,

Convention of the Rights of the Child, like Optional protocol

to  the  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child  on  the

involvement of children and armed conflicts which was  signed

during  the  Millennium Summit last year.  We  are  currently

also  reviewing the Convention that he referred to, that  is,

the  International  Convention on the Elimination  of  Racial

Discrimination to see whether we can sign that and  become  a

party to it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point he made was, when we become a party to a

treaty,  we  must  enact  legislation  to  implement  it,   a

proposition  which I do not disagree.  It  must  follow  that

when  you  adhere  to a treaty, if the treaty  requires  that

legislation  to  be enacted, you must enact  the  legislation

because  the general principle in international law  is  that

you  cannot  cite  inadequacy of your law as  an  excuse  for

failure  to  fulfill your international obligations.   Having

said  that, let me say that we make it a point to ensure that

we do not fail in that international obligation.  So if there

is an obligation to enact legislation, we will do so.  But if

there is no obligation to enact, and if it is a discretionary

position,  then  we will examine whether our  other  body  of

laws,  our  legal  framework, enables us to comply  with  the

international    convention   without    enacting    specific

legislation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He referred specifically to the Genocide Convention as

an   example  where  we  had  not  really  carried  out   our

obligations.  I am the Minister for Law but I must be  guided

by  the  legal experts and all legal experts in the Attorney-General's  Chambers  actually advise  us  that  there  is  no

mandatory  obligation to enact specific delegated legislation

for the Genocide Convention.  But having said that, we are in

any  case  looking  at drafts of legislation  which  we  will

include  in  the Penal Code during a broader  review  of  the

Penal  Code  legislation.  But because we have  been  advised

that   there  is  no  immediate  obligation  to   enact   the

legislation,  we  are not treating it with pressing  urgency.

And  some  time  later,  when  we  have  the  next  round  of

amendments to the Penal Code, we will see whether  we  should

include provisions of the Genocide Convention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, his point about publicity. Yes, when we have

important new conventions which we have acceded to,  we  make

it  a  point  to have publicity.  A good example is  when  we

became  a party to the Convention on the Elimination  of  All

Forms  of  Discrimination against Women, an Inter-Ministerial

Committee,  chaired by Ministry of Community Development  and

Sports,  had overseen implementation of our obligations,  but

also they had various activities - forums, workshops, and  so

on  -  with  individuals,  interest groups,  NGOs,  to  raise

awareness  about  the  obligations  and  policies  under  the

Convention.   I take his point that we should  do  this  with

every major convention.  And in reply, I do not disagree with

him.   But  this is being done, and if it can be improved,  I

shall  welcome suggestions on this matter.  I believe I  have

touched on his main points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in case we are cut off by the guillotine under

Amendment  No.  (1),  I  hope that those  who  did  not  have

satisfaction  of  replies to the remaining items  would  feel

free to file a question and we will be happy to answer later.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I intend to end the discussion on this

amendment at 4.44 pm.  Mr Charles Chong.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, in the immediate

aftermath  of the recent earthquake in India, our  Government

responded promptly with US$50,000 worth of emergency supplies

to  the victims of the earthquake.  This humanitarian act was

given  prominent  coverage in both our  print  and  broadcast

media.  It was, therefore, a rude shock to subsequently  read

the  criticisms  of a Straits Times reader, who  pointed  out

that the Singapore Government's contribution was paltry.  Was

our  Government  indeed parsimonious in extending  aid  to  a

friend in need?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Singapore has demonstrated its sincerity to lend a

helping hand by responding instantly to the crisis, how  much

we  contribute would obviously affect our international image

as  a  donor.  Others are likely to compare the sum given  by

the   Singapore   Government  to  the   country's   financial

resources.  In other words, our willingness to donate  versus

our  ability to donate.  Little wonder that the Straits Times

reader  concluded  that  the sum  of  US$50,000  was  paltry,

relative to our budget surpluses and national reserves.   The

fact  that  another S$4 million was raised  in  nearly  three

weeks  from  Singaporeans, who responded  generously  to  the

donation  drives  by the various organisations,  appeared  to

further diminish the impact of the initial contribution  from

the   Government.   Could  the  Minister  elaborate  on   the

Government's policy with regard to granting aid to  disaster-struck less-developed countries?  What criteria do we use  in

deciding  the quantum of assistance to be given to  countries

in need?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, I share the sentiments expressed

by  my  colleague  that many Singaporeans  thought  that  our

Government's contribution of US$50,000 to the recent disaster

in  India  could have been better.  However, I note that  our

Government  has also been helpful in providing assistance  in

other  forms as well to other countries, and these programmes

are not often publicised.  It is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>

unfortunate  that  the  issue  of  our  contribution  to  the

disaster relief effort in India is now firmly etched  in  the

minds of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to ask the

Minister,   therefore,  to  clarify  whether  our  Government

considers  our aid contribution to be reasonable and  whether

this  is  in  keeping  with  what  the  other  countries  are

contributing and, secondly, to give us an explanation  as  to

our policy of providing foreign aid to the other countries.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, I am glad to hear earlier in the

debate  from the Minister that Singapore has been  active  in

extending  technical cooperation and technical assistance  to

other  developing countries.  We have shown that even  though

we  are small, we have a constructive role to play in helping

fellow  developing countries to develop more quickly.   As  a

member   of   the  international  community,  Singapore   has

benefited  in  the  early years of its development  from  the

benevolence of more developed countries not only in terms  of

funding  but  also  with  expert advice  and  financial  aid.

Without  these, we would not have been able to  overcome  the

obstacles  of  a  young nation dependent on  mainly  entrepot

trade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our parents' generation, when Singapore was just

starting  out, they had to look after those in need  at  home

first,  at  the  same time that our leaders  were  fulfilling

basic  social  needs  of housing and creating  jobs  for  our

population.  Our children's generation has grown up in an era

of  affluence where these basic societal needs have been more

than  met.   Singapore, therefore, has  a  responsibility  to

assist those less fortunate and less developed than we are.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I read and heard about the response of our people

and Government to the disasters and crises around the region,

and  sometimes  even beyond as in the case of  Turkey,  I  am

assured and heartened that our society is progressing in  the

right  direction.   However, Singapore is  a  small  country,

small in size and its resources are limited compared to  more

developed countries.  Because of these, I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>

would  like  to  urge  that we focus on those  disasters  and

crises  in which we can respond quickly and in a manner  that

is  sufficient to make a significant contribution.  To spread

our   resources  too  widely  would  only  serve  to   invite

undeserved criticisms that our contributions are not enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, may I ask the Minister to clarify the

aims and objectives of Singapore's humanitarian assistance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed):</b> Sir, I have

listened  with interest Members' comments and concerns  about

Singapore's training programmes for foreign countries and our

contributions to specific natural disasters abroad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether we are doing too little or paltry, or not

enough,  depends  on one's perspective.  Our  perspective  is

that as a member of the international community, we will have

to  play our part in assisting other countries.  That is  for

sure.  But we have to remember that at the end of the day, we

are  a small country.  Singapore is not in the big league  of

major  donor  countries.  We do not pretend  to  be  a  major

donor,  nor  do  we aspire to be one.  Our focus  in  helping

fellow   countries  has  always  been  on   giving   tangible

assistance and not simple monetary disbursements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at what Singapore is doing to assist

countries, I would ask Members first to look at the technical

assistance  and  training that we provide  in  the  Singapore

Cooperation Programme (SCP).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's major contributions to foreign assistance

rest  in  our  Technical Cooperation Programme.   Because  we

ourselves  benefited from such assistance in our early  days,

we   believe  that  the  way  to  help  developing  countries

meaningfully  is  through  the  development  of  their  human

resources.  The Singapore Cooperation Programme, for example,

in   FY1999,  the  SCP  trained  3,145  officials  from   110

countries.  In FY2000, which is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>

not  yet  complete,  trainees so far  number  3,293  from  94

countries.   That works out to an average of 274 participants

and 16 training courses per month.  The total expenditure for

FY1999 was $17.5 million and, for FY2000, expenditure to date

is $14.6 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask Members to pause and reflect on these

figures.  For Singapore to train over 3,000 foreign officials

each  year is no mean feat.  Since 1992, the SCP has  trained

over 15,000 officials from 138 countries.  The number is even

larger if you add what other Singapore agencies, beyond  MFA,

do.   In FY1999, for example, when we add the expenditure  by

other  Government Ministries and agencies which shared  their

data with MFA, the cumulative number of foreigners trained in

Singapore  stood at 6,160 from over 110 developing countries.

The  total  training cost was S$41 million.  I  believe  that

when  we  add  these  efforts up, Members  would  agree  that

Singapore  is  doing  its  fair share  in  rendering  foreign

assistance to other developing countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like next to turn to the comments by

Members   on   Singapore's  contributions   to   humanitarian

assistance.   Singapore  renders humanitarian  assistance  to

affected  countries  in  various forms,  including  financial

contributions,  the provision of rations and  equipment  and,

where time and travel arrangements permit, rescue and medical

teams.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999 and 2000, for instance, Singapore dispensed over

$12  million  in humanitarian assistance to Indonesia  alone.

This  includes supplies of rice and medicine.  Singapore  was

also the first country to offer disaster relief to victims of

the  earthquake  in  Bengkulu, Sumatra,  in  June  2000.   In

response to a request by the Indonesian Government, Singapore

sent  a 20-member SAF medical team to Bengkulu, together with

emergency medical supplies and tents worth S$50,000.  An  SAF

doctor was also despatched to help the UN Disaster Assessment

and Coordination Mission to Bengkulu.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 2000, Singapore contributed to seven

humanitarian assistance efforts

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>

in Cambodia, twice in Vietnam, Laos, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and

Botswana,   amounting  to  over  $200,000.   In  1999,   five

contributions to Mozambique, Kosovo, twice in Indonesia,  and

Turkey, amounted to $765,600 - again, not a mean sum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the earthquake in Gujarat, as referred to by

Members just now, the RSAF airlifted a planeload of emergency

supplies worth about $87,000 as an immediate response.   This

was   followed   by  another  $34,000  in  medical   supplies

despatched by the RSN, which also helped to ferry 17 tons  of

food,  clothing and medicine donated by Singaporeans  to  the

earthquake-stricken   area.   These  efforts   were   further

supplemented by the Singapore Red Cross and other  charitable

or  community-based organisations, which  have  since  raised

over  $4  million  in  donations  for  the  victims  of   the

earthquake.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, it is worth emphasising that the

amount  or  type  of  humanitarian assistance  given  by  the

Singapore  Government is not intended to match the  scale  of

the  disaster.  Rather, it is a show of moral support  and  a

gesture  of  sympathy to the affected country.  Through  such

efforts,  we  hope  to  catalyse  further  contributions  and

support  from all Singaporeans to agencies such  as  the  Red

Cross or other community-based groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do appreciate Mr Sin's and Mr Chong's points

that such assistance from Singapore could be better presented

to  the  public and to the international community,  so  that

there  is  greater awareness of the total efforts put  in  by

Singapore.    They   are  correct  in  pointing   out   that,

ultimately, it is the totality of humanitarian assistance  by

all    Singaporeans,    both   Government    and    community

contributions,  that is appreciated by the affected  country.

Singaporeans   have  always  contributed  generously   during

disasters,  and  we  should recognise  and  acknowledge  such

generosity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to reassure Members that as we gain more

experience  in such events, MFA will continue to  review  and

improve  not  only the way in which we despatch  humanitarian

assistance, but

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>

also  the way in which we package and present it to the world

at large.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, first, a point of

clarification.  When I earlier talked about our agenda at the

UN  Security  Council,  I  did not mean  the  formal  meeting

agenda, but what we set out to achieve and what we set out to

do.   In  any  case, we want to thank the Ministers  and  the

Senior  Parliamentary Secretary for their very  comprehensive

answers, and I am confident that our foreign relations are in

good  hands.   On  that  note, I beg  leave  to  withdraw  my

amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2), Mr Simon Tay.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head O of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code OA 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard the Minister about the efforts to assist

and  integrate newer ASEAN member states in his earlier reply

on  ASEAN.  I accept that there are limits to what we can  do

and  that we are best placed to serve as a catalyst.   But  I

think  that  we  should really be trying to do  more.   If  I

remember the answer correctly, the number of scholarships  to

be  given to the new ASEAN members is 60.  Sir, I think there

is a place for highly specialised elite scholarships, eg, the

Lee  Kuan  Yew Exchange Fellowship for ASEAN is a  good  one.

But,  more broadly, there is a need to reach out more  deeply

to help these newer members integrate and upgrade themselves.

I  would put it that 60 may be too few.  We should be aiming,

within  our capacity, to be serving somewhat like a Fulbright

Exchange Programme, through which many people have benefited.

So,  over  time,  many people would have come  to  Singapore,

gained from studying here, and gone back with both skills and

good  memories of Singapore, particularly when  the  National

University  of  Singapore has an enrolment  of  about,  if  I

remember correctly, 16,000.  In this sense, 60 is perhaps too

few, considering how much

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>

capacity  we  have, not just with this university,  but  with

three universities now on line.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take the next cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please do so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, the next cut relates to the future

of ASEAN+3 and ASEAN itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard in this House and outside, many have

emphasised, that Northeast Asia has come up dramatically, and

that  is  true.   Of course, Northeast Asian  countries  have

always been the bigger economies since China's opening.   The

relativity has shifted, but those three up north have  always

been bigger.  There are many good reasons to engage Northeast

Asia and I think we are doing the right thing with ASEAN+3.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I think there are two main dangers that I

hope  the  Ministry will address.  The first is that  ASEAN+3

should  not be an exclusive and closed group.  It should  not

be  a  bloc  which  is self-confining.   The  USA  and  other

partners  remain  important to the Asia  Pacific  and,  while

increasing our cooperation with Northeast Asia, we should not

ignore  these  other ties.  Secondly, Singapore should  avoid

the danger of neglecting ASEAN or of being perceived as doing

so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I would ask the Minister to share his thinking about

how  to balance these different needs of strengthening ASEAN,

ASEAN+3, and the broader Asia-Pacific framework.

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Charles Chong is not speaking. Mr

Ravindran.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Myanmar has been dealt with differently

by  two  opposing groups of countries and regional groupings.

On  the one hand, we have ASEAN, China, Japan, etc, who  hope

that  constructive  engagement would  democratise  and  bring

about change in Myanmar progressively.  On the other hand, we

have states that are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>

using the stick approach and advocate liberal democracy at  a

quicker  pace  of change for Myanmar, eg, the European  Union

and the United States.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for an update as to

whether Singapore's and ASEAN's approach to Myanmar has  bore

fruit  and  also whether Myanmar, as an issue, has held  back

relations between ASEAN and the European Union.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, to some extent, the questions

raised by Mr Simon Tay were fully covered by me in the fuller

responses  that  I  have given on the  amendments  raised  by

Members  in the first part of our debate on Foreign  Affairs.

What  I  would do is to recapitulate the key points  which  I

have made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mr Simon Tay wishes to underscore the importance

of  assisting  other countries in ASEAN.   I  have  mentioned

earlier  that this was a concern that Singapore expressed  at

the ASEAN Informal Summit and Prime Minister Goh made this  a

central point at the summit when we spoke about the need  for

integration. When we talk about the need for integration,  we

are  trying  to prevent an ASEAN divide between the  founding

countries,  or  those  who  are  better  off,  and   Vietnam,

Cambodia,  Laos and Myanmar, on the other hand.  The  leaders

took  note  of the need to avoid a two-tier ASEAN.   All  the

proposals  that came out from that Informal Summit were  with

this concern uppermost in the minds of the leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at Singapore's contributions to the

discussions  at the summit, it was not just rhetoric.   Prime

Minister  Goh  proposed,  and  the  leaders  accepted,   some

concrete  ideas to advance this process of ASEAN integration.

Singapore's proposals include, as I said this afternoon,  the

establishment  of Skills Development Training  institutes  in

the  four  countries.  It would involve training of trainers,

consultants,  researchers in areas such as trade development,

export   promotion,  human  resource  development   and   IT.

Secondly,  a  five-year  package of  IT  "Train-the-Trainers"

courses  for  each  of these countries.   In  fact,  we  have

offered 10 IT "Train-the-Trainers" courses for this year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>

Thirdly,  it  also involves an education "Train-the-Trainers"

programme   which   would  focus  on  teacher   and   trainer

development  and  that  would focus on  teaching  skills  and

resources   which   would  spearhead  economic   and   social

developments  in  Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar  and  Vietnam.   We

accept  60  vocational, polytechnic and university  lecturers

annually  from  these countries who will be attached  to  our

local institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to that, the Singapore scholarships that we

have  under  our cooperation programme, which  my  colleague,

Senior Parliamentary Secretary has outlined earlier, would be

doubled  from 30 to 60 per academic year.  I go back  to  the

point that my colleague, Mr Zainul Abidin made.  If you  view

this  as  too little, not enough, we have to do what we  can,

but  within the limits of our resources.  That does not  just

include  individual  resources.  It also  includes  what  our

institutes  can  cope  with.  These are  not  figures  to  be

sniffed at and they are appreciated by the countries  in  the

region.   And where we lack the expertise, what we do  is  to

team  up with other countries or other agencies, because part

of our Singapore Cooperation Programme involves third country

training  agreements, which we have with other countries,  as

well  as with international organisations, whether it is  the

UNDP,  WTO, World Bank and so on.  And sometimes, jointly  we

run  the  programme.  That enables us to pool  resources  and

perhaps also share expenditure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his remarks concerning ASEAN+3, here again, I have to

recapitulate  my fuller answer earlier, and  that  is,  ASEAN

must work within several areas of networking.  ASEAN plays  a

role  in ARF. We have played a role and will continue to play

a role in ASEAN-EU dialogue to engage the Europeans. Then, we

have  the  Asia-Europe  Meeting. Some members  of  ASEAN  are

involved in APEC and we have some newer initiatives like  the

East  Asia-Latin America Forum.  It is in this  context  that

you  have  to  view the ASEAN+3.  It is one of many  ways  of

engaging  different  countries  and  different  regions.  The

rationale for ASEAN+3 is, as the Member

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>

himself  said,  for Southeast Asia to engage  with  Northeast

Asia.  How this process will go, I am not sure, but it  is  a

process that is important because ASEAN has to engage  China,

Japan  and  Korea, both in economic cooperation  as  well  as

involve  them  in  discussions on matters of security-related

issues in Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has made an important point which I fully agree with,

and  that is, when we participate, all our driving forces  in

these  different circles of engagement with other  countries,

Singapore's  approach is that this cannot be  totally  closed

shop  and  totally  non-inclusive  processes.   We  must   be

prepared  to  have  an open mind and to  welcome  others  who

express an  interest.  That has been Singapore's approach and

it  is  this approach, for example, that we will continue  to

adopt,  whether  it  is  ARF,  where  Singapore  argued   and

advocated  the  participation of India,  we  supported  North

Korea and Mongolia's participation.  At the same time, it  is

not  something that Singapore can impose its will on  others,

whose views and positions are necessary to forge a consensus.

Behind  the  scene, we would argue for an open and  inclusive

process, but it may have to be gradual.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This relates to a point that Mr Simon Tay made in an

earlier intervention about our approach to Australia and  New

Zealand  which,  because  of  time,  we  have  not   had   an

opportunity  to  reply.  But that is  an  approach  which  we

believe  in,  that  Australia and New Zealand  are  countries

which  ought  to  be  brought  into  closer  interaction  and

participation  in  various discussions  and  forums,  whether

economic, political or security dialogues in our region. That

is  the  kind  of  thinking which  led  us  to  propose  that

Australia  and  New Zealand should be in the East  Asia-Latin

America  Forum.   Here again, if there are  reservations  and

voices  to the contrary, we will continue to work behind  the

scene  to  persuade  those whose agreement  and  consent  are

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Myanmar, in response to Mr Ravindran, I would say

that Singapore is not a country that has the habit of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>

standing  on  the  roof-top, making a  big  pronouncement  on

another  country's internal development.  But we do,  in  our

own  quiet way, from time to time, make known our views,  and

suggestions to our colleagues in Myanmar, as to how they  can

help  themselves meet some of the criticisms which they  face

in  international  forums.   This  is  part  of  constructive

diplomacy.   I  would  say  that  the  other  ASEAN   Foreign

Ministers and I have had useful discussions with our  Myanmar

counterpart.  This is different from their approaches of some

of  the  Western countries.  I do not wish to  criticise  the

approach of any other country.  Different approaches  may  be

useful in this regard, but you would have noticed that  there

have  been some recent positive developments in Myanmar.   It

is  encouraging  to see both the Myanmar government  and  the

opposition engaging in a dialogue. All we can do is  to  wish

them  well in this on-going process.  I believe that it  does

show,   to   some  extent,  that  ASEAN's  quiet  policy   of

constructive engagement may be bearing fruit, although  I  do

not  think we should take entire credit for it.   There  have

been  other  parties who have been involved in  this  process

such  as  the  Special Representative of the United  Nations'

Secretary-General.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ASEAN-EU dialogue, and whether Myanmar has been a

problem, I would not say that it is Myanmar which has been  a

problem.   If  I may elaborate a bit on what I said  earlier.

It  was because the European Union took a stand, and it is  a

stand which they could not reverse without consensus, that so

long as they had the policy, they would not be able to have a

meeting  in Europe of Foreign Ministers from both sides  when

the  Foreign Minister of Myanmar attends.  They had  taken  a

decision  that they would not give a visa.  Our approach  was

that we do not dictate to them what their policy should be on

Myanmar.   But whatever their policy on Myanmar,  why  should

they jeopardise and derail our long-standing dialogue process

which ASEAN and EU have had as a group-to-group position?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a postponement of the ASEAN-EU meeting, which was

supposed  to have taken place in Berlin, and therefore  there

was  an  impasse, we had quiet diplomacy between the European

and the ASEAN side and we, therefore, made a breakthrough  by

having  the ASEAN-EU Meeting in Vientiane.  My suggestion  to

the  European  Minister was:  it is far better  to  have  the

Myanmar  Foreign  Minister present there,  ask  him  whatever

questions you want to ask and let him reply.  That is exactly

what  took  place  in Vientiane.  That dialogue  took  place,

whether the EU were persuaded or not by explanations  of  the

Myanmar Foreign Minister, I do not know. But we were about to

get  on with other aspects of ASEAN-EU dialogue relationship,

which  is  very important.  It is one of the oldest  dialogue

relationships ASEAN has with other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me round up by saying that when

you  talk  about ASEAN playing a role in all these  different

dialogue  processes, ultimately, ASEAN must show that  it  is

making  serious  efforts to get its economic and  other  acts

together so that some of the shine and lustre which have lost

will  come back. For other countries, other dialogue partners

or other organisations, when they deal with ASEAN, they would

like  to know whether ASEAN is a credible organisation:   has

it  gained  stability and some of the dynamism which  it  was

associated before the financial crisis and before many of the

countries were beset by political and economic problems?   It

is  critical that ASEAN gets its acts together.   Only  then,

these  dialogue relationships can be taken seriously  by  all

parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, concept plans are long-term plans to determine the

land use of Singapore.  In formulating a concept plan, it  is

important  that long-term planning parameters are adopted  so

as  to meet the desired outcomes.  Singapore is a land scarce

country.   The  planning of land use plays a  vital  role  in

determining the kind of society and the environment in  which

we will live in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that it may be difficult to forecast the

future.   We  must,  nevertheless,  adopt  a  practical   and

flexible  approach when drafting our new  concept  plan.   It

must  be  forward  looking  and  have  provisions  to  inject

flexibility  to  meet changing demands of our  society.   The

concept  plan must also adopt a longer time-frame,  maybe  30

years, to enable both businesses and individuals to plan  for

their future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that URA has formed two focus groups to

gather  feedback  on  the  proposed  Concept  Plan  21.    In

addition,  I  would like to highlight the following  concerns

which I hope the Minister can clarify:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) What are the long-term planning parameters adopted

when the Concept Plan 21 was drafted?  Can the URA explain to

the general public how these parameters have been derived?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) What are the projected figures for population

growth,  foreign manpower, and immigration over the next  10,

20 or 30 years?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) What is the long-term mix of public and private

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;housing?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) How do we provide adequate "green lungs" in our

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;high-density and high rise built environment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) How do we reduce the effects of warming in our

built environment, and address environmental concerns such as

air, water, solid waste, chemical and noise pollution?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Can we relocate our military airports to offshore

islands so as to free up valuable land as well as lower noise

levels?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) What are the developmental provisions made to

support future lifestyles of Singaporeans which include  more

pro-family living?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, prior to the development and

finalisation  of the Concept Plan, the URA had  convened  two

focus  groups  to act as focal points for ideas and  feedback

for  a  wide  cross-section  of  the  population.   This   is

commendable as URA and everyone involved have benefitted from

the  experience.   I  would like to add  my  views  on  three

issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first point is that Singapore is an island state with

limited  land  resources.  We are a city and  a  country  all

rolled  into one.  Therefore, in planning for our nation,  we

have  to  meet  a  number  of  critical  needs   -   housing,

industries, airports, harbour, military training, reservoirs,

nature  reserves,  just to name a few.  We need  to  consider

carefully  what  we  need  to  have  physically  within   the

geographical  limits of Singapore, and  what  we  can  access

outside Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that for some non-essential items, we should look

beyond  Singapore's physical land mass.  For example, we  can

look  to  our  neighbouring countries   -  Johor,  Batam  and

Bintan,  to supply the space for more golf courses and  theme

parks.   Some expert studies have concluded that for  such  a

small population, we are over saturated with theme parks.   I

am  sure  land  used  for the Tang Dynasty  Village  and  the

Sentosa Asian Village can be put to better use.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for golf, it is simply not justifiable for more

courses to be built within our national boundaries, as  there

are  already so many courses in neighbouring Johor.   Golfers

now complain about the inconvenience of driving to Johor, but

I  think  this problem can be solved.  When the Deputy  Prime

Minister  of  Malaysia, Mr Abdullah Badawi, visited  us  last

month,  he  mentioned  plans for  a  smart  card  system  for

frequent travellers between Singapore and Johor, to ease  the

congestion  and  waiting time at the checkpoints.   With  the

easing of travel controls to Malaysia, I believe that it  can

be  quite  an attractive alternative to golfing in Singapore.

Because  of  the  abundance  of land,  Malaysia  offers  more

recreational  activities to Singaporeans  at  a  lower  cost.

Malaysian green fees, for example, are only half or  a  third

of  that  of  Singapore's, and club memberships  are  only  a

fraction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is about the density of our housing.

Although the planning scenario is  to accommodate 5.5 million

persons in year X, ie, sometime in the future, it seems  that

in  the  present  areas under development, our  planners  are

already planning and building to cater for an overall density

corresponding  to  a population of 5.5 million  people.   For

example,  in Sengkang and Punggol new towns, HDB  is  packing

the  flats  very densely and tightly in a small  area.   They

build  many flats within a limited specific area,  and  leave

huge   tracts  of  land  untouched  and  undeveloped.    This

principle  is  also  adopted  by  the  Focus  Group  on  Land

Allocation in formulating its recommendations. In its report,

it  is  said  that  "given limited land,  future  development

should  start with looking at already developed  areas.   All

areas  that  are  presently  sub-optimally  used  should   be

identified.   Land  development agencies should  aggressively

initiate  programmes to upgrade and redevelop such  areas  to

higher  intensity  before proceeding to open  new  areas  for

development."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the argument seems to be that we have to pack the

flats  more densely so as to leave other areas to build  more

flats in future in anticipation of the time when we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>

have  5.5 million people.  The fear is that if we build  less

"densely" now, we will not be able to accommodate all the 5.5

million people in time to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of this has been that HDB estates are more

crowded now.  There is less space in between blocks of flats,

and  dwelling  units are smaller.  People suffer  being  more

tightly  packed while we wait for the balance of 1.5  million

people to arrive in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot agree with this approach. On one border of my

constituency,  I  have  a large piece of  vacant  undeveloped

land.   It  benefits the relatively small number of residents

whose  flats face this so-called wilderness by offering  them

an  unobstructed view of greenery.  Even then, I  think  only

the  higher floor residents get the chance to appreciate  the

lovely   view.   Lower  floor  residents  certainly  do   not

appreciate  the bites they get from mosquitoes bred  in  that

vacant  land.  Such a valuable piece of land, yet it  is  not

put  to good use.  Only recently, one section of the land was

open  for  mountain biking.  Otherwise, it was off limits  to

the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest an alternative principle.

Instead of building so compactly, let us be a little bit more

"extravagant".  We have not reached 5.5 million yet,  and  we

do not have to cram everybody in now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two reasons why I say this. First, we must

not have the mindset that just because we erect buildings  on

a  piece  of  land to a certain gross plot  ratio  (GPR),  we

cannot  increase the GPR in subsequent years.  It is  not  as

rigid  as  that.   Market forces can be  put  to  work.   For

instance,  when  the  URA revised the  plot  ratio  and  DGP,

developers and property owners jumped in, and older apartment

blocks  were sold en bloc for redevelopment.  Some  of  these

buildings  sold  en bloc were less than 15  years  old.   For

public  housing  estates, I am sure the HDB  will  carry  out

quite  a  bit  of redevelopment under the Selective  En  Bloc

Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) in the next 30-40 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if we build buildings with more reserved sites

in between now,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>

these  spaces  can  be filled in later years.   For  example,

Tampines  Neighbourhood 4, in recent years, a  park,  an  old

folks  home  and a church centre have been built on  reserved

sites.   Buildings can be clustered together  but  with  open

spaces  in  between.  Residents do not mind  being  a  little

crammed provided there are open spaces, parks and playgrounds

for  them  and  their  family to go to relax  and  enjoy.   I

believe with a combination of clustering buildings and nearby

open  spaces  in  between,  residents  will  understand   the

constraints  of building close-knit structures.   But  if  we

cram everybody without nearby open spaces, I think this makes

everyday living that much more stressful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is that we have to be careful in

providing   for   mixed  use  developments  and   in   having

residential  units  in the vicinity of commercial  areas.   I

agree  with  the  Focus  Group that more  housing  should  be

provided  in the central area to rejuvenate it.  But  let  us

learn  from the experience of Lucky Plaza.  This building  is

situated along the popular Orchard Road, near Mount Elizabeth

Hospital.   It has a podium of commercial shops and  a  tower

block   of  residential  units.   Humans  being  human,   and

commercial space being more valuable than residential  space,

what  happens is that the apartments in the tower  block  are

often  used  as  offices, warehouses to store goods  for  the

shops  below  and  as hostels for long-term patients  of  the

hospital.  This is undesirable living environment.  Who wants

to  live  in  an apartment with a warehouse on  one  side,  a

hostel  on  the  other,  and  an  office  opposite?   Such  a

situation  does occur in a number of multi-purpose  mixed-use

developments,  and measures should be taken to  prevent  them

from being more widespread.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, first, I

would  like  to  commend the Minister for his  initiative  to

develop  the Concept Plan using a bottoms up approach,  where

professionals to grassroots leaders have had the  opportunity

to  air their aspirations, opinions and suggestions on how to

shape Singapore's physical and living environment.  While I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>

agree  with  the  number  of recommendations  of  both  focus

groups,  I  would  like to nevertheless  comment  on  several

areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, housing space. One recommendation is to increase

the  gross plot ratio to up to 8 for housing in downtown, and

they  call  it  Manhattan style.   At the same  time,  it  is

recommended that the gross floor area per person should  also

be  increased,  despite  the  fact  that  household  size  in

Singapore  has reduced from 4 to 3.  The experience  of  Hong

Kong is that while they have increased their gross plot ratio

significantly in public and sandwich housing, the gross floor

area  per person is indeed very much smaller than the present

Singapore public housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not sure if the gross plot ratio should be

increased to 8 in downtown and to 3.65 for State land outside

the  central area.  While this will optimise land use, on the

other  hand, it will create other problems like huge  traffic

congestions  in these areas.  Sir, I would like to  seek  the

Minister's  response  to this recommendation  on  gross  plot

ratio.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the focus group has also recommended that we

maintain  only  7% of low density housing up  to  18%  medium

density  housing.  Given young Singaporeans'  aspirations  to

own  a condominium or a landed property, I wonder whether the

7% for low density housing needs to be increased to, say, 10%

over  the medium term of the next 10-15 years.  I also  would

like to ask the Minister what percentage of the population he

expects to live in public housing in the medium term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next on the work space. The Government seems to

have often approached public housing building programmes very

much  from a supply point of view, rather than from a  demand

point of view.  If more attention is paid to this, I am  sure

many  in  the workforce will find it convenient to stay  near

where they work and find many other conveniences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the focus group has asked for more housing,

particularly  public  housing, to  be  built  in  areas  with

employment opportunities, especially in the central area and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>

the  west region.  I think the Government must seriously look

into  this,  as  this will have a big impact on  the  working

population  so that they can reduce their commuting  time  to

and  from  work,  and there will be an overall  reduction  in

traffic  congestions as well as they would be  able  to  save

money and their transport cost.

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the 1991 Concept Plan has recommended the

decentralisation of commercial centres.  The focus group  has

however  asked  for a review of the number  of  locations  of

regional  centres.  I call for a reduction in the  number  of

these  locations of regional centres.  Many  of  us  in  this

House  are  aware  of the problems faced by  our  HDB  retail

shops.   Neighbourhood  centres and  bigger  shopping  retail

outlets compete with the HDB retail shops and target the same

customers  who  are  limited by  the  size  of  the  regional

neighbourhood.  I think it is very urgent that the Government

looks into this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would talk about green space. There has been

much  public debate in the media especially on whether  there

should  be  more parks or more golf courses built.   Sir,  my

response  is that we should carefully evaluate the  need  for

both  of  these demands.  Personally, although I am  an  avid

golfer, I feel that we should not build any more golf courses

in  Singapore  as  the demands increase in  future.   Because

these demands, as Mr Ong Kian Min has pointed out, can be met

from cheaper golf courses in our neighbouring countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for parks, we should recognise that many of our parks

are  under-utilised.  For example, I understand from  the  MP

looking  after  the  Jurong area that the  Japanese  and  the

Chinese  Gardens are grossly under-utilised.  Therefore,  the

provision  of  0.8  hectares per  thousand  persons  must  be

carefully evaluated and reviewed so that precious land can be

used for housing or industrial use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, on the other focus group. It has focused on

identity and has made a strong

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>

case for preserving our heritage and developing a distinctive

identity.   In  this regard, I would like to just  point  out

that we must try and find ways to reduce the social divide of

residents  living  in our HDB estates.  Unwittingly,  we  may

have  developed a class system in our HDB estates.  We  often

categorise different households by 1-room, 2-room, 3-room, 4-room or 5-roomers.  We have entrenched this by using this  to

hand  out goodies during budgets and for off-budget measures.

People  do not like this branding.  I hope that, as  part  of

this  Concept Plan review, the Minister will look  into  this

matter,  which  is  a stigma amongst many lower  and  middle-income Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> I would like to

join my colleagues in commending the Ministry for its Concept

Plan 21 initiative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has been successful in getting wide-ranging

views  and  suggestions from all segments of society  through

discussions  and debates have been so comprehensive  that  we

would  be hard put to offer new ideas today.  What I am going

to  say  today  would be more an expression of my  views  and

preferences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we all agree that we have to better intensify

the use of land for housing, commercial and industrial needs,

if  we  want to support a larger population.  The density  of

plot  ratio  we  can go up to will depend on the  height  and

other  constraints.  I would like to make a special call  for

greater density in the prime housing areas, especially within

the  CBD.  We should build higher so that more of our younger

population can live in the prime areas and help to bring more

life   and  vibrancy  to  the  city.   We  should  have  more

residential  developments mixed with commercial  developments

so  that  our  downtown would not be dead at  night,  as  has

happened  in Shenton Way, Raffles Place and the Marina  area.

The  Marina  area  is  less  so because  of  the  hotels  and

restaurants  we have in the area.  This move  would  help  to

better

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>

utilise  the facilities and other infrastructure in  downtown

built  at  great expense.  It would help to boost the  retail

and restaurant sectors of our economy that currently is still

too much centred around Orchard Road area at night.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orchard Road area is so successful, in my view, because

of   the  high  number  of  high-rise  condominiums  in   the

surrounding   areas  of  Cairnhill,  River  Valley,   Orchard

Boulevard, Stevens Road, and so on.  In Marina South where we

are  planning a new downtown, I hope the Government will have

enough   high-rise   residential  developments   mixed   with

commercial ones to bring life there at night, so as to  bring

greater value to these properties built on land reclaimed  at

great expense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next issue which has been brought up by my

colleague,  Dr  Teo, is regarding the possible relocation  of

one  of the airports to the southern islands.  I support  his

call.   I  think  if  we need to reclaim  land  to  join  the

islands,  if necessary, we should try to do so.   This  would

free up a lot of land for other uses on the mainland.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the Government considered leasing on a long-term

basis  some  small islands from our neighbours for industrial

and  recreational uses?   That is something that I  hope  the

Government can look into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building to high density will obviously bring about

greater  congestion on our roads.  We should try and  promote

more  walking  and  cycling, especially in the  new  downtown

areas,  with  more  connecting paths and walkways.   Some  of

these  can  be  built underground or overhead.  Walkways  for

pedestrians should be covered, if possible.  Island-wide,  we

should  build more cycling paths to connect all parks in  the

island.   This  would  help to promote a healthier  lifestyle

too.  Netherlands is an excellent example for us to follow in

this respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reviewing the Concept Plan, like, for example, in

1991,  I  would  like  to ask the Minister  whether  we  have

reduced plot ratios in certain areas downwards.  If so,  have

we  ascertained how the reduction in plot areas has  impacted

the owners of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>

such land financially?  Do we compensate them in the same way

that  we ask for development charges for raising plot ratios?

For  Concept Plan 21, do we anticipate that we might need  to

reduce  plot  ratios  in  some  areas?   If  so,  would   the

Government compensate those owners affected?

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, it was my privilege to serve as one

of  the co-chairs of the two focus groups to the Concept Plan

that the members before me have mentioned.  I, first, want to

start  by  commending the Ministry for listening  to  people.

Some  of  you  may recollect that I engaged the Minister  and

questioned his Ministry about consultation over the issue  of

the National Library building.  And he took us up on that and

he  created  a  structure that tried to  reach  out  to  both

grassroots as well as to experts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the many points raised by the two reports, I want to

only  share  my  hopes on one, and this is on  the  issue  of

conservation of nature and built heritage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the greenery and conserved buildings are sometimes

viewed  as  marginal interests only, and the belief  is  that

there  are  only  a few Singaporeans who are  interested  in.

However,  I think the Concept Plan Focus Group challenged  us

to   see   its   connection  to  -  the  vital  question   of

Singaporeans' identity which is debated many times.  Clearly,

they  found that it is not so that these issues are marginal.

Rather, both grassroots leaders, professionals and all  those

we  spoke to were unanimous in supporting the conservation of

both  nature  and built heritage.  Public feedback  has  been

largely supportive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was quite surprised to hear that even avid golfers,

like  Mr Sinnakaruppan, say that they were supportive of  the

idea  that there should be no more golf courses.   Why?   Not

because suddenly they become anti-golf, but because there  is

a   recognition  that  our  built  national  heritage   makes

Singapore  distinctive  and  anchors  our  self-identity  and

belonging to this place.  Our Garden City concept,  the  fact

that  we are an island, all this appeals to both citizens  as

well as foreigners who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>

visit,  work and stay here.  Obviously, we have to  make  the

choices of what we conserve.  So many of the speakers  before

me  have  emphasised  other needs too.   We  cannot  conserve

everything.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Singaporeans, as a whole, have a good sense to

recognise there are trade-offs that are going to be necessary

over time between conservation and economic development.  But

almost  all felt that more can and should be conserved.   Not

just  the  famous national heritage like the Padang,  Istana,

the  Old Parliament Building, but also regional landmarks  in

different  areas  of  Singapore, and  everyday  places  where

people  congregate to eat, work and play.  Not just  colonial

buildings, but also aspects of post-World World II Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I think that we need to think more about how

we  conserve,  because  conservation is  not  a  question  of

freezing  things  and time.  It is not  a  museum  idea.   We

should  allow  sensitive  redevelopment  while  ensuring  the

cultures  and  lifestyles  are  considered  alongside   urban

design.   Katong was picked up as an example by the group  of

an  area of living interest and innovative re-use can also be

encouraged.   As  we  see the change of life  along  Waterloo

Street, I am not sure you can eat Indian rojak there anymore,

but  art  groups  flourish  there and  life  has  come  back.

Similarly, on a slightly higher scale, you have the Far  East

Square and the hotel at Fullerton.  Diversity and uniqueness,

in  a  sense,  Sir,  should be strongly  encouraged  for  the

Concept Plan.  For this, both environmental and social impact

should be assessed carefully before decisions are made.  This

brings  me  to  my  most important point, which  I  hope  the

Ministry will consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will conserve? Who will assess? Who will take part

in  the  process?  At present, Sir, decisions are made almost

solely  by Government.  I mention these focus groups  because

they  are  one  of  the first structured steps  in  involving

citizens more.  I hope the Ministry will continue to  involve

citizens in these issues.  More than

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>

that,  a  very  strong suggestion by the  groups  was  for  a

Heritage  Conservation Trust.  It is hoped that a new  entity

will   be   created  that  improves  transparency,  increases

accountability  and involves the public more  in  development

planning,  and that this Trust should stand both  independent

and equal to the relevant Government agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will share his response to this

suggestion, as well as to many of the issues raised  here  in

the House and in the report.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, as far as I

know,  most  of  our golf courses are sited in the  catchment

area  or  under flight path.  These are areas which  are  not

suitable  for  housing.  So if we need one more such  course,

especially for our NSmen, and if such land is available,  why

not?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me focus on one of the focus groups'

recommendations.  One of the groups in its report states that

the  group  in  formulating  its  recommendations  took  into

account  optimised  infrastructure.  It says,  and  I  quote:

"There  has been heavy investment in infrastructure  such  as

expressways,  MRT and utility installations.   The  level  of

intensity  of  development  in  the  areas  served  by  these

installations should be raised to be commensurate with  their

carrying  capacity  and  respective capital  investment."   I

think this is a sound principle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The completion of the North-East MRT line very soon and

the  planned development of several other lines and LRT  will

drastically  change the landscape as well as  impact  on  the

land use along this line.  I think it is very timely that the

old Concept Plan should be reviewed, and also the Development

Guide   Plans.   This  new  infrastructure  development   has

certainly rendered certain DGPs outdated.  A case in point is

the  DGP  for  Serangoon  area.  Under  this  particular  DGP

gazetted several years ago, one particular area next  to  the

Lorong  Lew  Lian HDB housing estate, on one  side  of  Upper

Serangoon Road was designated as low rise housing, despite

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>

the  fact  that  there  are existing  two  10-storey  private

apartments  called the Jade Tower.  This particular  area  is

now less than 200 metres from the Serangoon MRT Station.   On

the  other side of the road, however, the three-storey Farrer

Heights  CC was asked to move because it has got a  very  low

plot ratio.  The low plot ratio allowed for this area is such

that  the two existing blocks of 10-storey private apartments

have to actually go down to four storeys, if they were to  be

redeveloped.

<br>5.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sounds contradictory and inconsistent. We know for

a  fact  that  many  of the landed properties  adjoining  the

various  MRT  stations of the North-East line  were  actually

acquired and big sums of money paid to the owners.  The worst

thing about this DGP is that it gives no incentive for owners

of  the two blocks I mentioned, for example, which are  about

20 years old to redevelop.  So there is no incentive for them

to   redevelop.   I  would  therefore  like  to   take   this

opportunity  to urge the Minister to review and  revise  this

particular DGP and, perhaps, other similar DGPs with  a  view

to  revise  the plot ratio upwards so as to provide  adequate

incentives for them to be redeveloped.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, land use planning is actually a

sophisticated piece of work which is done by urban  planners.

For  example, when an airport is being built, one makes  sure

that  in  the  nearby  areas,  residential  housing  is   not

constructed,  or  if  buildings  are  constructed,  high-rise

buildings  are  not  constructed because it  may  pose  noise

hazards  to  the  residents who may subsequently  occupy  the

place.   For example, one does not locate housing next  to  a

reservoir  because we do not want the water to  be  polluted.

But  being in the Jurong area, I was surprised that,  despite

this  land use planning guidelines, Jurong West Neighbourhood

6,  which  is  a HDB housing estate, was built in  the  first

place  on  the  path of a RSAF airbase.  Not  only  was  this

housing  estate built, but the housing estate was built  with

very high rise blocks so much so that, as I have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>

stated  in  this  House  before, some  of  my  residents  can

actually see the faces of the pilots.  So I would like to ask

the  Minister how come there was such an urban planning usage

whereby  a  housing estate was built on the  aircraft  flight

path in the first place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue I would like to raise here is pertinent

because  the Minister himself is the FAS Chairman.   I  would

like to ask the Minister what is the norm for planning sports

facilities  in  HDB estates.  Because one of  the  sad  facts

about today's HDB estates is the lack of sports facilities in

the  housing  estates.  At most one sees in a precinct  is  a

basketball court or a sepak takraw court.  And I  am  one  of

those  who  believe  that if we want to  integrate  and  bond

people  at  the  local level, which is  at  the  precinct  or

constituency level, we must provide sports facilities because

people  will  come  down  and participate.   They  will  make

friends and that will lead to the creation of bonding at  the

local level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have noticed is that, in my constituency,

whenever  there  is a vacant piece of land, I  will  tell  my

grassroots leaders to put up a goal post and let us see  what

is the response.  And I notice that, on weekends, people will

naturally  come and play games.  This is the  way  we  create

friendship  and bonding at the local ground level.   Here,  I

would  like  to  ask the Minister whether he could  seriously

consider what is the land use planning norms in each  of  the

constituencies as far as sports facilities are concerned.   I

notice  that  whenever  I ask civil  servants  where  do  the

residents  go,  they said if you want bigger facilities,  you

can  go  to the stadium.  But actually the stadiums  are  not

quite  located in the best locations.  We cannot  expect  the

residents to go to the stadium to use facilities on  a  daily

or  weekend basis.  In any event, what I have heard  is  that

there  are  complaints that there are not  enough  facilities

even  in  the stadiums.  People have told me that  those  who

want to play badminton have to queue up on Monday morning and

within   half  an  hour,  all  the  facilities  are   booked.

Similarly, if those who want to play

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>

football, they do not want to go to a stadium where there are

inadequate facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would like to ask the Minister, when reconsidering

the  land use planning, whether we can see how we can develop

better sports facilities at the constituency or even precinct

level.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Government is the largest land owner in

Singapore.   It  controls  the supply  of  land  and  housing

through its land sales programme, zoning and plot ratios.  It

estimates  the  demand for land and puts  up  land  for  sale

accordingly.   It  determines the price  indirectly  and  can

decide  whether  to  award  or  not  to  award  the  tenders,

depending  on  the price.  In cases when tender  prices  were

considered below market value, tenders were not awarded.   My

question to the Minister is: how does the URA decide what the

market  prices  should be?  Is it not  the  slate  of  latest

tender  prices reflective of the latest market  price  unless

there is collusion among the tenderers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bids are high, sometimes even twice the

expected market value, the Government always awards the sale.

However,  when  the  bids are low, the  Government  sometimes

withholds the award of sale.  By so doing, the supply of land

to the private developers will be curtailed and the prices of

land  will be controlled.  This is unlike the sale  of  COEs,

when  COEs have been sold for even as low as $1.   I  am  not

suggesting  that land be sold for as low as $1.  We  can  all

become  property developers then.  What I want to ask  really

and  to generate some discussion on is why should there be  a

difference  in  the  two  assets  put  up  for  sale  by  the

Government. Both are assets with market values and  they  can

be financed by the banks and other financial institutions.  I

would like the Minister to comment on this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Sir, first of all, let me respond to all the Members who have

spoken on the Concept Plan Review.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Concept Plan is an important document, as Dr

Teo  Ho  Pin  has  mentioned just  now.   It  determines  our

physical  landscape and it guides the way we  wish  to  live,

work  and play in the decades ahead.  The first Concept  Plan

was prepared in 1971 by UN experts.  The emphasis then was on

basic  housing and, out of that 1971 plan, arose the building

of  HDB  flats around the central catchment area.  This  sets

the  tone  and the framework for the development  of  housing

estates in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1981 and 1991, the plan was reviewed. So every 10

years,  there is a review and this time, the emphasis shifted

from basic housing and basic infrastructure to enhancing  the

quality of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2001 review seeks to update the plan taking into

account  the  changing needs and aspirations of  our  people,

both  quantitative as well as qualitative.  The Concept  Plan

is  not just about creating a world-class city.  It is  about

building  a home for Singaporeans, a home we can be proud  to

call our own, a home to bring up family.  And this is why  it

was important to involve the public in the preparation of the

Concept  Plan.   First  of all, if this  is  going  to  be  a

blueprint for our home, then all of us who have a stake  here

ought  to  have a say in how we want this place  to  develop.

And  second, the more we are involved in the planning, we are

better informed and aware of the constraints we face and  the

tradeoffs  needed to make this place, this  little  red  dot,

comfortable and livable for us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reach out to as many people as possible from

different  walks  of life, URA formed two focus  groups.   In

addition,  URA  opened  up many feedback  channels,  such  as

Internet,  through  public  forums,  letters  to  the  press,

telephone calls, and so on, in order to draw in as much views

and ideas as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must say that I was greatly encouraged by the

response  to  our  efforts  in  the  volumes  of  suggestions

received  as  well as in the depth and the breadth  of  these

suggestions.  I would like to acknowledge, in particular, the

hard work and dedication of the focus group

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>

members,  ably  led  by their Chairman, Assoc.  Prof.  Vivian

Balakrishnan, Mr Tham Tuck Cheong, Mr Philip Ng and Mr  Simon

Tay and all those whom they co-opted into their discussions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public consultation process has been of great value

to  our  planners.   It has given them  plenty  of  food  for

thought.   It  has  also  given them a  better  feel  of  the

Singaporean  pulse,  about  how strongly  people  feel  about

issues,  such  as conservation and identity.   On  the  other

hand,  I  am told that many focus group members emerged  from

the discussions with a better appreciation of our constraints

and  competing needs in planning for the future.   I  believe

this has been a most valuable experience for all involved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two focus groups, one on land allocation, and the other

one on identity, submitted their final reports to my Ministry

last month.  URA and the relevant Government agencies are now

studying in detail the focus groups' findings as well as  the

public  feedback received.  They will give these  suggestions

serious  consideration and, where possible, incorporate  them

into the draft Concept Plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now present some of our preliminary thinking on

the  key findings of the focus groups and address the  issues

raised  by  several Members on the Concept  Plan.   Sir,  the

starting point for the Concept Plan is population size.   For

this  review, a multi-agency study group which included  URA,

of  course,  and  HDB,  the Department  of  Statistics,  MTI,

Ministry   of  Manpower,  Ministry  of  Health,  proposed   a

population figure of 5.5 million as a planning parameter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me emphasise that this figure is not a population

target.  It is not a target that the Government will set  out

to  achieve or has to achieve.  It is a projection  based  on

foreseeable  trends  in  economic  growth,  fertility  rates,

migration  rates,  etc.  It is a reasonable  assumption  upon

which to base our physical development over the next 40 to 50

years.  40 to 50 years is a very long time.  Projections  may

be wrong.  In fact, when we did the 1991 Concept Plan,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>

we  were  looking at a population figure of 4 million.   But,

nevertheless,  this is a best estimate of what  a  population

figure could be in 40 to 50 years' time.  And we will have  a

rough  idea in 10 years, when the next review of the plan  is

carried out, whether we are on the right track.  So,  in  the

meantime,  we  make use of this figure of  5.5  million.   We

asked  our planners what if we have a 5.5 million population?

How  should we cater to our future social and economic needs,

given the constraints that we face, particularly in terms  of

land?

<br>5.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question we need to consider, when talking

about  a  larger  population, is how do we balance  competing

land  needs.   The focus group on land allocation  looked  at

land for major uses like housing, industries and recreational

space.  One suggestion was to increase the average plot ratio

for  high-density housing, from a figure of 2.5 today, to  an

average  of  3.65.  What does "3.65" mean?  Just  to  give  a

rough idea: this means that housing estates could be as dense

as  some  of  the  newer estates that we see today,  such  as

Sengkang.  Of course, the older estates like Bedok, Toa Payoh

and  Ang  Mo Kio have a much lower plot ratio.  The  question

is:  would this more crowded environment be acceptable to our

people?  Mr Ong Kian Min, in fact, expressed his reservations

that this is indeed the right way to go.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from the focus group's consultations with the

public,  it appears that Singaporeans are prepared to  accept

such  higher  densities.  We will need to study  whether  the

average  plot  ratios proposed, like 3.65,  can  in  fact  be

achieved,  given some of the constraints that  we  face,  eg,

height  constraints from flight paths, etc.  But I  think  it

makes  sense  to  have  higher density housing  developments,

especially  in areas near MRT stations, so that  more  people

can  enjoy the convenience of the MRT.  In areas where  there

are  height  constraints,  more flexible  guidelines  can  be

considered to achieve the higher density and, in the process,

also to encourage more innovative housing forms.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Ong that there is really no need to

increase our housing density overnight, as it were.   It  can

be  done in tandem with population growth.  The Concept Plan,

as  I  said, is a long-range plan, and it is prepared  for  a

scenario 40 to 50 years down the road, which is a long  time.

So  it is likely that the increase in housing density will be

incremental and will be realised only over a period of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau spoke about more intensive housing

density  in  the CBD and in the new downtown.  In his  words,

this  would make sure that the downtown would not be dead  at

night.   The focus group has a similar proposal to have  more

residential  developments  in  the  central  area.   It   has

suggested  high-rise  Manhattan-style housing,  with  a  high

average  plot ratio of 8, compared to the average plot  ratio

of  5  that  the  planners had previously studied.   This  is

physically possible, because the new downtown is not  subject

to  the severe height constraints that other areas are.  But,

as  Members have also pointed out, planners have to  consider

the  implications of such dense developments if we  apply  it

across  the  board, such as social and environmental  impact,

traffic congestion and so on.  I want to stress that whatever

the  final  adopted  average plot ratio,  our  planners  will

ensure  that  high-rise housing means good  quality  housing,

with  enough  green relief, communal space,  amenities,  good

estate layouts, building designs and so on, all to make  sure

that we have quality housing for our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to some comments made about HDB estates.

Indeed, some HDB flat applicants have told us that they would

like  their  new homes in existing areas, because this  would

allow them to live closer to their families and also to enjoy

some of the established amenities there.  This is in fact the

problem  with some of our new estates, because we are rolling

out the facilities as the residents move in.  And where there

is  a  problem of timing or coordination of these  amenities,

inconveniences  arise, and some Members of  this  House  have

raised these issues here.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus groups have also commented that the continuous

creation  of  new  HDB  towns and the  resulting  outflow  of

younger  residents  and  upgraders have  resulted  in  people

losing  a  sense  of identification with the towns,  and  one

suggestion  was  to  build  new  higher  density  housing  in

established  housing estates.  I think these  proposals  make

good  sense,  both economically and socially.   Economically,

because  we  can capitalise on existing infrastructure.   For

example,  if we were to increase the capacity and density  in

some  of  the older estates where infrastructure  is  already

established,  then not only would it be more  convenient  for

those residents who move in, we would not need to spend large

sums  of money to open up new towns.  And, socially,  we  can

benefit because building within the existing new towns  means

that  people would be able to live nearer their families and,

as a result, foster closer family and community ties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Sinnakaruppan touched on the

issue of housing mix, in terms of density of housing as  well

as ownership, ie, whether it is private or public.  I want to

say  here that we would like to maintain a variety of housing

types, ie, low, medium as well as high-rise housing, to  make

sure  that Singaporeans continue to have choices in the  type

of  housing  that  they want to live  in.   The  focus  group

proposed  a  mix  of 8% low, 15% medium and 77%  high-density

housing.   This is close to the density mix today.   But  the

percentage of high-density housing would be higher  than  the

70%  proposed in the 1991 Concept Plan.  A higher  proportion

of  high-density housing is logical, if we are talking  about

intensifying the use of housing land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, when I spoke in this House, I said that for

planning  purposes,  we would adopt a 75%:25%  public-private

housing mix.  This mix was guided by what we thought would be

a  sustainable public housing programme, as well as  to  meet

the  aspirations  of  Singaporeans for private  housing.   In

1990,  the public-private mix was 86% public and 14% private.

In  our effort to meet the aspirations of Singaporeans to own

private

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>

housing,  the  Government has been steadily  releasing  sales

sites for private housing development and, at the end of last

year,  the  housing mix stood at 81% public and 19%  private.

In  other words, more households now live in private housing.

In  the  medium to long term, we intend to stick to  a  75:25

public-private housing mix as a planning parameter.  However,

we   will   monitor  closely  the  housing   aspirations   of

Singaporeans and adjust accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I just want to touch on the issue of industries and

commerce  at  this stage, for completeness.  The focus  group

recommended  that  we  also  increase  the  plot  ratio   for

commercial and industrial land.  For commercial land, this is

not  a problem, so long as the necessary infrastructure, like

transport  and utilities, is able to support such  increases.

But for industrial land, the dilemma is that many high value-added  industries, such as chemicals and life sciences,  need

low-rise  and  more  sprawling facilities.   They  cannot  be

accommodated  in  multi-storey industrial  developments.   We

have  to  continue to attract these industries to our  shores

because they bring tremendous economic spin-offs.  So we must

find room for them somehow, or our economy will suffer.   For

such  industries which cannot go high-rise, the  focus  group

recommended using the airspace above these industries  so  as

to optimise the land.  This is a novel suggestion and we will

study it carefully.  For selected sites, eg, those nearer MRT

stations,  intensification to the focus  group's  recommended

GPR of 2.5, or even higher, could be achievable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan asked how we could balance housing with

workplaces, in order to make sure that people do not have  to

commute  and therefore reduce traffic congestion.  The  focus

group   made  a  similar  point  about  creating   a   better

geographical balance between resident and worker  population.

What  we  will  try to do is to build more homes  near  major

employment  areas,  like the central  area  and  the  western

region.  Similarly, we will safeguard land for commercial and

suitable industrial developments in different regions near to

population centres.  URA is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>

adopting  this  approach in preparing the  Concept  Plan,  in

order to reduce commuting and bring jobs closer to homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of parks and open spaces, which Mr

Sinnakaruppan also brought up, the focus group  supports  the

planners' target standard of 0.8 hectares per 1,000  persons,

which  is  an  increase from the current  provision  of  0.67

hectares per 1,000 persons.  On the ground, these figures  do

not mean very much.  What most people are concerned about  is

whether there is a park near to their home where they can  go

to  relax and exercise.  So we should try to focus on quality

rather  than  quantity, and provide more  quality  parks  and

green spaces which would be accessible to more people.  Parts

of  the central catchment which are not currently accessible,

could  be  opened  to  the public.  Where  we  can,  we  will

integrate   nature   areas   with  parks   and   recreational

facilities.   While  we  cannot keep  all  the  nature  areas

identified by the focus group, we will try to keep  them  for

as  long  as  they  are  not required  for  development.   In

particular,  we  will  take note of the unique  qualities  of

Pulau  Ubin and the special place it holds in the  hearts  of

many Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members of the public have asked why can we not

have  even more green spaces and parks?  Can we not keep more

nature  areas?   This  is a question of  trade-offs.   If  we

choose  to increase the land provided for parks, open  spaces

and  nature areas substantially, it just means that  we  will

have  less  land  for housing, industries and businesses,  or

housing  will become even more dense and some industries  may

have to be squeezed out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau advocated having more cycling parks

connected  around the island, to promote cycling  for  health

and  to  reduce traffic congestion.  In case Mr  Lew  is  not

aware,  cycling tracks have been incorporated into  our  park

connectors.  These park connectors are actually intended  for

recreational purposes, but there is no reason why they cannot

be  used  also  as  a means of getting from place  to  place.

These   park  connectors  link  major  parks,  nature  areas,

population

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>

centres,  as  well  as  coastal areas into  one  very  easily

accessible  green  network.  So far,  16  stretches  of  park

connectors  have been built, and 18 more will be  built  over

the next four years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one issue which has received particular attention

during  the  focus group's discussions and,  indeed,  amongst

Members  of this House as well, is the issue of golf courses.

Sir, here I must declare my interest that I am also a golfer,

albeit  a  very lousy one.  The focus group recommended  that

there  be  no  more new golf courses.  This has received  the

support  of even avid golfers like Mr Sinnakaruppan, although

other  equally avid golfers in this House have  stood  up  to

champion the cause of certain groups of golfers.  I will come

to that later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planners have explained that most of our golf

courses  are located in constrained areas, as Mr Goh  rightly

pointed  out  - land within catchment areas or land  directly

under  flight paths.  So what else do you do with  the  land?

But some people have argued that we can actually use the land

for  parks,  why use it for golf courses?  Sir, I  understand

these  sentiments.   I  must point  out,  however,  that  the

Concept  Plan must cater to the different recreational  needs

of  many  Singaporeans.  Golf is one such form of  recreation

which  is  in  heavy demand.  For example, the SAFRA  Country

Club  at  Tanah Merah has some 10,000 members, 8,000 of  them

play  regularly on its golf courses, and an additional  3,000

non-members use its courses, bringing the number  of  golfers

at  Tanah  Merah SAFRA alone to some 11,000.  I  believe  the

reason  why  the  SAFRA golf courses are crowded  is  because

membership  fees are cheaper than other courses.  The  issue,

therefore, is not just about the number of golf courses,  but

whether we can have golf courses that are more accessible  to

the public.

<br>6.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min suggested that Singaporeans make use of

golf courses in our neighbouring countries instead.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>

Indeed, many Singaporeans have purchased golf memberships  in

Johor,  Batam,  Bintan  and  they do  play  there  regularly.

Singapore companies have also invested in golf courses there.

This  is certainly a win-win situation for Singapore as  well

as  for  our neighbours, and it should be encouraged.   To  a

certain  extent,  this would lessen the need  for  more  golf

courses here.  But where we can, we should provide facilities

on  our  home turf for Singaporeans to indulge in what  is  a

sport of choice for many.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will consider the focus group's recommendation not to

provide  any more private golf courses.  However,  we  should

not  rule  out  providing additional public golf  courses  on

sites  which  cannot  put  to more valuable  use.   Recently,

RECORD  III  recommended that a new  golf  course  for  NSmen

should be developed to recognise the important role that they

play in total defence.  This golf course would cater to NSmen

members  of all the reservists associations, in other  words,

SAFRA, CDANS and SPANS.  Since there is an NSman in virtually

every  Singaporean household, and since golf is a sport  that

is  growing in popularity among NSmen, I believe  this  is  a

recommendation which deserves our support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within our land constraints, we should try to provide a

wide  array of facilities for Singaporeans to indulge in  the

sporting  or  recreational activities of  their  choice.   In

particular,  we  should  recognise  the  special   role   and

contribution of our NSmen.  This is important if Singapore is

to  be  an attractive place to live and work in, and also  to

fight for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some participants at the public forums suggested

that  land  set  aside  for golf courses  need  not  be  used

exclusively  for golf.  This is an attractive  idea.   NParks

will  explore  whether we can open up some nature  areas  and

waterbodies  in  the  vicinity of  golf  courses  for  public

recreation purposes.  I must caution, however, that this must

be  implemented with care.  We have got to make sure that  it

is safe for non-golfers and also the interests of golfers are

taken care of.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin has raised some points concerning the

environment.   He asked whether environmental concerns  would

be  addressed in the Concept Plan.  Let me clarify  that  the

Concept  Plan  is  not just the product or the  work  of  URA

alone.  It is a combined effort of a large number of agencies

and  Ministries,  working together on many technical  issues.

These   agencies  provide  inputs  to  URA,  guide  them   in

allocating land, not only for housing, factories,  roads  and

so  on, but also for utilities infrastructure, such as  waste

disposal  and treatment.  At the same time, they also  advise

on how to minimise the environmental impact from adverse land

uses.  I just would like to inform Dr Teo that in the process

of  drawing  up the Concept Plan, other plans,  such  as  the

Green  Plan,  which  is coordinated by the  Ministry  of  the

Environment, are taken into consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Dr Teo also touched on the issue of over-heating of our environment. In preparing the Concept Plan,

NParks,  URA  and  HDB have worked together to  identify  and

safeguard  areas  of open space and parks with  greenery  and

trees  to  mitigate  the over-heating effect.  BCA,  HDB  and

NParks   are also embarking on a research programme on  urban

heat islands in Singapore.  This is a matter in which Dr  Teo

has particular interest.  This study will include a study  on

roof-top  gardens,  together with the NUS  Centre  for  Total

Building Performance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the issue of identity and

development.    The  focus  groups,  as   well   as   several

Singaporeans, have expressed the need to conserve more of our

buildings,  places and natural features which they  feel  can

help   in  retaining  our  identity.   Mr  Simon  Tay   spoke

passionately on this issue just now.  It is indeed heartening

that  more Singaporeans feel strongly enough for our home  to

want  to  preserve  our  social memories  and  in  doing  so,

strengthen our sense of belonging.  It was not too  long  ago

that  we did not care what our city looks like.  It was  even

further  back in time when conservation of our built heritage

was a luxury and of lower priority.  This was when we had  to

set out to solve critical issues of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>

housing  shortages  and  how to earn  a  living  in  a  newly

independent  Singapore.    Times have  changed.   With  basic

housing and infrastructure in place, with economic growth and

rising  affluence,  we can now turn our attention  to  issues

such  as conservation, identity and shared memories.  But  we

must not get carried away.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As rightly pointed out by Mr Simon Tay, we cannot simply

conserve  everything. We need to carefully consider  what  to

retain,  how to retain and how much to retain, while ensuring

better  use of land.  The process of selection and evaluation

has  to  be  vigorous. This is to ensure that while deserving

buildings and places would be conserved, we would still  have

enough  land  to  meet  the needs of our future  generations.

Nevertheless, when drawing up future plans for our city,  our

planners should consciously identify the buildings, features,

places,  which  give the area its identity.  We  should  find

ways to integrate these so called "identity markers" into new

developments.  We should also look into how we can  safeguard

the   interest  and  factor  in  the  views  of  the  various

stakeholders, the owners, the residents and the users.  These

are  not  easy  issues  to  settle.  They  call  for  a  fine

judgement,  coupled  with  an ability  to  balance  competing

demands.  The focus group on identity has proposed a heritage

conservation   trust  to  help  Government  to   make   these

decisions. This is a suggestion we are seriously considering.

The relevant Government agencies will study it further to see

whether and how this concept can work in our local context.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the limited time, I have only touched on

some  of  the key issues raised so far on the  Concept  Plan.

URA  and  the  relevant Government agencies will continue  to

study  and  consider all the other suggestions  and  feedback

from  Members of this House, the focus groups and the public.

The  Concept  Plan is still on the drawing board.   URA  will

work  towards exhibiting the draft plan to the public by  the

end  of  April.  It will hold a public dialogue on the  draft

plan to gather more views before the plan is finalised.   The

preliminary conclusion, based on the work

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>

done  so  far, is that as far as the physical development  of

Singapore is concerned, we should be able to look forward  to

a  comfortable  life  even  if  our  population  reaches  5.5

million.  There would be homes for all, industries to sustain

economic  growth and also room for our children to enjoy  the

simple pleasures of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to address some of the Members'

specific questions on land use and the Government land  sales

programme and a few other issues.  Mr Goh Choon Kang  and  Mr

Lew Syn Pau asked about changes to the plot ratio of land, in

particular,  Mr  Goh asked about intensification  of  certain

specific  sites near MRT stations.  I would like to say  here

that  when URA determines the plot ratios for different sites

in  the  masterplan,  factors  such  as  height  constraints,

planning  intention, character of the area and  proximity  to

transport nodes are taken into consideration.  Where  a  site

is   surrounded  by  high-intensity  uses  and  is  close  to

transport  nodes, like the MRT stations, a higher gross  plot

ratio  (GPR) may be prescribed to optimise the use  of  land.

But if the site is next to an existing landed housing estate,

a  lower gross plot ratio may still be prescribed in order to

safeguard  the  amenity  and the low-rise  character  of  the

existing  landed housing estates.  The Concept Plan maps  out

the  broad direction in land use for Singapore. It  does  not

look  into specific plots and specific plot ratios.  This  is

done  only  with the Masterplan as distinct from the  Concept

Plan.   The next review of the Masterplan will take place  in

the  year  2003, when we will take into account the feedback,

such as those from Mr Goh on specific sites.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew asked a specific question about whether plot

ratios  would be reduced and if so, whether owners  would  be

compensated for the reduction.  I wish to inform him that any

existing  plot  ratio,  which  has  been  approved,  will  be

honoured, subject to prevailing height control for the  area,

even  if  the  plot  ratio is beyond that prescribed  by  the

Masterplan for that site.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>

Under  the  circumstances,  the  issue  of  compensation   is

irrelevant because there would be no loss to the owners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran asked why the Jurong West housing estate

was  built  under  the RSAF flight path.  I believe  he  also

raised  the same question in this House a few days  ago  when

the Ministry of Defence's estimates were debated.  Let me say

that in land scarce Singapore, we need to do a balancing act.

We  have  to  balance  various land uses,  such  as  housing,

schools,  airports, etc, within this limited land area.   And

when  you  do  a  balancing  act,  inevitably,  you  have  to

compromise  between these various uses.  However,  that  does

not  mean  to  say  that we totally ignore the  dis-amenities

caused by different uses. There are guidelines in place  that

are  prescribed  to  limit the impact of nuisances,  such  as

noise  nuisance,  smell  nuisance,  pollution,  etc,  by  the

various land uses.  In the case of Jurong West, let me assure

him  that  the  location of the housing  area  satisfies  the

guidelines set by the Pollution Control Department  on  noise

levels,  within which housing may be permitted.  I understand

that MINDEF is taking steps to reduce the noise nuisance from

RSAF  flights  where  possible, but it is  not  realistic  to

expect  that the residents in the estate can enjoy the  peace

and  quiet  that other residents in other parts of  Singapore

are  able to enjoy.  If we were, for example, to specify that

no  housing estates be built under flight paths, today  there

would be very few housing estates in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew asked about the setting of reserve prices for

sale  sites  and  whether  in so  doing,  the  Government  is

interfering in the market.  He asked how URA decides what the

market  price is and why the Government could not just  leave

it  to the market to decide prices, and just award it to  the

highest  price  irrespective.   Let  me  say  here  that  the

Government  does  not arbitrarily set any so-called  "reserve

price".  The reserve price is set according to Chief Valuer's

assessed market value for the site and this value takes  into

account evidence from recent property transactions and  other

relevant indicators of market sentiment.  As a prudent land

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>

owner,  and  as  a  custodian of the  State's  reserves,  the

Government  has the responsibility to ensure that it  obtains

fair  value  in the disposal of State land, and  the  reserve

price  provides  an  objective basis to guide  the  award  of

tender  for  State  land.  To allow for  some  variations  in

market opinion from the Chief Valuer's estimates, the highest

standard  for a site is accepted so long as it  is  not  less

than  85%  of the Chief Valuer's assessed market value.   The

Member  did say that he is not suggesting that land would  be

sold  in  Singapore for $1.  I think that  is  precisely  the

point:   should we sell land at a price which is ridiculously

low  or  far below what is considered, at least by the  Chief

Valuer, to be the fair market value at that point in time?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasise that this policy of selling

land  is  not intended to prop up or to lead property prices.

The Government is committed to a steady land release strategy

to  make  available land for development.  It is  up  to  the

developers  to  decide to tender and at what price  based  on

their  own reading of market demand.  I stress again that  it

is  not  prudent  for Government to accept  any  tender  just

because  it  happens  to  be  the  highest  tender  in   that

particular exercise.

<br>6.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Ong Kian Min spoke about the abuse of mixed

use  developments,  and  he cited a specific  case  of  Lucky

Plaza.   Sir, we are actually trying to introduce more  mixed

use  into  our estates.  For example, last June, URA actually

relaxed  the guidelines for industry, warehouse and  business

park zones to allow more mixed use, eg, e-businesses and dot-com companies to set up offices within these zones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand Mr Ong's concerns about such abuse. This,

inevitably, takes place when owners try to take advantage  of

the  system  for  their own benefit, at the  expense  of  the

convenience  and  amenity of others.  There  is  always  this

group  of people who are very quick to try and arbitrage  the

system.  But this is the risk that we have to take.  If it is

a major

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>

loophole, we will have to plug it.  If not, then we just have

to  depend  on enforcement from time to time.  But we  cannot

just stand still and do nothing, and not to take into account

the   changing  circumstances,  just  because  there   is   a

possibility of abuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have addressed most of the concerns.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, I requested for additional sports

facilities at the local precinct level.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I am sorry. In so far as the provision

of  sports facilities is concerned in housing estates,  I  do

sympathise with the Member's view that there should  be  more

sports facilities.  Indeed, there are sports facilities being

provided  in the Concept Plan on a total basis.   But  on  an

estate by estate basis, there may be instances where there is

a  shortage of such facilities.  One of the things  that  the

URA is looking into, together with other relevant Ministries,

is,  for  example, the question of shared use.  If  we  could

find  a way to use existing facilities in the housing estates

which  are  under utilised, eg, the school fields,  we  could

actually increase the number of such fields available for our

residents to use.  Another possibility, of course, is to make

use of some of the existing open spaces, and here I think  we

would  have  to again contend with this issue of  conflicting

demands.   By this, I mean that if we were to open  up,  say,

some  of the open spaces to children for playing ball  games,

inevitably,  there will be complaints about  noise,  nuisance

and so on.  Of course, these are not insurmountable problems,

but I just wish to point out such problems will arise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, of course, I think the point that

the  Member made is well taken, that we should look into  how

we  can provide more such facilities.  And I will support any

such  moves to increase the number of facilities and  I  will

refer his request to my colleague, the Minister for Community

Development and Sports, to take up with the other agencies.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, the primary purpose of building HDB

neighbourhood   shops  and  hawker  stalls  is   to   provide

convenient shopping for HDB residents.  But these shopkeepers

and hawkers are now facing an uphill task to survive in their

businesses.   What has caused this situation?  The  following

are some of the problems faced by them:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) There is an oversupply of shops in the neighbourhood

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;area;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) There is inadequate control of tenant mix in some areas,

leading   to   duplication  of  services   and   insufficient

complementary shops;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The rental rates are too high, and too much

multiple  subletting has been allowed.  This has  drastically

reduced   the  price  competitiveness  of  their  goods   and

services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to recommend three measures for HDB to

consider  in  making neighbourhood shops and  hawker  centres

more viable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Lower rental cost and property tax. HDB should

review  its  policy of determining rental rates.   We  should

adopt  the practice of private developers who use  fixed  and

variable rental rates to help their tenants to build up their

businesses.   We  should also consider lowering  or  removing

property tax, especially for hawker stalls.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Control tenant mix. HDB must control tenant mix as

in  private  development.  This will ensure fair  competition

and  viability for their businesses.  A good tenant mix  will

provide  a  wider range of services.  HDB should also  ensure

that  ATMs,  post  offices, banks, clinics and  childcare  or

family  service centres are present to complement  the  shops

and  hawker stalls.  We must not allow the change of use from

retail shops to offices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Upgrade business practices. We must encourage all

HDB  shopowners  and hawker stallholderss  to  upgrade  their

operations to increase productivity and competitiveness.   As

an incentive, HDB should consider providing rental rebates

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>

or  property  tax  rebates for shops  or  stalls  which  have

successfully upgraded their operations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

recent  economic recovery and the slowdown of the US  economy

led us to face uncertainties in our economy.  Many retailers,

shopkeepers and stallholders in HDB estates do not enjoy  the

benefit  from our economic recovery.  All that they  feel  is

that  they have bad business, mounting costs and turnover  is

lower.   They are full of complaints and grievances.  At  the

moment,  the  retailers and hawkers find  that  the  cost  is

almost unbearable.  Although the present situation is not  so

serious,  the moment the US economy gets worse  and  sends  a

greater impact on Asia, the situation can be very serious.  I

hope  the  Minister  can  seriously  consider  the  following

suggestions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, those who have already bought their shops on a

99-year lease, we should allow them to reduce the lease  from

the  current  99  years to either 30 or 60 years.   Then  the

surplus money could be refunded to the shopowners, so  as  to

lighten their burden.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as Dr Teo has mentioned that there are too

many shops in the older  housing estates, HDB should buy back

the  shops  from those operators who are not able to  sustain

their  business.  They may have a problem of sustaining their

business,  but  because they have already bought  the  shops,

they have to pay their instalments to the banks.  They are in

great  financial difficulties.   So, if it is possible,   HDB

should buy back the shops.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would suggest that the Government lower the

rentals  and  the service charges for the shops  in  the  HDB

estates.   For  those who are having MUP,  the shopowners  do

not  have much benefit because they have to pay a high amount

of  renovation or upgrading charges, unlike the residents who

only  pay 20-40%.  I hope the Government will allow  them  to

enjoy the upgrading, but without having to pay so much money.

If we insist on their paying so much, there will be a greater

burden for them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, make some refinancing arrangement with the

bank  to  lower  the  monthly  instalments  payable  by   the

shopkeepers.    As   business  is  bad,   they   have   great

difficulties  paying the high instalments and  high  interest

every month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from those who have bought the shops, some of the

retailers are actually renting the shops from the HDB.   They

have  difficulties.   I  have three  proposals.   First,  HDB

should  consider  lowering the rentals and  service  charges.

Because some of the shops are not doing well and they  cannot

afford to pay the high rentals.  Second, the number of  shops

in  HDB estates should be smaller, whether they are purchased

or  leased.  If there are too many shops, it is very hard for

the businesses to survive.  If they can reduce the number  of

shops  in the estates or to pay some kind of compensation  to

buy  back  the shops, the recovered shops can be turned  into

void  decks,  and  there will be more  space  for  grassroots

activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, consider reducing the floor area of the

neighbourhood  shops.   Some of these shophouses  have  floor

areas  of 60, 90 or 120 square metres, but they only need  30

square metres.  If they can reduce the size of the shops, the

rentals will be correspondingly reduced, and this will  be  a

help to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards hawker stallholders, they have two problems.

Firstly,  for  these  people,  the  Government  can  consider

lowering the rentals of their stalls, especially in the  case

of  the  stalls  which were originally  tendered.   When  the

contracts expire, the rentals are adjusted upwards.  In  some

cases,  the tendered rental was already very high,   yet  you

adjust it further upwards.  It would be unreasonably high and

almost  impossible for the stallholder to carry on  with  his

business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I can see that some hawkers are doing a

roaring  trade.   They live in big houses and drive  Mercedes

cars.   If  they are good in their trade and want  to  expand

their  stall space, they should be allowed to take  over  the

vacant stalls nearby, so that they can expand their business.

For these people, if there is more space for them to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>

operate,  they  will be able to do better  business.   So  we

should  not restrict them to just one or two stalls, but  let

them  rent as many stalls as they wish, so long as there  are

vacancies and they can afford them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope these proposals will be considered by the

Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> For the benefit of all those who want to

speak later on, please make your speeches short.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, if one were to look around the

housing estates, it is a no brainer to conclude that there is

an  over supply of shops in some areas where human traffic is

low  and  business is poor, and an under supply of  shops  in

other  areas, because they are popular.  People  flock  there

and  retailers do a roaring trade.  The reason  for  this  is

simple.   HDB decides on a new town from the top down.   From

the  planner's  point of view, which at times  can  be  quite

academic  in nature, it is like there is an open field  where

you  want to design and build a footpath for people  to  use.

You  can  build  one, but people may choose not  to  use  it,

because it is not convenient.  Or you can wait for the people

to  carve a natural path through the grass and then  pave  it

and make it into a footpath.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When HDB designates a particular area to house the

neighbourhood  shops,  there is no  guarantee  that  it  will

successfully develop into a popular and attractive place that

residents  want  to  visit.  Many factors  are  involved  and

consumers' preferences are fickle and hard to determine.  Bus

services, car park, accessibility, tenant mix and many  other

factors affect the success of the neighbourhood centres.  The

plans  may  look good on paper but actual implementation  may

produce  a  very different result.  Of course,  there  is  no

denying  that  the  planners can do  a  lot  more  to  ensure

success.  For example, if you put a critical number of  shops

together,  integrate  them with the bus interchange  and  MRT

station, like Tampines regional centre, the chances are  that

it  will  become  a success.  But other fringe  neighbourhood

centres are not so

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>

fortunate.  As a result, many shopkeepers in fringe areas are

not  faring well.  For these areas, there must be a mechanism

for  the  excess to be cut down.  Retailers who  have  rented

shops  from  the  HDB should have the option  to  voluntarily

surrender their lease for compensation.

<br>6.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the other side of the same problem of

determining  the optimal number of shops for  any  particular

area  is  that  there are many new housing estates,  like  my

constituency, Pasir Ris GRC, with very few retail outlets  in

some  precincts.  These shops are few and far between, making

it difficult for residents to get their necessities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tackle these two problems - too many shops in some

areas  and too few in other areas - we need to find  a  right

balance and the right tenant mix in between.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to rethink and revamp the retail scene

in  the  housing estates in the light of the changes  in  our

shopping  and  buying  habits.  One of the  reasons  why  our

neighbourhood  shops are not doing so well is the  change  in

people's  buying habits.  People buy the bulk  of  what  they

need  from the large supermarkets and shopping malls.  People

also  prefer  to wait for the right occasion to buy  an  item

that they do not need urgently.  For example, if you want  to

buy  an expensive watch, you would rather make a special trip

to  a  popular shopping mall than buy it from a neighbourhood

shop.   In  these  smaller neighbourhood  shops,  people  are

looking  for  things that they need urgently.   This  is  the

success behind the 7-Eleven stores.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 7-Eleven stores provide us with a model that has

been proven to be highly successful, despite high rentals and

business overheads.  People do not mind paying more  for  the

convenience   of   getting  items  they  need   quickly   and

conveniently.   These stores are popular in  many  countries,

including Japan and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>

Hong   Kong.   They  have  become  entrenched  in  the  local

community.   As  an  essential piece in  the  infrastructure,

people in these countries are even thinking of using them  to

offer   other  services,  such  as  paying  utilities  bills,

withdrawing money, buying stamps and posting letters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge HDB to consider facilitating the

development  of such a network of convenience stores  in  our

housing estates.  If retailers were to upgrade their offering

of  goods  and  services, I dare say  that  they  would  find

themselves  more relevant in serving the needs of  the  local

community,  and  more  people  and  more  businesses  flowing

through their shops.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to what many people believe, opening a retail

shop  is  not an easy matter.  In my constituency, I  have  a

neighbourhood  centre.  The shops there have  been  sold  and

most of them are rented out by the private owners who are now

landlords.   I  speak to the shopkeepers there from  time  to

time.   But  it is difficult to keep track because they  come

and  go so quickly, some within months.  Some of the aspiring

retailers are first-timers taking the plunge.  They  complain

to  me that business is so quiet that they do not make enough

to  pay their rent.  When I told them that perhaps they  were

paying  too  high  a  rent,  they  told  me  that  they  were

inexperienced  and did not know.  Some of them  were  retired

civil  servants,  ex-army  officers and  company  executives.

Some  left  good-paying jobs to go into the retail  business.

Some had been retrenched and decided to use their savings and

retrenchment benefits to start out on their own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being new to the trade and not familiar with the

neighbourhood,  they  had decided to rent  the  shop  without

doing  much feasibility study or ground research.   They  had

agreed  to pay a very high rent which cannot be sustained  by

the  low pedestrian traffic and poor business.  Many  had  to

close shop after a few months.  One would think that the next

guy to come along would be wiser. But that is not the case.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>

There  is always some other guy with equally limited business

savvy who wants to give it a shot and pay the same high  rent

for the shop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To alleviate the situation and as its contribution to

Retail  21, I believe the HDB should do more in advising  and

guiding  people who want to open retail shops in HDB estates.

I  would  like  to  urge HDB to offer some form  of  business

consultancy  or  business intelligence  service  through  its

network of branch offices, where a prospective tenant can get

some  assistance and guidance in assessing the local business

environment and the proper trade mix for that area.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am still not getting the cooperation of

time  for  cooperation  for  the benefit  of  all  the  other

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, there have been many calls

today, and in the past in this House, for assistance for  HDB

retail shops.  Many of these HDB shop retailers, majority  of

them,  have been suffering in silence for the past few years.

Because  of  the increased competition from big retailers  in

the  nearby estates, as well as the changing shopping  habits

of  Singaporeans, you will find that their pleas have  become

louder.   Today, if you look at the topic, there are  11  MPs

who  are going to speak on this topic, although I notice that

none  of the Opposition MPs have thought that it is important

enough for them to bring this up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask specifically the Minister what his

Ministry  intends to do on the over-supply of shopkeepers  in

HDB  estates.   I would like to also ask how  far  the  PSB's

retail scheme will go to train and retrain retailers who  may

not  be  proficient  in  English and whether  there  will  be

programmes  in other languages, so that they can  be  trained

and retrained to help them seek a new livelihood.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to also ask whether the Government

will  be  prepared  to compensate existing  tenants  if  they

decide  to  call  it quits, not just to compensate  them  but

whether  the  Government will also buy back  these  shops  at

market price.  And I believe that they will sell it at market

price  but the Government can consider offering an attractive

ex-gratia  payment,  so  that shopowners  can  pursue  a  new

livelihood.   Or,  alternatively, would the Government  allow

the  conversion  of the 99-year old lease to  a  30-year  old

lease  at  market  price plus offering an  ex-gratia  payment

which  is  attractive enough, so that many of these retailers

can tide through the difficult period?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is getting better now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I will be even shorter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister, in reviewing his policies for

HDB  shops,  consider  the fact that just  cutting  away  the

excess  capacity,  doing away with the  shops  or  relocating

them, might not necessarily be the best way, in my view.  One

of  the  better ways would be to reduce rentals, as mentioned

by  my  colleague,  Dr Teo.  That could be  lowered  so  that

tenants  could  still continue to do their  business  and  be

profitable.  These neighbourhood shops, the mom and pop shops

-  the hairdresser, the food centre, the stationery shop, and

whatever - can help to keep our cost of living down.  Perhaps

more  flexible use of shops will allow the business  activity

to go on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking back the shops and compensating them $40,000, or

whatever,  may appeal to some aged tenants but  not  to  many

others  who may have to depend on their business to  survive,

as  mentioned  by another colleague just now.  So,  what  are

they  to  do  after that?  They move to another location  and

they  pay  higher cost of operation with higher  rentals  for

more  popular areas, where they have to move or give up their

shops.   Can  these people be suitably retrained after  that?

What  happens to those aged residents or low-income residents

who  stay in HDB flats who need easy access to shops, instead

of travelling by buses and trains to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>

the  retail  centre?  Where the shops can form a  complex  so

that  among  them they can organise themselves  and  together

with  HDB, form some kind of differentiation or mix of trade,

then   they  can  attract  customers  which  will  keep   the

neighbourhood busy.  For example, I have suggested some years

ago in this House for MND to consider allowing shopkeepers to

spruce up old housing estate shops, like the two-storey shops

in  Tanglin  Halt,  for their unique 1960's HDB  conservation

flavour on a 30-year old lease.  Of course, at that time when

I made the proposal, it was rejected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy can now allow for more flexibility of use.

We  have to be a bit wary.  There are externality effects  of

retail  activity.   If some shops are permanently closed  and

kept  vacant, then it would affect the business  activity  of

the  nearby  shops.  Those who want to carry on the  business

will  be  affected.   There will also  be  no  potential  for

redevelopment  and better use of land, unless all  the  shops

are  vacated.  Meanwhile, the life for everyone is made worse

for the remaining shopkeepers and residents.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> I shall be short, Sir.

retailers face now.  I would like to repeat my call  for  the

Ministry of National Development to consider helping them out

with the following measures  (I would like to declare that  I

am running my clinic from an HDB tenanted shop):

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Allowing splitting of the shops into smaller shops

to co-exist with other types of businesses;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Granting easier "change of use" of their shops;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Resettling some retailers to other places that have

better need of their kind of trade;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Relocating shops in poor locations and poor market

conditions to better business areas;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Having the option of selling their shops back to

the HDB without losing too much;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Lowering HDB rentals;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Reducing and restructuring HDB shops, not only in

terms  of  new supply but also in consideration  of  existing

ones; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Regrouping HDB shops to form "commercial streets"

of distinctive features.

will consider my proposals favourably.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A" is for accolades. I think we have to praise our

shopkeepers, retailers and hawkers for keeping  the  cost  of

living down.  They have helped us, we must help them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"B" is for business mix. I must join in the call to

make  the  business mix more intelligent and acceptable.   We

cannot have people survive if there are five grocers in a row

and three barber shops next to each other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"C" is change of use. HDB can be more flexible in

allowing change of use, especially for sales.  People want to

sell  their shops but they are then subject to change of use.

And  if  HDB  says no, the sale is off.  For shopkeepers  who

then have to stay in the shops, they want to diversify.  They

want  to put up something else, besides groceries.  HDB again

says  no,  you  cannot.  This is only a grocer's  shop.   You

cannot  have  a  florist next to it.  So  change  of  use  is

important but "D" - Diversification is helpful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"E" - for those who want to exit, I think we should have

compensation  programmes to allow them to exit with  a  small

little  sum,  maybe for the rest of their lives.   They  have

been  successful in bringing up their children and sent  them

to universities.  Now these children do not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>

want  to  go  back to the shop.  So let them have  a  sum  to

retire in happiness and enjoy the rest of their lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"F" - when you diversify, sometimes they may not want to

leave,  they  want  to  have their shop floors  strengthened,

because  upstairs  is no longer a place for  them  to  sleep.

They  want to store their goods up there, but HDB says,  "No,

you  can't  because  the floor is too weak."   Therefore,  if

these shopkeepers are willing to strengthen their floors, let

them  do so.  For new shops, I would ask HDB to perhaps build

stronger  floors  so that other uses can  be  made  of  these

shops.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these things would then help to give our

shopkeepers, for those who are entrepreneurial, a  new  lease

of  life  and for those who are not entrepreneurial, to  exit

nicely.  The same thing would go for hawkers.  If the hawkers

want  to exit, there should be a nice little sum for them  to

exit because nobody wants to sell fish

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>

anymore,  and  their children do not want to sell  vegetables

anymore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think we can stop slightly early as a

bonus for cooperation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to report

that the Committee of Supply has made further progress on the

Estimates  of  Expenditure for the financial year  2001/2002,

and ask leave to sit again tomorrow.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.
