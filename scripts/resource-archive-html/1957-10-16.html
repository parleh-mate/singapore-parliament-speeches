11th  September,  1957, I read  a  message  from  the

Speaker    of   the   Federal   Legislative   Council

<div align="center"><b>ALIEN MUSICIANS AND BANDS</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Policy on entry and on protection of local musicians



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> asked the Minister for Labour

and  Welfare  what  is the present  practice  of  the

Government  with  regard  to  the  entry   of   alien

musicians  and  musical bands seeking  employment  in

Singapore; and what is the Government's policy on the

question   of   protecting   local   musicians   from

unemployment as a result of imported alien musicians.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the entry of alien musicians

and musical bands seeking employment in Singapore  is

governed   by   the  provisions  of  the  Immigration

(Prohibition  of  Entry)  Order,  1953.   Among   the

categories of persons set out in the Schedule to that

Order  who may be admitted into Singapore are persons

with  professional or specialist qualifications which

would  enable  them  to follow  their  profession  or

occupation  in  the  Colony without  prejudicing  the

interests  of  persons already resident in  Singapore

and     possessing    corresponding    or     similar

qualifications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present policy of the Government, Sir, designed

to  protect  local musicians from unemployment  as  a

result  of imported alien musicians, allows  for  the

admission of not more than two foreign musical  bands

into  Singapore at any one time, subject to the local

sponsor who is desirous of importing the foreign band

engaging an equal number of local musicians to play

with  imported bands. The maximum stay  in  Singapore

for each imported band is six months. This policy  is

at   present  under  review  in  the  light  of   the

experience gained and of the Government's  policy  on

the tourist trade.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Will the Hon. the Minister inform

us  whether  the review is intended to  widen  or  to

narrow the limits of entry of alien musicians?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> It is intended that the number

fixed at present of two bands may be increased.



One  must  not overlook the fact that a foreign  band

here means employment for local musicians.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government policy on entry into Singapore



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for Labour

and  Welfare if he will state the Government's policy

regarding



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the entry from China of wives of Singapore

residents  who already have wives in  Singapore;

and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the entry from China of aged parents of

Singapore residents having no other relatives in

China to look after them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, with regard to the first

part  of  the  question, it  is  the  policy  of  the

Government not to permit entry into Singapore of such

wives, invariably referred to as secondary wives.  In

very special circumstances where the wife in China is

the  primary wife, the policy may be relaxed. In such

cases,  certain  factors meriting  consideration  and

normally   taken  into  account  by  the  immigration

authorities   must   be  satisfactorily   proved   or

established.   It  will  be  appreciated   that   the

circumstances of every case vary and, in consequence,

each  case  is thoroughly investigated and  carefully

considered on its merits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entry of persons described in the second part of

the  question is governed by paragraph 7 (f)  of  the

Immigration (Prohibition of Entry) Order, 1953.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of recommendation by

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Court of Inquiry into Trade Dispute



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> asked the Minister for Labour

implement the recommendation for a secret



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2647</b></font><br><br>



ballot  in paragraph 9 (iii) (b)*  at page  8  of

the Report of the Court of Inquiry into the Trade

Dispute at  the  Singapore  Harbour  Board  as  contained  in

Sessional Paper No. S. 7 of 1957.



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Following is paragraph 9 (iii) (b) -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the case of the Singapore Harbour Staff Association the question of whether or not it is

representative of a majority of workers in the Singapore Harbour Board, is more difficult and

clouded by the effect of disorderly administrative practices in the keeping of books, accounts

and other papers, and with inadequate routine of notification of changes, particularly on the

alteration of the Association's rules to include all employees of the Singapore Harbour Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the evidence presented to us there are signs that something like 4,000 workers

were members of one particular union, the Singapore Harbour Board Workers Union, and

that with the addition of members of the Singapore Harbour Board Staff Association, the total figure

would have been somewhere around 7,000. Whether or not the 4,000 members of the Singapore

Harbour Board Workers Union can now be considered as members of the Singapore Harbour Board Workers

Union, from the evidence provided by the Registrar of Trade Unions and his Assistant, and from

the submission of counsel. It is our opinion,therefore, that further evidence should be collected

in the form of a secret ballot by members whose names appear on the membership cards of the Singapore

Harbour Board Workers Union and the Singapore Harbour Board Staff Association. The question to be asked

should be whether or not each one of these men supports the Singapore Harbour Board Staff Association.

The ballot could be easily arranged by the Ministry of Labour in co-operation with the Registrar of Trade

Unions and the Supervisor of Elections."

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the question is in regard to

a suggestion and not a recommendation of the Court of

Inquiry.  This question is under examination  in  the

light of its wide implications.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Can the Hon. Minister for Labour

<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> In this case trade union

organisations  will  have to be consulted  for  their

views,  and as soon as these views have been gathered

by the Labour Department, a decision will be given.

<div align="center"><b>POST OFFICE SAVINGS BANK INTEREST RATE</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increase suggested to match higher Bank Rate and encourage savings



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr William Tan</b> asked the Financial Secretary

whether  in view of the recent increase in  the  bank

rates and in view of the necessity to encourage  more

savings  he will take steps, if necessary by amending

legislation, with the object of raising the  rate  of

interest  payable  on deposits  in  the  Post  Office

Savings Bank.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> Sir, the matter has been considered

but  it  has  been  decided  that  it  would  not  be

appropriate  to change the rate of interest  paid  by

the Post Office Savings Bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.O. Savings Bank does not compete with

commercial banks or borrowers appealing to  investors

in  the stock market. It does not raise or lower  its

rate   of  interest  on  deposits  in  sympathy  with

movements  in the stock exchange. It aims  at  giving

people in the lower income group easy facilities  for

saving  small  amounts in circumstances  of  absolute

security,  and  guarantees a rate of  interest  which

remains  steady and certain over the years and  which

is  reasonable having regard to the security and  the

facilities  afforded by the Bank. In this  connection

it  is perhaps interesting to note that despite booms

and depressions, disasters and victories, the rate of

interest paid by the P.O. Savings Bank in the  United

Kingdom has remained at 2 per cent since 1864;  while

the rate of interest paid by the P.O. Savings Bank in

the  United States of America has remained at  2  per

cent since 1910.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is open to doubt whether the P.O. Savings Bank

could  in  fact  raise the rate of  interest  at  the

present  time even if it were regarded as politic  to

do  so.  As  the hon., Member is no doubt aware;  the

P.O. Savings Bank is intended to be a self-supporting

institution. Its deposits are required by law  to  be

invested   in   trustee   stocks,   which   yield   a

comparatively low rate of interest. Its income



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2653</b></font><br><br>



is   derived   solely   from  interest   from   these

investments.  From  this income,  it  must  meet  its

operating  costs  and  pay the rate  of  interest  on

deposits, which is prescribed by law. It should also,

if  circumstances permit, build up a reserve  against

depreciation  of  investments.  If  its   income   is

insufficient  to meet running expenses and  statutory

interest charges, the deficit must, by law,  be  made

good  by  Government. The financial position  of  the

Bank   at   the  present  time  has  been   examined.

Indications clearly are that if the rate of  interest

were to be now raised to 3 per cent - which would still

be  low compared with the yields obtainable elsewhere

under  stable  and secure investment - the  Bank  would

find  difficulty in meeting its running expenses  and

interest  charges, and the deficit would have  to  be

met  from the general revenue by Government.  Such  a

situation would not, I am sure, be in accordance with

the wishes of the hon. Member.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to sub-question (iv), 14 applications

have  been  rejected but it is likely that  at  least

three of these will be reconsidered if the applicants

adopt suggestions made to them by the Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> The Hon. Minister previously

assured  the Beehoon Association people  of  help.  I

would  like the Minister to inform the House  whether

such application has been considered favourably.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the assurance I gave to

the  House was that I would do my best to see whether

the  Board  would consider favourably the application

of  the  Beehoon  Co-operative Society.  However,  it

would be very impolitic for me to put pressure on the

Board because it is a statutory board, and I think it

is  not to the interests of Singapore that a Minister

should exert pressure on such a Board.  If the  Board

feels that it is not in its interests to grant a loan

to any applicant, then it is at liberty to refuse.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2660</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, regarding this Beehoon cooperative's

application, it has been under consideration and  the

Manager  has met the members of the co-operative  and

given  them  some  advice on how to reorganise  their

factories.   The  problems  are  very  complex.   For

instance,  if  they are to install mechanical  driers

they  will have to acquire land and abandon  squatter

production  methods. It is now up to the  Cooperative

to  satisfy  the  Board that it can  produce  Beehoon

economically and that any loan granted by  the  Board

it will be able to repay.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> On the first part of the

answer,   Sir,   does  it  mean  that  opinions   and

assurances of Ministers are next to useless  and  may

be rejected at will?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the hon. Member has either

completely misunderstood my assurance when I gave  it

or  is  trying  to  take  a  different  meaning.  The

assurance I gave was that I would try and see if  the

Board   would   give   the   application   favourable

consideration. That is all. I cannot - I  stated  that

when  I  moved  the Second Reading of the  Industrial

Promotion Board Bill - put pressure on the Board,  and

I will not do it - even if I am in a position to do so;

I will not do it.

<br><br>10.32 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I have a statement to make  on  local

government  elections. I think hon. Members  of  this

House  will  be interested to know what progress  has

been made towards holding local government elections.

According  to the envisaged programme, the  intention

is  to  hold elections to the City Council under  the

Local  Government  Elections Ordinance  on  Saturday,

21st   December.  As  you  are  aware,   claims   and

objections



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2661</b></font><br><br>



have  already been heard and it is expected that  the

electoral  registers, as amended and certified,  will

be  available to the public before the  end  of  this

month. All the other administrative arrangements  for

the  elections, such as the delimitation  of  polling

districts  and the selection of polling stations,  is

well  advanced, and this information will be gazetted

shortly. The issue of the writ of elections will take

place  on  1st November, specifying 18th November  as

nomination  day.  As  the life of  the  present  City

Council expires on 7th December, it will be necessary

to  extend its life to cover the interregnum  period.

To this end, new legislation is now under preparation

and  will come before this House at its next sitting.

The purpose of this legislation is simply to validate

all  business conducted between 7th December and  the

holding of new elections on 21st December.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards elections to the three rural District

Councils, it is envisaged that this will be  possible

about  April/May  next year. Already,  the  electoral

divisional  boundaries  drawn  up  by  the   official

Committee   have  been  referred  to  the   All-Party

Committee  and Government has adopted two amendments,

which   were   suggested  by  that   Committee.   The

boundaries   will   shortly  be  gazetted   and   the

preparation of the registers has already started.  It

will  then  be  possible to proceed with  claims  and

objections  and with the other legal requirements  in

the same way as for the City Council. A more detailed

programme   will   be  announced  later.   Meanwhile,

administrative   arrangements  to   establish   rural

District Councils are under way.

Assignee to continue proceedings commenced under  the

former  Workmen's Compensation Ordinance,  which  was

repealed  by  the  Workmen's Compensation  Ordinance,

1954.  The  repeal of the former Ordinance  does  not

affect proceedings instituted under it, or any right,

continued as though the repealing Ordinance  had  not

been passed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner for Workmen's Compensation

appointed  under  the  now  repealed  Ordinance   was

appointed  by  name  and not by office.  He  has  now

retired from the Government service and, it not being

possible  to make any further appointment  under  the

now  repealed Ordinance, it is necessary to make some

other  provision for the continuation of  proceedings

under that Ordinance. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2663</b></font><br><br>

to  have  all  the  powers of  the  Commissioner  for

Workmen's Compensation under the repealed Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

would like the Hon. the Financial Secretary to tell

us after the expenditure of such a great sum of money

what benefit has been derived from it - whether

Singapore has increased its acreage under cultivation

or has benefited in any other way by this

expenditure.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Sir, the benefits of such agricultural

shows  or trade exhibitions are not apparent  visibly

and  at once. They are long-term benefits which arise

as  a  result of people visiting these places, seeing

things - manufactures and produce - which they  have  not

seen  before,  and being attracted by the  way  these

things  are  manufactured or produced; and  therefore

the benefit is one which is derived slowly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Considering the small acreage

available for agriculture, then how much benefit  can

the  Hon.  Minister  predict that  we  will  have  of

manufacture deriving from such?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, as the Hon. the Minister

for Local Government, Lands and Housing just now said

in  reply, I am no prophet, but the hon. Member  must

remember  that it was not only agricultural  products

that  were  put  up  for  show  at  the  Agricultural

Exhibition  but there were also cows, pigs,  poultry,

fish  and  other things, and the hon.  Member,  I  am

sure,   is   well   aware  that  the  Government   is

concentrating  now on increasing livestock  breeding,

pig-breeding, poultry rearing and so on, rather  than

on  agriculture because, the island being of  such  a

small  size, we cannot have much agriculture  in  the

real sense of the word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $13,805 for Head 32 ordered to stand

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, could the

Hon. the Financial Secretary explain to us what these

legends mean? - "P.E.". "O.C.A.R." and "O.C.S.E." - who

were going to be the great "banana" colonels in this

coupon-distributing spree,



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> As I understand it, Sir, the first

question of the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar is what

the  capital letters refer to. I should have  thought

that   after  three  years'  consideration   of   the

Estimates  and  the  messages, which  come  up  every

month,  he  will  know that these refer  to  Personal

Emoluments,  Other  Charges  Annually  Recurrent  and

Other Charges Special Expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understood him to ask also who the people were who

operated  this  particular scheme. As  far  as  I  am

aware,   Sir,  they  had  no  rank - they  were  merely

ordinary Government officials who were recruited  for

these posts because they fortunately had had previous

experience of operating a petrol-rationing scheme and

therefore were qualified to organise and control this

department,   and   to   make   all   the   necessary

arrangements for a petrol-rationing scheme. These two

officers were in Division I; the rest of the officers

in  the  temporary department were clerical officers,

typists and two inspectors.



<br><br>10.45 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I do not want to anticipate the

item appearing in Paper No. Cmd. 42 of 1957 but could

we  be  enlightened  as to why this  expense  of  the

petrol  rationing  office has  been  split  into  two

halves, one in No. Cmd. 41 and the other in No.  Cmd.

42 when they apparently refer to the same office?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It would be convenient for hon.

Members if both items could be discussed now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The petrol rationing office was set up in

November,  1956 when the Suez crisis  broke  out  and

when  we considered that there was a possibility that

our  petrol supplies might be interrupted. A  certain

amount  of  expenditure  was  incurred  in  1956.  It

totalled - as can be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2666</b></font><br><br>



seen  from  the application for supplementary  vote - a

little over $13,000. This, was incurred in 1956  and,

under our regulations, must be brought to account  in

the 1956 accounts. The balance of the expenditure was

incurred in running the office until it was closed on

30th  June, 1957. This amounted - speaking from memory,

Sir - to, I think, $34,000-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can the Hon. the Financial Secretary

please  quote  the  item, number  and  the  relevant

paper?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir. The paper is No.

Cmd. 42 of 1957 and the item is 207 - Head 40 Supplies,

New Subhead, Expenses of the Petrol Rationing Office.

The  office  continued in existence until 30th  June,

1957  and the expenditure incurred in 1957 is charged

to the 1957 accounts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Arising out of the estimate in

paper No. Cmd. 42 of 1957, it says in the explanatory

note:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Petrol Rationing Office, which was

established  in  November 1956,  continued  in  being

until  June 1957, when it was decided that there  was

no longer any likelihood that petrol would have to be

rationed."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it did not appear to the Singapore Government

that  petrol would not have to be rationed until June

1957.  Now,  Mr  Chairman, as  I  remember  it,  the

British  Government announced that it was  abolishing

petrol rationing in April 1957. Why did the Singapore

Government take another two months to decide that  it

was no longer likely?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Subject to correction, Sir, I think petrol

rationing  was  removed in May,  not  April,  in  the

United Kingdom.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Well, why June then in Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> It was not until the end of May that the

Prime  Minister  in  the United Kingdom  stated  that

British  tankers would use the Canal. The office  had

been  in  existence since the middle of November.  We

had  progressively run down our staff throughout that

period  until, at the end, in June, there  were  only

two   or  three  people  still  employed.  They  were

employed in tying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2667</b></font><br><br>



up  the  loose  strings of a petrol rationing  scheme

which  could be pigeon-holed and introduced at  short

notice at any given time.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Perhaps, Sir, I can enlighten

the hon. Member further on this. In January, we had a

staff of a petrol rationing officer, a deputy petrol-rationing officer, a chief clerk, a financial  clerk,

14  clerks  and  two  office boys.  In  February,  we

discharged the chief clerk, the financial clerk, nine

clerks  and one office boy, so that we had  cut  down

the  staff by about two-thirds. In March, the petrol-rationing officer's services were terminated, so that

the staff from March onwards was only very small.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $13,138 for Head 41 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 57 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $2,567 for Head 57 stands part of

the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, we do not get much

joy out of twisting the Government's tail - it has been

twisted out of joint so often now that one is alarmed

that it might be twisted out of place altogether! But

it does seem strange to me that the sum of $2,567 was

inadvertently  posted  and not corrected  before  the

accounts were closed. And what seems even stranger is

that  now it is corrected we are supposed to pay  out

$2,567. I should have thought that, as this was  just

a posting error, one could so juggle the posting that

we  do  not have to pay anything. Why is it  that  we

have to pay $2,567 because of inadvertent posting?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> First, Sir, as regards the inadvertence,

the   Permanent   Secretary  to   the   Ministry   of

Communications  and Works went on leave  and  it  was

agreed that his post should be filled temporarily  by

an  officer in the Chief Secretary's Office,  and  it

was  agreed  at  the time that that officer's  salary

would  continue  to  be  paid from  the  Head  "Chief

Secretary". Inadvertently, this salary was debited to

the vote in the Ministry of Communications and Works,

with the result that it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2668</b></font><br><br>



was  over-expended. Now, this was not realised at the

time.  When  the accounts have been closed,  we  find

that  expenditure  has exceeded the voted  provision.

This has often happened in the past. Votes have often

been  exceeded, perhaps because bills from the  Crown

Agents  have  been posted late or for other  reasons,

and  we  have not had an opportunity to come  to  the

Assembly  before the accounts were closed  to  obtain

funds  to balance the account. All we are seeking  to

do  now  is  to  obtain a small vote to balance  this

particular  account. There were of course savings  on

the  Chief  Secretary's vote owing to the inadvertent

posting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $2,567 for Head 57 ordered to stand part

of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $30,310 for the Heads of Expenditure and

for the services specified in the Schedule ordered to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly resolves that the sum of

$30,310 shall be supplied to the Government under the

<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir, I

have His Excellency the Governor's authority to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of

$2,115,572 shall be supplied to the Government  under

the   heads  of  expenditure  and  for  the  services

specified  in  the  Schedule contained  in  Sessional

Paper No. Cmd. 42 of 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this message seeks supplementary provision

amounting to "735,012 under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2669</b></font><br><br>



Heads  in the ordinary estimates and $2,022,200 under

Heads  in  the development estimates. Offset  savings

amounting  to $141,640 in the ordinary estimates  and

$500,000 in development estimates are available,  and

the  net  amount of new money required  is  therefore

$2,115,572. Full explanations as to the need for  the

funds  requested  are given in the message  and  this

little item adds to these explanations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with this substantial message at this time of

the  year,  hon. Members will no doubt be anxious  to

know   something   about   the   financial   position

generally.  It will be recalled that in  November  of

last  year, it was stated that despite the  estimated

deficit   of   $18,000,000,   revenue   and    actual

expenditure would in all probability balance in 1957.

That,  Sir, I am happy to say, is likely  to  be  the

case,  based  on  returns,  which  I  have  to  date.

Ignoring   payments   of   compensation   under   the

Malayanisation  scheme (these are, I  think,  a  fair

charge  against accumulated reserves since they  will

be  covered  in due course by savings on expatriation

pay   and  passages),  but  taking  account  of   the

expenditure  arising or are likely to arise  in  1957

from  the  messages now before the Assembly,  it  now

seems  likely  that  revenue  and  expenditure   will

balance at about $234,000,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the development estimates, it is

clear  that expenditure will fall considerably  below

the estimate. These matters will, of course, Sir,  be

dealt  with in greater detail in connection with  the

Budget on 20th November.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point, Sir, which I would like to

mention before I close, and that is that I propose to

withdraw  item  218  on page 9 of the  message.  That

deals  with  the item "Subhead 14, item (2) -  Kandang

Kerbau Maternity Hospital" under Head D49 Medical and

Health.  I take it, Sir, that the proper time  to  do

that  will  be  when the Schedule  is  considered  in

Committee stage. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Mr Tan Theng Chiang): Sir, I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion accordingly committed to

the year."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is already 16th October and there are slightly

under  two  and  a  half months left.  The  vote  was

originally  for $100,000 for the whole  of  the  year

1957.  Can the government let us into this big secret

as to what great jaunt is planned in these two and  a

half months that is gongs to cost $105,300?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The anticipated expenditure, as stated in

The  explanation,  is  in connection  with  the  Port

Commission which has just finished its deliberations.

It  is  estimated  that that will cost  $70,000.  The

bills have not yet come in. And it is estimated  that

Singapore's  share  of  the cost  of  the  University

Commission  will  come to close on $20,000,  and  for

that   also,  bills  have  not  yet  come  in.   That

represents close on $90,000 of the $100,000.

$20,000  to make $90,000. There is a vote originally,

of  $100,000, so there is still a balance of $10,000.

What  is  this $105,300 for? What is it being planned

for in these two and a half months?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> We also have to make provision for the

estimated  expenditure on a possible visit  from  the

Transport  Commissioner who may come to this  country

during the last two months of the year. We also  have

to  make  allowance for the payment of the allowances

and  expenses of the Colombo Plan expert who is  here

at  the present time - the Colombo Plan expert who  is

training  members of the Royal Singapore Flying  Club

in   the  Chipmunk  aircraft,  which  has  been  made

available  by the Government of India. We  also  have

made a small provision for unexpected contingencies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, I was always under

the  impression that Colombo Plan experts go all over

South   East   Asia  giving  free  help,  assistance,

guidance and so on. Are we to understand that in fact

we are paying for this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, Colombo Plan assistance is not

altogether free. The Colombo Plan authorities do  pay

a very large proportion of the expenditure but we are

required to pay local subsistence allowances.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> As a matter of interest, Mr

considerable time instructing people in Singapore  to

fly  the Chipmunk aircraft which has been lent to  us

by  the  Government of India under the Colombo  Plan,

and  this  extra provision which I refer  to  is  the

extra  sum  required to complete the payment  of  his

allowances this year.

expert  came from who is causing all this unnecessary

expenditure to the Flying Club?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> I am not conceding that the

expenditure is unnecessary. He is an Indian  officer,

Capt.  Bhargava,  who is lent to  us  by  the  Indian

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $105,300 for Head 23 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 28 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $272,000 for Head 28 stand part of

the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, this is something more light,

more adventurous, this question of the speedboats.  I

have been reading from time to time, Mr Chairman, of

how  the Customs have been outrun in many a creek  in

Singapore.  Now we are informed that for the  sum  of

$42,000  we  are  going to have four speedboat  hulls

with  outboard engines. And amongst the other  things

that  these  four  speedboats  are  supposed  to  do,

besides out-running smugglers or potential smugglers,

is  to  give  protection to the crews -  "sufficiently

strong  to afford protection to the crews". Sir,  can

we  be  informed  whether  this  means  amour-plating

speedboats?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> There is no question of armour-plating,

Sir.  The provision covers the construction  of  four

hulls which will cost approximately $3,000 each.  The

balance of the provision is required for the purchase

of  nine  outboard motors, leaving  an  allowance  of

$3,000 as a balance against contingencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word "protection" is used because, generally

speaking,  these speedboat hulls are of comparatively

flimsy  construction and smugglers have in  the  past

shown a tendency to turn quickly on their tracks  and

try  and ram the  Customs launches; and we feel  that

if we can construct a hull which is rather



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2673</b></font><br><br>



stronger  perhaps  than the ordinary  outboard  motor

hull,  we'  will give the Customs officers  in  these

boats  a  certain amount of protection. I think  that

everything  we can do to assist the Customs  officers

in  their  difficult task of preventing smuggling  we

should  do.  It is not really a matter for flippancy.

They  do  require every possible assistance which  we

can give consistent with efficiency and economy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, $3,000 per hull times four

for  four hulls is $12,000. I think I am right.  That

leaves a balance of $30,000. Can we be told how  many

engine  sets  or  how many outboard  motors  that  is

supposed to purchase?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, I have already said that we will be

purchasing nine outboard motors at a cost of $3,000 a

piece,  making  $27,000, and that we  are  keeping  a

reserve of $3,000 for contingencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $272,000 for Head 28 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 31 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $50,000 for Head 31 stand part of

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, can the Hon.

Minister  for Commerce and Industry inform the  House

as  to  the  size of the membership of this Singapore

Agricultural  Co-operative Union, and the  number  of

animals that will be benefited by such a scheme?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the first part of the

question  is  understandable but the second  part  is

rather curious. The idea of any Government assistance

is  to benefit human beings and not animals unless it

is the $5,000 given to the Society for the Prevention

of Cruelty to Animals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agricultural Co-operative Union has got six

rural   Chinese   co-operative   societies   as   its

affiliates and if the hon. Member wants to know their

names,   they  are  the  Potong  Pasir  Agricultural

Production  and Marketing Co-operative  Society,  the

Changi  Jalan Tiga Ratus Agricultural Production  and

Marketing Co-operative Society, Ltd., the Ama

Society (unlimited), and the Hup Ho Agricultural  Co-operative Society (unlimited).



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, I am afraid that

the  Minister has not answered my question.  I  would

like  to  know  the membership - how many  members  are

there in these co-operatives, and what is the size of

the farms. What we are interested in is how much they

can  produce or how much they can help to produce for

the benefit of humans.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I am afraid, Sir, that offhand I

cannot  give the exact number of members of  each  of

these component co-operative societies - the components

of  the  Union, but I suppose there must be  quite  a

large  membership.  The size of the  holdings  varies

with each individual farmer. As the hon. Member knows

full  well,  we  are short of land in  Singapore  and

therefore no farmer holds a big acreage of land.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> I seek

clarification, Sir. Towards the end of the  paragraph

it  reads  "after  two years". Do I  understand  that

after  the period of two years the whole lump sum  of

$50,000 is to be paid back to the Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, Sir. According to the plan

that  is  envisaged for the working of the purchasing

system,   the  Co-operative  Union  will  be   making

sufficient  profit  for it to be able  to  repay  the

Government the loan after two years, but of course if

unforeseen circumstances arise which prevent the loan

being repaid after two years, perhaps Government will

reconsider extension.

have been made to me by hon. Members on both sides of

the  House  that  the cost of these particular  flats

might conceivably be reduced. In these circumstances,

I  wish to investigate the matter to see whether that

is indeed possible.

settle their amendments with the Clerk beforehand.

<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir, I

have His Excellency the Governor's authority to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of $4,400 shall be supplied to the Government under the heads

of  expenditure  and  for the services  specified  in

Schedule C contained in Sessional Paper No.  Cmd.  43

of 1957.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2679</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this motion, by asking for token votes under 53

heads  of  the Estimates and small sums  under  three

heads  of the Estimates, seeks authority to implement

the revision and rationalisation of salary scales  in

Division  IV  of  the public service which  has  been

agreed  after protracted negotiations with the Unions

representing  the officers who will be benefited.  As

will  be  seen, Sir, from Schedule A of the Sessional

paper,  the task of revision and rationalisation  has

been  a  monumental  one and it  says  much  for  the

ability and good sense of all concerned that  it  has

been completed so successfully. Some idea of what the

task  has involved and of the success which has  come

of  it  will be gained from the fact that 55 existing

salary  scales  have been reduced to  12  key  salary

scales plus five variations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that the command paper and the schedules

give  a  clear  picture of what  has  been  done.  In

Schedule A the 17 new scales are shown in the  right-hand column by means of the Roman numeral IV plus one

or  more  letters  of  the alphabet.  Comparisons  of

columns one and two will give a clear picture of  how

existing posts and grades have been absorbed into new

main classifications. Pensionable posts are shown  in

capital  letters, non-pensionable posts are shown  in

italics. Schedule B gives a list of posts which  have

been  upgraded.  Schedule C is  the  usual  financial

summary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, one point which I should mention

and  which  has inadvertently been omitted  from  the

command



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2680</b></font><br><br>



paper. That refers to the pay of juveniles, that  is,

officers  under  18  years  of  age,  who  have  been

appointed after 1st March, 1957. These officers  will

be  paid  salaries as follows: if they are  below  16

years  of age, they will be paid 70 per cent  of  the

minimum  basic salary of the grade to which they  are

appointed, rounded off to the nearest dollar; if they

are  over 16 but under 17 years of age, they will  be

paid 80 per cent of that salary; and if they are over

17  but  below 18 years of age, they will be paid  90

per  cent of that salary. They will, however, receive

variable and other allowances at full adult rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this revision of Division IV salaries was the

last  major  revision of salaries in  the  Government

service,  and  I  am sure that hon. Members  will  be

happy  that  this has been brought to a  satisfactory

and agreed solution. Sir, I beg to move.

interest  at  the rate of 5 per cent  per  annum  and

repayable  at  par on the 1st day of  May,  1976,  or

prior thereto at the City Council's option at par  on

any half-yearly interest date on or after the 1st day

of  May, 1966, upon six calendar months' notice being

given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will recall that in March 1956 the Assembly

authorised the City Council to issue debenture  stock

not  exceeding $30,000,000 for the further  essential

expansion   of   its  electricity,  gas   and   water

undertakings. The rate of interest approved was 5 per

cent  and the stock was subject to redemption at  the

discretion  of the City Council at any  time  between

1966  and  1976 on due notice being given. The  issue

was  intended to be a conversion issue in so  far  as

the  City Council had decided to redeem the Singapore

Municipal  5 per cent Debenture Stock 1926 and  hoped

that  a  substantial number of the  holders  of  that

stock would convert into the new stock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new issue was favourably received by the

investing   public.   The  Central   Provident   Fund

supported it generously and by April of this year the

full  amount of the issue had been taken up. The City

Council,  however, was still in urgent need of  funds

for its public utility undertakings, and, rather than

float  a  new loan, it was decided to seek permission

to   raise  the  ceiling  of  the  existing  loan  to

$50,000,000. This was the subject of a motion to  the

Assembly  in April of this year when it was  resolved

that the authorised amount of the 1956 loan would  be

increased to $50,000,000. Subscriptions continued  to

be  made  to  the  loan  for  some  time  after  this

resolution, was passed. By the middle of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2686</b></font><br><br>



the year, however, the downward movement in the value

of  gilt-edged  securities had become marked,  yields

had  increased, and a 5 per cent loan at par  had  no

longer  many attractions for investors. The  position

at  the beginning of September was that subscriptions

had  ceased  to  come in and a total  of  $13,000,000

remained unsubscribe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need of the City Council for funds to meet

impending bills, however, remained urgent. The matter

was  discussed with the City Council authorities  and

it was decided that in all the circumstances existing

at  the present time, it would be wiser to issue  the

balance  of  the  existing loan at a discount  rather

than float a new loan at a higher rate of interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter has also been discussed with the

authorities of the Central Provident Fund, which,  as

you  know,  is the main source of investment  capital

available to Government and the City Council  at  the

present  time.  The Board has agreed to  support  the

issue of the balance of the existing 5 per cent  loan

if  the issue price is reduced to allow a discount of

10  per  cent. This discount gives a yield of 5?  per

cent  to  redemption and is in line with the  present

yield on similarly dated stock in the United Kingdom.

Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>11.41 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, in this Assembly on 29th July, in the debate  in

Committee  on  the Local Government  Bill,  the  hon.

Member  for  Tanglin  moved  an  amendment  which   I

opposed, and which amendment was to the, effect  that

loans  raised  by the City Council should  be  funded

over  the  life of the physical assets to which  they

related  and not the period from issue to redemption.

Now, Sir, the House had been in committee on the Bill

for  several  days  and, I suspect,  the  Press  were

getting  rather bored with the debate. Certainly  the

Press



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2687</b></font><br><br>



Gallery  was pretty empty and the Public Gallery  was

quite empty, and I am sure that the star reporters of

the  various newspapers were absent at that time. But

be  that  as it may, I was reported at that  time  as

saying  that  there was a feeling  that  the  Malayan

dollar  was slipping. Now, in point of fact,  Sir,  I

made   no   reference  whatsoever  to   depreciation,

supposed  or  otherwise, of the  Malayan  dollar;  at

least  not specifically. I am, Sir, a member  of  the

Currency  Board  and  I  know something  about  these

things.  But  in  any case as a  banker  I  am  fully

conversant  with the Currency Ordinance  and  I  know

that the Malayan dollar, the Straits dollar, is fully

backed  by  sterling  and is at least  as  strong  as

sterling. Besides, I repeatedly told this House on  a

previous occasion that the only currencies to survive

the  Japanese holocaust were the Straits  dollar  and

the  Hongkong dollar, because they had 100  per  cent

backing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, what I was drawing attention to was at

that  time  the universal depreciation of Currencies,

to  creeping inflation with its inevitable commitment

of  world-wide  reluctance to  invest  in  gilt-edged

securities,  that is government and municipal  bonds,

or  indeed  in  any  other  type  of  fixed  interest

securities.  The position of course is exactly  as  I

stated  it  was and there has been no change  in  the

interim.  On the contrary, there has been  a  further

slump  in  gilt-edged markets in  the  sterling  area

following  the  counter-inflationary measure  by  the

Bank  of England in raising the Bank Rate by two  per

cent  to  seven per cent per annum. Now, Sir, whether

or  no  such  action is an effective  weapon  in  the

battle against inflation is a matter of opinion.  The

relevance  of  all this, Sir, is this:  that  however

unpalatable it may be to local investors who may have

purchased  this stock fairly recently  and  now  find

that it is offered at a greater discount, the fact is

that  the  present  decision is  both  necessary  and

inevitable. These are facts which intelligent  people

must fully realise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be those who feel that we should ignore

economic changes in other parts of the sterling area,

but as long



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2688</b></font><br><br>



as  the  existing fiscal and economic links  continue

with  the  United  Kingdom,  we  cannot  successfully

maintain  any attitude of economic isolation.  It  is

doubtful  if  we  could. Even  if  this  island  were

completely  and utterly independent, we should  still

be  faced  with  the same position, as its  existence

depends  on  the  free and unrestricted  movement  of

money  and that presupposes an approximate parity  of

interest and discount rates with those in the  United

Kingdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Council wants this money. The City Council

must  therefore  offer  the public  an  adequate  and

contemporary return on their money. It is  as  simple

as that. Sir, I support the motion.

Singapore,  fixed by the Singapore Improvement  Trust

under  subsection (1) of section 22 of the  Singapore

1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this rate cannot, by law, exceed 5 per cent on

property within the City area. Hitherto the rate  has

always  been two per cent and the Trustees  recommend

no  change in the rate for 1958. The approval of  the

Assembly  is again required for this rate  under  the

Singapore Improvement Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rate, which is in lieu of the improvement rate

referred to in section 59 of the Municipal Ordinance,

is  collected by the City Council and paid over half-yearly  to  the  Trust. The monies  from  this  rate,

together  with an equivalent Government  contribution

under   section  23  of  the  Singapore   Improvement

Ordinance, are estimated at $3,150,000 and  form  one

of  the  major items of revenue of the Trust and  are

paid  into  the  Improvement Fund. These  monies  are

spent  on  improvement  schemes,  the  re-housing  of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore port rules were last reviewed in

1936 and since then many amendments have been made to

meet  changing  conditions. The need for  a  complete

revision   of  the  existing  rules  has  long   been

Immigration,  Customs,  Port  Health,  Fisheries  and

It will thus be seen that the new rules represent the

agreed views of all parties concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of the existing rules have been

modified  and  a few new rules have been  introduced.

The  existing  rules dealing with  the  licensing  of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members will recall that on six previous

occasions  this  Ordinance has  come  up  before  the

Legislature  and  its continuance has  been  extended

each  time  by  a period of one year. My  motion  now

seeks to extend the continuance of the Ordinance  for

a  further  period of one year as from 8th  December,

1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Ordinance gives the Minister powers to make

orders  prohibiting the import and export  of  goods.

However, in keeping with our tree trade policy, these

powers  are used very sparingly as hon. Members  know

very  well,  and  except for a  comparatively  narrow

field,  most  imports are placed on the open  general

licence  and exports are freely licensed. The  powers

of  control,  however,  can be useful  in  regulating

imports  for balance of payments reasons,  especially

from  the  hard  currency areas, but here  again  all

essential,   and  many  semi-essential,   goods   are

licensed  freely. These powers also provide a  useful

check   for   the  purpose  of  disease  control   in

connection with imports of plants, animals and  meat.

In  the export field, the powers under this Ordinance

are  used  to  keep a check on exports  of  strategic

materials  and  essential items in  short  supply  in

Singapore.  At present controls on exports  are  very

few  in  number.  It is, however, necessary  for  the

Minister to have such powers of control and the Trade

Advisory  Council has been consulted  and  it  agrees

with this view. Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly takes note that the Government

of  Singapore, in conjunction with the Government  of

the  Federation  of Malaya, proposes to  conclude  an

agreement, in terms as set out in Sessional Paper No.

Cmd.  44  of  1957, with Malayan Airways  Limited,  a

company  to  be  reconstituted as  a  public  limited

liability  company registered in Singapore,  for  the

maintenance and continued efficient operation of  air

services  within  and  between  the  territories   of

Malaya,  Singapore and Northern Borneo; and  approves

the purchase by the Government of Singapore, from the

surplus funds of the Colony, of a proportion  to  the

value  of  $500,000,  of the  share  capital  of  the

Company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with a feeling of happy relief, Mr Speaker,

that  I  have arrived at this motion in the Assembly.

It  fulfils  my  promise given  last  July  that  the

Assembly  should  have  an  opportunity  of  debating

matters  connected  with  this  agreement.  It   also

concludes  a most exacting and exhaustive  period  of

work.  The  first  file on this  was  opened  at  the

beginning  of 1954 and since the middle  of  1955  we

have  been  in frequent and continuous study  of  the

problems  involved in this agreement and in the  very

lengthy  discussions  which have  been  necessary  in

order to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2693</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement as tabled is substantially final and

correctly  represents  the joint  intentions  of  the

Governments  of  the  Federation  of  Malaya  and  of

Singapore.   It   is   still  subject   to   drafting

amendments.   I  would  have  wished  to   give   the

opportunity to the House for a longer period to study

before  this  debate,  but  last  Saturday  was   the

earliest possible date for tabling and today  is  the

latest  practicable day for taking the debate  if  we

are  to  complete all the necessary matters connected

with  the  agreement  before  the  end  of  the  last

extension  of  the agreement. And  I  must  ask  hon.

Members  to note that we cannot accept any amendments

to  the terms of the agreement. The Government has  a

constitutional  responsibility  for  negotiating  and

signing agreements of this sort. We cannot shirk that

responsibility or shove it off on to the House  as  a

whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not, however, expect any amendment to be

moved.  The  agreement is a sound one. It  reconciles

the  divergent  interests of  all  concerned  and  it

undoubtedly  serves all concerned  in  the  best  way

possible in the practical circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also ask Members of the House, Sir, to note

that  this agreement covers only a part of the future

operations  of Malayan Airways. There is  with  us  a

complementary agreement which will be signed  between

the  three  Borneo territories of the  one  part  and

Malayan   Airways  of  the  other  part.  These   two

agreements  are  fully  interlocking,  complementary,

interdependent,  and they will together  provide  the

firm  basis on which Malayan Airways will be able  to

operate aviation services throughout the whole Malaya-Borneo area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This agreement is particularly satisfactory, Mr

Speaker, because it is an example of international co-operation on the best social principles. We have  all

been saddened no doubt in recent years by the unhappy

spectacle  of nations selfishly and greedily  seeking

what they consider to be their national interests  at

the expense of other nations. That selfish and greedy

conduct of nations has in the past plunged the  world

into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2694</b></font><br><br>



the  tragic futility of war and may do so again  with

horrible  results for us all. Here we have a reversal

of  that  unhappy situation. We have five territories

coming  together and making an agreement which  fully

embodies the principle that the good of each is  best

served to the mutual good of all. It is a most  happy

augury  that the Government of the Federation should,

at the outset of its period of independence, have so

fully  accepted  and carried out this principle;  and

that  Singapore, with self-government in hand, should

have  gone  along  as well. It is a model  which  the

greater Powers of the world might very well follow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From our Singapore point of view, this agreement

matches  our historic function and duty  of  being  a

centre  of communications and services for this  part

of  the  world, and indeed for the whole  world.  The

five  territories  concerned will  all  benefit  from

having  a strong, economically sound airline  linking

them   efficiently.  They  will  derive  far  greater

benefits from that than they could have derived  from

any policy of isolationism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will deal briefly with the economic aspects of

the  agreement when I come to the end of  my  motion,

Sir.  But  I  would  point out here  that  for  sound

investment the scale of operations of an airline must

match  the  capital invested. If you  have  airplanes

idle  on  the  ground when they could  be  fruitfully

carrying passengers and freight in the air,  you  are

suffering  a dead loss; and there is every hope  that

under  this  agreement  the scale  of  operations  of

Malayan  Airways will be such as to match  the  fixed

capital   employed,  because  we  have   these   five

territories working in real partnership together with

Malayan Airways as their common servants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I should like to pay a high tribute to the Hon.

Mr  Ong  Yoke  Lin,  who at the time  of  the  major

negotiations  of this agreement was the Minister  for

Transport  in the Federation. His negotiating  skill,

his  grasp of principle, his statesmanlike leadership

played a vital part in securing the general adherence

of  all  concerned to this agreement. We  owe  him  a

great debt.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2695</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think, Mr Speaker, I need go through this

agreement clause by clause. If there is any clause  I

do  not refer to which hon. Members would like me  to

explain,  I  shall be glad to do so in reply;  but  I

think  I  ought to draw attention to a few  clauses,

particularly number 8. Number 8 bears the  appearance

of  a  subsidy  clause but, as far  as  Singapore  is

concerned, it is an appearance rather than a reality.

By  international custom, international  flights  get

their  aviation spirit free of tax and, consequently,

Malayan  Airways  will, under  this  clause,  receive

nothing   more  than  all  other  operators   through

Singapore  also  receive. Similarly, as  regards  the

freedom  from duties on spare parts and  engines  and

that  kind  of thing, Singapore is of course  a  free

port  so  that, as far as Singapore goes, this  is  a

dead-letter clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next clause - of very great importance - is clause

number  15. It deserves the closest attention of  the

House.  In  clause  15  (1) we provide  that  Malayan

Airways  shall have exclusive rights on the  services

in the First Schedule and on additions thereto during

seven years, that is the first seven years of the 10-year franchise. And in 15 (2) we provide that Malayan

Airways shall, for the remainder of the term  of  the

agreement,  a  further three years,  be  entitled  to

operate  all  the services which it was operating  at

the end of the first seven years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simultaneously, the Federation and Borneo safeguard

their  special interests by making provision for  the

possible  sharing  of  additional  services   between

Malayan  Airways and Borneo Airways for  Borneo,  and

between  Malayan  Airways and an airline  for  Malaya

during the last three years of the agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clause, in short, provides transitional

possibilities if some transition is necessary  during

the  latter years of the franchise. It is a difficult

clause to summarise and indeed a difficult clause  to

understand.   It   involves   both   the    technical

complexities   of   the   law   and   the   technical

complexities  of  civil aviation  practice,  and  the

combination of all these complexities produces a sort



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2696</b></font><br><br>



of  verbal algebra which personally takes me a  great

deal  of time to make sense of. If hon. Members  want

me  to make it clear no doubt they will say so and  I

will  try to clear up their minds in my reply to  the

debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clause does illustrate the difficulty of

putting  into  readily  comprehensible  and  not  too

unwieldy   language  an  agreement   which   concerns

different  territories with to some extent  different

special  needs. We had envisaged the  writing  of  an

agreement  which  would have  covered  all  the  five

territories of Malaya and Borneo on the one part  and

the  Malayan Airways on the other part, but  when  we

came to writing it down it became completely unwieldy

and  it  was decided that there should be a  separate

Borneo agreement which would be complementary,  as  I

have already stated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for clause 15. Clause 16 is just worth a

mention, Mr Speaker. It links up with clause  5  and

it  provides  the basis for a potential expansion  of

Malayan Airways on to new overseas routes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we can pass to clause 18, I think, Mr Speaker,

and  this  is  one to which the House will  assuredly

give  very close attention. We are all agreed,  I  am

sure,  on  the essential need that our local citizens

should  be  able  both to qualify themselves  and  to

exercise   their  qualifications  in   positions   of

responsibility and authority and leadership; in short

that  Malayan Airways should be truly Malayan as well

as  fully  efficient;  and this clause  provides  the

means  to attain that objective. Careful thought  and

planning  will be necessary in this connection  since

at   present  the  local  staff,  excluding  the  air

hostesses, form a little under 25 per cent of the air

crews and a little under 50 per cent of the qualified

engineers. There will inevitably be a period of years

during  which  expatriate staff must be  retained  in

employment. I do not propose to prejudice the work of

the  new Malayan Airways Board, nor of our Government

directors on the Board, by a discussion of details or

by  acrimonious  references to past history.  I  have

full confidence that the new Malayan Airways will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2697</b></font><br><br>



wise  and  just  and practical in dealing  with  both

local  and expatriate staff. If at present any member

of Malayan Airways' staff has feelings of doubt as to

his  future, I am sure that those doubts will  vanish

as   the  new  Malayan  Airways  Board  develops  its

policies.  In this connection the close  links  which

will  henceforth  exist between our airline  and  two

great  international airlines offer marked advantages

in staffing matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 will also no doubt receive the close

attention  of  hon. Members. Nothing  is  of  greater

importance to Singapore than that the development  of

our   economy  should  not  be  obstructed  by  trade

disputes.  This clause provides for conciliation  and

discussion  by  which, properly used, trade  disputes

can be avoided, and I have full confidence again that

in  this  matter  the Board will act  with  practical

wisdom for the good of all concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members will no doubt particularly welcome  19

(c) which envisages that the staff organisations will

not  concern  themselves solely with their  terms  of

employment  and  conditions of employment,  but  will

also play their part in matters of the efficiency  of

the  services  which  they help to  provide  for  the

general good of the five territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to both these clauses, hon. Members will,

I  am  sure,  bear  in mind that there  will  be  two

Government directors on the Board and that they  will

be  well  able  to  represent the best  interests  of

Singapore  and  of  the  Federation,  and  of   their

citizens, in all matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 remains for a brief mention, Mr Speaker.

It   is  important  because  it  enshrines  the  very

valuable principle of continuing co-operation between

the  two  Malayan  Governments.  Co-operation  is   a

practical matter of great importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need deal further now with the

agreement but it does remain for me to deal with  the

question of the Government's purchase of part of  the

share capital of Malayan Airways.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration of motion resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have done my best

to  deal  with  the major points in the agreement.  I

must  now deal with the last part of my motion  which

concerns the investment of $500,000 from the  surplus

funds   of  Singapore  in  the  reconstructed  public

Malayan Airways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I had better start by giving a simple

account of what is actually going to happen over  the

capital of Malayan Airways. The existing issued share

capital  amounts to $2� million made up  of  250,000

shares  of  $10 each. 550,000 new shares  are  to  be

issued,  thus making a total capital of  $8  million:

that  is, 800,000 shares of $10 each. This new  share

issue   will  be  distributed  amongst  the  existing

shareholders in appropriate proportions according  to

their   holdings.  Thereafter,  the   Government   of

Singapore  will buy 50,000 shares. The Government  of

the  Federation  of Malaya will do the  same  and  so

acting  jointly  will  the three Borneo  Governments.

There  will  thus be a total holding of  $l�  million

held  by the three Governments. Just over $4� million

worth  of  shares  will be bought by QANTAS/BOAC  and

just  under $2� million will be offered to the public

of Malaya and Borneo. Simultaneously, Malayan Airways

will  be  transformed into a public limited liability

company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of these transactions deserves the

attention  of  the House. It is best  illustrated  by

considering the profits reaped by a single $10 share.

These will amount altogether to $22 made up of $11.40

from past profits, formerly allocated to Reserve, and

$10.60 from appreciation of fixed assets. In short, a

$10  share-based on an accountant's valuation - now has

a market value of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2699</b></font><br><br>



$32. From the point of view of the shareholders, that

is  no doubt a very happy situation but I think I had

better  make  a  few comments on  it  in  order  that

Members of the House may see the situation in a  more

precise perspective. I should not like Members of the

House  to  form  the impression that  by  putting  in

$500,000 into the new Malayan Airways, we can  expect

to reap profits on that scale and to take them out of

Malayan  Airways  and  use  them  in  some   way   to

supplement the general revenue of the Colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us first examine the $11.40 which comes from

profits formerly allocated to Reserve. The management

of Malayan Airways has consistently followed the very

wise  and very desirable policy of ploughing  back  a

large  proportion of profits into the  industry.  The

result  has  been  a relatively low  rate  of  annual

dividend.  On capital actually invested, as  distinct

from  the  original capital, dividends have  averaged

only  5 per cent before tax. Shareholders who have  forgone  larger dividends in the past are now drawing

in  a lump sum what they have forgone in the past and

if we add together the dividends actually distributed

plus the lump sum which is now being drawn in respect

of dividends forgone in the past, we find that we get

an  average annual return on the capital invested  of

about,  I  think, 14.2 per cent. If hon. Members  are

tempted  to deduce from this that we ought to  invest

all  our money in this sort of enterprise because  we

are getting a very high rate of profit, they ought to

think  again. This rate of profit of 14 per  cent  is

not  a  very  high rate for a risk-bearing enterprise

and   an   airline  is  emphatically  a  risk-bearing

enterprise. One single crashed aeroplane can wipe out

its  profits.  There  is no salvage  from  a  crashed

aeroplane; there is a dead loss of capital. Moreover,

if you have an accident or accidents, you also suffer

a  loss  of public confidence and a loss of  goodwill

amongst  the  travelling  public  and  that  will  be

reflected  in a lasting loss of revenue. Now,  thanks

to  the  skill and reliability of its staff,  Malayan

Airways has a high - I can say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2700</b></font><br><br>



an  extraordinarily high-record for  safety  and  for

punctuality. I do not think that any other airline in

the world has a better record. Malayan Airways has  a

100  per  cent safety record and about 98 to  99  per

cent  record  for  regularity of services.  Over  ten

years of operation, during which it has carried  some

1,040,000 passengers and it has operated some 159,000

revenue  hours,  Malayan Airways has never  killed  a

passenger  or  lost  an  aeroplane.  That  remarkable

record  of safe flying is reflected in the fact  that

reserves  have been built up and that they  have  not

been wiped out through disastrous accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to provide for future re-equipment, it will

continue to be necessary for Malayan Airways  to  put

aside large sums to Reserve. Consequently, it will be

necessary   for  them  to  seek  to  operate   at   a

satisfactory  rate of profit. Every  effort  must  be

made  to ensure that the future operations of Malayan

Airways are as satisfactory in regard to punctuality,

safety, efficiency and financial return as their past

operations have been. So much for the reserve  aspect

of the gain on the shares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect is the appreciation of fixed

assets, and, of course, I need hardly point out  that

all  fixed assets inevitably increase in their  money

value  on the grounds of what the hon. Mr Sutherland

was  saying  just now : -that there is  a  world-wide

creeping inflation: as the money gets smaller, so the

value  of  any  assets in terms of the smaller  money

gets  bigger.  But  the Malayan dollar  has  probably

suffered  less  inflation than many other  currencies

and  I  would not like to guess what the  element  of

inflation is in this appreciation of fixed assets;  I

do  not  think we need attach too much importance  to

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A much more significant factor is the eleven

Dakotas which belong to Malayan Airways. Although the

Dakota  is old and in a sense obsolescent, it has  up

till  now  had a high market value. The Dakota  is  a

very  suitable  aeroplane for the sort of  operations

that  Malayan  Airways  has conducted  and  as  those

operations  are fairly widespread, naturally  it  has

fairly  high value in the world market. But  we  must

remember this, that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2701</b></font><br><br>



insofar as appreciation of fixed assets accounts  for

profits  in  this case, those profits are a  windfall

which cannot be expected to recur. It is possible, of

course,  that  they  may  recur;  there  may   be   a

favourable world market at some future date  for  the

aircraft  which may be owned by Malayan Airways,  but

it  is  not  a thing on which anybody can  count,  or

which  you  can take into your expectations  or  your

planning. It is purely in the nature of a windfall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for the past profitability of Malayan

Airways. We cannot in this matter attempt to  predict

the future profitability on the basis of the past.  I

am  not  going  to attempt to guess what  the  future

profitability may be. There are a great many  factors

which,   in  some  cases,  are  necessarily   unknown

factors,  in  the  sense that we  cannot  predict  or

control  them.  They operate by causes lying  outside

our own country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct profitability is not, however, the criterion

by  which we should judge our proposed investment  in

Malaya  Airways.  We are concerned  not  with  making

profits but with providing services. Our aim  is  set

out in the second "Whereas" in the Agreement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... it is the desire of the Governments to

continue  to provide for safe, economic and efficient

air transport services;".



<br><br>Such services are of the greatest importance not only

for Singapore but also for the Federation and for the

three   Borneo  territories - in  fact,  for  all   the

Government partners who are now undertaking this  new

aviation  development.  Now,  if  we  are  going   to

maintain  those efficient air services which  are  so

important, there will necessarily have to be a  large

capital investment because the aviation world  is  an

intensely  competitive one. We must  have  aeroplanes

that  fully match the needs and expectations  of  the

travelling  public  and  aeroplanes  of   that   sort

necessarily cost money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is very proper that we should aim and the

new  Malayan Airways should aim to provide all or  as

much  as  possible  of the capital  required  out  of

profits.  That can only happen if the rate of  profit

is  reasonably  high and if there is thoroughly  safe

flying  to  make sure that there are no

accidents  to wipe  out  profits  which have been  accumulated.  If

Malayan Airways or any other airline cannot find  its

capital   from   its  own  profits,  then   it   will

necessarily have to find the capital elsewhere:  that

is to say, either in the private market, the ordinary

money  market or from Government support of one  kind

or  another. Now, the chances of getting large  scale

capital  investment in an airline  are  not,  on  the

world  picture, very good. I have got here some world

figures  of  airline profit or loss  expressed  as  a

percentage of turnover. In 1951, over the whole world

picture, the loss was 1.9 per cent; in 1952,  it  was

3.6  per cent; in 1953, it was 1.3 per cent; in 1954,

it  was .4 per cent. Over all those four years, there

was  a  loss - in  some cases, a substantial  loss.  In

1955,  the tide turned and there was a profit of  2.4

per cent gross on turnover. 2.4 per cent, I can point

out,  is  hardly a commercial rate of  profit.  These

figures are before payment of fixed interest.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.

Am  I  right  in  assuming that these  figures  being

provided  to us are figures of international airlines

and not of internal monopoly airlines?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> They were given to me as world figures

taking in all types of airlines together. It will  be

a  mistake to assume that the international  airlines

are  necessarily more in the red than  the,  what  is

called, monopoly airlines.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Giving a monopoly. There is no

competition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> It is surely an extraordinary illusion

that Malayan Airways has no competition. There is, of

course,  vigorous  competition from  road  and  rail.

[Interruption.] The hon. Member is not aware  of  it.

He  will only find out by experience that there is in

fact  real competition between road, rail and air  in

Singapore and in Malaya and if he doubts it, he  can

refer  to Malayan Railways and get their views  about

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of monopoly operators or local

operators - not   international   ones - making    better

profits, as he seems to be implying, perhaps I should

give him an example. The United States of America  is

an extremely rich and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2703</b></font><br><br>



wealthy   country  with  a  very  high  standard   of

efficiency   and  low  operational  cost - particularly

staff  cost - and there in that great and free economy,

the  Congress has found it necessary to pass  a  Bill

(it  went  to  the President last August) authorising

Government  guarantees up to 90  per  cent  on  loans

required  by  local U.S. operators. If Singapore  had

had  to find from public funds - from the surplus funds

of  the Government - the capital now needed for Malayan

Airways, the burden would have been very considerable

indeed.  It  could  only be met by sacrificing  other

development - schools, hospitals, a unified  transport

system   or  flood  control  or  some  other  equally

important work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our investment in Malayan Airways is partly an act

of  partnership. It is an act of partnership  between

the  five Governments concerned and it is also an act

of  partnership between the commercial operators  and

the Government cooperating. It is also a guarantee of

our  firm  purpose to do all in our power to maintain

our  aviation services at the very high  level  which

our status as a world communications centre requires.

We  must  therefore note with satisfaction  that  the

very  efficient past management of the operations  of

Malayan  Airways has made it possible to provide  for

the  continued operation of this airline with  strong

new  backing,  with  every  reasonable  prospect   of

economic soundness and of operational efficiency, and

without  a  heavy  requirement  for  investment  from

public  funds. There has been no loss of capital  for

Singapore in this matter. All the capital accumulated

from  the  past will continue to be employed  and  to

give  employment. We are also retaining an  excellent

working organisation with a very high level of skill,

of experience and of public goodwill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.

The Minister for Communications and Works rattled off

at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2704</b></font><br><br>



some  speed the distribution of the $10 million worth

of shares. I would be obliged if he could at a slower

speed   tell  us  how  this  $10  million   will   be

distributed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I am afraid I must have indeed spoken

too  fast, which complaint has often been made to  me

by those who have to record my spoken words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is that it is not $10 million but $8

million on revaluation - the capital altogether in  the

new  Malayan Airways. Of this $8 million,  after  all

transactions  are  completed, QANTAS/BOAC  will  hold

just  over  $4  million.  The five  Governments  (the

Federation of Malaya, Singapore and the three  Borneo

territories) will each hold $500,000 making  a  total

of $1� million; and the remainder which is just under

$2�  million will be offered to the public of  Malaya

and Borneo.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a further point of

elucidation, Sir. What about the present  capital  of

$2� million of Malayan Airways?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I think, Mr Speaker, Sir, I had better

read  very  slowly  what  I have  already  read  very

carefully once. I think the hon. Member must have not

quite  heard what I was saying. There is an  existing

issued  share  capital of $2� million  made  up  of

250,000  shares  of $10 each. New  shares  are  being

issued - 550,000 new shares - which make up  a  total  of

800.000 shares still at $10 each, thus making a total

capital of $8 million. This new share issue will,  in

the   first  instance,  be  distributed  amongst  the

existing shareholders who will then in their capacity

as  owners  sell them out to those who  wish  to  buy

them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Could we be informed of the

financial  operations by which the $2� million  worth

of  shares  in the existing Malayan Airways  will  be

converted  into  $4 million or $5  million  worth  of

shares in the new Malayan Airways? How does that come

about?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I think the hon. Member is taking me to

a  level of commercial practice where my approach  is

timid



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2705</b></font><br><br>



like that of a rabbit on meeting a boa-constrictor. I

am  not sure that I could explain in detail precisely

how   this  operates  under  the  company   law   and

commercial  practice. As I understand it, you  create

550,000 new bits of paper, each entitled "$10 share",

and    these   are   distributed   amongst    various

shareholders   in   proportion  to   their   existing

holdings.  If I hold one quarter, then I have  o  get

one quarter of the new issue; and then I shall have a

claim  on  the  actual property  of  the  airline  in

relation  to the shares I hold; so that its  break-up

or  distribution value would be on that basis. But  I

am  afraid that I have not expected to be taken  into

this type of company practice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Since we do not propose to be

rabbits in the face of boa-constrictors, could we ask

the Minister for Communications and Works to table  a

memorandum  or  a  White  Paper  giving   all   these

essential facts before we debate this matter?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Surely, the hon. Member will appreciate

that  this  has  nothing whatever  to  do  with  this

Assembly.   It   is  purely  a  transaction   between

commercial shareholders who are making a normal share

transaction  in the ordinary way. This  Assembly  has

nothing  to  do  with it except insofar  as,  by  not

altering  the  company  laws,  this  Assembly   gives

sanction  to whatever they do. It is not a matter  in

which this Assembly should interfere in any way.  All

that we have to say is that we approve the Government

proposals   to  acquire  a  holding  in   the   newly

reorganised   and   reconstituted   public    limited

liability company.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> We are not quite such rabbits as

not  our business. It is our business and we want  to

this monopoly away on these terms.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, it is still elucidation. I take

it?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2706</b></font><br><br>



2:54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Minister for Communications

and  Works  had hoped to take the sting  out  of  our

criticism because very little time had been given  to

the  Opposition  to study what is  a  very  important

agreement offered by the two Governments to a private

limited company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing he has not explained is: why did

the   Government  give  BOAC  and  QANTAS - two  public

corporations   of   the   British   and    Australian

Governments - 51  per  cent of our  national  airline's

controlling share? The way he presented his  argument

this  morning  indicated that it was a  case  of  the

Government not having sufficient funds to acquire  51

per  cent of the shares. Therefore it decided to give

BOAC/QANTAS 51 per cent, sell by public auction  or

even  by  public subscriptions $24, million worth  of

shares and the three Governments together raise  $14

million worth of shares. Now I would like to ask  him

and  have a categorical answer, yes or no: was it  or

was  it  not  a demand of QANTAS and BOAC or  Malayan

Airways  that they should have a controlling interest

in  the company? That is the first point. If they did

not  want  the  controlling interest, why  were  they

given  a controlling interest and if they wanted  the

controlling interest, what was the reason for it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are now presented with a fait

accompli.  Last year when we raised this question  of

the  renewal  of the franchise we were informed  that

there  would be a full opportunity for debate of  all

the  terms and conditions. Now we are told, "Here  is

the  agreement. We are not obliged to tell it to  the

Assembly  but  we  are  doing  it  as  a  matter   of

courtesy." We are first of all informed that all this

is  the good work of the Minister of Transport of the

Federation  and  a large bouquet was handed  to  him.

Well,  Sir,  the bouquet may well have been  deserved

but  I  have a feeling that this is another  instance

where  the Singapore Government has decided  to  hide

behind the Federation sarong.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2707</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister took us through

several  clauses  in  the proposed  agreement  rather

rapidly this morning. The first question I would like

to  ask  him  is:  why is there no provision  in  the

proposed  agreement as to what is to  happen  if  the

agreement is not renewed at the end of the franchise?

Clause 21 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) Not later than the 30th day of October, 1964,

the  parties shall consult together to consider  what

further arrangements, if any, should be made  at  the

end of the period of this Agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Each party shall, as soon as possible after such

consultation  and, in any case, not  later  than  the

30th  day  of  October, 1966, inform the other  party

whether or not it desires-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to continue this Agreement for a further

term; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to negotiate a fresh agreement to take effect

on the termination of this Agreement."



<br><br>This is the typical case of an agreement to agree and

is  no agreement whatsoever. What happens if there is

no  agreement? Does the company just wind up and sell

its  assets?  Or  we  going to be confronted  with  a

situation  where  if  we  want  to  nationalise   the

airline,  we shall have to pay a terrific  price  for

it,   just   as  Malayan  Airways  by  very   skilful

accounting had been able to increase its share  value

from a nominal $10 to $32? Now, from the $10 which we

are  going  to  pay  for a share in  1957,  how  many

dollars is it going to be if we want to buy over this

company  and run it as a national airline in 1964  or

1966?  That,  I should imagine, is one  of  the  most

important factors. The Government, for better or  for

worse,  have decided not to have a controlling  voice

in  this airline. The Government have left the matter

in  abeyance as to what is to happen at  the  end  of

this  period.  Surely, it must have a policy  and  it

should tell us what that policy is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, why were only BOAC and QANTAS brought

into   it?  If  it  is  a  question  of  Commonwealth

airlines,   why   was  not  Air  India   invited   to

participate  in the development of our  internal  air

services?  Why  two  "white"  Governments  in   close

collaboration over the Far Eastern routes? I  have  a

particular antipathy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2708</b></font><br><br>



towards  monopolies in which foreign or  Commonwealth

Governments  will  be  able  indirectly  to  run  our

essential services. It may well be that airlines  are

difficult  things to run. They are  risky;  they  may

incur  terrific losses. We have been regaled  with  a

whole  series  of  figures as  to  how  international

airlines  have  been losing money. But  this  is  one

airline  that has been making money and  it  is  more

than  likely that it will continue to make money  for

no  other reason than that there is no other internal

air   service   to  be  allowed  in  Singapore, the

Federation   and   the  Borneo  territories.   Unless

something  unexpected happens to  the  air-travelling

habits of the people of this area, it is likely  that

the air traffic is going to increase and profits also

will increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we were told that clause 18 is a

progressive clause. It sets the duty of this  company

to Malayanise, train local personnel as air crews and

ground maintenance staff. I would like to read a  few

of the operative words in clause

18. It says here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Company undertakes that provision shall be made

for  training  and promotion schemes  to  ensure  the

fullest  practicable employment  and  advancement  of

locally domiciled staff . . . ".



<br><br>What  does  "locally domiciled staff" mean?  We  know

that  all  kinds of people come here, live  here  two

years  and evince an intention to reside here  longer

than  they  expected  when they  first  arrived  here

because   they   found  conditions  for   them   very

satisfactory.  Are  they locally domiciled  staff?  I

always  believed that Malayanisation is a process  by

which we displace expatriates with local citizens and

subjects,  not just locally domiciled  staff.  I  may

come from Timbuctu and after two years, I say, "Well,

I like Singapore and I like to be domiciled here." So

I would come within this phrase of "locally domiciled

staff".  I  am  quite  sure  that  that  is  not  the

intention of the Minister for Transport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 goes on to say in the next sentence:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". . . recruiting, training and promotion air crews

and certificated ground maintenance staff . . .".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2709</b></font><br><br>



What  about  the  administration and  the  managerial

side?  We  know that it is always more difficult  to

Malayanise  the  technical side because  it  takes  a

longer time training technicians and technocrats than

to  train  administrators. We know  also  that  large

numbers  of  expatriates have  arrived  to  head  the

various  departments in the new Malayan  Airways.  It

may  well  be  that,  at  the beginning,  experienced

administrative  personnel are necessary  to  get  the

machinery  going  but why is there in  clause  18  no

provision  for  the training and the eventual  taking

over of these jobs by local men?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, this is an agreement which is full of

loopholes. It says in clause 4 "fares and rates"  and

variations  thereof. This is a key clause because  if

the  service is to run efficiently, it does not  only

mean  that  there should be no crashes of planes  and

that  planes  should arrive on schedule but  that  it

should  be run cheaply and it is acknowledged amongst

all  air operators that Malayan Airways have some  of

the highest fares in South East Asia. It says here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Company shall charge for the carriage of

passengers and cargo such fares and rates as may from

time  to  time  be  approved by  the  Ministers.  The

Company may submit to the Ministers proposals to vary

fares  and  rates, together with such information  in

support  thereof as may be required by the  Ministers

and  the Ministers' approval of such proposals  shall

not be withheld without good cause being shown."



<br><br>Now,  who is to decide whether it is "good cause"  or

not? Clause 3 says that if there is any disagreement,

it  goes to arbitration. Clause 22 says that if there

is arbitration, the two Governments shall appoint one

arbitrator  and the Company shall appoint  the  other

arbitrator, and it says that if there is no agreement

between the arbitrators, there shall be an umpire:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... in case of disagreement between the

arbitrators  so  appointed and so far  only  as  they

disagree, to their umpire to be appointed by them  in

writing  before  they enter on the  business  of  the

reference."



<br><br>Government  Ministers  disagree  with  the   company;

Ministers   appoint  one  arbitrator,   the   company

appoints one arbitrator. Two arbitrators disagree and

it  goes to one umpire. What if they cannot agree  on

an umpire? Then what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2710</b></font><br><br>



happens?  But surely, Mr Speaker, Sir, this business

of fares is a matter which cannot be left just to the

company and if it is not agreed to, to an umpire!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has rightly said that they are

interested in this as a public service and not  as  a

commercial  concern. Now, Sir, I am quite  sure  that

QANTAS/BOAC are interested in this as a profit-making

concern and not as a public service. We do not expect

the  Australian Government or the British  Government

to  do a public service for us. What I would like  to

know is this: if they consider it sufficiently profit

making,  why  is the Government only taking  a  token

share  of $500,000? Is it suggested that if the three

Governments  between them or the two  Governments - the

Federation  of  Malaya  and Singapore - were  to  raise

slightly  more  than $4 million, the two  Governments

will  go  bankrupt? That is the explanation which  we

must  have  before we give our approval or before  we

even take note of this agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I do not appreciate the argument that

because  we  are not interested in running  it  as  a

profit-making concern we should therefore  leave  the

profit  making to two public corporations  which  are

profit-making  concerns. I seriously suggest  to  the

Minister for Communications and Works that it must be

written into this agreement that the right to appoint

directors should not vest in proportion to the number

of  shares held. It was indicated to us this morning,

although  it  does  not  say  so  anywhere   in   the

agreement, that the Singapore Government will appoint

one  director  and  the  Federation  Government  will

appoint the other director. We have not been told how

many directors there will be on this company and  how

they will be appointed. By the ordinary operation  of

most  of  the rules and memoranda of companies,  they

are  appointed on the basis of the number  of  shares

held  in  a particular company. I do not see how  two

Governments   can  give  a  monopoly  to   a   public

corporation not knowing how many directors there  are

going to be and what voice they are going to have  in

that directorate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2711</b></font><br><br>



The only provision that is laid down for directors is

in clause 12 which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... all the Directors of the Company including

the  Chairman  shall  be  British  subjects,  British

protected  persons or citizens of the  Federation  of

Malaya;".



<br><br>How  many  there are going to be and what weight  the

Singapore and the Federation directors are  going  to

have  on  this  board of directors is another  matter

altogether.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to ask the Minister for

Communications and Works why it is he who  has  moved

this  motion  when,  in fact, he will  not  sign  the

agreement  at  all. This agreement  will  be  signed,

according  to  page  9  of the White  Paper,  by  the

the Federation of Malaya in the presence of: ......and

by  the  Chief  Secretary for and on  behalf  of  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Well, Sir, that is a nice easy passage

for  this happy agreement. We have had a very lengthy

speech from the Member for Tanjong Pagar. Most of  it

was  prepared  and was unnecessary in  the  light  of

explanations  already given: but since he  has  asked

for  them,  I  will  try and give those  explanations

again. And the rest of it, there was not much in  it.

I  will  take  his points as I got them  down  in  my

notes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not enough time?" Well, I have dealt with that

one.  We  had just got to the point during this  week

that  I  received  the  Borneo  agreement;  and  that

agreement necessarily had to be assured-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I hesitated to put forward this

information in case the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2712</b></font><br><br>



Minister explained that he knew nothing about it  but

will  the Minister confirm that, in fact, in the case

of  the  Borneo  Airways, the three Governments  will

hold 51 per cent of the shares?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> This is really a matter concerning the

Borneo Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That is not the point. It is a

matter of principle.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I do not think I can safely deal with

what  the  Borneo  Governments  are  doing  in  their

subsidiary  airline which is again an airline  linked

with  the BOAC and which they regard as a very  vital

airline for their own internal purposes. I could find

out  from the Borneo Governments whether they  object

to  the  hon. Member having the information he  asked

for  but I do not think that I should try to give him

the   precise   nature  of  the  rather   complicated

proceedings  between the Borneo Governments  and  the

other interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked, "Why a monopoly?" Air services must be a

monopoly if they are going to pay. It is possible  to

increase   the   number  of  taxis  on   the   street

indefinitely, but an aeroplane must fly at  a  proper

loading.  If the load is insufficient, then it  flies

at a loss. You cannot expect to have capital invested

in airlines unless you give the investors at least  a

reasonable chance of recovering their costs.  I  have

indicated  that  although  the  profits  of   Malayan

Airways have been satisfactory in the past, there  is

no certainty of their continuing at that level in the

future.   On  the  world  picture,  they  have   done

extremely well but you cannot gamble on the fortunate

past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a point about not enough public funds.

Well,  the simple fact is there: We are just hard  up

for  money.  We  could invest our  money  in  Malayan

Airways  if we wanted to, but of course if  Singapore

had  wished  to  have  a controlling  interest,  then

obviously  the  other  countries  would  have   said,

"Well,, we are not going to have our airlines at  the

mercy  of the Singapore Government. It has  to  be  a

partnership." It would have been necessary  to  carry

out   a   joint   purchase,   presumably   in   equal

proportions, by all the Governments holding an equal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2713</b></font><br><br>



proportion  of  the capital. It is a  most  difficult

manoeuvre and would certainly be doomed to failure if

it were to be tried at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted a categorical answer to the question why

BOAC/QANTAS wanted a controlling interest. Well,  the

obvious  answer  is that they wanted to  control  the

thing.  The  obvious danger to all people  likely  to

invest  in  this  country  is  that  ill-judged   and

inexperienced people may get into power and that they

may  then  carry  out  ill-judged  and  inexperienced

policies. I do not think you will get anybody to  put

capital  into  Singapore  in  partnership  with   the

Government  unless  they have a reasonable  guarantee

that their voice will be heard and that they will not

be  pushed around in an ill-judged way as a result of

political pressures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forget if I have dealt fully with the question of

not  enough time. I think I was interrupted  at  that

stage. The simple fact is, of course, that we had  to

spend  a  good deal of time in getting this agreement

up to tabling stage. There had to be a completion; we

had  to  wait for the Borneo Governments to  complete

their   parallel  complementary  agreement  and   the

consequence  has been that we are rather  pushed  for

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, a rather curious question, of what happens at

the end of the franchise? The hon. Member read clause

21  and I do not think I need read it again. It  says

perfectly plainly "what further arrangements, if any,

should  be  made  at the end of the  period  of  this

agreement."  The  only thing that  emerged  from  his

question was an apparent assumption on his part  that

this  Government would still be in power in 1967.  At

least  he asks what our policy would be and  what  we

intended  to do in 1967. The fact of the  matter,  of

course,  is  that  we have provided a  very  adequate

agreement  with,  as  I pointed out  in  my  original

remarks,  a  transitional clause for  a  transitional

period  of three years - the last three out of the  ten

years  of  the  franchise - and there is  no  point  in

trying to go further and to presume that we are going

to do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2714</b></font><br><br>



this or that at the end of ten years. We have not got

that  amount of foresight to see the future; nor  has

anybody else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why was not Air India invited to participate?" The

hon.  Member  objected to what he called "whites",  I

think.  I  can  only say that we do  not-at  least  I

certainly  do not - when conducting negotiations,  work

from  any racialist or racist approach. Air India  is

an   efficiently   run   and  a  highly   competitive

international airline and if they had approached  us,

we  would have considered it. In fact, they did  not,

and  we are perfectly satisfied with QANTAS/BOAC  as

an effective partnership on a larger scale, with more

advantages  to  offer  to  us.  There  is  no  reason

whatever  to suppose that Air India would  have  been

able to give us any better or more helpful terms than

what we have got from QANTAS/BOAC.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> All your Ministers prefer to

travel by Air India.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> As to that, I cannot say. There are

sabotage problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked, "What is locally domiciled staff?" I am

afraid  that is a very thin one again in  respect  of

clause  18. Obviously, a person locally domiciled  in

Singapore  is  not locally domiciled in Kuala  Lumpur

nor  is  he  locally domiciled in Kuching, Brunei  or

Jesselton and you have got to find some phrase  which

adequately  represents the fact that we  are  dealing

with five different territories, and not with one. We

have   provided  in  clause  12  what  is  much  more

significant:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The restriction in favour of British subjects . . .

shall be extended to include Singapore citizens  when

Singapore   citizenship  has  been   established   by

legislation."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the company is bound to employ them. Eighty per

centum  under that category should provide adequately

for the point which the hon. Member has in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Malayan Airways' fares are the highest in South-East Asia." I have a great deal of information here,

Mr  Speaker,  but it will take me a little  time  to

find  the exact references I want. Now, here are  the

average fares in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2715</b></font><br><br>



Malayan  cents  per passenger mile for  some  of  the

airlines operating in this part of the world:



<pre>

  Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam         39.5 cents per passenger mile.



  Indonesia                          39.6 cents per passenger mile.



  Malayan Airways                    28.1 cents per passenger mile

                                        for what they call their standard

                                        service, I think and



                                     21.1 cents per passenger mile

                                        for their tourist services.

</pre>

<br><br>The   tourist   services  are  the  more   accurately

comparable  with the standard of service provided  in

the other airlines:



<pre>

  Thailand                          20.9 cents per passenger mile.



  Burma                             20.6 cents per passenger mile.



  India                             15.4 cents per passenger mile.



</pre>

<br><br>Now,  on  that table, there are two airlines  with  a

very  much  higher  rate indeed,  not  very  far  off

double,  that  is, Indonesia and Laos,  Cambodia  and

Vietnam:  then there are more which are substantially

the  same - Thailand and Burma running just level  with

Malayan Airways; then there is India down below  five

or  six  cents cheaper per passenger mile. Of course,

there  is  a difference in the standard of living  in

these  territories and in the standard of wage rates.

I   think  it  is  fair  to  say  that  probably  the

passengers  in  Malayan Airways can (a)  well  afford

these  fares and (b) get a better standard of service

or  a  very  good standard of service; and  that  the

possibility  of  keeping the  prices  down  does,  of

course,  depend on the wage rates prevailing in  that

particular territory. But anyhow there is  no  ground

at all for saying that Malayan Airways' fares are the

highest in South-East Asia. That sort of remark should

be  withdrawn when it is made. These wild allegations

should  not  be  made against what is  in  fact  very

largely a Malayan-operated concern. From a suggestion

that  our  fares  are  unreasonably  high,  it  would

naturally follow that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2716</b></font><br><br>



either  the  Malayans on the staff  are  unreasonably

inefficient or that their wages are too high.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Or their expatriates are getting

too much.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Another rather empty point: he noted

that  disputes go to an umpire; first you put up  two

arbitrators and if they cannot agree, it goes  to  an

umpire.  Then he asked, "How if they cannot agree  on

an  umpire?"  Well, of course, if  he  had  read  the

clause  with any attention, he would have  seen  that

the  arbitrators  agree on their  umpire  in  writing

before  they enter on the business of the  reference.

If  they could not agree on an umpire, we should with

draw  our  arbitrators and find two  arbitrators  who

could agree on an umpire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is Government taking only a token share in

Malayan Airways?" Really, Mr Speaker, I thought half

my  remarks were directed to that point. Perhaps that

is  why I said that it was probably a prepared speech

which had not been readjusted in the light of what  I

actually  had to say but I do not think  that  it  is

necessary to say it all over again. The only  way  in

which  we could have found the money would have  been

by  sacrificing  development in other directions.  Of

course, the bottom of the barrel is not empty.  There

is some money but we have also got a great many calls

on our money and we cannot-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Find $4 million.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> - find $4 million without taking $4

million  away  from something else. It  is  a  simple

concept to understand. The hon. Member seems to think

that the Government has a bottomless purse from which

it  can draw out money without ever coming to the end

of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the last point of any significance he made

was:  why was this motion moved by myself when it  is

in  fact  the Chief Secretary who has to sign  it?  I

should  point  out that international air  agreements

have  a  dual aspect. They are partly commercial  but

they are also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2717</b></font><br><br>



diplomatic or foreign affairs types of agreements and

in  this case the foreign affairs aspect predominates

to  the  extent  that  it  is  appropriate  that  the

Minister  who  has  to concern himself  with  foreign

affairs  has  to  sign  the agreement.  That  is  why

although I am the unhappy Minister who has had to  do

all the work, the pleasure of signing will fall to my

friend and colleague the Chief Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Your Federation counterpart is

<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> My Federation counterpart is in an

services  within  and  between  the  territories   of

amendments are technical ones designed to improve the

drafting of the Bill and I do not propose to go  into

these  in detail as they are fully explained  in  the

official  report  on the proceedings  of  the  Select

Committee. Possibly, the most notable change has been

the  reduction of the residential qualification  from

ten  years  to  eight years. As a result  of  further

consideration and discussion, it has been agreed that

it  would  be easier from an administrative point  of

view to reduce the qualification to eight years. This

will  greatly simplify registration as identity cards

were issued late in 1948.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important amendment, Sir, is the proviso

added  to  clause 12 of the Bill which provides  that

before the Minister refuses an application, he  shall

refer the case to an Advisory Committee consisting of

three  persons appointed by the Governor in  Council.

In  making  his  decision, the  Minister  shall  have

regard  to  any  report made to him by this  Advisory

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members will also notice that a new Part VI has

been  added  to the Bill. Sir, as is well known,  the

main purpose of the Bill is to enable persons who are

qualified to become citizens under this law  to  take

part  in  the general elections next year and  it  is

therefore  necessary for the initial registration  of

citizens  to  take place as quickly  as  possible  in

order that the electoral rolls can be prepared. It is

an  All-Party decision that a three-month period  for

initial registration is sufficient for people to have

their  names put on the electoral rolls and  so  take

part in the forthcoming elections. At it is now going

to be made so easy for people to be registered, it is

necessary  for the Minister to have powers to  cancel

that  registration. Following such cancellation,  the

person concerned can reapply for registration in  the

normal way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the most important amendments and, as I

said  before, the others are designed to improve  the

drafting of the Bill.

the  Bill in respect of clauses 3 and 8 and  one  new

clause  immediately after clause 5 to a Committee  of

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I have that in writing, please?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment is in order. Please

proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Sir, this Assembly is going to enact a

law  by  which  it  proposes to give,  under  certain

conditions,  citizenship status  to  the  people  who

reside or are domiciled in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I went through the Select Committee

Report, I found that a certain section of people made

certain  representations. They claim that  those  who

are  already  registered as Citizens  of  the  United

Kingdom    and   Colonies   should   be    recognised

automatically.  Sir,  I think that  that  is  a  very

reasonable  suggestion which, I beg  to  submit,  the

Select  Committee  completely ignored.  These  people

have unmistakably shown their loyalty to Singapore by

swearing allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen  and  to

Singapore.  It  is  not right to insist,  every  time

there  is  a  change of government, that  citizenship

registration  should be renewed.  According  to  this

Bill, I think about 60,000 people who are Citizens of

the  United  Kingdom and Colonies will  be  asked  to

register again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not asking anything new by this

registration. The same forms are to be filled  in  by

the  same  section of people, swearing allegiance  to

the  same person, that is, Her Majesty the Queen, and

to  the same country, that is Singapore. I think  the

Government finds pleasure in making more people  come

forward  and  register  but  the  Government  is  not

encouraging  people  to  come  forward  and  register

because  it  is now creating a feeling amongst  those

who  have  expected  themselves  to  be  citizens  of

Singapore  that  they are completely ignored  because

they are asked to register again. The Government is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2722</b></font><br><br>



really  discouraging people from  coming  forward  to

register.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Singapore was directly under the colonial rule

a  new  method  of  registration of  citizenship  was

imposed  on  the people. I think, Sir, in  1946,  the

people were asked to register. Many people did go  to

register  and there was an election. The  result  was

that  Mr  C.  C.  Tan became the head  of  the  then

Government.   When  he  became  the   head   of   the

Government,   he   discovered   a   new   method   of

registration of citizenship. By this new  method,  he

deprived those people who elected him of their voting

rights.  After  Mr  C.  C.  Tan,  our  former  Chief

Minister Mr David Marshall proposed a new method  of

registration of citizenship. Now the Hon. the  Chief

Minister  Dr Lim Yew Hock has invented a new  method

of  registration of citizenship. As there is going to

be  an  election in 1958, there will be another Chief

Minister.  Surely there will again be another  method

of  citizenship registration. Sir, by these  tactics,

this  Government  must realise that the  citizens  of

Singapore are losing faith in it. Whenever there is a

change  of  government, a new method  of  citizenship

registration will be devised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another irony is this. This Assembly is not a

constituent Assembly. This is a legislative Assembly.

We  were elected under the Rendel Constitution and we

represent the interests of a certain section  of  the

people. Not only are you not doing that, but you  are

depriving those people who elected you of their right

to  vote.  The people who are Citizens of the  United

Kingdom  and Colonies whom you are asking to register

are the very people who elected you to this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was never elected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> I am sorry, Sir. By "you", I mean the

Government,  and  that is a most  unfortunate  thing.

This   Government  is  finding  ways  and  means   of

depriving the voters who elected them of their voting

rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I propose this amendment and if it goes

to the Committee stage.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2723</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I find it

difficult  to understand the reason for the amendment

proposed by the Member for Farrer Park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Citizenship Bill was drawn up as a result of

the   agreement   reached  in   London   during   the

constitutional  talks. The agreement was  debated  in

this  Assembly in April; the hon. Member was present.

The  agreement was adopted and as a result  of  that,

the  Bill was drawn up in order to give effect to the

wishes  of the Assembly to see that persons  who  are

qualified  to  become citizens can be  registered  in

order  that they can take part in the elections under

the new constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park would have us believe

that  the  Government  was  employing  all  sorts  of

tactics.  I cannot understand that insinuation,  Sir.

These  citizenship proposals were as a result  of  an

All-Party conference and the recommendations  of  the

All-Party  conference were approved by this  Assembly

before  the All-Party delegation left for London  for

the constitutional talks. It is therefore clear. Sir,

that the Government is against the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, on a point of information.

Whatever the proposed amendment the Member for Farrer

Park  may  move, I would like to have information  on

this: if a citizen of the United



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2725</b></font><br><br>



Kingdom applies to be a citizen of Singapore, will he

have to renounce his allegiance to the United Kingdom

Government or to Her Majesty the Queen? If he holds a

United Kingdom passport, will a Singapore passport be

issued   to   him   if  he  applies   for   Singapore

citizenship? And if a Singapore passport  is  issued,

will    that   Singapore   passport   be   recognised

internationally?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I now understand, Sir, why the

Member for Queenstown seconded the motion, it  would

appear that he does not understand what this Bill  is

for. He has difficulty in understanding the agreement

reached  in London and what the citizenship proposals

were.  In  the  case of the citizens  of  the  United

Kingdom and Colonies, what is required of them before

they  can  become citizens of Singapore is that  they

should  take  an  oath  to  the  Queen  and  to   the

constitution. That is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.

Will  that  mean  then that a person  can  hold  dual

citizenship



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is out

of  order.  He  should have made his speech  when  he

seconded the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am just asking for information,

Sir.



<br><br>3.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

although I am not in favour of the amendment,  yet  I

would  like to seek guidance from you: when a  Member

asks  for a clause to be considered in Committee,  we

always allow that. We have done that previously and I

think that is the usual practice.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was under the impression that

the hon. Member was rising on a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> No, Sir, I am asking for

guidance.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I had better guide the hon. Member

then. The relevant Standing Order 55 (3) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Upon a motion to adopt the report of a Select

Committee  on  a  Bill,  any Member  may  propose  an

amendment  to  add, at the end of the motion  or  the

original  motion may include at the end thereof,  the

words "subject to the recommittal of the Bill [either

wholly or in respect only of some particular part  or

parts  of the Bill or of some proposed new clause  or

new  schedule] to a Committee of the whole Assembly",

and if that motion is agreed to, the Bill shall stand

so recommitted...'



<br><br>I  did,  on  a  previous  occasion,  suggest  that  a

procedure  should be evolved whereby, when  a  Member

asked  for  certain  clauses to  be  reconsidered  in

Committee,  it  was as a matter of  course  that  the

motion should be accepted; but as the Standing Orders

now stand, we must still go through the procedure  of

debate,  and  only if the motion is agreed  to,  then

there  can  be  a recommittal to a Committee  of  the

whole  Assembly. But today perhaps hon. Members  will

have noticed that there has been an amendment made to

the  relevant  Standing Order which would  in  effect

provide for the procedure I have indicated: that  is,

when a Member wishes certain clauses of a Bill to  be

recommitted  to  a Committee of the  whole  Assembly,

that  will  be done as a matter of course,  but  that

amendment  to the Standing Order does not  come  into

operation until the 1st of November.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question is before the

House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill was

the result of co-operative effort by all the Parties.

We  have considered every detail and every aspect  of

it  in the interest of the people of Singapore and  I

believe  that this Bill does not exclude anybody  who

wants to be loyal to Singapore and who wants to serve

Singapore. We make it such that anybody who wants  to

be  a  Singapore citizen, if he is of good  character

and is an asset to this country, will be granted that

right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous to this, Sir, we had been under the control

of England and they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2727</b></font><br><br>



made  all these laws for us, so that anybody who owes

allegiance to the Queen may come into this place  and

make it their land. However, since then, we have  had

many new nationals coming in and they may not be just

citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies  but  may

also  be of the Commonwealth, so that we have to take

into  consideration all such people; but whatever  it

is,  Sir, we believe that this Bill provides for  all

who  would  want  to make this place their  permanent

home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We of the Liberal-Socialists have taken part in it

Sessional Paper No. L.A. 17 of 1957, be adopted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Paper was laid on the 18th of September

and  the  facts  supporting  this  private  Bill  are

clearly  stated in the affidavit. The Little  Sisters

of   the   Poor  have  established  homes   for   the

maintenance, treatment and nursing of the  poor,  the

aged, the sick and the infirm and for the purpose  of

the  propagation  of Christianity. I  must  say  that

although one of the purposes is for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2728</b></font><br><br>



propagation  of  Christianity,  it  is  admitted   by

everyone   in   Singapore   that   they   have    not

discriminated  against  any  other  religion  in  the

treatment  of the sick and the infirm and because  of

the good work that this body of people have done,  it

has  received much contribution as a result of  which

it  has  been able to build two homes: one at Thomson

Road,  Singapore and the other one in  Batu  Lanchang

Lane,  Penang.  As  the work will increase  and  more

homes  will  be  established, it  is  felt  that  the

vesting  of  all  the properties and  titles  in  the

titular   Roman   Catholic  Bishop  of   Malacca   is

inconvenient in that it puts an extra burden  on  the

Bishop of Malacca for objects of which he has no real

concern.  It  is  therefore  asked  that  the  Little

Sisters of the Poor be now incorporated by law  under

which  it will be able to hold all the properties  in

its own name.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there is no statutory obligation to register for

employment, nor any requirement that those registered

should be only unemployed persons, the list does  not

give  the whole picture. For instance, many of  those

registered  may  already be gainfully  employed,  but

wish to transfer to other jobs. Again, others may  be

in part-time occupations or in training.
