<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the Bill handed in to the Clerk and

<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,  "That the Bill be now read a Second  time."  I

have  His  Excellency  the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's

recommendation  that this Bill be proceeded  with.  I

also  have a Certificate of Urgency by the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara to proceed with the Bill through  all

its stages under Standing Order No. 81.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my statement at the sitting of the Assembly on

11th  December, 1963, I have already touched  on  the

matter  of the setting up of a one-man Commission  of

Inquiry  to  look  into  and  examine  the  financial

transactions  of three deregistered trade  unions.  I

have   already   recounted  to   hon.   Members   how

unscrupulous and mercenary anti-national  leaders  of

unions  could usurp the funds of the workers  towards

purposes  inconsistent with the objects and rules  of

the  unions to the detriment of the unions and danger

to  the  State.  In order that the interests  of  the

workers  may  be  safeguarded,  the  Government   now

consider it necessary that the Bill before the  House

should be taken through all its stages and passed  on

a   Certificate   of  Urgency.  As  I   have   stated

previously, the reason for bringing in the Bill on  a

Certificate of Urgency is obvious. The Assembly  will

be  adjourning shortly and it is necessary  that  the

Bill  be passed in order that there will be effective

legislation to prevent trade union funds  from  being

frittered   away   illegally  and  dishonestly.   The

Government at present have no power to deal with  the

funds  of unions which are deregistered or are  being

given  notices to show cause why they should  not  be

deregistered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Unions Ordinance which was passed in 1940

did not foresee that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



there  are  so-called  trade union  leaders  here  in

Singapore  capable of taking away  large  amounts  of

money of the workers for purposes known only to their

secret masters. As a result of this, once a union  is

deregistered, the money of the union is left  at  the

mercy  of the union leaders. Amongst themselves  they

can  do  anything they like with the money.  Although

union  rules require them to distribute the money  to

the  general  members, in most cases  this  is  never

done.  In fact, in the case of the Singapore  General

Employees' Union, the Secretary-General, when  called

upon by the police to explain why certain amounts  of

money  were  expended, disappeared  with  some  union

minute books. So you can see how dangerous it  is  to

leave  large amounts of money in the hands  of  union

officials who are capable of going underground at any

moment.  They  do not have the workers' interests  at

heart. The workers' money is not used to further  the

interests of the workers. It is being used  for  some

inexplicable purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 3rd September, 1963, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

issued  a writ to dissolve the previous Assembly  and

ordered fresh elections. Everyone knew that elections

were  coming  and elections cost money.  And  it  was

exactly  on  this  day, the 3rd  of  September,  that

leaders  of  the  three unions,  viz,  the  Singapore

General  Employees'  Union,  the  Singapore  Business

Houses  Employees'  Union,  and  the  Singapore   Bus

Workers'  Union decided to withdraw large amounts  of

money from their banks. I can leave it to you to draw

your  own  conclusion as to what they intend  to  use

this  money for. The Government cannot afford  to  be

complacent  in this matter. If we are to protect  the

interests of the workers, I am sure hon. Members will

agree  that stringent and urgent action must be taken

to deal with the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present the Trade Unions Ordinance does not

empower the Minister or the Registrar of Trade Unions

to  freeze  the bank accounts of any trade  union  if

information is received that the union



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



intends to utilise its funds for any purpose contrary

to  the  provisions of the Ordinance or the rules  of

the  union itself. While the Registrar has  power  to

apply to the Court for an injunction to restrain  any

trade  union from unlawful expenditure of its  funds,

this  process  in  law, however, is  not  practicable

especially when the matter has to be dealt with on an

immediate  basis. Because the present Ordinance  does

not  provide  the necessary powers, the Registrar  of

Trade  Unions  could only advise  banks  holding  the

accounts of unions to suspend payment of any  cheques

drawn  on  them. Although in the case  of  the  three

deregistered  S.A.T.U. unions the  banks  co-operated

with   the  Government,  they  were  in  a  difficult

position as the Government's request had no statutory

backing. This being so, the banks would therefore  be

liable  for  damages  if  they  were  sued  by  their

clients.  As  Government had perforce to  freeze  the

funds  of  these unions, it was necessary, therefore,

for  the  Government to give a categorical  assurance

that  it would indemnify any legal costs arising from

any  proceedings  as  a result of  their  failing  to

honour the unions' cheques.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite action taken by the Registrar to request

the  banks  to  withhold withdrawals which  might  be

initiated by these three S.A.T.U. unions, two of  the

unions,  however, were able to withdraw about $30,000

from  their accounts in a number of banks before  the

banks   could  receive  Government's  indemnification

assurance. The new section 15A provided in  clause  2

of the Bill will now enable the Minister, where he is

satisfied  that  the  funds  of  any  unions  may  be

misused,  to order any bank in Singapore not  to  pay

any money or to cash any cheques of the unions for  a

period  not  exceeding  three months.  Non-compliance

with  this  order will make the manager of  the  bank

liable to punishment as set out in subsection (3)   of

section  15A. Subsection (2)  will, of course, absolve

the  bank  of  any liability arising from  compliance

with the order



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



of  the Minister. Clause 3 of the Bill amends section

18  of the Ordinance, and this amendment is necessary

having regard to the new section 18A provided  under

clause 4. The new section 18A in clause 4 of the Bill

will  obviate any undue delay in the winding  up  and

disposal of funds of unions which have been dissolved

on  the  grounds  that  they  have  not  applied  for

registration  or  where their registration  has  been

refused,  withdrawn  or  cancelled.  There  are  many

instances where unions that have been dissolved  have

still  to  wind  up  and dispose of  their  funds.  A

glaring instance is that of the Singapore Factory and

Shop  Workers' Union, which was deregistered in 1957,

and  to  date it has still to wind up and dispose  of

its funds. Hon. Members will, therefore, see that the

powers  sought in the new section 18A are  necessary.

Once  a  trade union is dissolved, the assets of  the

union  will vest immediately in the Official Assignee

in  Bankruptcy so that he can proceed to wind up  the

affairs  of  the  union.  Any  surplus  assets  after

providing for all debts and liabilities will, if  the

Minister directs, be paid into the Consolidated Fund;

or  where no such direction is made, will be disposed

of  as  provided in the rules of the trade  union  in

question. It is very necessary that the assets of the

dissolved  trade  union should vest in  the  Official

Assignee  in Bankruptcy to prevent officials  of  the

union from making any withdrawals on the accounts  of

the  union  held by any bank between the period  when

notice  has  been  given by the  Registrar  of  Trade

Unions to the union of the intention to dissolve such

union,   and  the  actual  date  of  dissolution   if

dissolution takes place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already recounted instances of such

irresponsible  withdrawals in my  statement  of  11th

December.  This  will  make very interesting  hearing

when the Commission of Inquiry sits to look into  the

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 18B gives retrospective effect to

the Bill so that the unions deregistered or cancelled

prior to the date of 11th December, 1963, can be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



dealt  with in the same way. I would like, therefore,

to  commend this Bill to the House so that it can  be

taken  through all its stages and passed  at  today's

sitting.  I  do  not  propose  to  overemphasise  how

essential it is for Government to be given the powers

sought in the Bill. Any person having the interest of

the  workers  and the protection of the  funds  which

rightfully  belong  to the workers  will  undoubtedly

support the enabling measures that will be vested  in

Government by the amendments proposed in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  fact that the P.A.P.  Government

have  now  tabled this Trade Unions (Amendment)  Bill

shows that they are taking further action against the

workers.  This will thus deal a blow to  the  workers

who  do not allow themselves to be controlled by  the

P.A.P.  The  P.A.P. have always boasted in  the  past

that  it is their intention to have an open argument.

But  this so-called open argument and competition has

not been used in the true sense. As a result of their

insincerity  in  the  so-called  open  argument   and

competition, the Government have taken action to  ban

some  trade  unions and have arrested their  leaders.

Some  of  the workers and their leaders who  went  on

strike  were assaulted. Apart from this,  the  P.A.P.

Government have also made use of the State  machinery

to break up the non-P.A.P. union strikes. This can be

seen from their repressive actions in the past. Seven

unions   were   dissolved.   The   application    for

registration  by S.A.T.U. was also turned  down.  The

Naval  Base Workers' Union strike, which lasted about

thirty  days,  was a legitimate strike.  But  it  was

broken  up  by  the  P.A.P. by  illegal  means   and

despicable methods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of all these actions, the P.A.P. have

discovered  that they have not sufficient  powers  to

deal with the workers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



whose only wish is to struggle for a better life  and

improve  their  working conditions, which  are  their

legitimate rights. In spite of all these actions, the

workers are as united as ever. They are as adamant as

ever.  This  fact has worried the P.A.P. very  much.

That is why the P.A.P. are now taking a step further.

They  are  abusing the legal and State  machinery  by

tabling  this  Bill,  which is  an  attempt  to  gain

control  over  the  unions' funds.  In  other  words,

unions  which  do  not  support  the  P.A.P. can  be

controlled by the P.A.P. There are provisions in this

Trade  Unions  (Amendment)  Bill  which  empower  the

Minister  to  freeze a union's funds deposited  in  a

bank  for  a period of three months when the Minister

is  satisfied that the funds may be misused. We  know

that  workers  have contributed to the trade  unions'

funds by way of monthly subscriptions. Therefore, the

disposal  of  the  funds should  be  decided  by  the

workers  themselves and not by the Minister  and  the

P.A.P.  The funds should not be interfered with.  The

trade  union  officials  have  been  elected  by  the

workers  themselves.  They  have  been  entrusted  to

administer  the  funds. They are held responsible  to

the workers and members of the unions. So long as the

workers  of the unions agree to the action  taken  by

their   elected  officials,  and  so  long   as   the

administration   of   the  unions'   funds   is   not

inconsistent  with the rules and regulations  of  the

unions, the Minister should not be given any right to

interfere  with  such administration of  the  unions'

funds. In fact, nobody should be allowed to interfere

with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phrase "satisfied that it is likely that the

funds  of  the  union  may be misused",  is  actually

typical  of Fascist methods. It seems that  only  the

Minister  is  able to decide whether a union's  funds

are  being  used in the right and proper  manner.  We

know  that if the Minister is given this power,  then

he  may  make use of this power as an excuse to  take

action  against the union which refuses to  be  under

the control of the P.A.P. Trade union funds come from

the workers themselves. They subscribe to these funds

in  their own interest and for union activities. They

can be considered as the capital of the workers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



for  their  union activities. If their funds  can  be

frozen at the whims and fancies of the Minister, then

the  workers will face great difficulties in carrying

out  their  activities. They will have  no  financial

backing  if they wish to increase their wages through

legitimate  methods. For example,  if  members  of  a

union  decide  to stage a strike or  take  any  other

industrial  action, which is their weapon,  to  fight

for better working conditions, then the Minister may,

if  he so desires, break up this impending strike  or

even  if  a  strike is on. He does this  by  exerting

pressure on the bank to freeze the funds of the union

in  question. If a union is not able to withdraw  its

funds from the bank, how are the workers to have  any

means  of livelihood during the period of the strike?

How  are they going to maintain themselves during the

duration  of  the  strike  and  their  activities  in

connection with the strike?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Naval Base Union, the Government

took action to freeze the funds of the union when the

strike  broke out. All the banks were instructed  not

to  meet any payment on their behalf. As a result  of

the  Government's action, the strikers met with  many

difficulties.  There are other cases.  There  is  the

example  of  the Singapore Business Houses Employees'

Union.  Strike action was taken by some  branches  of

this  union.  Action was taken by the  Government  to

control  their  funds. They therefore  faced  similar

difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister is given these dictatorial powers,

then  the workers will face difficulties in the event

of  a  strike.  In fact, these powers will  give  the

Minister   many  opportunities  to   break   up   the

legitimate strikes of non-P.A.P. unions. This  is  my

first point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to draw your attention to

is  this. If the workers wish to support the  strikes

of  other  unions,  that is, by giving  material  and

financial aid, the Government can, by virtue of these

provisions in the Bill, abuse their power and  freeze

the  unions'  funds. These provisions  are  meant  to

prevent certain unions from making use of their funds

to  assist other unions and other workers who are  on

strike. Apart from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



this  point, if such dictatorial powers are given  to

the  Minister,  then,  in the  event  of  the  unions

desirous  of expanding their activities, and  if  the

Minister does not like certain unions to expand their

activities,  he  will  again  resort  to  the  powers

contained in this Bill to freeze the union funds.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is one clause which deals with

the  point, and the debate is on that clause.  Though

he is using the same expression, he is using it in  a

different context and using different reasons. I rule

that he is in order. Please proceed, Mr Chia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister can

even   go  to  the  extent  of  abusing  his  powers,

contained  in this Bill, to threaten certain  unions.

That is to say, if the Minister does not want certain

unions  to carry out certain activities in the  trade

union  movement, then he will again  take  action  to

freeze  the  trade  union funds.  Even  when  certain

unions want to carry out legitimate activities  of  a

cultural  nature or, in other respects, to raise  the

cultural standard of the workers and make use of  the

union  funds for publication purposes, if the  P.A.P.

desire  to  stop the activities of these unions,  the

Minister again can freeze the union funds in order to

prevent  such activities from being carried  out.  If

these undemocratic powers of a dictatorial nature are

given  to  the  Minister, then we can  see  that  the

P.A.P. will, by way of this Bill, take action against

those non-P.A.P. unions and drive their members  over

to  the  other side, namely, the side of the  P.A.P.-controlled  trade unions. So since  the  P.A.P. have

failed to control the non-P.A.P. unions, they are now

resorting to legal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



means  to further suppress them. The P.A.P.

always claim that these unions are indulging in  open

front Communist activities, and so it is necessary to

have  this  Bill to take action against such  unions.

But let us look at the facts. This is a document from

the   Malayan  Trades  Union  Congress.   After   the

Committee  came to Singapore for a survey, they  came

to this conclusion as contained in this document:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Singapore Government always make use of the

State machinery and other governmental facilities  to

help the National Trades Union Congress in Singapore,

but  neglect those other unions which do not  endorse

the Government policies.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This point has been admitted by the Minister for

Labour.  In this memorandum the Malayan Trades  Union

Congress  officials continue to say that those  trade

unions  which  do not endorse the P.A.P. Government's

labour policies always have their leaders intimidated

on  all  sorts of excuses and harassed unnecessarily.

Such  excuses like anti-national elements, open-front

Communist workers and the rest are common expressions

used  by  the  Government against them. This  is  the

conclusion  arrived  at  by a  third  party  from  an

objective  point  of  view. So  the  so-called  "pro-Communist"  and  "anti-national  elements"  are   but

expressions  used  by the P.A.P. against  non-P.A.P.-controlled trade unions if the P.A.P. fail  in  other

ways  to  deal with them. If the P.A.P. fail to  gain

their  support  by legitimate means, they  will  turn

round to brand them as Communist controlled and  take

action against them. This again is another example to

show how one can give a dog a bad name and hang him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Bill there is also a provision stipulating

that   the  Minister  can,  in  the  event   of   the

dissolution of a trade union, direct that  the  funds

be  put into the Consolidated Fund of the Government.

As  we  have already said, the funds of a trade union

come  from the workers by the accumulation  of  their

subscriptions over years. The workers  have  to  work

very  hard  to build up their own funds to  safeguard

their  rights  and to enable them to  have  financial

means to carry out their trade union activities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.08 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Dr Fong Kim Heng) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how these funds should be used should be decided

by  the  workers  themselves. In  the  event  of  the

dissolution of any union, the members of  that  union

may desire that the funds be used for the welfare  of

the  workers. Therefore, the disposal of  such  funds

should be in accordance with the trade union rules or

according  to  the  desire  of  the  members  of  the

dissolved union. It is not proper for the Minister to

direct  that the funds of that union be put into  the

Consolidated Fund, thereby depriving the  members  of

that union of their legitimate rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that even in the Federation of Malaya or

even  in  England, trade union laws do not  have  the

provision  whereby trade union funds can be  forcibly

put  into  the  Consolidated Fund, which  amounts  to

confiscation in the event of the dissolution  of  the

trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this amending Bill, there is also another

provision whereby the Minister's direction  that  the

trade  union  funds can be put into the  Consolidated

Fund  will have retrospective effect to the  11th  of

December,  1963.  Now  this provision  is  even  more

unreasonable. According to the present  Trade  Unions

Ordinance, before the Government can freeze the funds

of  any  trade union, an injunction should be applied

for in the High Court of Singapore. That is according

to  the  present Trade Unions Ordinance. But  in  the

past,  when the Government froze the funds  of  seven

unions  of  the  S.A.T.U. group, the Government  used

illegal  means  in  freezing  their  funds.  Now  the

Government  are  trying to pass a  Bill  to  legalise

their illegal acts in the past. For example, recently

the Singapore Business Houses Employees' Union wished

to make use of the union funds in the bank. According

to  their  rules,  the  funds in  the  event  of  the

dissolution of the unions should be distributed among

the  members. Now the Government are trying  to  race

against  time to pass this Bill in order  to  prevent

the members of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



union from having a share in the union's funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any law is to be given retrospective effect, it

is  improper,  and it is even more  improper  if  the

P.A.P. should  try  to make  use  of  this  Bill  to

legalise  their  illegal acts in  the  past.  Now  if

legislation is to serve the interests of the  P.A.P.,

then  the  P.A.P. can make laws and break laws.  Then

where  is  democracy? Where is the rule  of  law?  We

find,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker, that this  Trade  Unions

(Amendment)  Bill  is  a Bill  unprecedented  in  the

history of the trade union movement in Singapore.  It

is  a most undemocratic and dictatorial Bill. If  the

Government  should force through this Bill,  then  we

must  condemn them strongly and they should  be  held

responsible for any consequences.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I  am  looking at this Trade Unions (Amendment)

Bill  as  a piece of legislation, and as a  piece  of

legislation,  I see three objectionable  features  of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the Bill is made retrospective to be

applicable  to  unions which were being  closed  down

before this Bill has been discussed or passed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, any democratic

government  recognises as a fact  that  retrospective

legislation is a very bad thing. As far as I know, in

other  democratic  countries no government  has  ever

attempted   to   try   to   introduce   retrospective

legislation because, if once the door is  opened,  we

will  not know where we stand tomorrow. For instance,

today we have freedom of speech in this Assembly, but

tomorrow  we  may not have it here. The  speeches  we

make  before such a Bill is passed can also  be  made

effective retrospectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the second objectionable

feature  of this Bill is that the Minister will  have

the power to seize the funds of a union which he does

not  approve. Now when a member joins an association,

he  is  like a shareholder buying shares in a  public

company. May I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



state,  for  instance, a public company is mismanaged

or  some  of  its officials have misappropriated  the

funds  or  invested  them  in  contravention  of  the

objects of the company. There is nothing to prevent a

government  in future, based on this precedent,  from

seizing  the  funds of that company and putting  the,

likewise  into  the  Consolidated  Fund.  Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  very soon we might find  many  public

companies in Singapore being mismanaged - funds  being

lost,  the shareholders lodging complaints  with  the

Minister. [Interruption] I beg your pardon.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Are

you worried about your company?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I have no company. I think the

Ministers  should  investigate how many  shares  they

have  in  companies they should look after their  own

shares in companies!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is very unfair to

expropriate  the funds which rightly  belong  to  the

members.  When a person becomes a member of a  union,

or an association or a company, he has complete trust

that   the  articles  and  rules  approved   by   the

Government will be carried out to the letter. Now  we

have  a  Bill  which will supersede all the  previous

rules  and  constitutions approved by the Government,

and it will enable the Government to seize control of

the funds of the members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, clause 4 which gives power to

the  Minister  to  seize  union  funds  is  most

objectionable. If the Government have any  reason  to

close  down  a union - any reason that they  can  give -

the  funds  should  rightly go  back  to  the  union

members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third objectionable feature, Sir, is that this

Bill gives too much power to the Minister. My view is

that trade union funds rightly belong to the members.

The  Registrar  of Trade Unions has a legal  duty  to

discharge   to   see   that   the   funds   are   not

misappropriated  or misused by union  officials  and,

for  this  reason, the best way is to strengthen  the

Registry of Trade Unions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of this Bill enables the Minister to act on

information  given  to the Registrar.  The  Registrar

might  have  obtained  false  information.  You   may

remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that at  one  time

there  was some false information about Tommy Koh,  a

university  student  who  was  supposed  to  be  with

student  pickets, whereas he was actually in  Cameron

Highands,  This sort of thing might happen again.  An

informer  might lodge a complaint with the  Registrar

of  Trade  Unions that a meeting is to be held  on  a

certain  night  and  that the  union  funds  will  be

appropriated.   The   Minister,   acting   on    this

information, will immediately freeze the union funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is sufficient

provision  in  the  Penal Code to institute  criminal

breach   of  trust  proceedings  against  any   union

official who misappropriates or misuses union funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, I feel that this Trade Unions

(Amendment) Bill should not be passed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

a  little  while ago, the Member for Jurong raised  a

hue  and cry over this Bill. We know why he has  made

such   a  strong  protest  against  it.  Before   the

elections,  the  Barisan had been  warned  that  once

merger took place, every step would be taken to check

the pro-Communists from manipulating the unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, our object is to prevent them from using the unions and other civic organisations for activities which are inconsistent with our national interest. Their allegation that precautionary or whatever steps we take to checkmate them are detrimental to the workers is far from the

truth.  This is the very Bill that we are introducing

in order to protect the interest of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will explain to this House how the pro-Communist

elements  in  the unions manipulate  the  unions  and

union funds. I will dwell on this point later.



Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, at present the Trade Unions Ordinance  has  provision to deal with such  matters. But this is an old Ordinance which does not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



make provision to cope with the situation that we are

faced with at the moment - that is, the manipulation of

the  trade unions by the pro-Communists. If they  had

been  honest and served the interest of the  workers,

we  would not have had to move this Bill to amend the

Ordinance  this afternoon, in the present  Ordinance,

there  is  provision to say that in the  event  of  a

union   being   deregistered  by  the  Registrar   or

dissolved on its own resolution, the assets and funds

of  the union should be distributed according to  its

rules  and constitution. If there are people who  are

genuinely looking after the interest of the  workers,

the   present  Ordinance  will  have  sufficed.  But,

unfortunately,  we  have  an  unscrupulous  group  of

persons who are manipulating the unions and they find

ways  and  means  to overcome the provisions  of  the

Ordinance, not only to exploit the workers  but  also

their funds - as they say "the sweat and blood of  the

workers".  This  is exactly so, Mr  Deputy  Speaker,

Sir;  we  know that that is the workers' money  - from

the  sweat and blood of the workers. And we  want  to

preserve it. That is the present position with regard

to  the  Ordinance. When the three trade unions  were

served  with  notice of cancellation - mind  you,  Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, only a notice was served to  ask

them to show cause why the registration of the unions

should  be  cancelled; the Registrar  had  not  taken

action yet, and they had ample time - two months' time

- to  convince  and  satisfy  the  Registrar  why  the

registration  of the unions should not  be  cancelled

- the  general election was around the corner  and  we

had  information that the people behind these  unions

intended to withdraw large sums of money not for  use

in the interest of the workers but in the interest of

the  Barisan. Therefore, the Registrar  had  to  take

action  to  preserve the workers'  money.  After  the

election,  that  is, after one month  of  the  notice

served  by the Registrar, the so-called officials  of

these unions with their legal adviser threatened  the

bank  to  allow them to withdraw a sum of  money.  We

were  not  aware  of this until the  money  had  been

withdrawn  from the bank. Immediately  the  Registrar

came to know about this withdrawal, he wrote



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



a  letter to the unions and their legal adviser. They

replied  to say that this sum of money was  withdrawn

to  pay  for  the  services  of  their  comrades  Mr

Woodhull,   Mr   Fong  Swee  Suan  and   Mr   Bani,

immediately the Registrar wrote to them that this was

an  unlawful  use  of union funds.  Their  own  legal

adviser  wrote back to admit that that was  unlawful.

Therefore  we  told them, "All right,  now  you  have

withdrawn this sum of money. Will you please  put  it

back into the bank?" But no, they still clung to that

sum  of  money. But when the Registrar threatened  to

take  action  against the legal adviser, the  latter,

probably from his professional point of view, quickly

passed   back  the  money  to  the  union  officials.

Therefore, we had to chase after them for this sum of

money.  Ultimately they went underground, the  minute

books  and other things disappeared. For this reason,

the  Registrar was compelled to report the matter  to

the  police.  Anyway there will be  a  Commission  of

Inquiry which will look into this matter. So  I  will

not go into details.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is this, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, If

their  argument is that while the notice  was  served

they  needed money to defray administrative expenses,

there  was  no  such hurry. They were asked  to  show

cause within these two months why the registration of

the  unions should not be cancelled. If they had  any

bill to pay, what they could do was to tell the shops

or  any one who pressed for payment, "All right,  the

Registrar  has  seized our funds at  the  moment.  So

during  these two months, we will have to  await  the

decision as to whether the Registrar's notice will be

withdrawn - that is, no cancellation will be  effected

- or  whether  the  registration  of  the  unions   is

cancelled."  Even if the registration of  the  unions

was  cancelled ultimately, the bills could  still  be

paid, because there was a rule to the effect that the

unions  had  to  pay  for whatever  liabilities  they

incurred. Therefore, the outstanding debts  could  be

paid.  Therefore, there was no hurry  whatsoever  for

the  unions - especially these three unions that  were

under notice - to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



threaten  the  bank to allow them to  withdraw  large

sums of money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, these are the main causes that have motivated us to move this amending Bill so that the Registrar will have power to seize the funds of a union when it is served with a notice, otherwise the money of the workers will not be safeguarded, or it will disappear for some motives other than in the

interest of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has said that this is a

repressive law to obstruct the trade union  movement.

Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, can he cite an instance? Can

he point out in what way the workers will be affected

by this Bill? Of course, he has cited that in case  a

union  calls a strike it cannot withdraw  its  funds.

Mr  Deputy  Speaker, Sir, the words  used  here  are

"Where a notice has been given by the Registrar to  a

trade  union". Now if a union has done nothing  wrong

and has not been served with a notice, of course,  it

is  not  affected by this Bill. So in what  way  will

this  Bill  affect  or  hinder  the  workers  in  the

struggle for better terms and conditions of service?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, he has mentioned that we have exercised

our  power  to  freeze the funds of  the  Naval  Base

Workers' Union. That is not true. We have never  done

that. He has also mentioned that this amendment  will

affect  the  unions  in  their  expansion  of   union

branches  and in promoting cultural activities.  That

is  untrue.  Any  union can expand its  branches  and

promote activities, but this can only be done if  its

constitution provides for such activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also mention just now that even the Federation

have  no  such similar Ordinance. Again that  is  not

true. At the moment, the Registrar of Trade Unions in

the  Federation has full power to make directions  on

the  use of union funds when a union is under notice.

Of  course, they say that this is a dictatorial piece

of  legislation because the Minister can exercise his

discretion. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in clause  4  of

the  Bill which proposes the new section 18A,  it  is

provided that:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Upon the dissolution of a trade union under the

provisions of section 18 of this Ordinance -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the property of the trade union shall

forthwith  vest  in  the Official  Assignee  in

Bankruptcy;'.



<br><br>When  this Bill is passed, the position will be  that

as  soon as a union is dissolved either by itself  or

by  cancellation by the Registrar, whatever  property

that  union  possesses  must  vest  in  the  Official

Assignee. The reason why we want this is that we have

unscrupulous  persons in these seven cancelled  trade

unions, and only through this provision can we remove

them  from the possession of workers' property.  Once

the   Official  Assignee  takes  possession  of   the

properly,  what does he do? There are two  provisions

there:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(b) the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy shall

proceed to wind up the affairs of the trade union and

after  satisfying  and providing for  all  debts  and

liabilities  of  the trade union  and  the  costs  of

winding  up shall pay the surplus assets, if any,  of

the trade union -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) where the Minister so directs, into the

Consolidated Fund; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) in the absence of a direction from the

Minister, in accordance with the rules  of  the

trade union.'.



<br><br>So, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are two provisions

here.  The Member for Hong Lim mentions that this  is

dictatorial  and  that  the Minister  can  abuse  his

power.  Provision  18A (b)  (i)  is  made  because,  in

certain  cases, the situation may be such that  there

is  no  record as to how the funds can be fairly  and

justly  distributed to all the members who belong  to

that union. In those circumstances, then probably the

Minister may have to exercise his discretion  to  pay

that  money back into the State. The money goes  into

the Consolidated Fund and into the State; it does not

go to anyone else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second provision there, 18A (b) (ii) , the

money can be distributed in accordance with the rules

of   the   trade  union.  Therefore,  where  is   the

dictatorial power that the Minister will assume  with

the  so-called provision where the Minister will  act

according  to  his  whims  and  fancies?  All   these

allegations are untrue.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, just now the Member for Hong Lim has mentioned the retrospective effect of this Bill. Due to the inadequate provision of the present Ordinance, in the past few years there were many unions which were dissolved or cancelled for not properly distributing the funds to the workers.

Therefore, in order that this matter can be  settled,

we  take  this opportunity to incorporate it in  this

amending Bill, so that provision can be made for  all

such  matters to be disposed of according to the law.

So  whatever  money  is due to the  workers  will  be

accordingly returned to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all this roughly rebuts the criticisms that have been made against this Bill. But I think the Member for Jurong has made his allegations not because this amending Bill is going to hurt the workers' movement but rather it is going to hurt the anti-national movement. Therefore, it is

their  business  and  not  a  matter  for  us  to  be

concerned with. What we are concerned with is to  see

that  whatever money is due to the workers should  be

fairly  and justly returned to them. That is  why  we

have introduced this amending Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, my colleague the Member for Jurong  has

said  that  this  Trade Unions  (Amendment)  Bill  is

introduced by the P.A.P. for various purposes. One of

the  purposes is to legalise their illegal acts  done

in the past. They have not acted according to the law

when  they froze the funds of the three trade unions.

Now they come to this House for the power to legalise

their  past  actions.  If  they  have  done  anything

illegal,   i.e. without  abiding  by   any   proper

procedure, they come to this House to ask  the  House

to condone their actions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find this kind of attitude which they are now

action  which the P.A.P. are now taking. He  did  not

resort  to  laws passed in this House. The Government

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

the  Party  in  power  attempt to  legalise  what  is

illegal  and to right what is wrong. This  is  a  new

kind  of democracy of the P.A.P. It is a most serious

blemish  on democracy. This amending Bill  smacks  of

Fascism and dictatorship. They say that the intention

of  the  Bill  is to prevent the activities  of  pro-Communist  trade unions from being carried  out.  But

what  they actually have in mind is to turn all  non-P.A.P. trade unions into pro-Communist  unions.  Can

they  legally prove that these trade unions are  pro-Communist or Communist organisations? You can  accuse

anybody  of being a Communist or a running  dog,  but

where is the legal evidence? None at all; they cannot

advance any evidence to prove their allegations. What

they can do is to produce this Bill here so that they

can  have the power to control all trade unions which

are non-P.A.P. and to eradicate or wipe out all those

trade  unions  which  do not support  them.  If  they

attempt  to  do so, then trade unionism  will  be  in

difficulty.  This  kind  of action  is  very  serious

indeed, because the P.A.P. are abusing their majority

position in this House to give themselves dictatorial

powers.  This action of theirs smacks of Fascism  and

dictatorship.  They  claim that  the  people  elected

them.  But  the  people  did not  elect  them  to  be

dictators. The people will never condone their desire

for  dictatorial powers. The people did not give them

the  power to do whatever they like when they elected

them.  I  would  say  that the introduction  of  this

P.A.P.  Bill  will  brand them in the  end  as  anti-Communists. They call us traitors. But this Bill will

finally  land them in a position where they  will  be

the traitors. It is full of Fascist ideologies. If it

is approved and implemented, we will see more Fascist

methods  being employed by the P.A.P. in the  future.

They  will  be able to deal with all the people  whom

they do not like. Will this be good for the people in

the  end?  It  will only endanger the rights  of  the

people.  In the end the rights of the people will  be

undermined.  I hope the P.A.P. will not make  use  of

their  majority position in this House to abuse their

powers. If they abuse their powers,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



then  in  the end it will not only be detrimental  to

the  people  but  also to the P.A.P. themselves.  The

Bill  gives  very  wide powers  to  the  Minister  to

control and take action against those unions which do

not belong to the P.A.P. The Ministers and the P.A.P.

have shown in the past that they can make use of  the

law to deal with people whom they do not like.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, when this Bill is passed, it will

provide  them  with further powers  to  take  further

repressive  actions against the workers.  The  powers

will enable them to do more things detrimental to the

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Member for Bras Basah will examine this

Bill  in  a  democratic spirit,  dispassionately  and

objectively. I also hope that Members of  this  House

who are not P.A.P. Ministers will look into this Bill

objectively. They will find that it will  hinder  the

growth  of  trade  unionism and democracy.  With  the

passing  of  this Bill, a non-P.A.P. Government  will

also  follow  suit.  This will be  a  great  blow  to

democracy. The P.A.P. have been smearing those  trade

unions  which  have been banned and closed  by  them.

They have accused them of misusing the unions' funds.

I  would  like  to ask a question. To whom  do  these

funds  belong? The answer is that they belong to  the

workers who are members of trade unions. The question

whether  or  not  the funds of the unions  have  been

misused should be left to the workers to decide.  The

decision  should not be made by the P.A.P. oligarchy.

What  right have they to say that the funds have been

misused when the workers themselves do not think  so?

Are  they  the  office-bearers of the  trade  unions?

Therefore, the P.A.P. is not the arbiter or the judge

to   decide  whether  trade  union  funds  have  been

misused.  The  arbiter should be the members  of  the

unions themselves. The workers and the office-bearers

have  all along been members of the unions from their

inception  up  to  the  time  when  the  unions   are

dissolved.   They   have   never   expressed    their

disapproval of the activities of the trade unions and

the  guidance  of  their  leaders.  This  shows  that

whatever actions that have been taken in the past  by

the leaders have had the approval



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



of  the  workers and members of the unions concerned.

This  also  shows  that  the members  of  the  unions

concerned  supported them. The Minister  has  alleged

that the leaders of the unions have been misusing the

funds  of trade unions. How could he convince  others

of this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  you  will  agree  that  whenever  a  piece   of

legislation is introduced in this House, it is always

intended  to  protect the good citizens and  not  the

culprits. If the S.A.T.U.-controlled trade unions are

straightforward  and  make use  of  their  money  not

inconsistent with trade union activities, there is no

need  for  them to be afraid of any legislation  that

will be passed here. Therefore, why should they raise

strong  objections  to  this  Bill?  They  must  have

something at the back of their minds. They are afraid

legislation can stop these people from making use  of

their    money   to   further   their   anti-national

activities. That is the reason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Jurong is more a teacher

than  a  trade  unionist. He says  that  the  Malayan

Trades  Union Congress in the Federation have made  a

report  on  their  investigation of the  trade  union

situation in Singapore. But, on the other hand, he is

ignorant  of  the real facts concerning the  M.T.U.C.

team  that  has come to Singapore to investigate  the

trade union situation here. In fact, the M.T.U.C. in

the  Federation cannot even take part  in  any  trade

union  activity for the simple reason that it is  not

registered  under the Trade Unions Ordinance.  It  is

registered  under  the Societies  Ordinance.  So  the

Member of the Opposition is ignorant when he tries to

bring  in the stature of the M.T.U.C. and compare  it

with the trade union situation in Singapore, which is

quite irrelevant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in a democratic country it is

nothing  unusual for the people to criticise  the Government.

But whenever the Barisan Sosialis make  a criticism, they

always do it out of point. The reason why  I say they

do it out of point is this. They have even mentioned

that the funds of the Naval Base Union

were frozen. I think the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



Member  knows that the Naval Base Union's funds  have

never been frozen. He is making use of this House  to

publicise  this  statement so that  the  public  will

come  to  know  that they are the champions  of  the

workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak (Tampines)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy Speaker, I am giving my personal views on this

Trade  Unions  (Amendment) Bill. In the first  place,

let me deal with the intentions of the Government and

the  grounds  on  which this Bill are  tabled.  Their

grounds can be classified in three categories. In the

first place, they are tabling this Bill because  they

want to take action against those so-called Communist-controlled trade unions. Their claim that the  unions

are Communist-controlled is most unconvincing. Nobody

will  ever  believe  what they  say  about  Communist

activities in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason which they have put forward to

justify  this  Bill is this. There  are  many  unions

which   do  not  come  under  P.A.P. control.  Their

membership  is  strong. These unions  will  not  take

instructions   from  the  P.A.P.  The   P.A.P. are,

therefore,  introducing this piece of legislation  in

order to control these disobedient unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason they have given to justify the

introduction  of  the  Bill is this.  They  say  some

unions  are responsible for the industrial unrest  in

Singapore.   Therefore,  the   Government   want   to

consolidate their control over the unions in order to

safeguard the workers. The Government want  power  to

direct  trade  union officials to make their  workers

obedient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the reasons they have put forward to

justify  the introduction of this Bill. To put  in  a

nutshell. The P.A.P. are contemplating action against

all  those  trade unions which do not obey  them  and

which  refuse to allow themselves to be under  P.A.P.

control.  Why should the P.A.P. do such a  thing?  My

view is that the P.A.P. is a discredited Party in the

eyes of the workers in Singapore. It is difficult for

them to get



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



the   support  and  confidence  of  the  workers   in

Singapore  as a result of their bad reputation.  They

have already failed in gaining the confidence of  the

workers  because they have never given any assistance

to the workers in their struggle for their legitimate

rights and their betterment. They have already failed

in  the open confrontation and open argument. That is

why  they are amending the trade union laws to  their

own advantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to draw your attention to

is   that  the  Government  try  to  cover   up   the

shortcomings of their anti-labour policies. They want

to  control  all unions and all the workers  and  put

them in servitude. But they have already failed in so

doing. So to strengthen their position, they have  to

find some ways and means and they have found them  in

the  introduction of this Bill. The  failure  of  the

P.A.P.'s  labour  policies  is  known  to  everybody.

Therefore, where there is the existence of non-P.A.P.

trade  unions, the N.T.U.C. cannot survive. In places

where  there  are  workers  belonging  to  non-P.A.P.

unions, the N.T.U.C. can never find a way in. That is

why  the P.A.P. want to have this Bill to protect the

life and the existence of the N.T.U.C. They cannot do

so  in open competition, so they resort to some legal

means  to gain control over the non-P.A.P. unions  in

order to promote and strengthen the N.T.U.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that the P.A.P. desire to

further persecute the workers and the broad masses of

the  people.  In the past, many trade  union  leaders

were  arrested, workers were assaulted  and  yet  the

P.A.P. would not stop at that. They now realise  that

these  repressive actions of assault will never  lead

them  anywhere.  So  they put on  the  mask  of  open

argument and legal facade. That is why you have  this

Bill.  But this Bill is a very clear indication  that

the  Government  are wearing a mask  of  trade  union

democracy in Singapore.



The  Minister for Finance is particularly interested

in foreign capitalists. He has said on many occasions that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



strikes  of  the  Singapore workers threaten  foreign

investment in Singapore. They put the blame  for  the

hesitation of foreign investors to come to  Singapore

on the shoulders of the non-P.A.P. unions ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> On a point of order. Mr Deputy

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Will the Member for Tampines

Try to come back and speak on the Bill itself. He may

proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

I  was  just  trying to sketch to you the  background

behind this Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill. Since  you

do  not want me to go further into the background,  I

shall not go further into it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill has been introduced because some unions in the S.A.T.U. group were given notice to show cause why their registration should not be cancelled. These unions were not able to give satisfactory reasons. Also some of them have withdrawn some money from

their   banks.   In  view  of  this  situation,   the

Government  have  introduced this Bill  in  order  to

exercise  some  control over the  non-P.A.P. unions.

This is going to give some undemocratic powers to the

Registrar of Trade Unions against non-P.A.P.  unions.

The  position  is  this.  Instead  of  the  Registrar

telling  the world how wrong these unions  are,  they

want  them to show cause why they are right. In other

words,  "I want to kill you" instead of "I am telling

you  and  showing the world that you are guilty.  You

have  to tell me why you should not be killed."  This

is  the  position. This is not in any  way  different

from   the   methods  of  dictatorship  and   Fascist

countries.  If  any of the unions  belonging  to  the

S.A.T.U. group has acted against the trade union laws

or any laws existing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



in  Singapore,  it can be prosecuted and  charged  in

court. Evidence can be produced in court to show what

offence the union in question has committed and  then

the punishment can be imposed on the offending union.

But  this  is  not done and this is  not  a  practice

unfortunately ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> On a point of order. The

amendment  before us is whether we should give  power

to  the Minister to freeze the funds of the union  if

they are being given notice to show cause, and not to

discuss the deregistration of the unions. I think the

Member has now drifted away in that direction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Wasting time.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I agree with the

Minister  for Labour. I think the Member for Tampines

has  strayed  away again. Will he come  back  to  the

discussion on the Bill and not stray away? Make it as

short as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

the  deregistration of seven unions and the  freezing

of  their union funds are inter-related. But in  view

of  your ruling that I should not mention it further,

I shall go straight to the discussion on this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour has said just now that it

was  necessary  to freeze the funds  of  some  unions

because   the   officials   had   ulterior   motives.

Unfortunately, I was unable to hear from the Minister

for  Labour what those ulterior motives were, and  on

what  basis  he has made his allegation. Some  unions

have had their funds frozen not because they have any

ulterior motive, but because the Ministers themselves

have some filthy ulterior motives ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> On a point of order. The Member

is  referring  to the personal conduct of  Ministers,

saying  that we have inexplicable intentions.  But  I

have  to  inform Members that this Bill is  only  the

collective  wish  of the Cabinet and  not  of  myself

alone.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Will the Member for Tampines

not  make any unparliamentary personal remarks of any

Minister and proceed? He may proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

about  the  undesirable motives, the expression  came

from  the Minister himself. He said that some  unions

had  undesirable objectives in the administration  of

the  union  funds.  But  as a representative  of  the

people,  I  have to speak in defence of these  unions

which  have  been wronged and against which  wrongful

accusations  have been made. This is a decision  made

by   the   Minister.  If  you  want  to   shift   the

responsibility to the Cabinet, then I  will  say  the

P.A.P.  Cabinet have undesirable motives in  freezing

the  trade union funds and in tabling this Bill.  You

want  to  deprive certain unions of their  funds  and

then  you  turn round and say that these unions  have

ulterior  motives. It is just like a thief telling  a

rich  man,  "You have plenty of money  and  you  have

undesirable motives in making use of your  money.  So

that  is  the  reason why I shall  rob  you  of  your

money."  This is precisely the analogy that  one  can

draw from this Bill. Trade union funds come from  the

sweat  and  labour of the workers who are members  of

the  trade unions. So the funds should rightly belong

to  the  members  themselves.  The  decision  on  the

disposal  of the funds should not be decided  by  the

P.A.P. Cabinet. They should be decided by the workers

themselves. We ask whether the P.A.P. Cabinet is,  in

substance,   the   same  as  the  Central   Executive

Committee  of any trade union, so as to  be  able  to

decide  on the disposal of the trade union funds.  So

the  position  now  is that a thief  wishing  to  rob

another person of his money says that this person has

undesirable intentions to use his money and make  use

of this allegation as the reason to rob him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the gratuity paid to some of the unionists,

this  was  also  a reason given by the Government  to

justify  the introduction of the Bill. Regarding  the

gratuity  payment by the union to  some  of  its  ex-officials, do you mean that the union has no right to

decide on this and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



it  should meet with condemnation from the P.A.P.? Is

there  anything  wrong if the union decides  to  give

some  gratuity payment to some of their advisers  and

their  leaders as an expression of respect for  their

leaders and advisers ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I do not see the

relevancy  of  gratuity in the debate on  this  Bill.

Will the Member for Tampines get on to the discussion

of   this  Trade  Unions  (Amendment)  Bill!  He  may

proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, whether the question of gratuity payment has any

connection  with this Bill or not, I do not  want  to

argue.  But  this  question of gratuity  payment  was

touched  upon  by  the Minister  for  Labour  in  his

accusation  against  some  of  the  leaders  of   the

S.G.E.U. If you rule that this is irrelevant  to  the

Bill,  then  I will not proceed any further  on  this

point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read an open letter by the unions addressed

to  the Registrar of Trade Unions, the Press, and the

Barisan  Sosialis agent. When this amount of $13,50()

was  withdrawn  from  the bank, how  was  this  money

spent?  The  Registrar wrote to the  union  officials

asking  them to give reasons why they withdrew  money

from  the  bank and for what purposes was  the  money

withdrawn.  The official of the S.G.E.U. listed  the

reasons for the withdrawal. His reasons were (1)   the

executive  committee  of  the  unions  had  passed  a

resolution authorising the President, Vice-President,

and Treasurer, to withdraw the money from the bank to

be  spent  as follows: $4,500 to be used as a  strike

fund  to assist the striking workers; (2)  this  would

enable them to have some means of livelihood, and (3)

would  prolong their struggle against oppression  and

exploitation and to ensure victory. The workers  went

on  strike  because they are against the exploitation

and  suppression of the employers. Is there  anything

wrong with the manner in which the money was spent?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> On a point of order, Sir, I am

this  amending Bill to the Ordinance.  But  here  the

which  is  to be set up. The Commission will  be  too

glad  to  have  the co-operation of  the  Member  for

Tampines  bear  this in mind and not go  into  too  much

I hope I can be heard in silence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the second and third reasons for the

use  of the money, it is clear that this sum of money

was  used  to  assist  those who  were  arrested  and

detained.  The leaders of the trade unions have  been

arrested,  workers have bean assaulted, and therefore

the  unions  in  safeguarding the  interests  of  the

workers have withdrawn this sum of money in order  to

assist  the relatives of the arrested leaders of  the

unions.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand why the Government should say

it  is wrong for them to do such a thing. The purpose

of the withdrawal of the funds does not constitute  a

threat  to  the interests of the people. The  Central

Government have arrested the union leaders  with  the

support of the P.A.P. and relatives of those arrested

<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the circumstances and facts I have mentioned just now

are related to this Bill. The unions withdrew $13,500

to  be  used  for rightful purposes, but  the  P.A.P.

accuse  the unions of having misused this money,  and

that  they  have introduced this Bill  to  deal  with

them.  I say that the money was expended in a  proper

manner by the unions.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, he may proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank  you.  The  leaders of  the  S.G.E.U. and  the

Singapore  Bus Workers Union have been arrested.  The

unions   voluntarily  withdrew  the  money  to   help

relatives of those arrested. What is wrong with that?

The  Government not only want to persecute the  trade

union leaders but also want to resort to all sorts of

measures  to starve the relatives of the trade  union

leaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to ask the Government this: the

Cabinet  is not an executive committee of  the  trade

unions.  So what right have the Government to  freeze

and  seize  the  funds of the trade  unions?  It  the

Cabinet  is human, then this sum of money  should  be

handed  over to the trade union officials and  to  be

used  to  look after the welfare of the relatives  of

the   arrested  trade  union  leaders,   or   to   be

distributed  among the members of  the  trade  unions

concerned. This sum of money should be handed over to

the   executive  committees  of  the   trade   unions

concerned and let them make their own decision as  to

how  this money should be used, or be distributed  to

the  members fairly among them. I do not believe that

since  the  registration  of  the  unions  has   been

cancelled,  their  members  become  illegal  and  are

Communists.   The  P.A.P.  Cabinet   has   no   right

whatsoever to introduce this amending Bill to  enable

the Government to put the money into the Consolidated

Fund. The Government

accuse  the  trade  union leaders  of  the  cancelled

unions  of  not  having given sound reasons  for  the

withdrawal  of  the money from the banks.  The  Vice-President  and  Treasurer of  the  S.G.E.U. wrote  a

letter  to  the  Registrar  of  Trade  Unions.  These

leaders  have been persecuted and arrested. Wong  Pow

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the Statement handed in to the Clerk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is fortunate indeed that this first wave of

saboteurs has been relatively unsuccessful  and  that

their   network   has  been  extensively   disrupted.

However,  it  is  expected  that  further  and   more

determined  attempts will be made by more intensively

trained commando-type saboteurs, both Indonesians and

local  fifth columnists. All people must  be  on  the

alert  and immediately report any suspicious movement

or  activity to the police through the 999  telephone

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligence information so far available shows a

concerted  plan starting early in 1960  for  cultural

and   ideological   penetration  of   groups   either

sympathetic to Indonesia or hostile to this  country.

It is worth noting that these activities commenced  a

year before Malaysia was first mooted by the Tunku in

May 1961. From June to November 1962, over 50 persons

went  to  Indonesia from Singapore as volunteers  for

the  liberation of West Irian. Seventy went from  the

other  States in the peninsula. At the end  of  1962,

these  volunteers returned to Singapore  and  Malaya.

Indonesian  Consulate officials here  and  Indonesian

Embassy  officials  in K.L. maintained  contact  with

them. From April to September this year, a number  of

these    persons   who   were   already   politically

indoctrinated were sent for further training  courses

at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>



Tanjong  Sekupang, a few miles south of Singapore  in

the Rhio Islands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their operations in Singapore, the local

representatives   of  this  Indonesian   intelligence

organisation  at  Tanjong Sekupang used  three  dummy

commercial   organisations   as   cover   for   their

intelligence   operations  and   for   the   finances

required -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) G.E.M.I. otherwise known as the Gerakan Ekonomi Melayu Indonesia;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Duma Corporation at Bussorah Street and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Malaysia Indonesia Corporation at Beach Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training of these fifth columnists at Tanjong

Sekupang consisted of military close combat, sabotage

and  political  propaganda  against  Malaysia.  Their

instructions on return to Singapore were to  sabotage

petrol  dumps, railway lines and, in particular,  the

Tebrau   water  works  and  the  water  pipeline   to

Singapore,  and the Pasir Panjang Power  Station.  In

the  event  of  their  being unable  to  reach  these

targets,  they  were  instructed  to  explode   their

charges  anywhere  in Singapore with  the  object  of

causing damage and public alarm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that there have been five

explosions   in   Singapore  so  far.   The   leading

Indonesian national arrested is M. Sihombeng,  former

Indonesian  Consulate official in  Singapore  and  an

official of the D.U.M.A. Corporation and the Malaysia

Indonesia  Corporation. He was arrested at 7.30  p.m.

on  10th  December  as  he was  about  to  flee  from

Singapore to Pulau Samboe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following upon the arrest and interrogation of the

24 persons, a large quantity of explosives, Sten guns

and hand grenades were recovered. However, it is also

known  that  some  explosives and weapons  have  been

passed on to other fifth columnists who are still  at

large.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typical of the kind of person who has been drawn

into  these traitorous activities in return for cash,

arms and a sense of power and mystery in a cloak-and-dagger outfit is Osman Bin Zainal Abidin, former Hang

Tuah  leader  and  detainee. Interrogation  disclosed

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



they  were  planning, with the aid of the  Indonesian

Government,   to   stage  an  armed  revolution   and

overthrow the Government of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is known that nine Chinese West Irian returned

volunteers,  including  a young  woman  who  acquired

temporary  fame for a parachute jump,  started  their

training  at Tanjong Sekupang in the Rhio Islands  on

the  1st December, some 17 days ago. It is also known

that  some of the explosives now missing have  passed

through  the hands of Chinese. Explosives and weapons

have  been  recovered from places as strange  as  the

hedge   behind  a  house  near  the  Chief  Justice's

residence  at Nassim Road, the backlane  of  a  house

where  a  private generator supplied  electricity  to

Kampong  Amber  in Katong, the back of  a  mosque  at

Jalan Abadi off Jalan Eunos, and at Kallang Park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The operation of these saboteurs will be made

difficult  if  the  public  give  prompt  and   quick

information on any suspicious movement of persons  or

cars,  in  particular of any person found  carrying

packages   in  plastic  travel  bags  under   unusual

circumstances,  unusual either  in  time,  place,  or

manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, all West Irian volunteers who have

returned to Singapore and are not connected with this

intelligence organisation for sabotage should  report

to  the C.I.D. as soon as possible with their present

places of abode and employment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Member for Bras Basah has said just now that the

introduction  of this Bill is meant to  protect  law-abiding  workers.  I do not know why  the  Government

should  have prevented the Singapore Business  Houses

Employees' Union from withdrawing its money from  the

bank after it was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



banned. The Minister for Labour has said that  it  is

his  intention to get the Bill through all its  three

stages and have it passed. I do not know why if  this

Bill  is  very important, it should be taken  through

all   its  stages  so  hastily.  Why  is  this  being

introduced  at a time when certain trade unions  have

already withdrawn their funds from the bank, and also

at  a  time when the Government have already admitted

that they have taken action in the past to freeze the

unions' funds in the banks? Their action has not  the

full backing of the law. It is not easy to understand

why,  in  introducing this urgent Bill in this  House

today,  the P.A.P. should have given specious reasons

to  cover  up  their real intention. I think  one  of

their  intentions is to legalise their  past  actions

which were illegal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now touch on the opinions of the Malayan

Trades Union Congress which were reported in the  Sin

Chew  Jit Poh. From what the Government Benchers have

said about this matter and also from what is reported

in  the Sin Chew Jit Poh and other newspapers, we can

see  that  whatever the P.A.P. have done  has  caused

dissatisfaction not only to the people and workers of

Singapore  but also to the people and workers  across

the  Causeway. This is a fact which cannot be  denied

by  anybody. The Member for Bras Basah may  deny  the

important role of the M.T.U.C. But I would  say  that

the   M.T.U.C. has  a  large  membership   in   the

Federation.  It occupies an important  place  in  the

field  of  trade unionism in Malaya.  We  should  not

overlook  the  opinions which they have expressed  on

the situation of trade unionism in Singapore today. I

would like to refer to what the Member for Bras Basah

has  said  regarding the banning of trade unions  and

other   actions   taken   against   them   and    his

justification for them. All this goes  to  show  that

the  P.A.P. have taken suppressive action against the

workers.  They are trying to ride over the  heads  of

the workers. That is their intention.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



across  the Floor are really not taking any  interest

in the grievances of the workers. Nor have they taken

a  keen  interest  in  how to  bring  better  working

conditions to their fellow workers in the country. On

the contrary, they are interested in the funds of the

union.  Can  any  Member over  there  answer  me  one

question?  Are not workers in our country  adequately

provided  with  good  working  conditions  under  the

Labour  Ordinance? Our fellow workers in this country

are more highly paid than their counterparts in Japan

or Hongkong. I must point out to the Barisan Sosialis

that  the  good trade unionists will always show  how

best  they can conclude the number of agreements with

the  employers and not in the number of strikes  they

can  call. I think this House will agree with me that

we  should proceed to discuss the amending  Bill  and

not waste any more time in this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, just now the Member for  River  Valley

has  said that in the whole of South-East Asia  there

is  no country in which the workers have a better lot

than  Singapore. Perhaps it is so. But  it  does  not

mean  that  when the Singapore workers are  well  off

their  funds  should be controlled by the Government.

The union funds of the workers are built up by the $1

per month subscription contributed by each worker. So

you  just cannot say that when the workers are  quite

well  off  the  Government should have  control  over

their trade union funds --- [Interruption]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I want you to stop the Minister for Labour

from interrupting me.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I request the Members from the

Government   side   to  afford  the   Opposition   an

opportunity to say what they like in silence. We  are

all  anxious  to  finish  this  debate  as  soon   as

possible. The fewer the interruptions, the faster  we

go on. Mr Kow.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): So when you talk

about  Legislation, Mr Speaker, we  should  not  use

this  argument against the workers. It does not  mean

that  when  the  workers are well  off,  their  funds

should be controlled and put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



into  the Consolidated Fund. This is purely illogical

and irrelevant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Bras Basah says that all the

Bills tabled by the Government will always meet  with

our  uncalled for criticism. But he fails to remember

and appreciate that we are Opposition Members elected

by  the  people to express our views on the Bills  of

the  Government. It is our right to express our views

and  criticise  the Bills of the Government.  If  the

Government do not want this right to be with us, then

they can introduce another Bill to deprive us of such

right.  If you want to, you can do so. It is a matter

of  whether you want it or not. If you want  to,  you

can  just  have  a  law  to say that  the  Opposition

Members will have no right to speak here ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the

Member for Bras Basah says that if we have nothing to

hide,  we should have nothing to fear. But the P.A.P.

Government in the past did a lot of things  by  using

the  State machinery against innocent people.  Public

funds  were used in the interests of the P.A.P. These

are facts, and the people are afraid. So these people

have  a  guilty conscience that every move of  theirs

will  arouse suspicion on the part of the  people  in

general  because  of  their  past  acts.  We  in  the

Opposition and the people outside the House have  the

right  to  express  our  views  on  this  Bill  under

discussion now. We have the right to criticise it. If

there  is  no ulterior motive in the introduction  of

this  Bill,  why  is there such a hurry?  Why  should

there be a Certificate of Urgency to enable this Bill

to  go through all the three stages? This is full  of

ulterior  motives. From this urgency one can  rightly

suspect  that  there is some ulterior  motive  behind

this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, since the P.A.P. came to power, what are its labour policies? We have to look at this question first. One must appreciate that there is no smoke without fire, and nobody can deny this fact. Facts are facts and they cannot be explained away. When the P.A.P. came to power, it started its lunatic

and barbaric



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



actions against trade union leaders  and  trade

unions. Patriotic nationals have been arrested by the

P.A.P. --- [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I had occasion before to ask

Members  to  allow the Member for Paya  Lebar  to  be

heard  in silence, and I do not want any more further

interruptions. Mr Kow, please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If their amending

Bill has nothing to hide, then I think they should be

silent and listen to me. Because their Bill has  some

ulterior motive, that is why they are interrupting to

cover up this ulterior motive. They have taken action

against  seven Left-wing trade unions which are  very

influential  in  Singapore;  thinking  that  by  this

action  against trade unions and their  leaders,  the

members  of such unions will go over to the  N.T.U.C.

and   be  controlled  by  them.  This  is  what   the

Government  hope will happen. But in spite  of  these

repressive actions and arrests, the members of  these

unions  are  still on their own side.  They  are  not

allowing themselves to be exploited by the P.A.P.  So

the  P.A.P. are  unable  to achieve  their  ulterior

motive.  Failing this, the P.A.P. are now introducing

this Bill which will give them another means by which

they  can  take  further  action  against  non-P.A.P.

unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, following the deregistration of some

trade  unions, the Government have even gone  a  step

further  to  establish  the so-called  Commission  of

Inquiry  to look into the trade union funds of  these

banned trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, why should the P.A.P. Government at

this   particular  moment,  not  earlier  or   later,

establish  a Commission of Inquiry? In the  meantime,

they introduce this Bill. Mr Speaker, Sir, they  are

doing  so  because they realise now  that  they  have

acted  against  the  law. Because  in  the  past  the

Registrar of Trade Unions had no right to freeze  the

funds  of  trade unions in the bank. This is  usually

the behaviour of the Registrar of Trade Unions. So in

so far as Singapore laws are concerned, the Registrar

of  Trade  Unions has acted against the law,  legally

speaking.  Everybody knows now, as  admitted  by  the

P.A.P., that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



Registrar of Trade Unions has no right under existing

laws to freeze trade union funds in the bank. So  the

P.A.P. are  now  introducing this Bill  to  legalise

their  illegal acts in having frozen the trade  union

funds in certain banks. But I want to tell them  that

although the powers are in their hands they must  try

to justify the use of their powers. They cannot abuse

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one other point to which I wish to draw your attention. That is, in introducing this Bill, the Government will be able to have the means to control trade unions in Singapore for a very long time to come. The P.A.P. will lay down certain lines and ask trade unions in Singapore

to  follow them. If they do not, then action will  be

taken  against  them.  If trade unions  in  Singapore

refuse  to  go along the way laid down by the  P.A.P.

then the P.A.P. will take action against them. In the

N.T.U.C. a  lot of leaders are trained according  to

the  ways  of the PAP. They are all going  along  the

path of the P.A.P. But there are unions which are not

allowing  themselves to be controlled by  the  P.A.P.

There are non-P.A.P. unions in Singapore ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> On a point of order. Mr Speaker,

Sir, we are here to debate the merits or demerits  of

the  amending  Bill.  I  do  not  see  there  is  any

relevance at all - the N.T.U.C. leaders are trained in

the P.A.P. way or are trained in the S.A.T.U. way.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes. Mr Speaker,

there  is much relationship between what I have  said

and  this  Bill. This is to expose the motive  behind

this Bill ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Paya Lebar is

<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am sorry, Mr

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



are now thinking of how best they can control the non-P.A.P. trade unions. The P.A.P. wish to have all  the

unions fall into their control and follow their line.

They  want  the  workers  to become  servile  to  the

On a point of order. Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member has

given a speech without looking at the Speaker. He has

been looking at this side. When the Minister gave his

speech, he was looking at the Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> When a Member speaks in the Assembly,

Bill ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is nearly five o'clock. I

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

before the tea-break I was giving my views on why the

P.A.P. wanted  to introduce this Bill  today.  Their

main  intention  is to control all  non-P.A.P. trade

unions  in  order  to win support  for  the  P.A.P.'s

future power thrust and power struggle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Bill, extensive powers are being given to

the  Minister who can make use of them to  deal  with

any trade union which is not under the control of the

P.A.P. in  order  to  ban it or  freeze  its  funds.

Therefore, we say that this Bill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



has  very serious and undesirable intentions  against

the  workers, because by virtue of the powers of  the

Ordinance  he  can  say that he is taking  action  in

accordance with the law. His every action can then be

justified  by  law. And the whole P.A.P. set-up  can

claim  that out country is under the rule of law,  so

they  are  doing things according to law. Under  such

pretext they can take action against all those  trade

unions  which  are not in agreement with  the  P.A.P.

That  is  why  I oppose this Trade Unions (Amendment)

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, this Bill will not meet with the support

of  the  workers, because no workers or trade  unions

had  been  consulted before it was drafted.  I  would

point  out  that  before the Bill  was  drafted,  the

Government  should  have consulted  the  workers  and

trade unions concerned and invited their views. Since

this Bill will provide powers to freeze the funds  of

the trade unions, it is the duty of the Government to

consult  the trade unions to enable them  to  discuss

among  themselves  and  to  help  the  Government  in

drafting a proper Bill by which the Minister will not

be  given  the opportunity of misusing the powers  of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now read out what the Minister for

Labour  has said about the Singapore Business  Houses

Employees' Union ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Surely the Member should not

take  out other unions' statements and read them  out

in   this   Assembly.  If  he  wants  to  read   such

statements, he can read them in the newspaper.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know what the Member for Paya

Lebar was proposing to do ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> The Member was proposing to

read out the whole statement issued by a trade union.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We have had this before. I remember

when  one  of the Members of the Opposition quoted  a

statement,  he was asked to quote the source  of  his

statement. That point was raised by the Minister  for

Culture. If the Member proposes to read the statement

which he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



has  with  him  and if it is relevant to  the  matter

under  discussion,  I  will allow  him  to  read  the

report.  If  he says, "The union said  this  and  the

union  said  that," the Minister would  be  right  in

getting up on a point of order and asking him for the

source of his information. This is exactly what he is

doing now. I will allow him to proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I think it is in order for

him  to quote from the statement, but he is proposing

to  read the whole statement in this House. That  was

what he said in Mandarin.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Well, let us see what he has to say.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now I was

saying  that  before  the Bill  was  introduced,  the

Government  should have consulted  the  trade  unions

concerned, so that nothing improper would be provided

in  this  Bill  and the members of the  trade  unions

would be given the opportunity to discuss and to know

and   be   assured  that  nothing  in  it  would   be

detrimental  to  their interests. We  have  not  been

properly  consulted and the Bill has been  circulated

to  us  Only today. In such a hurry, how can we  have

sufficient time to read the Bill and debate  upon  it

in  this  House? This is most unreasonable action  on

the  part  of the Minister. The Government  has  even

asked us to pass the Bill today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I shoud like to read out a statement issued by

the Singapore Business Houses Employees' Union:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This Union is of the opinion that the Registrar's

action  in giving notice to freeze the funds  of  the

Union  in the Bank is illegal, and the action  to  be

taken  in this regard is also illegal. In our  letter

of the 9th December, 1963, we already clearly pointed

out that only the ex-members of this Union can have a

share in the funds, in accordance with section 18 (c)

of  the  Trade Unions Ordinance and our  Trade  Union

Rules.  Thus, this fund should be divided  among  our

members.  The  Government knows very  well  that  our

reasoning has a concrete basis. All along our actions

have been legal. Now the Government is making use  of

specious  pretexts  to  take action  against  us,  to

introduce  the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill  in  the

Assembly  oil a Certificate of Urgency  in  order  to

enable  the  Minister or the Registrar  concerned  to

have the powers to deal with this matter,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



also  to  legalise  their past illegal  actions  with

regard  to the freezing of funds and to give a  legal

facade to their actions. In actual fact, there is  no

need  for  the  introduction of this  amending  Bill,

because  the  present  Trade  Unions  ordinance   can

achieve  the  same  purposes. That Ordinance  already

provides the Minister with power to freeze the  funds

of  a trade union in a bank. This implies that if the

Minister  wishes, he can force the dissolution  of  a

union  and seize the money of the Singapore  Business

Houses  Employees'  Union.  Judging  from  the   past

actions  of the P.A.P., nobody is in doubt  that  the

Singapore  Consolidated Fund  is  no  more  than  the

P.A.P.'s fund. This act of robbery is despicable. ----'



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is the point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> The point of order is that the

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The matter is relevant, Mr Minister.

Surely  he  can read it. We are discussing the  Trade

Unions (Amendment) Bill. He is free to give the views

of any trade union.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government might as well introduce a Bill to

enable  the  Ministers of the PAP, to rob  others  of

their   money.  We,  the  Singapore  Business  Houses

Employees'  Union, have the right to  appeal  to  the

P.A.P. leader, ship and the Members of this House and

the  members  of the public to rise up  against  this

unreasonable Bill.'



<br><br>Now,  this is the statement issued by the members  in

the   Singapore  Business  Houses  Employees'  Union.

Because  all  of us agree that this Bill is  actually

meant  to  deal  a great blow to the workers  and  is

detrimental  to  the  interests and  welfare  of  the

workers.  First of all, the Minister for  Labour  has

not  been  acting properly in introducing this  Bill,

because he has not given us ample time to read and to

discuss  before we debate on this Bill and no support

from the workers ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member is repeating himself. I

think only five minutes ago he mentioned the Minister

for Labour hardly giving him enough time to read this

Bill. Do not repeat. If he has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



new arguments, I am quite prepared to hear them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

only  wanted to say that the Minister for Labour  had

not consulted the trade unions concerned and no trade

union had given its opinion of this Bill, because  no

chance was given to them to air their views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that the purposes of the P.A.P.'s

introduction  of  the Bill are twofold:  firstly,  to

legalise  the Party's illegal acts and, secondly,  to

have some legal means to perpetrate and carry out its

future  repressive actions against the  workers.  The

Bill is also for the purpose of blinding the sight of

the  workers - to give the people a misconception. The

P.A.P. also  tried  to  mislead  the  public   into

believing  that, because of a fraudulent act  on  the

part  of  the leaders of the trade unions  concerned,

the funds of the trade unions have been frozen by the

Government.  The  P.A.P. should not  think  that,  by

using  this pretext, they can get the support of  the

workers  from non-P.A.P. unions. It can never achieve

this. I can tell them that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we should understand, first of all, how the trade unions and the funds of the trade unions came into being. These banned trade unions had a membership of more than 60,000 members. Had these unions' funds been misappropriated, how is it that there was $400,000 in the kitty? Had these unions'

funds  been misappropriated, they would not have  had

the  support of the workers, and they would not  have

had so much money by now. That they have such a large

sum  of  money only goes to show that the  management

had been carried out properly and without any defect.

Had  they  been misusing the $400,000, then today  we

would  not have been able to see the money any  more.

This  shows that they have not been squandering  away

the  money.  The Minister for Labour  says  that  the

union officials, when asked by the Registrar to  turn

up  to  see  him, did not turn up. But  what  is  the

actual  fact?  Is it a fact that, as claimed  by  the

Minister for Labour, these union officials dared  not

turn  up  to see the Registrar? No. Because  we  know

that the Registrar of Trade Unions had an appointment

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



see the officials of the Singapore General Employees'

Union  at  10.00 a.m. on the 3rd December, 1963,  but

the  letter  was received by the union only  at  1.00

p.m. the same day because they had been to visit  the

strike  at some other place. Thus the letter was  not

received  in  time.  But the  union  on  the  5th  of

December went to see the Registrar. They intended  to

see the Registrar, but before that the police went to

search  the residence of the leaders and their  union

premises on the 4th December, 1963. These facts go to

show that the Minister for Labour has not been giving

the  full  facts  to  this House. Talking  about  the

$13,500 union funds being withdrawn, I would say that

the  Executive  Committee of the union concerned  had

the full right under its union rules to decide on the

use  of  the  money and to withdraw it,  because  the

Central  Executive Committee had passed a  resolution

to  that  effect. The money belonged to  the  workers

belonging to the unions, and was accumulated  by  the

workers through their toil and sweat. This fund  does

not  belong  to the P.A.P. It is not from the  P.A.P.

kitty  or from Government coffers. Since it  did  not

belong  to  anybody else, what was wrong  with  their

withdrawing the money and with their use of the money

on the workers themselves as decided by the Executive

Committee?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say that the introduction of this Bill has been

too  hasty.  If the Bill is passed too hastily  today

through all the three Readings, I should say that  it

is  most  unreasonable, because we all know that  the

Bill has very much to do with the future of the whole

working  population, touching on their interests  and

welfare from now hence. The Bill should not be  dealt

with in a haphazard way. It is most unreasonable  and

abnormal.  We  the Opposition Members  had  not  been

given sufficient time to read the Bill. And there was

no time for us ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am sorry, but this is the third time

I  have  had  to remind the Member on this  point  of

insufficient time for the Opposition. Please  do  not

repeat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): How did the P.A.P.

treat non-P.A.P. trade unions? The P.A.P. resorted to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



suppression, deception and even resorted  to  getting

the  help  of the Central Government to suppress  the

workers and, through the Registrar, freeze the  funds

of the trade unions and prevent them from using their

own  money,  the  so-called "$15,000 incident".  They

also resorted to smearing the character and integrity

of the trade union leaders concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have already talked a lot about

this.  There  is  one thing we must ensure.  We  must

ensure that we' consult all the trade unions and  the

workers  concerned  about this  Bill.  That  is  most

important.  And we should not pass the  Bill  hastily without giving it proper time, or giving enough  time

or  opportunity  to the people concerned  to  express

their opinion. On behalf of the people concerned,  we

oppose  this  kind  of action of the  P.A.P.  If  the

P.A.P. would not like to look after the interests  of

the  people,  the  general masses, the  workers,  and

would only look after its own interests, and want  to

force  through  this Bill today, then here  we  would

lodge  the  strongest protest against the passing  of

the  Bill. I say that if it is passed without  regard

to  the opinion and the will of the trade unions,  of

the  workers concerned, we would lodge our  strongest

protest  against the Bill here in this  House.  Those

are our views on this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

there  is  one Chinese proverb, that if you  are  not

guilty  of  anything, then you will have no  fear  of

anybody  when your door is knocked in the  middle  of

the  night. So if you are not guilty of anything,  if

you  have  no  guilty conscience, why should  you  be

afraid  of  people freezing your funds?  The  Members

opposite  have stood up one after another  to  attack

this  Bill.  But  they are repeating  themselves  one

after   another.  They  have  called  us  "Fascists",

"dictatorial" - these are all tunes being played  over

and  over again, right from two years ago. There have

been  no  changes in their argument.  They  are  only

capable  of  repeating  themselves  and  their   past

leaders  in this House. One Hitler propaganda  expert

says  that  if  you repeat a lie one thousand  times,

then      you     may     be     able     to     convince



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



others that it is the truth. So  this  is  the

purpose  behind  their  talk.  They  are  calling  us

"Fascists",  "dictatorial" repeatedly.  So  they  are

actually   resorting  to  the   Fascist   method   of

propaganda.  They say that the people  are  on  their

side, they have the support of the broad masses,  the

workers and everybody, and that they have the support

of  all  concerned all over the world  and  all  over

Singapore. Now, is this really true? If they have the

support  of the people in Singapore, how is  it  that

they were not able to win power in the elections?  So

how  can  they  explain  away  their  defeat  in  the

elections? How can they deceive the people by  saying

that they have the support of the people?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We have heard all about the elections

for  the last nine days. The Minister should  try  to

confine his remarks to this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  have  said all this because since Members opposite

have   said   many   nonsensical  things   and   made

allegations  against us and further claim  that  they

have  the support of the people, then I have to stand

up  and  refute their arguments. But in any case,  we

can let that pass.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the main idea of this Bill is to

protect  the interests and properties of the workers,

and  to  protect the trade union funds so  that  such

funds  will  not be made use of by the  irresponsible

trade  union  leaders by way of gifts  to  their  so-called "union advisers", their "union leaders".  This

is an objective that we are trying to achieve through

this  Bill.  Now the behaviour of these irresponsible

trade  union leaders, as I have already said, amounts

to  the act of workers' traitors. If they really have

nothing  to hide, then where is the General Secretary

of  the Singapore General Employees' Union? Why is he

not here to explain that he has withdrawn their money

in  a legitimate manner? Why has he not explained how

the funds that he has withdrawn have been used? It is

because they have done something wrong that they  are

now in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



hiding. They are now trying to explain away the  fact

that they have done something wrong by saying that we

in  the  Government desire to arrest  them.  Now  why

should they disappear so conveniently soon after  the

funds  were withdrawn? Why should they accuse  us  of

having introduced this Bill when they themselves  are

guilty  of  an illegal act? Of course, we agree  that

the  funds  of the workers should be decided  by  the

workers  themselves, but we must not,  on  the  other

hand, allow the so-called "leaders of the workers" to

decide on the use of the funds of the workers.  These

so-called "leaders" tried to justify the use  of  the

trade  union  funds  withdrawn by  way  of  paying  a

"bonus" to their so-called "advisers". But I want  to

ask  them, "Did they consult the workers before  they

paid  this  so-called "bonus" to the union  advisers?

Did  they have the approval of the workers before the

payment  was  made for the benefit of  the  so-called

"union advisers"? No. They did not do so. They  never

consulted  the  workers.  This  decision  of   paying

"bonus" to the "leaders" and "advisers" was made in a

hurry by just a handful of them. That was during  the

election  time when a lot of money was  required  for

election   propaganda.  So  we  have  established   a

Commission of Inquiry to look into these funds having

been  misused. I am sure the Report of the Commission

of  Inquiry  will give a full picture  of  how  these

funds were misused. A few moments ago the Member  for

Jurong said that, according to the provisions of  the

Bill,  there  are opportunities for the  Minister  to

abuse his powers against the interests of the workers

and  to  break  up strikes conducted in a  legitimate

manner, that he can even go a step further and  abuse

his  powers  to  restrict  certain  unions  that   he

dislikes  from expanding their activities,  and  that

the  Government can misuse their power to freeze  the

unions funds. But he should realise that these powers

will  not  be misused by the Government. The Minister

will  have  no  power  to freeze  trade  union  funds

according  to  his  whims and fancies.  According  to

clause 2 of this Bill, section 15A reads:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where a notice has been given by the Registrar to

a  trade union under the provisions of subsection (2)

of  section  15 of this Ordinance, the Minister  may,

where  he  is  satisfied that it is likely  that  the

funds  of  the union may be misused, by order  direct

any bank in Singapore not to pay any money out of nor

to pay cheques drawn on the account of such union for

a specified period not exceeding three months.'



<br><br>So  the conditions are, first, when a notice has been

given  and, secondly, when the Minister is satisfied.

So  it  is not so easy for the Minister to abuse  his

powers.  There is one prerequisite, and that  is  the

notice must be served first on the union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new section 15A is very clear, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  Before the Minister can exercise his powers  to

freeze the union's funds, a notice must be served  on

the union by the Registrar in accordance with section

15  subsection (2)  of the Trade Unions  Ordinance  to

show  cause  why  its  registration  should  not   be

cancelled. This is the prerequisite under  which  the

Minister may only exercise his powers. It is  not  so

easy  for  the  Minister to exercise his  powers,  as

alleged by the Members opposite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another allegation is that we are trying to

rush  through this Bill. But the fact is that  before

we  introduced this Bill in my Ministerial  statement

on  11th December, 1963, we indicated that a Bill  of

this  nature  would  be  tabled  and,  in  fact,   we

distributed  copies  of it to  Members  opposite  for

their examination and study. So from 11th December up

to  the present moment, the Members have had at least

one  week to enable them to go through the provisions

of  this Bill. How can they say that no time has been

given to them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong says that even the Malayan

Trades Union Congress have accused us of having  made

use  of the State machinery against non-P.A.P. trade

unions. I will say that this allegation is untrue. It

is  not  necessarily true that trade unions which  do

not endorse P.A.P. views are not allowed to exist. We

deny  facilities to those unions which are controlled

by  the  Communists.  As  long  as  a  union  is  not

controlled by the Communists, then it will  be  given

all  sorts of facilities to carry out its activities,

whether it is a P.A.P. union or a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



non-P.A.P. union.  We  only  deny  the   Communist-controlled trade unions similar facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also say that in the Federation of Malaya and

other  countries there are no laws giving such powers

to the Minister for Labour except in Singapore. But I

would   like  to  refer  to  the  statement   by   my

Parliamentary Secretary with regard to the  power  to

freeze trade union funds. The power to freeze and  to

put trade union funds into the Consolidated Fund also

exists   in  the  Trade  Unions  Ordinance   of   the

Federation of Malaya. If the Members opposite do  not

know this, then they should go and read the law books

before they criticise us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say that the introduction of this Bill is to

legalise  our illegal acts. But I wish to  point  out

that  there  are  loopholes in  the  Ordinance  which

enable  irresponsible  trade  union  leaders  to  act

against the interest of the workers. That is  why  we

had  to  introduce  this amending Bill  to  plug  the

loopholes in our laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not our desire to destroy non. P.A.P. trade

unions. All that we desire to destroy are the  unions

controlled   by   the  Communists  and  anti-national

elements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say that by introducing this Bill we will

ultimately  land  ourselves  into  the  position   of

traitors. But they are the thieves, and now they turn

round  to  call other people thieves.  They  are  the

traitors,  and  they have got the cheek  to  call  us

traitors now!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They maintain that the question of whether union

funds  are  misused or not should be decided  by  the

workers. But the point is, were the workers given the

opportunity  to  express their views against  Messrs.

Fong Swee Suan, Woodhull and Bani? No, they were  not

given  the  chance  to do so. In  fact,  the  workers

themselves do not know how the union funds have  been

used.  In addition to their salaries, the trade union

leaders and so-called advisers are given $200 special

allowance.  Do the union members know about  this?  I

think  there are other facts which have not  come  to

light and I hope the Commission of Inquiry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



will  be able to bring them out into the open.  So  a

good show is coming this way!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Hong Lim has also

mentioned    a    few    points,    expressing    his

dissatisfaction  with this Bill. He  says  that  this

Bill  has a retrospective effect. But I say that this

retrospective effect is necessary because  the  funds

of  some  unions which have already been deregistered

in  the  past have not been disposed of. For example,

in  the  case  of  the  Singapore  Shop  and  Factory

Workers'  Union  which  was  declared  illegal,   and

deregistered quite some time ago, the problem of  the

disposal of their assets has not been settled.  Their

union  premises  in Bukit Timah Road  have  not  been

disposed of. Now, how are these properties and assets

of  the  unions to be disposed of? One of the objects

of  this  Bill  is  to  provide a  solution  for  the

disposal of these unions' assets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Opposition Members have also said that the

Consolidated Fund is actually a P.A.P. fund. Now this

is  a  big lie. The Consolidated Fund belongs to  our

country, it  belongs to our people.  In  fact,  they

spent a lot of time in the Budget debate to say  that

the  Consolidated Fund is a public fund and  that  we

should not abuse it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be appreciated that we have to withdraw

funds  from the Consolidated Fund to provide services

for  the  people. So there is nothing wrong,  in  the

event  that  trade union funds cannot be disposed  of

otherwise, to put them into the Consolidated Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim has also referred to the

fact  that the Minister in charge has been given  too

much  power. As I have said, this power can  only  be

exercised under certain circumstances, that is, after

a  notice  has been served by the Registrar of  Trade

Unions  on  a  certain union. Before that  notice  is

served,  the Minister can never exercise  the  powers

under  this  Ordinance. So the arguments put  forward

cannot hold water. They say that the workers and  the

people  are  on their side. But why is it  that  they

failed in the elections?

important, Sir, that the Government must not give any

grounds  for doubt, that the Government is using  its

power to suppress the Opposition. Therefore, Sir,  if

the  powers were to be transferred from the  Minister

to a High Court Judge, I think that would remove much

of  the  odium  of  this undemocratic  Bill.  It  is,

therefore,  with  this intention  that  I  move  this

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The amendments

put  forward  by the Member for Hong  Lim  cannot  be

accepted by us.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for his amendments is that the Minister

may abuse the powers given by this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Second Reading of this Bill, I have said

that  the  Minister cannot freeze the  funds  of  any

trade  union until the Registrar of Trade Unions  has

served notice under section 15 subsection (2)  of this

Ordinance.  Before he does so, he cannot  freeze  the

funds of any trade union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the Member for Hong Lim

suggests  that the Minister should be replaced  by  a

High Court Judge. This is not proper.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if there is any question in doubt, it can be

decided  by  a  High Court Judge. He  can  order  the

freezing  of  trade union funds. But  will  the  same

Judge  preside  over the original trial  of  a  trade

union  as  well as over the appeal case? There  is  a

similar provision in the Federation trade union  laws

and our provision is based on that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the dispute is

whether this Assembly should observe the rule of  law

or   accept  that  this  country  should  be  run  by

arbitrary  powers of the Government? Where  funds  of

unions  are concerned and the future of union members

is  at  stake,  I  feel  that  the  Minister  or  the

Government  must  not  be given arbitrary  powers  to

decide  whether union funds should be frozen or  not,

but  that  the  Minister or his  representative,  the

Registrar of Trade Unions, should present a case  and

whether union funds should be frozen or not should be

decided  by  an  impartial  High  Court  Judge.   Mr

Chairman, Sir, that is the essence of my amendments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

point  mentioned by the Member for Hong  Lim  is,  in

fact,  in the present Ordinance, but the difficulties

we   are  facing  are  this.  There  is  a  group  of

unscrupulous   people  and  if  we  resort   to   the

democratic procedure laid out in the present  section

of  the  Ordinance, by the time we get an order  from

the  Court the union has already withdrawn the  funds

and  the  money will have disappeared into  the  air.

That  is  why,  in  order to plug the  loophole,  the

inadequacy  of  the provision, we have  therefore  to

amend it by this section here. But I think the Member

for  Hong  Lim has just moved the amendment  for  the

sake  of  moving  it without looking into  the  whole

aspect of the Ordinance. In section 15A there are  so

many  provisions for the Registrar to satisfy himself

before he can issue a notice to a trade union.  First

of  all, there is a checkmate. The Registrar can only

serve  a  notice on a union under certain  conditions

which  are laid down in section l5A. Therefore, there

is  no justification for the statement that this Bill

is  trying to suppress the Opposition. What  we  want

from  this  amending  Bill is that,  in  the  interim

period where a notice has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



been served on a union, if it is found that the union

intends  to  withdraw money for purposes inconsistent

with its rules and objects, the Minister will have to

exercise his discretion to withhold - he does not stop

the  money  - the money for three months  only.  After

that,  if the union is allowed to continue, then  the

frozen money will be released; or if registration  of

the union is cancelled, the money will be transferred

to the Public Official Assignee. There is no question

of  the  Minister holding the funds.  It  is  just  a

checkmate during the interim period.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I do

understand  it is to freeze the union's  account  for

three  months, although this is a moratorium on union

funds  for three months. But, Sir, with three  months

funds  frozen,  the union will cease to  operate  for

those  three months. If the Government think that  it

is  very  difficult to get a hearing  before  a  High

Court  Judge  -  and  I know of instances  where  the

Government can get a High Court Judge to hear a  case

within  one  or  two  days, I mean,  I  do  not  mind

amending it to a District Court Judge - either a  High

Court Judge or a District Court Judge but the essence

of  the  amendment  is  this. Let  the  rule  of  law

prevail.  Let  us have less arbitrary powers  of  the

Government exercising more and more control over  our

daily lives. That is all. If the Government think  it

is  very difficult to get a High Court Judge to  hear

such  a  case, I do not mind having a District  Court

Judge.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just to cut

the matter short, just one point.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right.

from   a  High  Court  Judge  in  case  there  is   a

miscarriage of justice, either by the Registrar or by

the  Minister. I am a layman but I am sure  there  is

provision in the law in this State where, if there is

a  miscarriage  of justice, the person concerned  has

every facility to seek his redress through the Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, to leave out from line 33 up to

"Minister" in line 37; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, to leave out from line 40 to the end of

the clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the funds of the unions belong to

the  members of the unions, and it is not  right  for

the  Government to misappropriate union funds. If the

Government  consider it necessary to close  down  the

unions,  all  the funds should rightly be distributed

among   the   members,   because   the   funds    are

subscriptions  or  donations  from  the  members  and

should  be returned to them, as is usually determined

by  the  Official Assignee in bankruptcy cases  That,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  is  the  first  reason  for  the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason, as I have said earlier during

the Second Reading, is that it is very bad to make  a

law  retrospective, and section 18B  makes  this  law

retrospective and applicable to unions against  which

the  Government have taken action even before the law

is passed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is because of these two reasons

that I move these two amendments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, the proposal made

by the Member for Hong Lim negates the very principle

of this Bill. Therefore, the Government cannot accept

it.  There  is no question of misappropriating  union

funds,  because The Minister shall so direct only  in

extreme  cases where the union membership  cannot  be

established or where the members cannot be traced. It

is  only  in  those extreme cases that the Government

have no choice but to direct these monies be put into

the  Consolidated Fund. The Consolidated Fund belongs

to  the  people  of Singapore, and I cannot  see  any

possibility of misappropriation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 18A paragraph (b) (ii) provides that the

Government  can  dispose of the funds  in  accordance

with the rules of the union. If the union membership



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



can  be  established and  its  members  can  be

traced, there is no reason why this provision  should

not be carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the retrospective effect of the Bill, I

think  it is necessary because there are some  unions

which  have  been deregistered as early  as  1956  or

1957,  and  the funds and properties of those  unions

have  still  to be disposed of. They are now  in  the

hands  of some legal firms. I think it is right  that

the  Government be given the power to refer all these

properties to the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy, so

that  they can be dealt with in accordance  with  the

law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I will continue from where I  left

off yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, in the Minister for Culture's speech,

there  was  nothing  but  intimidation,  threats  and

smears.  We  can see from his speech his  despondency

and  evil intentions. There was nothing in his speech

but  smears, accusations and fairy tales. He put  all

the  blame on the Opposition side. His speech can  be

described as reflecting on the P.A.P. He defended the

Central Government for all the evils and failures the

P.A.P. have perpetrated in the past and for all  the

repressive  and oppressive actions carried  out  with

the  abetment of the P.A.P. on the people. The P.A.P.

have defended themselves by putting the blame on  the

Central  Government  for  the  arrest  of  the  trade

unionists and other progressive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



elements.  Today they use the same tactics;  tomorrow

they can also resort to the same game and tactics  on

the  people.  This  has  been their  usual  political

practice. But I would like to advise them not to  put

the blame on the shoulders of others in order to show

to the people that they are people of integrity and a

Party of integrity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of policy in regard to the rural

areas,  the P.A.P. have been following the same  past

practice - shifting the blame for their failures on  to

the  shoulders of others. All the failures  in  their

rural policy have been shifted on to the shoulders of

the  Opposition  Parties and the  pro-masses  of  the

rural  people. They have never thought  of  analysing

their  failures  themselves or  realising  that  they

themselves  are to blame. They should  have  revealed

their  own  mistakes but in His Excellency's  speech,

nothing was mentioned about how the P.A.P. Government

could  improve the lot and livelihood  of  the  rural

people.  The  P.A.P. have never started  anything  on

concrete grounds and have never paid attention to the

realities  existing at present. As in  the  past  the

P.A.P.,  have  been  making use  of  every  available

opportunity  to  achieve their  political  propaganda

purposes. For instance, the Ministers have been using

occasions  when community centres were declared  open

by  the  Ministers,  and using the  radio  and  other

available  opportunities  to  do  publicity  for  the

P.A.P.   But  our  defeated  candidates  have   never

resorted to these actions. Some of them are  in  gaol

now.  Further,  the Prime Minister is  now  going  on

another round of rural tours and is trying to  change

the  former Welcoming Committees of the areas,  where

he    toured,    into   the   so-called   Citizenship

Consultative  Committees to help the Government  when

there are so many rural problems awaiting solution by

the  Government. Though these questions have not been

solved  by the Government and the needs of the  rural

people  have not been met, yet the Prime Minister  is

doing  something which will go to strengthen his  own

political  power. There is a grave doubt whether  the

advice and opinions of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



so-called  Permanent Citizens Consultative  Committee

will be listened to by the P.A.P. overlords. And  the

P.A.P. intend to extend the fields of its activities

in  the  community centres. But the P.A.P. Government

have  not  disclosed the details and  the  nature  of

these activities. Does it mean that the P.A.P. intend

to  use  the  community  centres  as  clinics  or  as

veterinary  stations  or  as offices  for  collecting

centres for property taxes, or are they to be used as

P.A.P. propaganda stations? On the other hand, we see

that  the P.A.P. are allotting $1 million to be  used

for  the  so-called training of leadership  to  serve

P.A.P. purposes.  This  is  another  indication   of

collusion with the Minister for Culture. The Minister

for  Finance has also said that he would use most  of

his  time  to  deal  with the youths  of  some  other

sections. That is the only method of policy he  could

have  in  dealing with State matters. This policy  of

the  P.A.P. can only create undesirable consequences

in the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years the P.A.P. Government's

policy of suppression in the rural areas against  the

rural people - this sort of activity of the P.A.P. has

far  exceeded  the  good it has  done  to  the  rural

people, and the enthusiasm and efforts of the P.A.P., in

helping  the  foreign capitalists have  far  exceeded

their efforts in helping the people themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industrialisation policy of the P.A.P. is

another  humbug.  It is a fact that the  P.A.P. have

been  making  extensive use of  the  police  and  the

military   to   suppress  the  people   and   workers

generally.  The P.A.P. have driven away over  100,000

people from their homesteads without giving them  any

adequate  compensation  or  properly  solving   their

resettlement  problems.  This  includes  Toa   Payoh,

Kallang,  Geylang  Serai,  Lorong  Meng  Kong,  Bagan

Merah,  Aljunied, Potong Pasir, Bukit Linchik, Delta,

Lim  Chu  Kang,  Lamaji, Choa Chu Kang,  the  Geylang

areas  and  various other places.  People  living  in

these  areas are all involved. From November of  last

year  up to this November, the P.A.P. have demolished

more  than  100  houses and destroyed  the  vegetable

plots of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of rural problems, unpleasant

incidents have always been caused by the bureaucratic

and  unreasonable attitude and actions of the  P.A.P.

They will never listen to the opinions and wishes  of

the people of the rural areas and the representatives

of the people. They are following the line of the Lim

Yew Hock Government. They never consider the economic

situation of those people who are affected.  Do  they

not  know  that  many of the rural people  could  not

afford  to  pay high rentals? Do they not  know  that

certain hawkers, after being forced to remove,  would

be short of finances to start their business anew? Do

they  not  know that certain workers, when  they  are

forced  to  settle down in areas far away from  their

places  of trade, experience great inconvenience  and

economic difficulty? Do they not know that the  costs

of  agricultural products would also be  affected  by

removal?  There are also other problems such  as  the

difficulties and inconveniences caused  to  school-going  children who are resettled in outlying  areas.

We  should understand when the rural people are faced

with  enforced removal, they will suffer the loss  of

their  wealth and other possessions and will be faced

with new unknown changes which will cause undesirable

psychological effects and an unnecessary burden.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If their future livelihood and business could be

assured  by the Government and if their psychological

ill-feelings  could be avoided, then I am  sure  that

they   would   be  quite  willing  to  be  resettled,

otherwise they would have no alternative but to react

against  their  enforced removal  and  of  course  to

oppose  the  Government's  unreasonable  compensation

rates.  All civic-minded citizens would also  demand,

on    their    behalf,   adequate   and    reasonable

compensation.  This inhuman enforced removal  carried

out by the P.A.P. is uncalled for.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Bukit Panjang is

discussing  the  rural problem  and  resettlement  on

which  much has been said in the Budget sittings  and

by his colleagues in this debate on the Yang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



di-Pertuan Negara's speech. He should not repeat what

the  other Members have said, I would ask him to  try

and  get  on  to some new matter which has  not  been

touched upon by any of his colleagues.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

what I wanted to say was about the Government's rural

policy.  They  only mentioned the Government's  rural

policy  in  passing,  but  they  did  not  give  full

details.  That  is why I would like  to  add  my  own

points and views.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I would ask the Member to accept my

ruling and go on to something else.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  can see from the policy speech of the P.A.P. that

they  do not have a complete education programme  for

the  rural people. The Government should have planned

to  make use of available land in our State. But have

the P.A.P. been using State land?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the P.A.P.'s Master Plan? Let us use

what the P.A.P. have said to rebut them. In 1959,  in

their  election  pamphlets there is a passage  saying

that  the Master Plan drafted by the colonial  regime

could  only satisfy the greed of the great landlords,

that,  in actual fact, it was not beneficial  to  the

people  and  that it should be drawn up in accordance

with  the practical needs of Singapore. Besides this,

the  P.A.P. also condemned the compensation rates  of

the Lim Yew Hock Government. But when we look around,

we  can  see  that the P.A.P. are out in  full  force

implementing  the  same  Master  Plan  and  the  same

compensation  rates of the Lim Yew  Hock  Government.

Therefore,   unpleasant  incidents  have   inevitably

occurred. Perhaps the P.A.P. think that building  and

industrialisation programmes are not compatible  with

the  interests  of  the rural  people  and  that  the

interests  of the rural people must be sacrificed  in

favour  of industrialisation. That is why they always

use   terms  like  "industrialisation"  and  "housing

programmes" to suppress the rural people.  Those  who

oppose  their actions are dubbed as anti-national  by

them. What else can the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P. contribute towards the welfare and  interests

of  the rural people? It is more pitiful to see their

persecution of the rural people by making use of  the

money  from  the  rural people for their  other  evil

deeds.  We  are of the opinion that the interests  of

the broad masses of the rural people and those of the

workers   are   compatible  with  each   other.   The

industrialisation and housing programmes  should  not

contradict  each  other. In our  opinion,  these  two

programmes  are not compatible with the interests  of

the  rural  people.  We have about  $400  million  in

revenue  every  year, and yet we have  to  contribute

$120  million to the Central Parliament. In  addition

to  this, we have to lend $150 million to the  Borneo

territories.  The P.A.P. further want to  use  public

funds to set up centres to train their own cadres.  I

say  that if these sums of money are used to resettle

those who have been forced to remove in a proper way,

then  this  question  can be resolved  to  a  certain

extent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during these few days, although

we have debated the question of rural policy, all our

views  and  opinions have never received  any  proper

answer  or reply from the Government Ministers.  That

is  why I feel that it is again necessary to give  my

viewpoints on rural policy. Because our viewpoints on

rural  problems  have  not  been  published  in   the

newspapers, that is why I feel it necessary to  touch

on it again in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, once more I tell the P.A.P. that their

suppression of the rural people far exceeds the  help

given to the rural people.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The rural problem has been gone over for days. The reason

given by the hon.  Member  for repeating  it  here is

that the newspapers  have  not carried  it. But under

the Standing Orders, a  Member is not allowed to

repeat himself. Can he go away from the rural problem,

on which so much has been said and on which he has

already spoken, to some fresh matter?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  will now go on to something else. As to the  other

points which have been raised by my colleagues,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



perhaps  I may mention in passing that they have  not

been adequately dealt with in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in my opinion, the rural economy is

facing  great difficulties at present. There  are poverty

and diseases in the rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am not prepared to allow the hon.

Member to go on to this rural problem. Can he not  go

on  to  something  else? We have been  debating  this

subject  for four days. I am quite prepared  to  hear

anyone  who  has  something new to say.  But  do  not

repeat  not only what he has said but what  has  been

said over the last four days.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

if you think I have been too repetitious, then I will

try  to  finish  my  speech in the shortest  possible

time.  What I have mentioned just now might not  have

covered  all that has been mentioned by my colleagues

in  the past. But anyway, I will now try to finish my

speech by dealing briefly with certain other points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have not been able to find out the real

problems existing in the rural areas. Once, when  the

Prime  Minister toured a certain rural area, he found

that  some  people who came out to welcome  him  with

bouquets  wore very nice clothes. He then  said  that

the rural people were well-fed, wealthy and enjoyed a

very  high  standard of living. In  addition  to  the

forced removal from their land, the rural people  are

faced  with  the  scarcity  of  land.  Here  in  this

Assembly, the Prime Minister has said previously that

17,000  acres  of land were occupied by  the  British

Forces.  Had this land been used to help the  people,

something good and useful would have come out of  it,

and  this, to a certain extent, would have solved the

scarcity of land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many small farmers have gone bankrupt. This was

because they lack capital and know-how. In the  past,

the  P.A.P. promised to give loans to them, but  they

have  not  fulfilled  their  pledge.  They  have  not

adopted effective measures to stabilize the prices of

farm  products. There is a great fluctuation  in  the

prices  of  farm produce. For instance, although  the

price of pork has gone up, the price



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



of  poultry has remained at $1 per katty. And because

of an outbreak of a poultry disease, 200,000 chickens

perished in this epidemic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have stated that after the merger of

Singapore with the Federation of Malaya, there  would

not  be any tariffs. But we see that the tariffs  are

still  there. A duty of one cent has to  be  paid  on

each egg that is exported to the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the Lim Yew Hock regime, two rural organisations were banned. They were the Farmers' Association and the Rural People's Association. And during the regime of the P.A.P., two rural associations were also banned. They were banned after the 16th of September. They have a membership

of  more than 20,000. And no good reasons were  given

for  their  banning. The only reason given  was  that

these associations carried out activities which  were

not consistent with their rules and regulations. This

goes  to show that organisations which do not support

the  P.A.P. are suppressed by them. The  banning  of

these  two organisations gives an indication  of  the

rural  policy  of the P.A.P. and their  collaboration

with  the  Federation Government. It also  symbolises

the  unity of the 500,000 rural people. That  is  why

they  have to be banned on the pretext that they were

being used by pro-Communist front organisations. This

is  nonsensical  argument. These rural  organisations

truly  represent the rural people. They work for  the

interests and welfare of the rural people. They  were

opposed to the unreasonable policy of the P.A.P. What

is  wrong with that? Just because they are considered

to  be organisations that oppose the Government, they

are  banned. Instead the P.A.P. should arrest Lim Yew

Hock  because  Lim Yew Hock organised  the  so-called

Alliance  Party, which also has a united front  among

them.  The  P.A.P. themselves rely  on  colonialism.

Likewise  they have a united front - an alliance  with

the colonialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you say that the rural people organise

themselves  to  look after their own  interests,  the

Government should not accuse them of being  tools  of

the Communists.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all actions of the Government, I cannot help

coming  to the conclusion that spit and spittle  will

fall on their heads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> How long does the Deputy Prime

Minister propose to take?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> About ten minutes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the debate of the

last  week has exposed the Barisan Sosialis in  their

true colours as a group of people who are willing  to

betray  the security of Malaysia. I do not think  the

people  are  so naive as to believe that the  Barisan

Assemblymen and Representatives in the Dewan  Ra'ayat

in  Kuala Lumpur were sincere when they took the oath

of  loyalty  that  they  will  defend  Malaysia.  The

Barisan    Sosialis   is   now   in   an   impossible

contradiction  out  of  which they  cannot  extricate

themselves.  Can  there be anything more  stupid  for

Barisan  Sosialis Assemblymen to take a  solemn  oath

that they would defend and die for Malaysia, when  at

the  same  time  their  own Party  Chairman  publicly

stated  that he is opposed to Malaysia? The stand  of

the  Barisan Sosialis is always confusing, like a dog

chasing its own tail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barisan Assemblymen have been only too eager to

exaggerate  the  unemployment situation  due  to  the

cessation of trade between us and Indonesia, but they

have  not  uttered  a  single  word  to  condemn  the

Indonesian  Government which brought this  misfortune

upon the people. In fact, the Member for Tampines has

said  it  is  not the Barisan's concern  whether  the

present attitude of Indonesia is correct or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson takes the cake when he urged

the Central Government to stop scolding Indonesia. If

the  dispute between Indonesia and Malaysia  amounted

to  only an exchange of words, then there need not be

any  anxiety at all. Let me ask this. Is  the  Member

for  Thomson  not aware that Indonesia  is  not  only

scolding Malaysia



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



but also bleeding the people of Malaysia to death  by

acts  of  aggression along our borders and piracy  in

our  waters?  This afternoon the Prime  Minister  has

related   in  this  Assembly  acts  of  sabotage   by

Indonesian  fifth columnists in Singapore.  Will  the

Member for Thomson, or for that matter any Member  of

the  Barisan Sosialis, be brave enough to go  to  the

Indonesian Parliament and tell big brother to lay off

smashing up Malaysia?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu declared that the Barisan

oppose Malaysia because of their patriotism and  love

for  their  country. Let me ask him.  Which  is  your

country?  He  is not here to answer. May  I  ask  his

colleagues, which is their country? Indonesia? Is  it

that  the  Barisan loves Indonesia so much  that  Mr

Bani,  ex-Member  for  Thomson,  made  the  revealing

statement in this very Chamber that Indonesia is  the

heartland  of Malaysia? Is it that the Barisan  loves

Azahari  so  much that it supported  him  during  the

Brunei  revolt  so  that he could capture  Sabah  and

Sarawak?  Is  it because of patriotism to  Indonesia

that  the Barisan is now speaking in this Chamber  on

behalf  of  Indonesia to smash Malaysia? The  Barisan

has  called  the  Central  Government  Fascist,  neo-colonialist, brutal, suppressive and by  every  other

conceivable  adjective  in  the  dictionary.  But  on

Indonesia  which  is perpetrating aggression  against

us, they keep a pious and hypocritical silence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with the Member for Hong Lim, the Barisan

Sosialis  want  us  to  crawl to  the  feet  of  Bung

Soekarno and to plead for mercy. The Barisan Sosialis

do  not  condemn the Indonesian Government as inhuman

for  stopping  water supplies from Singapore  to  the

inhabitants in the Rhio islands. They do not  condemn

the   Indonesian  Government  as  being  Fascist  for

issuing  a  decree  that all those in  Indonesia  who

listen  to Radio Malaysia will be executed.  They  do

not  condemn the Indonesian Government as brutal  for

inspiring   the  terrorism  committed  by  Indonesian

commandos in Sarawak and Sabah. On the contrary,  the

Barisan  is  acting  as  an advocate  for  Indonesian

aggression and applauds, what they have called,  "the

national liberation struggle"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



in  Borneo.  Will the Barisan despatch volunteers  to

help Indonesia liberate Sabah and Sarawak as they did

in  the  case  of West Irian? Is the Barisan  looking

forward to Soekarno liberating them from the Tunku? I

do not think we should make an error in thinking that

those  in  the Barisan Sosialis are stupid  men.  Far

from  it.  It will be more correct for us to  believe

that  they  are  evil men with sinister  aims.  Their

hatred  for Malaysia and their delight at being  able

to  make political capital out of the plight of those

who  are  now  unemployed on  account  of  Indonesian

confrontation stem from one fact, and one fact alone,

and that is, the Barisan prefers to sleep in the same

bed  with  Indonesia  and dream  the  dreams  of  the

P.K.I., the Communist Party of Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no positive or constructive thinking in

the Barisan. Their attitude is one of destruction and

condemnation. That was their stand during the general

election.  Condemnation  - no  positive  construction.

That frame of mind has persisted today. If there is a

drought, they condemn the Government for not bringing

in  the rain. If there is rainfall, they condemn  the

Government  for flooding. The Barisan call themselves

champions  of  the  workers.  But  they  condemn  the

Government  for  putting up housing for  the  working

class. The Barisan was prepared to sacrifice autonomy

in  education and labour by demanding complete merger

with  Malaya  like Penang and Malacca.  But  what  is

their stand during this debate? Now they plead  with

the  Government to protect the autonomy which we have

fought for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan calls Malaysian citizenship second-class. I suggest let them then apply to become

Indonesian  citizens, and having acquired  Indonesian

citizenship,  they may find a dialectical  answer  to

explain the anti-Chinese rioting in Java and Sumatra.

I do not believe the Barisan appreciate the amenities

of  civilisation and tranquillity that they now enjoy

in  Singapore  and  Malaysia.  Nothing  can  be  more

salutary  than for all of them to go back to Jakarta.

They  will  then  be thankful for the little  mercies

that they now enjoy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Mr Speaker, we owe a duty to ourselves to

appreciate  Indonesia's  feelings  on  the  role   of

Singapore in Indonesian trade so that there  will  be

less  bewilderment  about the motive  for  Indonesian

economic confrontation. For decades Indonesian rubber

and copra and other raw produce have been sold to the

markets of the world through Singapore and in  return

rice,  textiles and consumer goods have been imported

into  Indonesia,  again through Singapore.  This  has

been   possible  partly  because  of  our  commercial

expertise  and  the banking and insurance  facilities

which exist in Singapore and partly because Indonesia

has  no port comparable in efficiency and ability  to

handle the world's shipping to our own port.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since Indonesia attained her independence in

1949,   she  had  always  been  conscious   of   this

dependence on our entrepot port to conduct her  trade

with   the   rest   of   the   world.   Because    of

maladministration,   over-attention   to    political

affairs   and   inattention  to   economic   matters,

Indonesia   had  no  alternative  but   to   tolerate

Singapore's  role  as  her banker  and  trade  agent.

Indonesian  oil  had been distributed throughout  her

archipelago  by ships based in Singapore,  a  foreign

port.   This   has  always  been  regarded   by   the

Indonesians  as prejudicial to their own defence  and

security   measures.   The  desire,   therefore,   by

Indonesia  not  to  rely  on  Singapore  traders  and

Singapore  based ships is therefore not an  overnight

decision but one which has been considered for a long

time.  As  has  been indicated by the Prime  Minister

this  afternoon in his statement, Indonesian  efforts

to  subvert Singapore began in 1960, long before  the

Tunku announced his support for the Malaysia Plan. In

other  words, let us not underestimate the  political

intention  and ambitions of Indonesian  leaders,  The

umbilical cord between Singapore and Indonesia had to

be  cut  some  day;  confrontation  against  Malaysia

precipitated the economic surgery. Quite obviously in

this   context,  we  ourselves  must  make  our   own

readjustments.  Fortunately the  Government  has,  as

early as 4 years ago, foreseen the difficulties which

Singapore would face with each passing year if we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



made no efforts to diversify our economy. Singapore's

trading   economy  could  not  grow  if  neighbouring

independent  countries were to take  steps  to  trade

directly  with  other parts of the  world.  Moreover,

since  our trading economy could not grow as fast  as

our increasing population, new avenues for productive

activity  had  to  be  found. So positive  plans  for

industrialisation in Singapore were laid down by  the

Government.  The  Economic  Development   Board   was

founded  and  plans to create industrial  estates  in

different parts of Singapore were executed. It is our

hope  that  in  the next five years industrialisation

will  be  on  its way to fulfilment.  But  to  enable

industrialisation in Singapore to start and in  order

for us to maintain the tempo of industrialisation, it

is  essential that industrial peace be observed,  for

without  industrial peace, factories will be  working

at  half cock, or some of them may even close down as

we  have observed in the past few years. The Minister

for  Finance two days ago in answer to a question has

so  ably  illustrated  what irresponsibility  in  the

trade    union    field   could    do    to    damage

industrialisation. It is also essential that  markets

must  be  found for goods manufactured in  Singapore.

Fortunately, no one can be complacent by solely being

dependent upon our home market. There is already  the

Malaysian Common Market which has been agreed  to  by

the  four  territories of Malaysia.  However,  it  is

essential  that, if our manufacturers are to  prosper

and  the  people  to  share in the  prosperity,  that

Common  Market  must  be  extended.  Exports  towards

overseas  markets must eventually play a considerable

part  in  preserving our prosperity and  standard  of

living.  Our  economic tasks ahead are difficult  but

not  impossible.  So  long as our  entrepreneurs  and

workers  can  be inspired in the task of building  up

our  economy and our Malaysian nation, the  prospects

are bright, notwithstanding Indonesian confrontation,

and  we  all look forward to a new historical era  in

which true Malaysians can play a loyal part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the tone and tenor of the

debate  that  has  been set in the  last  week  is  a

depressing reminder of the futility of these meetings

when  the purpose of the Opposition is not to debate,

to criticise and to improve. Their purpose is to read

out under cover of privilege in this Chamber long and

dreary extracts repeating the Communist united  front

line,  anti-Malaysia, and anti any policy or plan  of

action that in any way makes things difficult for the

Communists to strengthen their ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this motion of thanks, I had set out in

broad  outline  four main targets, industrialisation,

housing   and  the  re-building  of  the  old   city,

education to meet the needs of an industrial society,

and,   last,   raising  of  social  standards,   Most

important  of all, I had explained a new addition  to

the  organisational structure of the Government,  the

Citizens'  Consultative  Committees.  One would  have

expected  the  Opposition, if it  were  a  democratic

Opposition,  anxious to play its role as constructive

critic,  to  take  the  Government  up  on  its  main

targets,  to show, if they can, why these targets  do

not  measure  up to the economic and social  problems

before the country and how they can be improved.  But

no such debate has taken place. It is clear that what

we  are going to have, even more so than in the  last

Assembly,  are  long and windy, repetitious  speeches

all  scripted beforehand and dutifully  read  out  in

this  Chamber. They talk of the death of freedom,  of

the  end of democratic rights, of merger and Malaysia

being a sell-out, all as if the referendum never took

place  last  year  and as if they had  won  the  last

general elections. For



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



it  appears  that,  every evidence  to  the  contrary

notwithstanding, only they can speak for the masses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said in introducing the motion that we

must  always  be prepared to face new situations  and

adapt  and adjust the democratic system to  meet  the

specific problems as they come up from time to  time.

Three-quarters of the time on the debate on the  Yang

di-Pertuan   Negara's  speech  and  on   the   Budget

Estimates  were more properly within the province  of

our Parliament in Kuala Lumpur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for various reasons they feel inhibited and

they  have  remained silent in Kuala Lumpur  although

their  parliamentary  leader, the  Member  for  Bukit

Merah,  has  taken leave from this  House  to  attend

Parliament since the 11th of December. And it is  his

comrades  here  who  have  dressed  in  parliamentary

privilege  the ghost writings in Chinese of  a  hard-working  but somewhat unimaginative group of aspiring

Marxist-Leninists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By our next sitting I think we should have re-adjusted our Standing Orders to take into account

this growing abuse of the legislative chamber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no desire to give a point-by-point

refutation  of their line of calumny. Suffice  it  to

say  that  if  we were able to survive their  vicious

campaign  of lies, scare and slander which they  have

unleashed since June 1961, we can and will debunk all

these  dreary falsehoods, for finally it  is  on  the

record of our performance in the five years from  now

that the people will judge us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we should do well to always remember that

if  they, the Barisan Sosialis, were in charge of the

country,  it  is  very  unlikely  that  we  would  be

allowed, in the Opposition, to say the things of them

that  we  have allowed them to say of us. It is  also

unlikely in that situation that either in the  unions

or  in  the  civic organisations we would be  allowed

even a one-hundredth part of the opportunity that  we

are  now  giving  them to organise and  preach  their

gospel  against the nation. Our failing, I fear,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, is not that we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



stifled democratic rights and liberties, but that  we

have  been  too  tolerant with a  group  of  men  who

interpret tolerance as a weakness to be exploited and

abused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can all remember what happened throughout Malaya

and  Singapore in the few weeks immediately after the

defeat  of Japan and before the re-occupation by  the

British Forces. The Communists were in charge in some

towns  and districts. Sir, Members on the other  side

have  been talking about the right to free  and  open

trial.  But  the  unreasoning, unceasing  screech  of

hatred  which  they have preached leads  us  straight

back  to  the  summary methods of  justice  that  the

people's  courts then enforced. They had little  time

and even less regard for the niceties of the rules of

evidence  and of trial by jury. We on this side  must

never forget that if ever we lose this fight, then we

must  be  stupid to expect of them to concede  to  us

what  we  have  conceded  to them  even  after  their

defeat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is worthwhile pointing out to them that

whilst  the democratic system concedes the rights  of

opposition  to  the new nation before it  is  formed,

once  it  has  been formed, to preach disloyalty  and

incite  disaffection against Malaysia is treason  and

punishable  as such. Sir, they may have  taken  their

oath  both  here  and  in Parliament  to  defend  the

Constitution of Malaysia more out of perfunctory duty

than  out  of any conviction. But let them know  that

the  whole of the apparatus of the State will go into

motion  if  they, instead of honouring  this  pledge,

actively  incite  disaffection, The  whole  of  their

effort over the past ten days has been to cast doubts

on  Malaysia, weaken the people's resolve  to  defend

it, and generally create disloyalty to the Government

of  Malaysia.  Sir, one can more than  guess  at  the

motives  of  these  speeches,  when  we  find   Radio

Kalimantan   Utara  picking  up  with  relish   every

falsehood  on  Malaysia, every  exaggeration  on  the

effects  of Indonesian confrontation, that  has  been

uttered  in  this  House. Whatever  they  said  their

intentions  were, the consistent use to  which  enemy

propaganda has put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



their  speeches can leave no doubt that they are,  in

fact, helping the confrontationists to inflict injury

on Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the very wording of this motion,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`regrets that the Government in helping to impose

`Malaysia on the people has caused great difficulties

and  hardships  to them in Singapore  and  urges  the

Government ...'



<br><br>and so on, every phrase is cast in terms of villainy.

To  talk  of  Malaysia having been imposed  upon  the

people  - I presume the people of Singapore - after  it

has been endorsed both at the referendum and again at

the  general  elections is not just to  perpetrate  a

lie, but to actively help hostile forces around us to

intervene against Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the disclosure today that confrontation even

for  Singapore does not stop at a trade  boycott  but

goes  on to active sabotage which has cost up to date

the   lives   of  two  innocent  civilians,   a   new

significance is given to the anti-Malaysia activities

of  the  Opposition.  Sir, the  intelligence  network

shows  that  these  activities  of  penetration   and

subversion have been going on for many months  before

Malaysia  was even mooted. Reluctantly one is  pushed

to   the  conclusion  that,  quite  unconnected  with

Malaysia,  a  scheme was launched at penetration  and

subversion  which, if successful, must  lead  to  the

gradual  absorption of Singapore and Malaya, and  now

Malaysia, by our bigger neighbour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violence that has been undertaken was planned

only  after April this year, shortly before Malaysia,

hut the cultural and ideological penetration had been

mounted  several years ago even before  Malaysia  was

ever  suggested. We must be blind if we fail  to  see

the  basic objective and the end result of all  these

Activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I have asked the Opposition is: on

whose side are they on? They have not answered.  They

have  remained silent. They have never even  admitted

the existence of Malaysia. So how can they even admit

that  they  are  Malaysian? And how can  they  defend

Malaysia, if they are not Malaysian?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>



But  let  me give them this piece of advice: whatever

their  intentions, if by any overt act, by  any  open

action,  they  help the enemy against Malaysia,  then

they must bear the full consequences of being treated

as traitors to the nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that Indonesia is now prepared to use

agents  and  fifth columnists to disrupt our  economy

puts a sombre hue on our responsibilities. We are now

in  the  midst of, literally, a battle  of  life  and

death,  a  battle  for survival, our  survival  as  a

separate entity, to live our lives in our own way  in

South-East  Asia  unmolested  by  bigger   and   more

powerful  neighbours. We have always feared that  the

temptation of the big to be bigger and to absorb  the

smaller would be too much to resist. But now we  know

for   a   fact  that  confrontation  includes   fifth

columnists and saboteurs trained to wreck the economy

of  Singapore and, even more important, to weaken the

will  of  the  people of Singapore and of  the  other

parts  of Malaysia to resist absorption, for that  is

the alternative to Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our chances of survival are ten times better in

Malaysia  than if we were by ourselves. Malaysia  may

have  been followed by a trade boycott and a loss  of

8.7 per cent of our national income. But this was not

the  logical  consequence of  Malaysia.  It  was  the

consequence  of a conscious act of the Government  of

the  Republic of Indonesia to inflict damage  on  all

the  parties in Malaysia, either by economic sanction

even if it costs Indonesia four times our losses,  or

by  military pressure along our borders and  sabotage

from  within,  if  it appears to  have  a  chance  of

success,   then   direct   military   action   cannot

altogether be ruled out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must resolve to defend ourselves to the death,

for  death  is preferable to conquest and absorption.

When  our  neighbours, both friendly and  unfriendly,

understand  this, then peace in South-East  Asia  is

more  likely  to be preserved. Whatever the  economic

pressures,  whatever  the  harassment  by   sabotage,

whatever  the  psychological  tensions,  let  no  one

mistake our right to be masters in our own house.  We

cannot  afford  to  be  befuddled  or  bemused   into

weakening in our resolve for Malaysia. What is at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



stake is not just 8.7 per cent of our national income

but, literally, our survival as a separate people  in

this  part  of the world. When survival is at  stake,

those  who  help the enemy to weaken the nation  will

find  to  their cost that the nation is  prepared  to

defend  itself  against the enemy  without  and  also

against the enemy within.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask this House to reject this amendment as the

line of treachery and treason. If ever the Communists

succeed  in weakening our resolve for Malaysia,  then

verily,  first, Sarawak, then Sabah, then  Singapore,

and  finally Malaysia itself, will be slowly absorbed

into the Indonesian orbit. If this happens, then even

the  Barisan which has moved this amendment may  look

back to this era as a golden age compared to what  is

in  store for them and indeed for all others in  that

situation.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, since over a

week   ago  this  House  has  witnessed  the  tactics

exhibited  by the Barisan Sosialis Members when  this

House  debated matters which have been  tabled.  From

their  tactics, it is obvious that the seven  Barisan

Sosialis Members behave like agents of their  masters

who  instruct  them what to do, without  taking  into

consideration the consequences of their actions. This

is  not  surprising, Mr Deputy Speaker, because  the

Barisan  Sosialis Members are still  young  and  they

think  that  this  House is a place  where  they  can

indulge  in  games  so that they  can  exhibit  their

bravery.  All  this, as I have said earlier,  is  the

attitude  of raw parish pump politicians who  do  not

follow the trend of debates previously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their speeches remind me of the writings of Mao Tse-tung, their big leader, in one of his articles

entitled  Tactics to Oppose Imperialist Japan.  Inter

alia, Mao Tse-tung said that the young people have  a

lot  of  ideas  -  good plans - but  they  cannot  be

trusted  to implement state and world tasks,  because

they  are unable to understand such tasks. I  do  not

think  the  Barisan Members, who are raw,  understand

what they have said themselves. I do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



not  think they understand the consequences  and  the

dangers  of their speeches which they merely read  in

this  Chamber.  After  hearing  their  speeches,   my

conclusion  is that generally their speeches  do  not

indicate  any sign of loyalty at all to this country.

On  the  contrary, their speeches are of a nature  to

instigate  the  people to fight Malaysia,  which  has

been acknowledged by the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are their speeches really concerned with how to

improve  this  country? Are their speeches  concerned

with  how  to  solve the unemployment  problem  as  a

result   of   economic  confrontation   launched   by

Indonesia?  Do  their  speeches contain  constructive

suggestions  on how we should provide more  amenities

and  assistance for the benefit of the people of this

country? Or what should be done by the Government  to

give   facilities  to  the  rural  dwellers  in  this

country?  Or  what should be done by  all  of  us  to

defend  ourselves  from  aggression  and  threat   by

Indonesia?  Not a thing. The speeches by the  Barisan

Members,  on  the  whole, indicate  how  Malaysia  is

suffering as a result of confrontation which  is  now

being launched by Indonesia. Their speeches show that

the people are against merger, and the people of this

country  will  rise at any time in arms because  they

oppose  Malaysia. Which people? Are they  the  people

who  have chosen Malaysia in the referendum? Are they

the  people who have cast their votes in the  general

elections  in  September last and who have  reelected

the  P.A.P.  Government to govern for a further  five

years? No, definitely no, Mr Deputy Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people referred to in their speeches are those

anti-nationals   and   pro-Communists,   whom    they

represent  in  this  Chamber,  and  the  people   who

comprise the minority and who do not wish to see this

country  prosper  and live in peace and  harmony.  In

fact,  the speeches of the Barisan Sosialis  are  not

directed  at the people of Malaysia, but directed  at

the   Communists  in  Indonesia  and  abroad.  I   am

confident  that what they have said in  this  Chamber

will   be   broadcast  by  Radio   Indonesia,   Radio

Kalimantan  Utara, and Radio Peking. Do the  speeches

by the hon. Members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



condemn  Indonesia for launching aggression in  North

Borneo?  Do  their speeches contain the incidents  of

intrusion of Indonesian war-planes over the Malaysian

sky and Indonesian pirates who robbed the property of

our  fishermen  in  the Straits  of  Malacca  and  in

international  waters? Not a bit.  On  the  contrary,

their  speeches  indicate they  are  encouraging  the

incidents to continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel such an attitude as exhibited by these hon.

Members, sooner or later, will encourage Indonesia to

commit  aggression against Malaya and Singapore.  One

day  we  will  witness Indonesian jet bombers  flying

over  this  Chamber. Confrontation has increased  our

responsibility even more, because more problems  have

been   created.  Plans  which  were  to   have   been

implemented  by the Government for the betterment  of

the  people  cannot be put into effect  now,  as  the

Government  are  obliged  to  concentrate  on   their

efforts to solve problems of unemployment as a result

of  Indonesian  confrontation, with the encouragement

of  hon. Members opposite us. But, on the other hand,

there  is good in confrontation because it has caused

the  people in this country comprising many races  to

be even more united behind the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last general elections, the people voted the

P.A.P.  Government once again to govern the  country.

We  are proud that the people have put their faith in

us.  I am happy to say in this Chamber that the trust

placed in us will be honoured and, God willing,  will

not  be  betrayed forever. The faith and trust placed

in  us  by the people will be reciprocated. I promise

that  the  P.A.P. Government will never at  any  time

misplace  this trust. We will continue to strive  for

the  benefit  and improvement of the people  in  this

country  as a whole. What we hope from the people  is

their  co-operation and understanding so that we  can

smash  the  anti-national and pro-Communist  elements

which  are  in  our midst. We are proud.  Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  in  this struggle to eliminate these  anti-national elements, the people are solidly behind  us.

The Malaysia Plan was announced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



by the Malaysian Prime Minister, the Hon. Tunku Abdul

Rahman, about two years ago. About six months  later,

that  was  on the 17th November, 1962, the  New  York

Times published a letter signed by Dr Subandrio, the

Indonesian Foreign Minister, who mentioned  the  plan

to  establish Malaysia. In addition to welcoming such

a  plan Dr Subandrio, who voiced the official  stand

of  the Indonesian Government, said, inter alia, that

"the  Indonesian Government sends its good wishes  to

Malaysia  because  the  object  of  Malaysia  is  the

process  of  decolonisation of  Malaya  over  Borneo,

Sarawak and Singapore and that Malaysia will free the

people  of these three territories from the  shackles

and  exploitation of colonialism." Not a word did the

letter  mention that Malaysia was a new form of  neo-colonialism  planned  by  the  British  and  American

imperialists and neo-colonialists. Tunku Abdul Rahman

was praised for mooting such a plan. Furthermore, Dr

Subandrio  urged the people of Sarawak and  Sabah  to

determine  their  own  fate and choose  whether  they

wished  to join Malaysia or otherwise. The people  of

Sabah  and  Sarawak have made their decision  through

general  elections in their respective  countries  to

join  Malaysia. Singapore through the referendum also

decided  for merger and Malaysia. All these means  of

getting  the approval of the people have been carried

out   by  the  Governments  of  Sabah,  Sarawak   and

Singapore.    In   accordance   with   constitutional

democratic  practice, they voted of  their  own  free

will, without coercion, and by the secret ballot they

chose  Malaysia.  What else do these anti-nationalist

pro-Communists  want?  The  people  have  made  their

decision  clear  that they desire Malaysia.  But  the

anti-nationalist elements and pro-Communists  refused

to  acknowledge the decision of the people. Then they

started to spread wild charges that the elections and

referendum  were  conducted as a sham  and  that  the

people were bluffed and frightened so that they  were

forced to choose Malaysia and merger. But, Mr Deputy

Speaker  we all know that the decision of the  people

has  caused  the  anti-nationalist and  pro-Communist

elements, represented by the Barisan Sosialis in this

Chamber, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>



suffer  a  severe thrashing because their leaders  at

that  time  made statements indicating that  Malaysia

could not be destroyed from within this country. Then

they  started  their instigation from  outside.  They

made  contacts  with Communists from  outside.  Their

leaders, such as Lim Ching Siong, have stated  openly

in  the newspaper Bintang Timor in Indonesia that the

Barisan  Sosialis preferred to merge  with  Indonesia

and  that  Singapore would be better off  by  merging

with   Indonesia  than  with  Malaysia.  The  Barisan

Sosialis  leaders and leaders of the Socialist  Front

in  Malaya  also  made close contact  with  Communist

leaders  in  Indonesia. Then  they  used  Azahari,  a

bankrupt politician, to launch an armed revolution in

Brunei.  We  all know that before the revolution  was

launched on the 8th of October last year, Azahari had

several   negotiations  with  the  Barisan   Sosialis

leaders  in  Singapore. A few weeks  before  that,  a

number  of  Barisan  Sosialis leaders  went  over  to

Borneo  to  persuade the people there to support  the

armed   insurrection.  Azahari  launched  his   armed

revolution  which was crushed in a matter  of  a  few

days.   He   fled  to  Manila  and  subsequently   to

Indonesia.  Agitation from outside  against  Malaysia

continued.  The P.K.I. launched a big  campaign  with

the help of the Barisan Sosialis to oppose Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We still remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, how the

Communists and their puppets, their lackeys, tried to

evict Malaya from attending the Afro-Asian Solidarity

Conference  in Moshi. The Communists were afraid  and

worried  because  of the presence  of  the  Malaysian

delegation from Singapore who could expose their  lie

about  Malaysia.  The Communists  in  the  conference

tried  to  lobby  the other Afro-Asian  countries  to

agree  to  a resolution to send 20,000 volunteers  to

support  the  aggression perpetrated  by  Azahari  in

Borneo,  but  the  Singapore  and  Malayan  delegates

headed by Mr Devan Nair - a sincere and true patriot,

who  at  one time was involved in the M.C.P. struggle

but   who  later  left  the  M.C.P. because  he  was

convinced  that the struggle launched by  the  M.C.P.

was not good for this country - were able to influence

the other delegates in Moshi. Likewise, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



the Afro-Asian Journalists Conference held in Jakarta

not   long  ago,  the  Communist  groups  once  again

expressed  strong opposition to Malaysia,  but  their

efforts were futile, and they could not influence the

other  delegates  from the Afro-Asian  countries  who

attended that conference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the people who have really fought for Malaysia outside this country, with the result that the United Arab Republic, India, Burma and other countries gave their support to the establishment of Malaysia, are the leaders of the P.A.P. headed by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. Do the

Barisan Sosialis Members in this Chamber consider the

U.A.R., India and Burma as neo-colonialist countries?

If  the  Members  opposite consider themselves  anti-colonial, we are even more anti-colonial. But we  are

national  patriots  with undivided  loyalty  to  this

country,  and we are prepared at any time  to  defend

our  country  against aggression  from  any  quarter.

Where is the patriotism of the hon. Members opposite?

Are they loyal to this country? No. Their loyalty  is

to  Indonesia. They are agents of Communist Indonesia

which has embarked on confrontation against Malaysia.

They  do not work for the interests of the people  of

this  country,  but  for  their  foreign  masters  in

Indonesia. In other words, they are agents  of  their

foreign  masters  in Jakarta. They are  agents  of  a

country  which is our enemy - a government  which  has

embarked  on  aggression resulting in many  Malaysian

lives  being  lost. They represent the enemies  in  a

place where they get facilities for education, and as

Members  of this Assembly, they receive an  allowance

of $500 per month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, this country has fed them - sometimes they eat food more than three times a day;

in  Indonesia, if you get food once in three days you

are  lucky.  But  what  has happened?  They  are  the

spokesmen of a country which is determined  to  smash

us.  I  am  ashamed  to see their behaviour  in  this

Chamber.  I  do not think any true Malaysian  citizen

will  adopt such low tactics of the Barisan  Sosialis

Members  opposite. They expect that if  confrontation

succeeds, they will get high places in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



country;  they hope that their defeated candidate  in

the  last  election in Rochore will be elected  Prime

Minister and that many of them will be Ministers. Let

me  emphasise  here  that  if  we  are  destroyed  by

Indonesia, they will not get a chance at all to  hold

such  posts which they dream of. What will happen  is

that  the  aggressors from Indonesia will  confiscate

everything  in this country and what the agents  will

get  will be the residues from the hungry aggressors.

Therefore, there is no use for them to shout in  this

Assembly  that  the P.A.P. Government are  exploiting

and   suppressing  Chinese  education  and   culture,

because  they  know  very well the  attitude  of  the

Indonesian leaders towards the Chinese. Yesterday, my

colleague, the Minister for Culture, stated  in  this

Assembly  that  the utterances and behaviour  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis over the last few days will involve

them  in  a  very dangerous position. What they  have

done  amounts  to treason against the government  and

the   nation,  and  according  to  the  law,  it   is

punishable  by  death. For that  reason,  Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  their leaders like Messrs. Woodhull,  James

Puthucheary and Lim Shee Ping have announced publicly

that  they  do not wish to associate themselves  with

the Barisan Sosialis activities because these actions

are  fraught with danger. Therefore, the necks of the

Opposition  Members in front of me are in the  noose.

People  like Messrs. Woodhull, James Puthucheary  and

Lim  Shee  Ping are no political chickens. They  know

the  consequence  if they involve themselves  in  the

activities  of  the Barisan Sosialis. They  are  more

politically  intelligent  than  these  seven  Barisan

Sosialis Members. Well, there is still time. I advise

them to retreat before they are swallowed. I wish  to

remind  the Members opposite that the people in  this

country  condemn  their acts which involve  treachery

and  treason in collaboration with foreign  countries

to  smash Malaysia. They are fed up and they hate the

tactics  of  the  Barisan. The Barisan  Members  must

consider carefully what they say and how they  behave

in  this  Assembly.  They may  be  applauded  by  the

Gallery  but they are hated by members of the public.

Their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>



acts  are  bringing shame to the people of Malaysia.

Let  us  take  stock  of the position.  Refrain  from

carrying  out treacherous acts against this  country,

because those who will bear the consequences will  be

the  hon. Members themselves opposite. As we reminded

them  yesterday,  there is still  time  for  them  to

reconsider the situation. If they are lost at the end

of  the road, they should go back to the beginning of

the road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, today we have read in the

newspapers that 37 saboteurs from Indonesia have been

arrested. I feel that in the next few days the  total

will  be increased. At least a further seven will  be

nabbed!



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> The Member for Paya Lebar is

most  eager to speak, but I think the Chair has given

ample  opportunity to the Opposition to speak. As  he

is  the  last speaker in the Opposition, I intend  to

give the Government benchers the opportunity to speak

first  and  he will then be given plenty of  time  to

speak later. Mr Yong Nyuk Lin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in  support  of

the  motion,  standing  in  the  name  of  the  Prime

Minister,  expressing  our thanks  to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara for his speech on 29th November, 1963,

and  to  reject the amendment proposed by the  Member

for Jurong which was supported by the Member for Paya

Lebar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Singapore can reasonably be proud of its

health  and medical services, if judged in comparison

with standards obtainable in countries of South Asia,

yet  we see no reason for complacency over this state

of  affairs, because we must always strive  to  raise

the  standards  of public health and hygiene  of  our

people  to  the highest possible pitch, so that  ill-health  and  disease  can be reduced  to  its  lowest

level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in attempting to provide better medical

facilities for our people, we must ultimately face up

with  other  problems,  e.g. finance,  shortage   of

qualified  personnel  like  doctors,  which  is   not

peculiar to Singapore alone but is world wide in  its

applicability. Therefore, we,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>



need  to find new solutions to our problems by making

greater  efforts  to  recruit and  train  more  para-medical  and  auxiliary staff like nurses  (male  and

female),  health inspectors, laboratory  technicians,

midwives  and others, in order to provide a full  and

adequate service for our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is well known, our rate of population growth at

nearly  4  per  cent per annum is twice  the  average

world rate. But our present infant mortality rate  at

31  per thousand live births and crude death rate  at

under 6 per thousand are reasonably comparable to any

of  the advanced nations of the world today. In these

circumstances, we must pay more attention  to  family

planning  for our mothers than hitherto.  I  wish  in

this respect to pay the highest tribute, Sir, to  the

gallant efforts of our dedicated voluntary workers in

the  Singapore Family Planning Association for  their

good  work  in the past and to assure them  that  our

Ministry  will  spare no efforts henceforth  to  work

more  closely  with  them, in order  to  provide  yet

better   facilities   for   the   dissemination    of

information and advice to mothers at every one of our

Maternal   and   Child   Health  Centres   throughout

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, how healthy a country's

population  is  will  largely be  determined  by  the

effectiveness  of its public health measures.  May  I

remind the House of the relevant part of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's  speech on the  subject  of  Public

Health  [Hansard, 29th November, 1963, col.  124]?  I

have  mentioned it before, Sir, in the Budget debate,

but I think it needs repetition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`On the Public Health side, the Ministry is

planning  a  reorganisation  of  the  City  Cleansing

services.  A gradual run-down of transport equipment,

expansion  of  urban  and  housing  areas   and   the

corresponding huge increase in the number of hawkers,

inadequate methods of supervision resulting  in  lack

of  discipline  in  the  work force,  complicated  by

secret  society elements in their midst, have brought

about  an  increase in rubbish, flies and mosquitoes.

All  this  can  and will be put right. Reorganisation

can succeed once these factors have been dealt with.'



<br><br>In his speech of 9th December, our Prime Minister,

when elaborating on the fourth target of the

Government for the next five years - that of raising

social



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



standards - said [Hansard, Vol. 22, No. 4, col 148]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I wish to emphasise higher standards of public and

social conduct. This can be brought about by a

sustained process of education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was inevitable that with new forms of popular

and representative government, hawkers, squatters and

other  social problems increase. But slowly as social

standards  and  civic  consciousness  correspondingly

increase,  hawkers for instance begin  to  understand

that  they  must stay out of the main traffic  routes

and  that  they  must  for their  own  sake  maintain

certain standards of cleanliness and hygiene. Litter,

rubbish, flies and mosquitoes are not only the job of

the  Health Ministry and the workers in the Cleansing

Department, but the social responsibility of all.'



<br><br>Public  health measures, Sir, can therefore  only  be

effective  if each and every one plays his part,  and

it  is our hope that with patient education and time,

we  can  make  our people uphold higher standards  of

social  responsibility in respect  of  public  health

than hitherto.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now wish to answer the irresponsible

statements  made  by the Member  for  Jurong  in  his

speech  of  9th  December pertaining  to  the  Health

Ministry. According to the transcript of Hansard,  p.

18, para. 6, line 4 [col. 161], he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Diseases like malaria, long unheard of in Singapore, are once again making their reappearance.'



<br><br>The  Member  for  Jurong does not  know  what  he  is

talking about. Presence of mosquitoes alone does  not

signify  incidence of malaria, although  it  is  true

that  certain  types of mosquitoes can cause  malaria

and  spread this disease. May I enlighten the  Member

for Jurong that the World Health Organisation regards

Singapore  as  "an  area in which  Malaria  has  been

eradicated", unlike his homeland - Indonesia - and that

my  Ministry  will  continue to  maintain  its  anti-malarial measures to the best of its ability to  keep

up this good record.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong again shows not only his utter

ignorance of the subject of El Tor Cholera  but  also

states  falsehoods (typical of all  Barisan  Sosialis

types)  when he goes on further to say, according  to

the  transcript of Hansard, page 19, first paragraph,

line 9 [col. 162]:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With such a dangerous and infectious disease like

cholera,  the  confirmed diagnosis of  two  cases  is

sufficient to warrant the description of the  disease

situation  as  epidemic.  Yet  the  people  were  not

informed  of  the seriousness of the situation  until

there were 10 confirmed cases.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ever since the first bacteriological confirmed

case  of  El Tor Cholera was known on 13th  November,

1963,  the  W.H.O. International Sanitary Regulations

required  public  announcement  of  Singapore   being

declared  a cholera infected port. This was  done  by

Government Gazette Extraordinary No. 2774 of the same

date  and  this news was published in all newspapers,

including   the  Chinese  newspapers,  the  following

morning.  With  every confirmed  case  or  discovered

"carrier", there had not only been the usual  follow-up

of  public  health measures such as isolation  of

direct  contacts,  stoppage of  food  preparation  by

hawkers  within  200 yards, sterilisation  of  wells,

disinfection of houses, etc. but a daily bulletin was

also  issued giving details of the residence and area

of   every   confirmed  case  and  opening   of   new

inoculation  centres to suit the convenience  of  the

public.



<br><br>10.16 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since the first confirmed case was discovered,

the professional officers, i.e. qualified doctors  of

the  Ministry,  held  daily meetings  to  assess  the

situation.   Professor   Lim   Kok   Ann    of    the

Bacteriological  Department  of  the  University   of

Singapore was present at these early meetings. During

the   first  few  days  it  was  the  view   of   the

professional officers that as more than  1.2  million

have had inoculations only six months ago during  the

May  outbreak, the number of cases did not justify  a

decision  to launch another mass inoculation campaign

until  19th  November  when  there  were  five  known

confirmed cases and four symptomless "carriers".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision was then arrived at, too, that El Tor

Cholera  had come to stay in Singapore in an  endemic

form  and that anti-cholera inoculations alone  would

not  be  good enough and that adequate and  effective

Public Health measures must be maintained throughout



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>



the year. It was then decided that a second mass

inoculation  campaign should be  organised  with  the

opening of more than 30 centres throughout the island

as from 25th November. I am pleased to say that up to

date more than 700,000 have inoculated themselves  at

33 free Government centres, and I hope that many more

will  take advantage of the free services offered  by

Government  before  the month-long  mass  inoculation

campaign comes to an end, in three days' time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to express my

thanks  to  the  Council  of  the  Singapore  Medical

Association for their co-operation in recommending to

their members to charge only a nominal fee of $1 when

using free cholera vaccine from the Government during

the Mass Inoculation Campaign. I want also to express

my  deepest gratitude to the doctors associated  with

32  private dispensaries for coming forward to assist

the  Government during this period. I understand that

many thousands have been so inoculated under the free

Government  vaccine scheme. It is my hope  that  this

welcome  co-operation from our private  practitioners

will  be  extended to all fields, in order  that  the

best  possible medical service may be placed  at  the

disposal of our people in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to date there have been 24 confirmed cases and

13  symptomless  carriers  - the  figure  13  is  very

symbolic - with two regrettable deaths. One was an 85-year old woman who was already in a state of collapse

when admitted to Middleton Hospital and died within a

few hours, and the other a 56-year old man who was an

opium addict and had, in addition, pneumonia as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Jurong says that two confirmed

cases  of cholera means an epidemic, then I am afraid

he  has been wrongly advised by his Party doctors for

not keeping abreast with latest medical knowledge, as

not to be able to differentiate between classical  or

"Asiatic"  cholera,  which is  a  more  virulent  and

explosive  type of cholera, commonly known in  India,

from  El  Tor Cholera, which has now come to stay  in

Singapore. El Tor Cholera was first diagnosed in 1906

in  Egypt from Mecca pilgrims. According to the World

Health



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>



Organisation,  16th  World Health  Assembly  held  at

Geneva  in  May this year, Report No. 127  -page  31,

para. 18.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Committee recalls that in 1957, at the time of

its  fifth  session and for some decades before  that

time, all reported cases of the disease due to El Tor

vibrios  had been limited to the Celebes.  [That  is,

Indonesia]  It  was on this basis that the  Committee

was  of  the opinion that this disease should not  be

included in the term cholera, a quarantinable disease

under  the  International Sanitary  Regulations.  The

11th World Health Assembly endorsed this opinion.'



<br><br>It  was  only  in  May  1962 after  hearing  detailed

reports  of several outbreaks of the El Tor infection

in   Indonesia,  Sarawak,  Macao,  Hong   Kong,   the

Philippines  and North Borneo, and having  considered

the   views   of  the  experts  on  these  outbreaks,

including the conclusions and recommendations of  the

Scientific Group on Cholera Research and the findings

of  the meeting in Manila, that El Tor Cholera became

a  notifiable and a quarantinable disease. This  then

is  the  situation in Singapore today.  There  is  no

cause  for  panic  or alarm but of  determination  to

raise  the  Public Health consciousness  of  everyone

throughout the State of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, Sir, may I enlighten this House by

quoting  a  further relevant extract from the  W.H.O.

Report  again.  I  quote from page 37,  para.  48  on

Hongkong:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`During the period 1 July 1961 to 30 June 1962,

Hongkong  in  common with certain other countries  in

the  region  was  infected with cholera  El  Tor.  An

account   of  the  outbreak  in  Hongkong  has   been

published  as a White Paper and copies of this  White

Paper  have  already been forwarded to  the  Director

General of WHO.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the experience gained of the epidemiology of

cholera  during  the  outbreak  in  Hongkong,  it  is

suggested   that  Articles  60  to  69, of   the

International   Sanitary   Regulations   should    be

reviewed. Despite the considerable powers conveyed by

these articles, it has not proved possible to prevent

the entry of Vibrio cholera infections into countries

in  the  region  despite  rigid  application  of  the

quarantine measures allowed by the Regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of the contact-carrier in the

dissemination of cholera is not fully understood, but

there  is  evidence  to support  the  view  that  the

contact-carrier  without  clinical  symptoms  of  the

disease  may  be  the  agent  of  dissemination  from

country   to  country,  particularly  those  contact-carriers moving by sea



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>



in  small vessels over short distances which  do  not

normally go through quarantine inspections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is evident that the powers at present given

under  the Regulations are not wide enough to prevent

the dissemination of cholera.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of El Tor Cholera in Singapore today

can   be  said  to  be  similar  to  the  unfortunate

existence of Communists and Barisan Sosialis  in  the

political field. Whereas the Barisan Sosialis can  be

likened  to  persons  suffering  from  diarrhoea   or

dysentery  or even confirmed cases of El Tor  Cholera

because  they are open front apologists for Communism

for  all to see, the really dangerous people are  the

Communists  who spread the doctrine of Communism,  of

hatred,  evil and poison without disclosing who  they

are  and  what  they  are. It  is  these  symptomless

carriers  like  El  Tor Cholera  carriers,  outwardly

harmless  and  innocent  but  actually  sinister  and

dangerous carriers of germs, disease and death,  that

we  must slowly and patiently ferret out, isolate and

quarantine,  as  it were, so that  the  rest  of  the

people of Singapore may live in peace and happiness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Jurong has seen fit to say that

"the  manner in which the Government has handled  the

cholera  epidemic is deplorable" (page 18 [col.  161]

of the Transcript of Hansard). He even ended with the

much   stronger  words  that  "the  P.A.P. must   be

condemned for its criminal negligence in the handling

of  the cholera epidemic" (page 19 [col. 162]). As an

elected  Minister  and charged by my  Prime  Minister

with  the  responsibility of being in charge  of  the

Ministry  of Health I accept full responsibility  for

everything that is done or has failed to be  done  by

my  Ministry. I do not disappear and run into  hiding

when things happen or appear to go wrong like two  of

their so-called leaders - the Members for Nee Soon and

Toa  Payoh. Where are these so-called leaders?  Where

are they? Sir, I am not in the least disturbed by the

strong language used by the Member for Jurong. It  is

for  the  people  of  Singapore and  the  responsible

people  of  Singapore to pass judgment on  me  or  my

Party, which I am privileged to serve.

treasonable Barisan Sosialis and ask them  to  return

to their homeland Indonesia where they belong!

<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you. Mr

Speaker, for giving me a chance to speak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, concerning the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

speech and the debate thereon up till  now, we  have  not

seen and we have not  heard  what  the P.A.P. Government

have advanced or what measures they have  given  to  us

to understand  in  tackling  the confrontation  policy.

What they have been  doing  is

all  the  time  blaming the Communists,  the  Barisan

Sosialis.  It  is most regrettable that  no  one  has

taken  down how many times they have used the phrases

"Communists",  "Barisan Communists"  and  so  on.  On

matters that affect the livelihood of the people, the

P.A.P. Members have never said anything. Instead they

put  all  the  blame  on  us.  They  blame  Soekarno,

Indonesia  and the Barisan for the confrontation  and

its consequent sufferings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now refute the arguments by the Ministers

and  advance my reasons for doing so to show  to  the

people  of Singapore that we are not smearing and  we

are  not slandering or talking without any reason  or

fact in support. Perhaps the P.A.P. Ministers may not

want to admit what I am going to say, but the man in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>



the  street in Singapore knows what kind of  attitude

they have been adopting in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I want to deal with the smears made by the

Ministers of the P.A.P. in this House. First of  all,

the Member for Punggol asked us to express our stand.

He  was  only taking the cue from the Prime Minister.

He  had  nothing new to advance in this  House.  From

what the Minister for Social Affairs has said in this

House just now, I say there is no need to counter him

in  my  reply because his speech is similar  to  that

made by the Minister for Culture. So I will now first

deal with the allegations of the Minister for Culture

against us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 11th of December and yesterday he tried his

best  to attack us. He used a very simple weapon - the

term  "Communists". He applied this term to  us,  the

Barisan  Sosialis Assemblymen. Playing on this  term,

he  thought that he could bamboozle the people by his

long  and  stinking speech, shouting and  yelling  at

us.  We  were bored by his speech. I dare  say  that

without  the  term "Communists", he  would  have  had

nothing  to  say. The only thing he could talk  about

was  Communists, Communists, and Communism. His logic

was also absurd and ridiculous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried his best to put the blame of Indonesian

confrontation  on  the  shoulders  of   the   Barisan

Sosialis.  On  the other hand, he tried to  whitewash

the  sufferings  and consequences  brought  about  by

Malaysia  and  the hatred of the people for  Malaysia

and  the P.A.P. He even tried to make good use of the

hatred  of  the  people for the P.A.P. and  for  the

sufferings  and  ill-consequences  brought  about  by

Malaysia.  He  even made use of this hatred  for  the

P.A.P. to  put the blame on us in order  to  achieve

their  purpose  of isolating us. He seemed  to  think

that by doing so he would be able to fix us, which is

mere fantasy on his part. I would like to remind  him

of  something, but unfortunately he is not here  now.

In  the  course of his speech, he forgot to hide  his

fox-tail. He made very serious mistakes. He  admitted

that there have been economic difficulties after  the

establishment of Malaysia. And in his defence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>



of  the  establishment of Malaysia, he said that  the

purchasing  power and the standard of living  of  the

people  have  been  raised. He painted  a  very  rosy

picture  of  Singapore. In doing so, he  exposed  the

ulterior motives for bringing about Malaysia, and  at

the  same  time,  he  smeared all those  Parties  and

people  who  did  not agree with the  P.A.P.  In  our

speeches,  we have refuted his specious arguments.  I

had thought of asking the Minister one question but I

am unable to do so now as he is not here. But I would

ask  him  not  to  waste  his  time  by  calling   us

"Communists". It is futile. In his speech, which  was

specious  and incorrect, he harboured impure  motives

and evil thoughts. I say that the true reason for the

economic  difficulties is the nature  of  reactionary

Malaysia which has obstructed the development of  our

national  culture,  education and progress.  But  the

Minister  for  Culture tried  to  put  the  blame  on

others. Yet in the end, he could not explain away all

these evil consequences of Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> On a point

of order. I do not think we have a quorum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice taken that thirteen Members were not

present,  Members  summoned  as  if  for  a  division

pursuant  to the Standing Order, and meeting  resumed

upon a quorum being then present.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We now have a quorum. Will the Member

for Paya Lebar please continue?



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The patriotism of

the  Barisan  Sosialis and their anti-Malaysia  stand

are   always   a  grave  threat  to  the  reactionary

Government  which have not been able  to  refute  our

arguments.  That  is  why they  have  resorted  to  a

slanderous  campaign  to distort  our  stand  and  to

undermine us. That is why they have slandered  us  as

agents of foreign powers. But their every attempt  to

slander us is not convincing to the people. And  they

have  not  been  able  to  explain  away  their   own

arguments and who are really working for the  foreign

powers.  The  cunning  and  sinister  attack  by  the

Minister for Culture is clear to all. His



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>



childish   argument   cannot  deceive   people   with

political common sense. The Barisan Sosialis stand is

for  the  people  of our country  and  we  place  the

interest of the people above everything else. What we

have  done in the past clearly shows that. The P.A.P.

accuse  us  of being the so-called agents of  foreign

powers in order to divert the attention of the people

from  the  grave  economic problems of  our  country.

Every  one  knows  that  if a  country  achieves  its

political independence without any economic  freedom,

this  sort of independence is not complete in  itself

and there is a danger of the country being controlled

and  manipulated by other powers. South  Vietnam  and

Thailand  are some examples of countries  which  have

achieved  only political independence. We  hope  that

this Government will not follow the line of these two

countries  and induce foreign capital  to  put  up  a

facade of prosperity which will not help to solve the

living  problems  of our people. Instead,  they  will

bring  hardship  and  disaster  to  our  people.  The

inducement  of  foreign capital will only  result  in

exploitation of our people. We cannot tolerate such a

type of policy. The P.A.P. persistently carry on with

this  policy.  They have unashamedly said  that  they

work for the people, but do you think that the people

cannot  see  through their policy? The  Minister  for

Culture  said that their loyalty is towards Malaysia.

We  believe that, but the P.A.P. are trying to  curry

favour with the reactionary cliques and their masters

to  sell out the interests of the people. All the new

emerging  forces have also made clear  their  stands,

but  these people have brought instability and  chaos

to   South-East  Asia.  In  order  to   shift   their

responsibility,  the P.A.P. are trying  to  make  the

Barisan  Sosialis  a scapegoat,  but  the  facts  are

irrefutable.  They  try  to  mix  up  socialism  with

Indonesia  in  order to divert the attention  of  the

people,  to  confuse their vision and  to  make  them

forget  the real crux of the problem - that the  cause

of our present difficulties has been brought about by

the  imperialists.  The  P.A.P. also  say  that  the

Barisan's  demand for the abolition  of  the  British

military bases here will pave the way for invasion by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>



another  foreign  power. Every  one  with  any  self-respect  will  know  that the stationing  of  foreign

troops  here is an insult to our country. It  implies

that   the   colonialists  want  to  maintain   their

exploitation  by  ruthless  means  to  strangle   our

economy. All those who are loyal to our country  will

not  tolerate the stationing of foreign  troops  here

for  the so-called safeguarding of our country.  This

act  of betrayal is very clear to all. [Interruption]

Do  you dare to have an open argument with me at Hong

Lim Park?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If we argue among ourselves, we will

never  be  able to end this debate. Please  carry  on

with the debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  financial policies and budgets of  a  government

reflect  its  character and nature. A  government  of

rogues  will  have a budget befitting its  character.

The  P.A.P. which have betrayed the people, can  only

put  up  a  Budget  which will be beneficial  to  the

foreigners.  Therefore,  the  Minister  for   Culture

should not level all sorts of accusations against us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me refute his challenge. He has brought

our  people  to the brink of war with our neighbours.

Malaysia, which is designed to serve the interests of

the  imperialists, has brought about the  suppression

and   exploitation   of  our  people,   tension   and

instability in South-East Asia. We should condemn the

Alliance Government and the P.A.P. for having brought

about  this disastrous outcome. The diplomatic  break

and  the  severance  of  trade between  Malaysia  and

Indonesia  is  the result of their policy.  Factories

have  closed down and unemployment has increased.  We

feel  that, at the present juncture, the only way  to

solve  our problems is to open negotiations to  solve

the  differences peacefully. All those who shirk such

responsibilities do not help to solve our problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture has challenged us to say

whether  we  hope  confrontation  will  succeed.  His

argument does not merit our rebuttal. We want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



ask   him  on  what  foundation  he  has  made   this

allegation. Mr Speaker, Sir, in the first place,  we

fully  realise that there has been a loss in  foreign

exchange  as  a  result of Malaysia.  We  also  fully

appreciate that Malaysia is to serve the interests of

the   colonialists.  This  appreciation   should   be

accepted, as this is the whole crux of the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture is afraid that the people

of  Singapore will see through Malaysia and his plot.

So  he has brought in other extraneous matters in his

speech in order to blind the vision of the people  of

Singapore and to divert their attention from the crux

of  the matter. The P.A.P. are now trying to push the

responsibility  of an economic crisis  over  to  this

side  of the House, namely, on the shoulders  of  the

Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture is afraid that we want to

expose  the  whole matter, clearly and in detail,  to

the broad masses of the people. So he has brought  in

these extraneous matters in order to blind the vision

of  the people. And we know what he is up to.  He  is

making  this challenge in order to smear us as agents

and  collaborators of foreign powers so that  he  can

push the whole matter on to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture has also attacked our

amendment  with a lot of intimidation as  though  the

Opposition  Members  are  not  allowed  by   law   in

Singapore  to  air  their views on  the  Government's

policies. He says that we are pro-Indonesia,  and  so

we should be charged with treason in court punishable

by  death or life imprisonment. Does he mean that  we

in  the  Opposition have no right  to  criticise  the

Government's  policies in this Chamber? Everybody  in

Singapore  knows  that Malaysia  is  a  new  form  of

colonialism brought about by the colonialists in this

part  of the world. And now the P.A.P. are trying  in

every way to put through this neo-colonial plan.  Who

is the traitor? Who has sold out the interests of the

people?  Who  is guilty of treason?  It  is  not  the

Barisan Sosialis. In order to judge whether a  person

is guilty of treason or not, we must know whether the

acts committed by him are in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



interest of the people or against the interest of the

people.  You cannot judge whether a person is  guilty

of  treason  or  not from the point of  view  of  the

imperialists and colonialists. If you do so, then you

are  a traitor and you are guilty of treason. If  you

disregard  the interest of the people, then  you  are

not  a  true  patriot.  Those  who  do  not  actually

struggle  for the genuine interest of the people  are

the  traitors.  So if the Minister for  Culture  says

that  anybody who votes for the amendment  tabled  by

the  Barisan  Sosialis will be guilty of treason  and

perhaps be charged in court with treason and punished

according  to  the law, I say that this  is  a  grave

threat to the rights of parliamentary democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We warn the Minister for Culture and the rest of

them  that  if  they  should persist  in  their  acts

against the interest of the people and sell out their

rights  to a foreign power, then the people will  one

day  inflict on them serious punishment for what they

have  done.  History will prove that the people  will

punish  the  real traitors - namely, the  P.A.P.  - who

have sold out the interest of the people to a foreign

power. History will prove this to be so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have dealt adequately with the speech of the

Minister for Culture who barks like a dog at shadows.

Now  we shall deal with the Prime Minister. As I have

already said, Mr Speaker, the Member for Punggol has

more or less echoed the speech of the Prime Minister.

But  we will not deal with what he has said. We  will

go  back to the root of the whole matter - namely,  the

speech of the Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister made his speech on

the  9th  of December this year. I wish to draw  your

attention to the fact that he was incapable of saying

anything new in his speech. He has repeated  his  old

arguments;  to put everything in a nutshell,  he  has

been   trying  very  hard  to  smear  his   political

opponents  and  those  who come  out  in  defence  of

vernacular  education and the labouring class.  So  I

will  touch on his main points and give him  suitable

replies. From his speech, one can notice



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>



several  main features. Perhaps the Back-benchers  of

the  Government may not understand; so I wish to draw

their attention to these main features.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, the Prime Minister tried very

hard  to  please the Malaysian Prime Minister,  Tunku

Abdul Rahman. He attempted to compete for the Tunku's

favour  to  oust  the  M.C.A. in  the  Federation  of

Malaya.  In  fact, the Prime Minister has said  quite

clearly  that he wishes to oust the M.C.A. from  the

U.M.N.O./M.C.A./Alliance,  so  that  the  P.A.P. can

replace the M.C.A. in the Alliance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the Prime Minister tried

to show that the P.A.P. really had the support of the

people in the elections, thereby covering up the fact

that they had resorted to filthy means in the general

election to gain power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, in his speech, it is clear that the

determination   of   the   P.A.P. is   to   destroy

parliamentary democracy. In this attempt, he tries to

put  the  blame for the grave consequences  and

ill-effects  of confrontation on his political  opponents

and true patriots of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, it is the intention of the Government to

try  to  strangle Chinese education. We can see  very

clearly what action the Government have taken against

Nanyang  University,  which is the  seat  of  Chinese

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, it was also the intention of the Prime

Minister in his speech to indulge in a dangerous game

by  describing all those who come out in  defence  of

Chinese education as Communists, thereby whipping  up

racial  feelings. He tries to whip up racial feelings

over  educational  issues. The so-called  Citizenship

Consultative  Committee is a  measure  by  which  the

P.A.P. desire to further control the daily lives  and

freedom  of the people of Singapore. He is doing  all

these  things in the name of Singapore. He  has  said

that  if in the town areas the election results  show

that the M.C.A. is no longer welcome and influential,

then  the  U.M.N.O. in the Alliance should reappraise

the situation with regard to the P.A.P. in Singapore.

He was not specific; he was very vague, but one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>



can   read  between  the  lines  to  find   out   his

intentions.  He wants to try to kick out  the  M.C.A.

from  the  U.M.N.O./ M.C.A./M.I.C.  Alliance  and  to

replace them.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member is repeating what his other

colleagues  have  said, that the  Prime  Minister  is

trying to be the Prime Minister of the Federation and

that  the P.A.P. are trying to take the place of  the

M.C.A. Can we get on to something else?



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I shall

go back to the main topic, but I have to reply to the

smears   made  by  the  P.A.P. against  the  Barisan

Sosialis. Since you rule that this is repetitious,  I

shall not dwell on it anymore. I am not going to  say

any   more  about  the  P.A.P.'s  attempt   to   gain

U.M.N.O.'s favour in the Federation of Malaya, but  I

personally  feel that as far as we are concerned,  we

should  be  very frank in our political struggle.  We

should  not  try  to  be very vague  and  indulge  in

smearing others, particularly political opponents. We

have  to  adopt  a  spirit of  statesmanship  in  our

political  struggle.  We cannot allow  ourselves  and

others  to  indulge in dirty political games.  Today,

the  Prime Minister hopes very much to kick  out  the

M.C.A. so that there can be more co-operation between

U.M.N.O. and the P.A.P. On the one hand, he tries  to

sour  up  the relationship between U.M.N.O. and  the

M.C.A., and, on the other hand, he tries very hard to

please  the Tunku and also his colleague,  Tun  Abdul

Razak, with whom the P.A.P. are trying hard to  curry

favour.  But it is impossible for the P.A.P. to  kick

out   the   M.C.A. from  the  U.M.N.O./M.C.A./M.I.C.

Alliance.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member is back on the same theme.

I  have just ruled him out of order. Can he get on to

some other subject?



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): This is very

important, Mr Speaker, but I shall take your  advice

and  forget about this. What I am going to say is  of

great   importance.  The  Prime  Minister  has   said

unashamedly  that the P.A.P. represent the  majority.

It seems that the P.A.P. represent the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>



majority  and  that  we, the Barisan,  represent  the

minority,  and  we  should  be  banned.  The  Barisan

Sosialis  should  be  banned and  expelled  from  the

Chamber, but it is futile for the P.A.P. to make  use

of some superficial figure to cover up the true facts

of  the  situation.  If you are  not  forgetful,  Mr

Speaker,  you will remember that in the last  general

election in South Vietnam, Ngo Dinh Diem claimed that

he  had  a 99.8 per cent majority, and his wife  also

claimed that Ngo Dinh Diem was able to obtain a  99.9

per  cent majority in the general election. The Prime

Minister,  who has not been able to obtain  99.9  per

cent of the votes, compares himself with Ngo Dinh  Nu

and Ngo Dinh Diem. But what are the facts? The people

in  South Vietnam simply hate Ngo Dinh Diem  and  his

regime  like poison. Yet Ngo Dinh Diem's  regime  has

the   audacity  to  claim  that  they  represent  the

majority  of the people. Mr Speaker, we all  condemn

the  so-called  election that  took  place  in  South

Vietnam.  This  is sufficient to show  that  majority

representation and minority representation is  not  a

criterion on which the true wishes of the people  can

be measured. In some countries such as South Vietnam,

arrests are made of political opponents of the  Party

in  power,  persecution is resorted to, and  all  the

state machinery is marshalled and made use of against

the  true  patriots  and the real  statesmen  in  the

country.  In  spite of all these repressive  actions,

the  Party in power has the audacity to turn now  and

say  that they represent the majority of the people.

What  a shame! In spite of what the P.A.P. have done,

they  can  only obtain less than 50 per cent  of  the

votes cast in the general election, to say nothing of

their  being able to obtain the majority  support  of

the   people.  In  spite  of  all  this,   they   say

unashamedly that they represent the real majority  of

the people. Mr Speaker, although we were defeated in

the  general election we have to draw your  attention

to  the  fact that the way in which the election  was

conducted was unfair ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We are not discussing the last

elections.  Keep  on to the Negara's  speech.  I  had

occasion  to rule before that we have had  enough  of

the elections. Go on to the Negara's speech.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I hope

that  you will bear with me because this is precisely

the  point mentioned in the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

speech.  So we want to let the people know our  views

of the results of the general election, otherwise the

people  might  be  misled by the  P.A.P.  It  is  our

responsibility,  as  Members of  the  Opposition,  to

clear  up the position. We were able to poll  200,000

votes in the general election, and so we ask that our

views be respected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Prime Minister's speech, we were further

smeared  by him. He said that we tried to  pull  down

the pillars of parliamentary democracy. Now, this  is

a  smear  which  we have to squash.  It  is  not  the

Barisan  Sosialis  which  desire  to  pull  down  the

pillars  of parliamentary democracy. In fact,  it  is

the  other  way round. It is the P.A.P. which  desire

parliamentary democracy to fail in this part  of  the

world. The P.A.P. are not prepared to face up to  the

consequences   of  their  action   in   breaking   up

parliamentary democracy in this island, and  so  they

try to put the blame on the Barisan Sosialis and make

use of this as an excuse to further persecute them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who have banned the rural organisations and hawkers

associations? Who have resorted to violence to  break

up  legitimate strikes? Who have assaulted non-P.A.P.

election workers? Who have prohibited and denied  the

people freedom of association, freedom of speech  and

freedom of publication? Who have sent Special  Branch

men  to  Nanyang  University to arrest  students  and

undergraduates  and assault some undergraduates?  Who

have  exerted pressure on the Vice-Chancellor of  the

University  of  Singapore? And who have  resorted  to

undemocratic  means? Are these not  facts  enough  to

show   that   they  try  to  break  up  parliamentary

democracy? This is what the P.A.P. have done. Or  can

one  say  that  it  has  been  done  by  the  Barisan

Sosialis?  In  fact, their dirty game has  been  seen

through by all concerned. As I have already said,  in

spite  of all the futile means adopted by the P.A.P.,

they  can  only obtain less than 50 per cent  of  the

votes.  In spite of their persecution of us,  we  are

able to get more than 20 per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



cent  of the votes cast in the general election. This

is  a cause of great worry to the P.A.P. That is why,

after realising that it is futile to resort to humbug

and   deceit  to  gain  further  support,  they   are

resorting  to  further means by which  they  hope  to

crush their political opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. try to make use of legal means to

further  control and squash political  opposition  in

Singapore. Now, this again is enough to show that  it

is  the P.A.P. which desire to break up parliamentary

democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we have to appeal to al the people in

Singapore  who  are  politically  conscious  to   pay

attention to the damage that the P.A.P. have done  to

parliamentary democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have been very sarcastic about those who

fight for Chinese education. In his speech, the Prime

Minister  has disclosed his hatred of those  Chinese-educated people and his intention to strangle Chinese

education in Singapore. He smears those who light for

Chinese  education and the cause of Chinese education

as    traitors,   pro-Communist   and   anti-national

elements. He even smears the Management Committee  of

Nanyang   University  and  tries  to  sour   up   the

relationship  between  the  teaching  staff  and  the

Management Committee of Nanyang University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister in his speech says that the

appointment of members of the teaching staff is  good

for  only  one  year. That is why they do  not  enjoy

security in their appointments. That is why they  are

not  daring enough to come forward to defend academic

freedom.  So  he talks about security  of  tenure  of

appointment as a means by which he wishes to sour the

relationship  between the teaching staff  of  Nanyang

University and the Management Committee of  the  same

University.  This again is enough to  show  that  the

P.A.P. and  their  oligarchy will  not  hesitate  at

anything  to  smear, to the fullest  extent,  Chinese

education,  Nanyang University and those  who  fight

for   the   interests  of  Chinese   education.   The

reactionary  attitude of the P.A.P. in education  has

been seen through by the people in Singapore. So  the

responsibility  of having put Chinese  schools  in  a

precarious position should be shifted from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>



the  P.A.P. shoulders to somebody else's  shoulders.

That  is  why the P.A.P. are putting on the shoulders

of  other people the responsibility of the failure of

Chinese education in its growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the P.A.P. wish very much to gain control

of  Nanyang  University. This  is  a  fact  known  to

everybody.  That  is  why  they  are  making  use  of

finances and economic aid against Nanyang University.

They  have  refused  to  recognise  the  degrees  and

qualifications of Nanyang University. In spite of the

Government's interference with academic  freedom  and

autonomy  in Nanyang University, Nanyang  University

shall   stand  unshaken,  Nanyang  University   shall

continue   to   safeguard  the  interests   of   true

education.  Nanyang University will not allow  itself

to  be swallowed up by the P.A.P. Nanyang University

will  never  allow itself to be made use of  for  the

P.A.P.'s party interest. All the persecution that Nanyang  University  has suffered at the  hands  of  the

P.A.P. must  receive  our  strongest  protest   and

condemnation. We shall go further into this matter in

my speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the intention of the Government to set up the Citizenship Consultative Committee is a measure by which the Government desire to further control the freedom of speech of the people, and the movements of the people in their daily lives. This is a measure of a feudalistic nature. The real purpose

is  not  to  strengthen the relationship between  the

people  and  the Government. On the other  hand,  the

real  purpose is to further exploit the  freedom  and

liberty of the people. This action of the P.A.P. has

been  exposed.  By  doing this, the  P.A.P. hope  to

control  the people through those so-called  Citizens

Consultative  Committees  by  using  them  as  their

lackeys to get intelligence information through them,

and  disseminate their propaganda through  them  too,

because they can be made use of to deal with  and  to

control  the people, and they will be making  use  of

some  nominal  heads  to manage these  committees  in

order  to  achieve their purpose of  doing  harm  to

others  in  order to benefit themselves.  So  if  the

people suffer as a consequence of their rights being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>



infringed,  then the P.A.P. oligarchy can turn  round

and put the blame on those nominal heads. You can see

the  nature of P.A.P. oligarchy. This is their  usual

tactic  - always  claim the merit for  themselves  and

blame  others. These Citizens Consultative Committees

will become the intelligence centre of the P.A.P. and

will be used as an instrument to further the P.A.P.'s

control  over the people, and as a tool  to  restrict

the  rights and freedom of the people. They will thus

be a very convenient piece of machinery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the speeches made by the Prime Minister and

the  Minister  for Education, we see that  they  have

smeared  the Chinese-educated and Chinese  education,

as  well  as  those who are patriotic and sincere  in

their  cause  for  national education.  We  can  well

understand  the intrigues of the P.A.P. in  smearing

patriotic educationists and Nanyang University.  They

try  to  sour  up  the  good  relations  between  the

Chinese,  Malays,  and  other racial  communities  in

order   to   create  misunderstanding   among   these

communities  against  us. So you  can  see  how  they

manage  to  sour  up the good relations  between  the

Malay and Chinese communities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has said that Nanyang

University  has  been  used to disseminate  Communist

doctrines,   and  the  Minister  for  Education   has

mentioned  Chinese chauvinism together with Communism

as  though the two words mean one and the same thing.

He  makes  use of Chinese education as the object  of

his attack, accusing it of being the cause of trouble

and  disharmony. The attack on the so-called  Chinese

chauvinism  and  the blame on the so-called  ignorant

people  have been made for obvious ulterior  motives.

If  the  P.A.P. oligarchy is like Don Quixote in  its

attitude,  then its propaganda will be more glaringly

exposed,  and  it will have to resort  to  more  mean

tactics with worse results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in Singapore we have a plural society of

Chinese, Indians, Malays, and others, and we  try  to

persuade all these different races to live peacefully

and harmoniously. We should also try to educate those

people  receiving education in the different language

media to live peacefully and harmoniously and to  co-operate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>



with and understand one another. How is the education

policy  of the P.A.P. going to achieve these objects?

How  is  it going to succeed in uniting the different

races? The P.A.P. have put Chinese education in a bad

light  before the racial communities, and in the  end

they think that Chinese education can be destroyed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This smear, the mean tactics and dirty propaganda

will   only   serve  as  a  warning  to  the   racial

communities,   and   it   will   only   lead   to   a

misunderstanding among the races and  cause  a  split

among   them.   Have  the  P.A.P. considered   this

possibility? I therefore say that this is a dangerous

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I have said just now is mainly directed at the Minister for Culture and the Prime Minister who have been accusing us of being anti-nationals and also smeared us with names. I say that the P.A.P. Government have not dealt properly with the question of confrontation and the sufferings

that  have  been brought to the people. On the  other

hand,  the P.A.P. Benchers have been trying to  evade

these questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the policy speech of the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara as a whole, we can divide it into four points.

On  the  first point, we see that the speech  praises

the  P.A.P.'s so-called achievements. It has  ignored

the  serious  and evil consequences  that  have  been

brought  about  by  Malaysia and  has  forgotten  the

people's sufferings. It also tries to shift the blame

for  the  sufferings of the people brought  about  by

Malaysia  and  confrontation on  to  others  and  the

Central Government. It also tries to explain away the

P.A.P.'s  inability to deal with the problem  of  the

livelihood and living standards of the people and for

their  betterment.  From this we  can  see  what  the

P.A.P. are like. The people of Singapore  can  never

forget  what  the P.A.P. have done to cause  them  to

suffer. The P.A.P. Government have been collaborating

with  British colonialists and the Central Government

to  confiscate the property of trade unions and  have

arrested   their  leaders  and  also   banned   their

organisations  and  increased  their  sufferings   to

further  their  own  ends.  The  P.A.P.'s  deceptions

cannot prevail forever.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They carried out a sham referendum on 1st September

last  year.  This  referendum, manipulated  by  them,

cannot  be  conclusive. Do not think the  people  are

fools.  The  people cannot tolerate this. The  P.A.P.

cannot  shirk  their responsibilities.  Malaysia  has

brought  a lot of suffering and difficulties  to  the

people.  The  P.A.P. are making use of the  bogey  of

Communism  to curb the reactions of the people.  They

are  thus  taking action against the Barisan Sosialis

and those who are with us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to talk now about building construction. Do

not think that by their propaganda on their so-called

construction  work  they can  fool  the  people.  The

P.A.P. are trying to put up a show when they say they

are carrying out construction work and other building

activities.  It  is  actually  a  facade.  It  is   a

deception  to  cover  up the difficulties  which  the

people are suffering. Are not these sufferings caused

by  Malaysia? The Government's speeches are the  same

as  those delivered previously. They are old speeches

in a new bottle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk of the livelihood of the people as it

existed  before  and the conditions prevailing  after

Malaysia.  Many  merchants  have  suffered  in  their

business.  Many  workers have lost their  jobs.  Many

industries have had to regulate the number of  shifts

for  their  workers as a result of  the  shortage  of

imported  materials. Some of them have been asked  to

work  only  for a few days in a week. Some  factories

have  had  to  close  down entirely.  The  industries

affected  include those engaged in a rattan and  sago

industries. We can see this situation clearly  if  we

go  along the sea front and the Harbour Board. We can

see    from   this   situation   the   result   which

confrontation  has  brought  about  consequent   upon

Malaysia. Much as I would like to enumerate all these

instances, I will not deal with them at length.  Many

factories  have  been  closed down  as  a  result  of

confrontation.  Some of them are  Loo  Ee  Toh,  Hock

Soon,  Yan Chuan, Chew Leong, Ho Kah Heng, etc.  They

are  too numerous to enumerate. Thus, as a result  of

confrontation  which Malaysia has caused,  people  in

all   walks   of   life   are  suffering.   This   is

unprecedented  in the history of Singapore.  Most  of

the workers,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>



especially   stevedores,  are   on   the   brink   of

starvation. Many workers were retrenched as a  result

of  the  closing down of their factories.  There  are

only  a few workers who are given partial work.  Just

look at the empty vessels in the harbour. Look at the

number of workers waiting along the quay queueing  up

for jobs. We can see from all this that the situation

is  going  from bad to worse. There are  about  8,000

workers directly affected by confrontation. They  are

now  unemployed. The total number of people who  have

lost their jobs as a result of confrontation may well

be   15,000.  These  are  workers  in  all  kinds  of

industries  and trades. Some workers have  only  been

offered  one  day's  work in  a  whole  week.  It  is

difficult for them to eke out a living like this  for

the  whole  month.  What about the workers  in  other

industries?  For instance, what about  those  in  the

shoe-making  industry? According to  the  Government,

only  8,000  workers  have  been  out  of  job.  This

statement   is   deceiving  the  people.   They   are

minimising the difficulties and hardships suffered by

the  people as a result of Malaysia. According to the

Minister,  there  are about 40.000 to  50,000  people

unemployed.  This is a very serious  social  problem.

Every year there are more and more school-leavers. On

top  of  this  problem,  Malaysia  has  brought  more

hardship and suffering to the people. They are living

like ants in a hot pot. What are the Government going

to  do  about  this?  This is a situation  which  the

Minister  for Labour has described as a  paradise  in

South-East  Asia. He says this kind of  living  is  a

paradise.  Perhaps we may not want to take his  words

seriously,  because such utterances  have  also  been

made by ex-colonialists. Even the Prime Minister  has

said that Singapore is a paradise in South-East Asia.

Perhaps  the Minister for Labour has avenues for  the

accumulation of wealth. He is riding in a big car ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member is being repetitious. The

something  else. I have made a ruling.  I  intend  to

stick by it. We can go on for hours if the Member  is

going to repeat the same argument. He has spent about

half  an  hour  on that point. I am not  prepared  to

was not spoken on it, it is repetitious. Please do not

proceed on that line.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, since

one  of our colleagues has already touched on  it,  I

will  skip it. But I should explain that we have  the

duty to condemn the incorrect utterances made by  the

Ministers because the Minister for Culture  has  even

dared to speak against our own people for the foreign

countries.  We know that in Brunei the oil  there  is

controlled  by the British and the people  there  are

suffering  in spite Brunei's rich natural  resources.

Yet  the  Ministers hope that our Parliamentarian  in

the  Central  Parliament would speak  to  defend  the

exploiters. What kind of representatives are you  who

dare to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>



make  speeches  in defence of foreign exploiters?  Is

the  Minister drawing $2,500 just to speak on  behalf

of the foreign powers? He has accused us, the Barisan

Sosialis,  of  receiving  $500  allowances.   I   ask

particularly  the Minister for Culture,  why  did  he

speak  for the foreigners and not for our own  people --- [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I was talking about

the  Minister  for  Labour. That is  why  I  find  it

necessary to rebut the utterances made by him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, on the question of Malaysia, the

P.A.P. Government have all along smeared us as  being

Communists,  and  because Indonesia  is  supposed  to

oppose Malaysia, so we must be opposing Malaysia. But

the  accusation will be exposed by the general masses

of the people. They have challenged us to declare our

stand.  Our stand is that of patriotism. We  are  for

the  interests  of all the people and  our  stand  on

Malaysia is based on this patriotism. Therefore,  the

Ministers'  propaganda would in the end be  met  with

bankruptcy. That is why, since they cannot succeed in

their  propaganda, they will have to change the  tune

of  their  speeches.  Their  lies  one  day  will  be

exposed.  The  Minister for Labour has  been  putting

forward his reasons which are absurd and childish. He

says  Indonesia is a sovereign country,  the  Barisan

Sosialis  is  a  political Party in  Singapore.  What

strength   have  we  to  influence  the   policy   of

Indonesia? The Minister for Labour is futile  in  his

attempts. His reasons are not worth our rebuttal. Let

us  hear  what he says about Indonesia  in  order  to

understand the trade severance between Singapore  and

Indonesia. He says the Indonesian people have nothing

to  eat. They have no clothes to put on and have been

eating  the bark of trees and rats. These are  common

occurrences, he says. In Indonesia, he also says, the

rupiah  is  not even worth a Japanese note.  He  also

talks  about  the  well-fed leaders  who  ignore  the

starvation  of their subjects. We know  the  Minister

has  been  attacking the Indonesian  people  and  the

policy of Indonesia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



This  is a gross interference in the internal affairs

of Indonesia which will lead to their hostility. This

is  an  insult  to the respect, the  dignity  of  the

Indonesian   people  which  will  lead   to   adverse

consequences - bad relationships between Indonesia and

Singapore. The people in Singapore have asked for the

restoration of trade relations between Indonesia  and

Singapore. We must not talk about their troubles.  We

must   negotiate  with  them  peacefully.   But   the

Minister's  attitude is not so. He  gloats  over  the

difficulties suffered by the Indonesian people.  This

will only make matters worse. This is not the way  to

bring  about  good  relations between  Indonesia  and

Singapore. The Prime Minister has said that  we  must

resume relations between Indonesia and Singapore, but

the Minister's speech will only result in a worsening

of relations. As the Government of Singapore, we have

the  right  to  urge the Central Government  to  open

negotiations with Indonesia, so the State  Government

has  the night to urge the Central Government. It  is

our   responsibility.  Therefore,  the  Minister  may

attack Indonesia but he must also consider the people

who are affected by the severance in trade. Factories

have to be reopened and the workers have to get jobs.

The  Government must seek ways and means  to  improve

the  situation.  It  is useless and  futile  for  the

Minister to carry on abusing our neighbour. This will

not help the matter very much.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the publications printed by the Ministry of

Culture,   the   P.A.P. have   admitted   that   the

confrontation  staged  by the  Indonesians  has  been

brought  about by Malaysia. Therefore, the Indonesian

confrontation  and  the severance  in  trade  between

Indonesia  and  Singapore have  been  caused  by  the

P.A.P.'s effort to bring about Malaysia. The Minister

for  Labour talks about the excess of population  and

other  reactionary theories. Now, what is his motive?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If you are capable,

let us have an open debate. Why should you repeat the

speeches  of  the  Prime  Minister?  Because  of  the

tension  brought about by Malaysia,  the  people  are

suffering a lot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



and  they  are  miserable.  The  merchants  have   no

business; the workers have no jobs and they  have  to

face  resistance from the people of Borneo. The Prime

Minister has told us that Malaysia has brought  peace

and  happiness to ten million people who will be able

to  lead  a happy, prosperous and peaceful life.  The

present  situation  is a slap  in  the  face  of  the

reactionary clique. So they are now trying  to  shift

the  responsibility for the present difficulties  and

hardship on to others as they are not able to account

for the present difficulties. Therefore, they have to

find  a  way  out  to  deceive the  people.  That  is

shirking their responsibility. They realize that they

have  collaborated with the British  imperialists  to

sponsor  Malaysia. The Prime Minister has  given  all

sorts  of  reasons, such as that Indonesia has  about

400,000 troops who are well armed, that Malaysia  has

very  few troops and that the population of Indonesia

is  bigger than that of Malaysia. Now on the  9th  of

December, the Minister for Labour repeated  the  same

argument.   Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  when   one   country

threatens   another  country,  the  size   of   their

respective populations need not be a deciding factor.



<br><br>00.01 a.m., 19-12-63



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Japan with a population of 90 million

people was able to conquer China with a population of

nearly 500 million people, and Britain with a smaller

population than India was able to conquer India. This

was because they pursued aggressive policies. Britain

was the oldest empire ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are not speaking of Britain

and Japan. The hon. Member needs only one example  to

make  his  point. I want to be fair to both sides  of

the  House. He has been on the Floor for  one  and  a

half  hours, and I think, in fairness to both  sides,

he  should  try to wind up his speech. We  have  been

here  from half-past two in the afternoon. I hope  he

will  try his best. I want to be fair to both  sides,

but  we  cannot go on forever, otherwise the standard

of debate in this House will deteriorate. I would ask

him to try to wind up his speech.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): All right, I will

not  touch on this any more. Let me touch on a graver

problem.  From the debate in the past three days,  it

seems  that  the  P.A.P. have tried  to  shift  their

responsibility and that they dare not face up to  the

stark reality. We will prove that they have done  bad

things    and    that   they   dare   not    shoulder

responsibility. I want to put forward these facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the P.A.P. came to power, what have they

done?  As far as I know, their first misdeed  was  to

deprive  Mr Tan Lark Sye of his citizenship  - a  man

who  has  contributed a lot towards the  building  of

Nanyang University. The leadership of the P.A.P. did

not   consider  the  adverse  consequences  of  their

ruthless measure in depriving him of his citizenship.

They think that because they were elected in the last

election, the people will support their misdeeds.  So

they  think  that  they can do what  they  like  now.

Victory  has  gone  to their heads.  They  have  been

arrogant.  During the last election, the  people  who

voted  for  them  did not return  them  to  power  to

deprive Mr Tan Lark Sye of his citizenship. If  they

persist  in  their barbaric misdeeds, I believe  that

those  who  supported  them  in  the  past  will  not

tolerate  them. They put the P.A.P. in power  because

they  want them to do good things and not bad things.

The  P.A.P. have disregarded the liberty  and  other

basic   human  rights  of  the  people.   They   have

collaborated with the Federation police to launch  an

attack  on  Nanyang University. Soon after  depriving

Mr  Tan  Lark Sye of his citizenship, the Federation

police  launched an attack against Nanyang University

and arrested the students, in addition, they banned 7

trade unions in Singapore. The general strike for two

days  in  protest against the Government  action  was

broken  up  by the Government by repressive measures.

In  fact,  this  general protest strike  was  brought

about  by  the  repressive actions of the  Government

which forced the workers to go on strike. The workers

had to take strike action in order to safeguard their

own interests and the existence of the organisations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member is talking about how this

strike  was  caused. Are we going to  have  all  this

again?  Six of his colleagues have spoken - they  have

all  spoken  on this strike - and if he goes  on  with

this subject we will go on forever.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The development of

my  argument will be quite different from  the  other

arguments.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I rule that the Member must not go on

to  the strike, so please accept my ruling. I do  not

care in what context he speaks. I have ruled that  he

is out of order in talking of this strike, because he

is  being repetitious. He has had the Floor for  more

than one and a half hours. If he is going to bring up

fresh  matters, I am prepared to hear him, but if  he

is going to talk of the strike of which we have heard

so much, I think it is a waste of time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): So it is

regrettable that when the reactionary Alliance in the

Federation  is making inroads into the liberties  and

freedom  of  the people of Singapore, the P.A.P. are

trying to ignore these facts. Instead, the P.A.P. are

assisting   the   Federation   Government   and   its

reactionary  Alliance to take action against  Nanyang

University,  against those who do not  endorse  their

policies.  These  actions  are  only  taken  in   the

interests  of  Devan Nair and his trade  union.  They

have  forgotten entirely their promises made  to  the

people of Singapore. They have promised the people of

Singapore that if the Federation interfere  with  the

fundamental  rights of the people of Singapore,  they

will  not  compromise with the Federation of  Malaya,

and  the Singapore Government will defend the  rights

of  the  people. This is what has been  said  by  the

Prime Minister. But when these things do happen, they

resort to the cheap propaganda that it is due to  the

trouble  created by the Communists that  the  Central

Government have to take certain actions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the P.A.P. have turned now to speak in defence

of the Federation action, instead of fighting for the

interests



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>



of  the people in Singapore as they have promised. To

put  everything in a nutshell, the P.A.P. are  trying

to  make  use  of their powers to ensure  that  their

political  position will be perpetuated.  The  P.A.P.

have  forgotten  the promise made to  the  people  to

fight  for  their fundamental rights.  They  are  now

acting  in  collaboration and in collusion  with  the

Federation  Government against the interests  of  the

people of Singapore. We must tell the leaders of  the

P.A.P. that in so doing they have been very foolish,

and  this has been too much on the part of the P.A.P.

to have done so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we do not deny that the P.A.P. have a

majority vote in this House, they cannot make use  of

this  majority to trample over the fundamental rights

of  the  people  in Singapore, and the P.A.P. should

never be allowed to make use of this majority in this

House to destroy parliamentary democracy. As we  have

already  said,  in  so  far as Singapore's  political

control is in the hands of the Federation reactionary

elements,  then the fundamental rights of the  people

of  Singapore will be destroyed and undermined. I lay

all  these facts before you to prove the truth of our

warning  that  we  gave quite a long  time  ago.  The

contempt  that  the  P.A.P. have  for  parliamentary

democracy and for the basic rights of the people  can

be  seen  clearly  in  recent developments  and  this

contempt will give rise to widespread dissatisfaction

among  the  people. There will come a  day  when  the

people will rise up to defend and fight for their own

rights.  In  the  struggle for  their  liberties  and

freedom and personal security, the workers, the under-graduates   and  other  people  have   been   branded

Communists.  This is the usual tactic which  deserves

no  repetition.  The people of Singapore  will  never

endorse  the policies of the P.A.P. Government  which

are detrimental to the people's interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to ask a question, that is, whether the

rights of the 60,000 workers in these two unions  can

be denied and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>



ignored.  Why should not a certain amount of  respect

be  given to the rights of the workers and why should

the rights of those arrested be denied?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nanyang University problem is again a knotty

question  that worries the Government. In failing  to

solve   this  problem,  they  have  taken  repressive

actions  against certain Nanyang undergraduates,  and

in  trying  to  destroy academic  freedom  they  have

arrested certain under-graduates. What is the ulterior

motive behind all these repressive actions? Have they

any  conscience  at all? We must point  out  that  if

parliamentary  democracy is  not  respected,  if  the

personal freedom and security of the people and human

rights  are  not respected, then it is  difficult  to

have peace and harmony in this country. The blame for

disharmony and possible unrest in this country should

be  placed  squarely  on those  responsible  for  the

repressive   actions   which   seek   to   break   up

parliamentary democracy. As the saying goes, there is

no  smoke without fire. If there is no action  coming

from  the  Federation against the  interests  of  the

people,  and if the P.A.P. have not failed to  defend

the  rights  of the people in the face of  Federation

interference, then there will not have been  so  much

trouble. So to ensure peace and harmony in Singapore,

the  people  of Singapore should be given  sufficient

democracy and freedom to exercise their rights. It is

only  when the people have certain democratic rights,

it  is  only when the democratic rights of the people

have  been given the minimum respect, that peace  and

harmony can ever exist in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is most improper to give democratic rights only

to  a minority group of people to enable them to boss

over  the  majority of the people. If  this  happens,

then  there  will not be any peace in Singapore.  The

P.A.P. do not appreciate the truth of this thesis and

pretend  not to know about it. In fact, they  try  to

put aside the indestructible truth of this thesis. It

is  our  duty to present the true facts to the P.A.P.

and to the people,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>



so  that all concerned will wake up one day to  take

part in the struggle to safeguard their basic rights.

It  is  only  when the people's rights are  respected

that there will be peace. Those who deliberately  try

to  distort  facts  and put aside the  truth  of  the

situation  should  be  exposed.  Their  true  colours

should  be shown up. They should be dealt with.  Then

they will have to bow to the will of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. are now undermining the rights of the

people.  The  Government  have  every  intention   to

destroy the progressive forces in Singapore in  order

to   consolidate  their  own  reactionary  forces  in

Singapore.   These  unreasonable   actions   of   the

Federation  Alliance can only be  frustrated  by  the

strong  will  of  the people. In order  to  safeguard

parliamentary democracy and the fundamental rights of

the people, we have to unite together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the 16th of September, 1963, the Federation of Malaysia was forced through as a result of collusion among the P.A.P., the Federation of Malaya, and the British. In this new Federation, although it appears that the British colonialists no longer hold the reins of government, in actual fact,

the  rights  and powers are still controlled  by  the

British through the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This again is mere repetition

that  the British are still in control. May I  remind

the  Member  for Paya Lebar that he has been  on  his

feet for nearly two hours? I am not prepared to allow

him  to  repeat himself. I must appeal  to  him  once

again  not  to  repeat himself. To  be  fair  to  the

others, I think he should wind up his speech is  soon

as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, what I

have  been saying has some connection with what  they

have  said and the arguments we have advanced in this

House during the course of the debate in the last few

days.  I  was  trying to make the point  whether  our

country,  after  Malaysia, is really  an  independent

sovereign country. In order to do so, I will have  to

enumerate the existing facts for the people to judge.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I agree with the Member that it is

relevant.  I  am not saying that it is irrelevant  to

the  subject. What I am saying is this. This  subject

has  been dragging on, from both sides of the  House.

It has been referred to time and again and I will not

allow the hon. Member to repeat it. That is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): So, superficially

the golden colonial era has passed into the annals of

history.  But  after the establishment  of  Malaysia,

British influence and the same social structure still

remain, although superficially the British are not in

the  ring.  In  fact, British military  and  economic

rights  still exist and they have not been disturbed.

Her influence still exists to a very great extent  in

this ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I rule the hon. Member out of order on

this subject about the British. I think he should  go

on   to   something  else.  Perhaps  there  is   this

difficulty of language between us. For that reason, I

have  allowed him to go on a little more, but I  must

put  a stop to this. I have ruled him three times out

of  order on the same point. I do not want to have to

rule him out of order again. I must ask him to get on

to something new.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, let me

conclude  briefly. I would like to  enumerate  a  few

facts  to show that actually there has been no change

at  all  after  Malaysia. Economically  speaking  the

British  colonialist position is  still  consolidated

and  they still maintain their bases through the  so-called   Anglo-Malaysian   Defence   Treaty.    Their

influence  and  power have not been  touched  in  the

least. Even the Australian and the New Zealand armies

are  making use of our land as their bases. They  are

driving their military trucks on our roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SEATO was not established to serve and maintain the

interest  of  the  people in this  region.  It  is  a

military  alliance of foreign countries. The  British

are   clever  in  manipulating.  Through  the  Anglo-Malaysian  Defence  Treaty,  the  British  can  still

maintain  their  interests in  South-East  Asia.  The

Malaysian Government are serving the British by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



this  treaty. The countries affected are still  in  a

state  of  submission, economically  and  militarily.

This  does not help to maintain peace in this region,

and  it  is not in our interest. Our stand  on  anti-colonialism  is  directed  at  getting  rid  of  this

position  of subjection to the military  might  of  a

foreign power, and securing true peace, happiness and

prosperity  for  the people in this  region.  I  have

already  said that actually there has been no  change

in  the  situation after Malaysia. Only the  economic

situation  will prove whether our country now  is  an

independent sovereign country. Britain has  still  an

economic hold on our rich resources, such as  rubber,

tin,  palm oil and other products and they are  still

in  control  of  communications,  trade,  import  and

export firms, banking and insurance which have always

been  monopolised  by the British  colonialists.  The

economic power structure is still in the hands of the

British colonialists. Although independence has  been

achieved, yet the economic situation has not  changed

at   all;  the  position  is  still  the  same.   The

plutocratic  economic exploitation has not  been  got

rid  of yet. The livelihood and living conditions  of

our  farmers  and  fishermen still remain  the  same.

There  has  been no improvement at all. The  Alliance

Central Government in encouraging foreign monopolists

and  capitalists  to come here and  compete  in  this

exploitation  are  still not  checked.  Although  the

investments  by  foreign capitalists and  monopolists

have  contributed to the superficial prosperity, this

is  detrimental  to an independent sovereign  country

because  it  will only make our country dependent  on

foreign economic support. Is this the kind of  policy

that  should  be pursued by an independent  sovereign

country?  Opposition  to colonialism  means  that  we

should get rid of foreign economic control over us so

that  we  can develop our economy freely and  achieve

our  own  independent industrial economic  policy  to

bring  about  a  better livelihood  for  the  people.

Industrialisation carried out by foreign  capitalists

and monopolists will do no good to us because it will

only mean their interference in our economic life. In

order to promote a healthy growth of our economy,  we

have to improve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>



our  economic  policy.  As an  independent  sovereign

country, there should be a manifestation of new  life

brought   about  by  a  new  policy  which   can   be

distinguished  from that used in the  colonial  past.

But  in  this  regard,  the  policy  of  the  present

Government  has nothing to boast about and  there  is

nothing  of  merit  in it. Although  we  have  a  new

Constitution which lays down and ensures  freedom  of

speech and publication in the Assembly, what actually

is  the  situation in our nation? The Government  are

making  use of the P.P.S.O. and other emergency  laws

which were passed by the colonial Government. On  the

one hand, the Constitution provides us with our basic

liberty and human rights; on the other hand,  it  has

taken  back  all these rights. This is not compatible

with  the  spirit of a new nation. All right-thinking

people  and political Parties must condemn and oppose

this P.P.S.O. Only those who talk about democracy but

who  in actual fact have benefited from this P.P.S.O.

will   not   oppose   the  P.P.S.O.   After   gaining

independence the past regime of darkness has come  to

an   end,  but  the  suppression  of  the  democratic

movement has again been enacted. Trade union  leaders

and students have been arrested ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member is being repetitious. Ten

sum  up  my  speech. Politically, there has  been  no

change.  Although  we  have  a  new  nation,  a   new

constitution, we have inherited things that were left

by the colonial government in the past, including the

laws. We wait to stress and reiterate our stand  when

we  opposed Malaysia in the past. Before Malaysia and

merger,  our Party pointed out that if Malaysia  were

to be pushed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>



through,  it  would bring suffering and disaster;  if

merger  and  Malaysia were to be forced  through,  it

would  only  bring hardship, because the concept  and

scheme  of  Malaysia  had been sponsored  by  British

imperialism.  Therefore, the P.A.P. have  helped  to

impose  Malaysia. What happens now? The  things  that

have  happened  are the result of the  imposition  of

Malaysia. Our prognosis has been correct, and  recent

happenings have proved this. The people have suffered

as a result of merger and Malaysia and confrontation.

I  fully  support the amendment tabled by the  Member

for Jurong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to dwell on aspects of public health wherein reference has been made to labour. It is customary in many parts of the world to attribute blame for many things on workers. It appears to me that we in Singapore are no exception, as that is the only inference that I can draw from

the  remarks  that inadequate methods of  supervision

resulting in indiscipline among public health workers

together   with  the  existence  of  secret   society

elements  in  their  midst  have  contributed  to  an

increase  in rubbish, so that they cause a menace  to

health  in Singapore. Being directly associated  with

the  workers  of  Singapore, I wish  to  emphatically

refute  such allegations. The blame for the state  of

affairs  in  public health, particularly relating  to

the  cleansing  of  the  city, cannot  be  attributed

either   to  the  indiscipline  of  labour   or   its

inefficiency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first touch on the remarks about secret

society  elements  in  the  midst  of  public  health

workers   in   Singapore.   Whatever   may   be   the

shortcomings of the pro-national labour in Singapore.

surely  the House will appreciate that we  differ  at

least  in this respect from the anti-national  unions

of  the  S.A.T.U. group who have never  hesitated  to

introduce  such  elements - I mean the secret  society

elements - to force



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>



workers into participating in anti-national political

strikes.  Anyone acquainted with workers in Singapore

will  recall  that the 1961 strike of these  workers,

unlike  the  many strikes in the S.A.T.U. group,  did

not  result in any free-for-all. Despite considerable

delay in the implementation of the terms of agreement

arising from this strike, public health workers  have

shown  considerable restraint over the last two years

even to the extent of agreeing to the setting up of a

Commission  of  Inquiry to settle unresolved  issues.

All  these can only speak well for the restraint  and

patience  shown by cleansing and other public  daily-rated  workers,  a situation hardly possible  had  it

been  true that secret society elements were  working

in their midst.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of the defects in this field of public

health,  particularly that relating to the  cleansing

of the city, must be squarely placed on the shoulders

of  the  Member  for Hong Lim who, during  his  short

reign  as Singapore's one and only Mayor, did lasting

damage  to  our  record as one of  the  cleanest  and

healthiest  cities of Asia - nay, the world.  With  his

advent,  orders for the purchase of new vehicles  for

the  cleansing  and  other public  health  work  were

cancelled; existing vehicles were deployed from other

purposes,  and even the incinerator was closed  down.

The  consequence was that refuse had to be dumped  in

open spaces, even in the frontage of the labour lines

and  housing  settlements,  and  this  is  still  the

situation  in  Singapore. Thus,  by  the  dumping  of

refuse,  delays  in removal caused  by  the  lack  of

necessary  equipment and a host of many other  things

have contributed to this vicious cycle of disease  - I

mean refuse, flies and diseases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I say that the position is even worse today.

About 29,000 houses have been built since 1959,  many

miles  of  new  drains  and  roads  constructed,  new

schools  built for the increasing number  of  school-going  children,  large numbers of people,  including

room   dwellers  moving  into  separate  houses   and

establishing  separate  households  and   a   general

expansion of social services in Singapore since 1959.

It  is  all well known to the Members of this  House,

both the Opposition and the Government. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>



consequence of all this is that the amount of  refuse

has  increased,  and  all this  calls  for  a  larger

cleansing labour force and more and better equipment.

What do we really have in their place? We have merely

an  additional  200 workers over and above  the  1958

labour  force. We have vehicles, thanks to the Member

for  Hong Lim, which operate 12 to 14 hours  per  day

over considerable distances with frequent breakdowns,

dust-bins despite the considerable public money spent

by  the then City Council are no longer adequate  but

usable.  In some places dust-bins with their  bottoms

about to fall off are issued to cleansing workers for

their work. Despite these handicaps and difficulties,

I  must say the workers of the cleansing section  are

doing a magnificent job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I regret that no recognition has been paid to

these   workers  for  their  services   under   these

handicaps. I, therefore, ask this House to judge  the

remarks  regarding  labour's  contribution   to   the

uncleanliness of the city in the light of what I have

said. What the situation really calls for is to  find

ways  and means of improving the cleanliness  of  the

city,  and  I  say the answer lies not  in  assigning

blame  to the workers, but in the provision  of  more

vehicles  for the transportation of refuse, a  larger

work   force,   and  a  trained  set   of   frontline

supervisors,  not  those who will  brow-beat  workers

without  regard to the difficult circumstances  under

which  they are required to work. Nobody has  thought

fit  to  look into the methods nor the efficiency  of

those in charge of public health in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent Commission of Inquiry into the Public

Daily-Rated  Employees reveals a  shocking  state  of

affairs. The cross-examination of the Health Ministry

by  a  genuine trade unionist, Mr C. V. Devan  Nair,

showed  up  a  set of anti-labour officials  in  that

Ministry  who  showed a greater  knowledge  of  anti-labour  theories  than that of  the  requirements  of

public  health.  I hope that before  making  sweeping

remarks about workers, the authorities concerned will

take  the trouble to study the shortcomings of  those

who  are  supposed to be in charge of public  health.

There are more flies, mosquitoes and rubbish today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>



Only  the  workers are responsible? That is  rubbish!

Only the officials in the Ministry of Health who have

mismanaged  public  health and systematically  misled

their  Ministers will dare say so. I  appeal  to  the

Government to take a fair and objective view  of  the

situation in public. The workers may not be  entirely

innocent  of the responsibility, but the major  guilt

lies   elsewhere.  It  lies  with  those   who   have

systematically mismanaged public health. It lies with

the rat-racing, responsibility-dodging, union hating,

and  blame-throwing bunch of inefficient buffoons who

staff  the Ministry of Health. The Public Daily-Rated

Employees  Federation,  which represents  the  Public

Daily-Rated Employees in Singapore, have assured  the

National  Trades Union Congress that they  will  give

their full co-operation in improving public health in

Singapore, but co-operation is not a one-way traffic.

It  is  a  two-way  traffic.  There  must  be  mutual

accommodation  between  workers  and  officials   and

mutual  efforts  towards improving public  health  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I warn the Barisan Sosialis in this House that

our criticism of the Government is not an act of anti-national  and  Soekarno-loving inclination?  This  is

democracy  at work, and it is the only way to  ensure

that democracy does work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in his speech the Head of State has also stressed the importance of the Industrial Arbitration Court in bringing about stable industrial relations in Singapore. We in the N.T.U.C. fully endorse this hope of the Government. But it is necessary to point out that the Government's hopes

and our hopes about industrial relations in Singapore

may  be  defeated if shortcomings in  the  Industrial

Relations  Ordinance  are not removed.  For  example,

section  77  of the Ordinance provides penalties  for

employers  who  dismiss  or  victimise  employees  by

reason  of  the  circumstance that  they  join  trade

unions.  But so far, these penalties have never  been

enforced.  Why  have they never been  enforced?  When

trade  unions  break  the law,  they  are  hauled  up

quickly enough. Why is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>



the  law  not  quick enough to punish  employers  who

offend against the law? In the last one year about 15

employers have violated section 77 of the I.R.O.  All

the  facts  have  been given to the  State  Advocate-General.  But to date not a single employer has  been

prosecuted Trade unions are, therefore, justified  in

expressing   dissatisfaction  with  this   state   of

affairs.  What is the use of the law  if  it  is  not

enforced?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis will say that the law is not

enforced against employers because the Government  is

pro-employer. That is rubbish. No worker in Singapore

will  believe  that the Government  is  pro-employer.

What  then  has  gone wrong? It is simply  this:  the

machinery  for the enforcement of the law has  proved

to  be  grossly  inadequate. An  employer  sacks  his

employees because they have joined a trade union. The

union,  under the present regulations, must  complain

to  the police. The police then send their reports to

an  over-worked S.A.G. The over-worked S.A.G. has  no

time to deal with these reports because he is deluged

with  other  responsibilities. Now,  why  should  the

police  have anything to do with industrial offences?

Industrial offences are not criminal offences.  Would

it  not  be better for a legal officer to be attached

to  the Ministry of Labour, whose sole responsibility

would  be  to  take  charge  of  the  prosecution  of

industrial   offences?   Speed   is   essential   for

industrial  justice.  You cannot  be  slow  in  these

matters  without  disillusioning  workers  about  the

rights  conferred on them under the  law.  I  suggest

that  if  the  Government really  want  to  establish

industrial justice, then the machinery for  enforcing

the law must be thoroughly overhauled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give a recent example of how an employer

deliberately  violated section 77 of the  I.R.O. and

got away with it. The management of the American firm

of Grant Advertising Incorporated dismissed all seven

members  of  the  Branch Committee soon  after  their

employees joined a trade union. Complaints have  been

made,  but  to  date  nothing has happened,  and  the

workers  have  become demoralised. If  employers  are

allowed to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>



get   away   with   this  kind  of   business,   then

constructive trade unionism becomes impossible. We in

the  National Trades Union Congress must insist  that

the   law   be  enforced  against  Grant  Advertising

Incorporated,   and   that  proceedings   should   be

immediately  instituted  against  the  employers   in

accordance with section 77 of the I.R.O.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the contentions of the trade unions

will  not fall on deaf ears and that the new Minister

for  Labour will take immediate steps to improve  the

machinery for the enforcement of the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Prime Minister's motion.

<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Inche A. Rahim Ishak)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, ever since the debate on the speech  of

the Yang di-Pertuan Negara started and throughout the

Budget  debate last week, we have had the opportunity

of listening to an exposition of the Communist cause,

not  from  misguided pro-Communists of the  Lee  Siew

Choh  or  the  Sheng  Nam Ching  variety;  they  have

vanished from the scene, washed away by the  tide  of

history, but from a group of Communist front  workers

who are better trained, more well versed in Communism

and  more  committed  to  the Communist  struggle  of

setting  up  the  dictatorship of the proletariat  in

this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt it was clear that every one of them in the

Barisan  Sosialis was parroting the old tune  we  had

heard   enough   of   before  the   elections.   Neo-colonialism,  phoney  merger,  sell-out  merger,  and

others.  There was nothing new for them  to  deliver,

simply  because  the underground Communist  Party  of

Malaya  has  nothing  new  to  offer  and  obediently

follows the tune set by the Partai Komunis Indonesia.

But the strategy now that Malaysia is a fact seems to

be  to  undermine  the faith in and  loyalty  of  the

people  towards  Malaysia. They have said  everything

possible to do this, short of openly declaring, like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>



the Indonesian leaders have done, that "Malaysia will

be  crushed".  In  their attempts  to  undermine  and

spread  disloyalty and disaffection towards Malaysia,

they   are  in  actual  fact  acting  as  the   fifth

columnists  and  agents  of  the  Indonesians.   This

blatant  act of treachery and betrayal of the  nation

is  being  perpetrated at a time when the Indonesians

are   carrying  out  their  policy  of  confrontation

against Singapore and Malaysia. While the Indonesians

are busy committing military action, economic boycott

and  generally  harassing  our  nation,  these  fifth

columnists  are  busy  helping the  Indonesians  from

within.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, last week when they were confronted with the question posed to them by the Minister for Culture as to whether they wanted Indonesian confrontation to fail or to succeed, they had no reply to offer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis did not expect that they would

be  cornered  and  exposed so soon after  the  debate

started.  The Member for Thomson made feeble attempts

to  evade  the  question by saying that  the  Barisan

wanted  a  peaceful settlement between  Malaysia  and

Indonesia. The truth of the matter is that  they  are

unable  to  give a clear-cut answer to that  question

without making a stand of their intentions. They  are

faced  with a situation where they want to carry  on

with the Communist struggle against Malaysia and,  at

the same time, they do not want to be identified with

the  Indonesians.  They have found  themselves  in  a

position  where  they  are  doing  exactly  what  the

Indonesians are doing. The Communists want  to  avoid

being   identified  publicly  with  the  Indonesians,

although privately they know they have decided to  be

loyal  to  the  P.K.I. line  and  accept  Indonesian

leadership  in  South-East  Asia.  They  cannot, of

course, publicly declare their loyalty to Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to remove this image of being the pawns of

the  Indonesians and the P.K.I. and  to  mislead  the

people  here that they are not working for a  foreign

power, they have, in the last



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>



one  week, gone out of their way to espouse the cause

of  the Chinese, Chinese education, Chinese language,

Chinese  patriots in China. They do all this to  show

that while they fully agree with what the Indonesians

are  doing  against  us, they are  still  Chinese  at

heart. Sir, in other words, they want to run with the

hare and hunt with the hounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their clumsy tactics, Sir, they have overlooked

the  important fact, i.e. the national language takes

precedence over all the other languages, and that  if

they  want  Chinese to be used in the administration,

then  they should also put up the case for  Malay  as

the  national language. Mr Speaker, apart from their

missing  leader in this House, the rest of them  here

are  very Chinese in their outlook. They may be loyal

followers of D. N. Aidit, they may know the  theories

of  Marx and Stalin, but I feel they know very little

about the Malays and the thinking of the Malays. They

are  out  of touch with the hopes and aspirations  of

the  Malays. Have they ever wondered why  the  Malays

who   are  economically  the  poorest  community   in

Malaysia  do not rally round the Communist  Party  or

any  Communist  front  Party in accordance  with  the

Marxist  theory  that  the  Communist  Party  is  the

vanguard  of the proletariat and peasantry?  Do  they

understand the political problems faced by the people

of  Malaysia?  Do they understand why  all  races  in

Malaysia reject Communism?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One matter, Mr Speaker, Sir, which I wish to clear

is  the  charge made by the Members in the Opposition

that  we deliberately raised the Communist bogey just

to gain political advantage. Truly, Mr Speaker, this

is  a matter that I wish to dwell at some length  in

my  speech. When the Barisan Sosialis say that we are

bringing  up  the Communist bogey, they mean  to  say

that  there  is  no  such  thing  as  Communists   in

political  Parties or non-political Parties  in  this

country  They  mean that we are purposely  trying  to

frighten  the  people with stories of spooks,  ghosts

and bogeys.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, Mr Speaker, Sir, a little while ago, the

Member  for  Paya  Lebar himself has  said  that  the

Minister  for  Culture has charged  them  with  being

Communists. Mr Speaker, Sir, only fools will believe

that the Communists do not exist in our society. Only

the  naive  will think that the Communist threat  has

been eliminated. Only the politically uninitiated can

be  bamboozled by the Communists into believing  that

they,  the  Communists, are democrats who  intend  to

work  the  parliamentary democratic system to  better

our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Emergency which lasted for twelve years, beginning from 1948 and which ended in 1960, is still fresh in our minds. The period from August 1945, when the war ended, to June 1948 is also fresh in our minds. The people of this country remember this period very vividly for the Hammer and

Sickle emblems in the Red flags which fluttered  over

the  Communist Party of Malaya Headquarters in  Queen

Street  in Singapore and Foch Avenue in Kuala Lumpur,

and  over  all  its  branches throughout  Malaya.  We

remember the Communist-front organisations called the

New  Democratic Youth League, the Women's  Democratic

Federation,    and   the   M.P.A.J.A.    Ex-Comrades'

Association.  As a matter of fact, we still  remember

many  names  and many faces who proudly  saluted  the

Communist flag with their fists clenched before their

crowns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the armed insurrection started by the Communist Party of Malaya is over. The Communists decided to call it off after continuing with their atrocities against the people three years after Malaya achieved independence and became an independent and sovereign member of the United

Nations.  The Communist Party of Malaya was  declared

an  illegal organisation since the Emergency started.

The  other  Communist-front organisation I  mentioned

which flourished from 1945 to 1948 also vanished from

the political scene. But what happened to the leaders

of the Malayan Communist Party and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



all these organisations? Have they all been killed or

have  they  all committed suicide in the  jungles  of

Malaya?  Have they renounced their Communist ideology

of  revolution  and  violence? Or  have  they  become

democrats?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Communists and non-Communists know that the answer to all these questions is no. The aim of the Communists and Communist Parties the world over is the establishment of proletarian dictatorships where the Communist Party rules under a one-party system in which the democratic

institutions,  as we understand them, are  abolished

forever.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Communist Party of Malaya does not function

in  the  open. On the contrary, it functions  in  the

open  as  legally constituted organisations, be  they

political, social, cultural or literary in character,

by   infiltration   of   these  legally   constituted

organisations.   The  Communist   Party   of   Malaya

functions   in   our  society  today  as   open-front

organisations  within  the  democratic  system  which

permits their existence. In fact, Sir, they are  free

to   flourish   under  the  democratic  system.   The

Communist Party of Malaya, like Communist Parties all

over  the  world, has its open-front as well  as  its

united   front   organisations,   which   they   have

organised. Lenin taught them this. Stalin too  taught

this. So also did Mao Tse-tung. They taught them  how

to  carry  on  with  the united front  organisations.

Aidit also believes in this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in their united front strategy, they invariably try to control the united front with non-Communists for their Communist ends, whether it be in the Old Boys' Association, trade unions, Students' Unions or political Parties. They still control these organisations. Mr David Marshall

recently  found it to his cost. He has accepted  this

fact.  The  coup  in  Czechoslovakia  in  1948,  when

President  Benes was betrayed, bears  this  out.  Two

years ago, the Communists in this country carried out

these same tactics in the struggle of the people. But

they  failed.  This is one example  where  they  have

failed and it has boomeranged against them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, it is sheer hypocrisy for

pro-Communists  and Communists to  say  that  we  are

raising  the  Communist bogey when we try  to  expose

them  and their deceptive tactics. They are no ghosts

nor  spooks. These Communists are live men and  women

with  eyes,  ears  and noses like  you  and  me,  Mr

Speaker. They are full-blooded Communists in  sheep's

clothing.  Naturally they do not go about advertising

that they are Communists or Marxists. As a matter  of

fact,  a Communist whose name the Prime Minister  has

referred  to  in his book The Battle for Merger  once

told  me  that  under the present circumstances,  the

more  reactionary  a  Communist appears  to  be,  the

better  for the cause of Communism. The Communist  is

still at large outside prison gates today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Minister for Education a few days ago

exposed  Communist  subversion in  Chinese  Secondary

schools   and  in  Nanyang  University,  the  Barisan

Sosialis Members loudly protested that he raised  the

Communist bogey. Let me ask them whether students who

distribute   Freedom   News   and   other   Communist

literature are bogeys? Are under-graduates at Nanyang

University,  who  write under  the  auspices  of  the

Geographical Society, bogeys?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Messrs. S. Wood-hull, Albert Lim Shee Ping and Puthucheary, were they ghosts when they were taken in in February? Neither was Lim Ching Siong a ghost. Nor is Chin Peng, the man who met the Tunku at Baling in 1955, a bogey. They are live Communists. So let not the Barisan men say again that

we  raise the Communist bogey when we expose them for

being  what  they  are. Mr Speaker, actually,  since

this  session started 10 days ago, we have been  able

to  identify these young and inexperienced  Communist

debaters  with  the  greatest of  ease;  whereas  old

timers  like S. T. Bani. Chan Sun Wing and Wong  Soon

Fong  in those days were very careful to avoid  using

terms  and  cliches which Communists are  trained  to

use. The present crowd of Barisan men have been using

with gay abandon terms like "national



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



bourgeoisie",     "progressive    forces"     "feudal

reactionary government", "revisionists", "reactionary

clique", "inevitable collapse of capitalism",  "anti-

people", "foreign monopoly capitalists", etc. I  have

even  heard  one  of  them refer  to  the  P.A.P. as

"revisionists".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, last week in the debate in this

House,  one  of the Barisan Opposition  Members  said

that  the Barisan Sosialis comprise patriots. He said

that  Tan Kah Kee was also a patriot. If Tan Kah  Kee

was a patriot, he was a Chinese patriot in China or a

Communist  patriot  in  China  and  not  a  Malaysian

patriot. This is another reason why he went  back  to

his  country  of origin. This is another instance  of

the  dangerous line they are taking to show that they

are not the stooges of the P.K.I.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday the Member for Thomson tried to show

that the P.A.P. have not done anything for the Malays

in  the  field  of education. Actually  he  has  been

repeatedly  saying  that the  P.A.P. have  not  done

anything  at all for education for all the  races.  I

marvel  at his ability to ignore the facts  when  the

facts  stare  at him in the face, and  known  to  the

people.  56 new schools, 464,000 children in schools,

35 integrated schools, more than 5,000 adults who are

mainly  teachers  with  certificates  in  the   Malay

language,  two Malay secondary schools and 126  Malay

secondary classes, 10-year education for every  child

in  Singapore  - with all these, he  says  the  P.A.P.

Government have not done anything. What sort of human

beings  are they who ignore these facts? Mr Speaker,

Sir, we can ignore these unimportant things, but when

people  deliberately choose not to see  concrete  and

rapid  progress over 4� years, the like of  which  is

unheard  of  anywhere in South-East Asia, then  there

must be something wrong with such people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week the Member for Thomson asked why the

number  of scholarships for Malays in the Polytechnic

and the University of Singapore has decreased.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



I  replied  that  it  was not  that  the  number  had

decreased, but that it had increased. I said that the

number  of  Malay students were not  enough  to  take

advantage of these scholarships. However, one  matter

which  I  would like to ask is this: since when  have

the  Barisan  Sosialis shown interest in the  welfare

and  education of the Malays? The truth of the matter

is  that because of the lunacy of the Communist Party

of  Malaya in their armed revolt, the hatred  of  the

Malays  towards  the  Communist Party  and  Communism

could not be greater. Actually even today, Malays and

other  Malaysians are ready and prepared to  take  up

arms  to  crush the Communists if they dare to  start

another armed rebellion in Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, while Malaysia is being threatened externally, we are still allowing fifth columnists and traitors to attack us from inside. What is the Barisan Sosialis stand in this situation? What should be done to disloyal people like those in the Barisan

Sosialis? Such as those people who are in front of us

here?  A  week  has  passed since  the  Minister  for

Culture challenged them to state whether they  wanted

confrontation to succeed or fail. They have still not

yet given a categorical answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the amendment by the Barisan Sosialis, among others, says that as a result of Malaysia, the Government have caused great difficulties and hardships to the people in Singapore. We all know that confrontation was started by the Indonesians. Therefore, how is it that the Barisan Sosialis now

say  that the Government have caused hardship to  the

people?  The people voted for merger and Malaysia  in

the referendum and again in the elections. The United

Nations investigation team reported that the majority

of  the  people of Sabah and Sarawak wanted  to  join

Malaysia.  Then  what  logic is  it  that  makes  the

Barisan Sosialis say that the Government have  helped

to  impose  Malaysia? It is the people of  Singapore,

Sabah  and Sarawak who wanted to join Malaysia.  That

is the crux of the matter, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To end, before long these political opportunists

who  are  prepared  to be the stool  pigeons  of  the

P.K.I. will be exposed for what they are worth. Their

loyalty is not to the people of this country, but  to

a  foreign country, a country they have called  their

heartland.  If  so, then they have no  place  in  our

society.  They should go and live there forever  like

Mr Tan Kah Kee.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I wish to say a few words  briefly

in  this  Chamber. I wish to ask the Barisan Sosialis

Members in this Chamber whether they oppose Malaysia.

Malaysia has been established with the wishes of  the

people. Because the people were not deceived  by  the

Barisan  Sosialis  or  the  Communist  front  in  the

referendum and in the recent general elections, it is

clear  proof  that the people have no  faith  in  the

Barisan  Sosialis. We see clearly how  many  of  them

have been elected by the people in this Chamber.  The

Barisan   Sosialis  are  not  yet  aware  that   they

represent  the  minority  of  the  people   in   this

Assembly. I wish to inform the Barisan Sosialis  that

if  they consider this country as hell to them,  they

are  free to go to any other country of their  choice

- Peking or Indonesia. I wish to ask them, if they are

anti-Malaysia and do not support Malaysia, why should

they  live in Malaysia? If they consider this country

is  hell,  they should leave it and go to  any  other

country which they consider a paradise to live in.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): They are

indulging in anti-national activities and they openly

support  the  armed rebellion in Borneo  and  Brunei.

They  are  opposed to national registration and  they

want  to  overthrow the Central Government. They  are

the   representatives   of  the   anti-national   and

Communist united front. They are not prepared  to  be

loyal  to  Malaysia, in spite of the fact  that  they

have sworn allegiance to Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malayan Communists have not abandoned their

attempt  to  set  up  a Communist  Malaya  since  the

Emergency.  If  they  cannot  put  their  plan   into

practice,  then they want to split Malaysia  into  so

many  parts  in  order  that they  can  absorb  these

territories one by one. Their underground  activities

are  still continuing and they have effective control

over  some organisations which openly carry  out  the

instructions of the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two years, according to the documents

revealed  in the Report of the Commission of  Inquiry

into  the Students' Boycott, the Freedom News  stated

that the political situation in Singapore had all the

necessary  conditions  for  launching  a  new   anti-colonial struggle to a new peak and that all the open

front organisations and leaders should be educated in

order  to enhance the political consciousness of  the

people  and to strengthen their anti-colonial fervour

to end colonialism in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>



It  also  pointed out that in order to  achieve  real

independence,  they must, first of all,  get  rid  of

British imperialism which it was impossible to do  by

peaceful  negotiation, and they must be  prepared  to

continue  with  their  national revolution.  It  also

called  upon  the  open front organisers  to  be  the

vanguard of the students, peasants and workers in the

struggle,  to concentrate their efforts  to  organise

themselves, to receive and welcome their  mission  in

the  struggle.  From  this policy  statement  of  the

Malayan  Communists, you can see that the open  front

organisations had been carrying out their  activities

according   to  the  instructions  of   the   Malayan

Communists. They have concentrated their  efforts  in

the  Chinese  Teachers' School Union and the  Nanyang

University    Students'    Union.    Through    these

organisations, they have staged examination  boycotts

and  the  "liquidation" campaign in  the  University.

They  have also concentrated their efforts  in  trade

unions  - especially the S.A.T.U. - in rural areas,  in

the  Country People's Association and Rural Dwellers'

Association  and the Barisan Sosialis is  their  main

organ in the political field. Although they have been

defeated by a force led by the P.A.P., but in view of

the  establishment  of Malaysia, they  will  be  more

daring in carrying out their anti-national struggle.

The  speeches made by the Barisan Assemblymen in this

House  reflect  their anti-national activities.  They

have  said  that  we have been using the  two  words,

"anti-nationalists" and "Communists', on them.  Their

speeches  on  the amendment only reflect their  anti-national stand and go to prove that they are  on  the

side of the Communists. The Barisan Members and their

united  front  members are all in the same  Communist

united front.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote from some statements on the

investigation of the Commission of Inquiry  into  the

Students' Boycott which has exposed the activities of

the  students  concerned. The Communists  think  that

they can control Nanyang University. They make use of

Nanyang University as a training ground for Communist

cadres  to  carry out their anti-national activities.

During University Week they carried out anti-national

activities.  On the 1st of December this year,  there

was a so-called academic forum, but in actual fact it

was  a  political  forum  to carry  out  their  anti-national activities. The speeches of the Barisan  are

the same in content, in that they accused the British

imperialists  of  having brought about  Malaysia  and

suppressing the people. In their speeches, they  also

defended   Indonesia,  saying  that  the   Indonesian

confrontation  was  justified as  a  means  of  self-defence.  They  put the blame for  the  formation  of

Malaysia  and  confrontation on the British  and  the

Alliance,  and  they  also  condemned  the   national

service  registration as a means of  suppressing  the

revolution in the Borneo territories. Therefore, they

started   the   anti-national  service   registration

struggle   in   order   to  overthrow   the   Central

Government, to drive out the British imperialists and

to  establish an independent country without  foreign

troops,    foreign   exploitation   and   reactionary

influence,  so  that the people can  have  their  own

freedom  to  live  happily in  Utopia.  But  if  this

objective  of  theirs cannot be realised,  then  they

propose  that the four territories of Sabah, Sarawak,

Singapore  and Malaya should be independent countries

by themselves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;University Week was made use of to further the

Communist anti-national activities and to promote the

so-called University autonomy and freedom of academic

exercise. The Nanyang University Students' Union made

use   of   University  Week  for   the   purpose   of

disseminating  Communist propaganda to further  their

anti-national activities and to recruit new Communist

cadres  to  train students as future  camp  comrades.

They  allowed the students to stay in the  University

campus  for  several  weeks  under  the  pretext   of

preparing  for University Week. In actual  fact,  the

activities  carried out in the University campus  had

nothing  to  do with University Week to  be  held  in

March.  During their stay-in, they exhibited articles

and  pictures from Communist countries,  praised  the

Red Army, issued anti-national pamphlets, and carried

out  all  sorts  of  anti-Government  and  anti-State

propaganda  and  other subversive  activities.  Their

main  purpose in the campus was for this.  They  said

that one of the objectives of University Week was  to

welcome new students - the freshies - to get settled in

the University and to know one another. By this means

they  intend  to recruit new cadres. After  training,

these  new  cadres will become their new blood.  This

has been an open secret.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of whether the standard of Nanyang

University  should be raised, the Barisan Assemblymen

have  all claimed that because the standard has  been

raised, therefore, the lessons are tough. They do not

want the standard of Nanyang University to be raised,

because  if  it is to be done, the students  have  to

spend  more  time on their studies than on  Communist

activities.  If  this  is to be  achieved,  then  the

professors  and  lecturers would be very  strict  and

have  to  spend more time on their lectures, and  the

students  would have no facilities to carry on  their

non-academic activities. The students who  belong  to

the united front, in the event of the standard of the

University being raised, will not be able to carry on

with their activities, as the curriculum will be very

heavy. On the other hand, their examinations will  be

quite  stiff, if a high standard is to be maintained.

That again



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>



will be another cover by which the activities of  the

students  and undergraduates can be restricted.  That

is  why  they do not want to have a high standard  in

the   University  of  Nantah.  Some  of  the  Nanyang

undergraduates  make use of the  typewriters  in  the

University  for the purpose of typing  out  Communist

literature.  They  supply material typed  on  Nanyang

University  typewriters. These typists  were  closely

associated with the Communist activists during  their

school  days.  So there are available  facilities  in

Nanyang  University  for the fostering  of  Communist

activities.  The Communist united front  workers  are

very  active  in Nanyang University. So there  is  no

chance  of  anybody  wishing to  raise  the  academic

standard of Nanyang University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The academic standard of Nanyang University is

really deplorable. The University authorities desired

to  arrange the position of the students according to

their  examination  results,  but  the  united  front

workers   opposed   this  move  by   the   University

authorities,  because they did not want  their  front

workers  to  be placed at the end of the list.  As  a

result  of  certain pressure exerted  by  the  united

front workers, the Nanyang University authorities had

to give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are facts which I mention to show that the

Nanyang University students are under the control  of

the  united front Communists. They are trying to make

use  of  academic  freedom to carry out  their  anti-national  activities.  They are  closely  related  to

other  united  front  organisations  of  a  Communist

nature.  They  even go to the extent of misusing  the

students'  union funds to finance their  non-academic

activities  up to the amount of $5,000. The  question

by  the  Barisan Members has been raised in order  to

defend  the activities of their friends in the united

front in Nanyang University. It is our duty to expose

their  ulterior motive. The question of  whether  the

standard  of  Nanyang  University  should  be  raised

should be judged by the experts.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Barisan Members on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>



the Opposition benches have been making a hue and cry

over  Malaysia  and confrontation for  the  past  few

days.  They deliberately seem to ignore Malaysia  and

give prominence to the Indonesian confrontation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their proposed amendment to the Prime Minister's

motion  to  express  thanks to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's  policy  speech is ill-conceived  and  evil-minded.  I  wish to deal with a few points raised  by

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, they deplore the existence of

Malaysia,  and try to show to the outer  world,  more

fittingly  to  their  Indonesian  counterparts,  that

there exists dissension among the people of Singapore

with   regard   to  Malaysia,  and  this   bunch   of

disillusioned politicians are their leaders.  If  the

cap fits them, let them wear it. Has the inception of

Malaysia caused any difficulty in the normal  way  of

living  of the people of Singapore? In fact,  it  has

opened  a vast stretch of land from Malaya to  Sabah,

Sarawak  and  North  Borneo for the  benefit  of  the

people  of  Singapore.  Then why  are  these  Barisan

Assemblymen trying to distort the facts?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia is not a dream land. Malaysia is in

existence,   as  real  as  the  Barisan   themselves.

Malaysia  is  a political and economic entity  of  10

million  people  of  Singapore, Malaya,  Sarawak  and

North Borneo. It is universally accepted. There could

be nothing more serious than to undermine this fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia is not an armed gang-up against any

country  - not  in the least against the  Indonesians.

Then why this confrontation by the Indonesians?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Soekarno has repeatedly stated over Radio

Jakarta that he will crush Malaysia. In other  words,

the  confrontation  will  go  on  until  Malaysia  is

crushed. Do the Barisan seriously advise us  to  give

up Malaysia?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Indonesians confront Malaysia, it is their

business.  But to defend Malaysia from  any  external

threat  or attack is the duty of all true Malaysians.

But  what are the Barisan trying to do? They want  to

subvert Malaysia in favour of Indonesia. They are not

interested



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>



in  the  country in which they live. In actual  fact,

they  follow  the Indonesians. They admire  Indonesia

where  there  is no Parliament, no rule  of  law,  no

democracy, but guided democracy being steered at  the

whims  and fancies of Dr Soekarno. There is no civil

government  but  Army generals at  the  helm  of  the

nation's administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps all these impress them more than the

peaceful and democratic way of life of the people  of

Malaysia. Perhaps Dr Soekarno is being considered by

them  as  a big brother and liberator of the  Barisan

masses  who  are  suffering in Malaysia  due  to  the

undemocratic imposition of Malaysia on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what the first part of their amendment

indicates. They say in their amendment ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"; but this Assembly regrets that the Government in

helping  to impose Malaysia on the people has  caused

great   difficulties  and  hardships   to   them   in

Singapore ---".



<br><br>Truly  none  other than the Barisan are  discontented

with Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we Malaysians consider the Indonesians as good

friends  and  big brothers too. But the confrontation

is  something  the reality of which we cannot  escape

from. Sarawak and North Borneo are part and parcel of

Malaysia, although they are far apart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Indonesian confrontation, Sir, it

seems that the Indonesians are very familiar with the

word "confrontation".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately after the Second World War the

Indonesians  confronted  the Dutch  colonial  masters

with  an  army trained by the Japanese, because  they

found a die-hard colonialism in the imperialist Dutch

who did not give in to their demand for independence.

Well, that is all to their credit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following their independence in 1949, there was

rebellion in the Celebes Island. There was  a  second

confrontation  of  Indonesians  against   their   own

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the third confrontation for the

annexation of West Irian. This time they received jet

planes  and  warships  from Russia  which  made  them

stronger still. Fortunately the world body moved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>



in and the Indonesians were saved from a devastating

war.  The  United  Nations mediated in  the  peaceful

transfer  of West Irian from the Dutch to  Indonesia.

So  the lessons of confrontation run all the time  in

their veins.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they confront Malaysia! What next? Do the

Indonesians  have  any  ulterior  motive   to   annex

Malaysia  with Indonesia? Sir, history has taught  us

that  any  dictatorial means of  action  employed  by

power-mad  politicians and their  armies  has  caused

more  harm to themselves than to the people intended.

Germany's  Hitler was an example of this.  He  had  a

powerful  army. He went on annexing and  annihilating

country   after   country.  First  from   Munich   to

Czechoslovakia, from the Sudetenland to Poland  where

he  was finally caught between the cross-fire of  big

powers and perished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Barisan's amendment, as it stands,

undermines the integrity and freedom of the people of

Malaysia.  It would have been better for the  Barisan

to  talk to the Indonesians and persuade them to stop

talking about confrontation and conflagration and  go

to the conference table to talk things over. It is an

ignominious  act on the part of the Barisan  Sosialis

to  ask  their own Prime Minister to go on his  knees

before  the Indonesians to talk things over,  because

the  doors  are closed on our faces by the Indonesian

confrontation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are an independent nation and a self-respecting

people. We want peace more than war. We have seen the

horrors of the Japanese war in Malaya during 1941. We

know the dangers of nuclear war and radioactive fall-out.  We know the devastating effects of the hydrogen

bomb  over Hiroshima. Therefore, we do not want  war,

we  want  peace. Nobody likes war. Even the  Russians

who  are  leading in the atomic bomb race  dared  not

start  a  war  over Cuba. Neither are the  Americans,

with  their  huge  stockpile  of  nuclear  war-heads,

prepared to fight a war. Malaysia is not an exemption

to this. Even a goat, if confronted with a lion, will

put up a final fight before it succumbs. Therefore, I

would advise the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>



Barisan Members not to try to be scare-crows in  this

Assembly  and be His Master's Voice of Radio Jakarta.

It  is  quite  logical for newly emerging independent

countries  to  first  set right  their  own  economy.

Perhaps the Indonesians are not quick-witted in  this

respect. Perhaps they have been absorbed in too  many

confrontations  for too long. Now  they  realise  the

seriousness  of  their  home  economy  and   find   a

scapegoat in Malaysia for it. Dr Subandrio has  said

over  Radio  Jakarta even if Malaysia is  settled  he

will not resume trade relations with Malaysia on  the

same  basis  as  it  was done before.  In  the  past,

Indonesian  raw  materials found their  world  market

through the Singapore free port. Now Jakarta wants to

come  out  as a free port and the marketing area  for

Indonesian  goods. In such an event  Malaysia  cannot

expect  a  big  volume of trade with  Indonesia  even

after confrontation is settled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Singapore is not minimising the

seriousness of the Indonesian confrontation  and  the

loss of trade. Our Prime Minister has openly admitted

that  the  Indonesian trade embargo has caused  us  a

loss of $8.7 million in national income. Our Minister

for  Finance  has not concealed this  in  his  Budget

Estimates.  On the other hand, provisions  have  been

made  for temporary relief measures for those workers

and  firms affected by the loss of Indonesian  trade.

This loss of trade will be made up eventually through

the  rapid industrialisation of this country, and the

Jurong industrial development will play a big part in

redeeming the national prestige and setting right our

national economy and increasing the national income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to tell the Barisan Members to correct

themselves  from the Indonesian illusion.  Think  and

act for themselves as true Malaysians, and co-operate

with   the  Singapore  and  Federal  Governments   by

forwarding   constructive   criticism   rather   than

bringing up a treacherous amendment such as this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I conclude my speech.

will  not  scold you any more. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  in

another  two weeks' time a new year will  be  ushered

in,  a year full of significance, because this is the

year in which the people in Sarawak, Sabah, Singapore

and  Malaya  have got rid of British colonialism  and

have formed themselves into a new nation. In the Yang

di-Pertuan   Negara's  speech,  the  Government   has

stepped up its effort to bring more happiness,  peace

and  prosperity to the people. Mr Speaker, Sir, when

the  past  era has ended and a new era has  come,  we

must  look  back and look forward. Looking back  over

the past few years, we are overwhelmed with feelings.

Under  parliamentary democracy  and  in  this  august

Chamber,  things  are the same but  the  people  have

changed.   That  shows  that  under  a  parliamentary

democracy  where the one-man-one-vote  system  is  in

existence, all those corrupt officials and all  those

who have exploited and oppressed the people have been

discarded  by  the  people. In every  election  these

people will be swept away by the political tide. This

includes   the  Ban-san  Sosialis  Members  opposite.

Therefore, today, in this House, we are not  able  to

see  the  so-called  Progressive Party,  the  Liberal

Socialists, the Workers' Party and the Lim  Yew  Hock

Party.  All this political rubbish has been discarded

by  the  people and has been driven from this  House,

this  august  Chamber. The Barisan  Sosialis  Members

today  have been elected through their deceitful  and

deceptive  tactics.  The P.A.P. are  still  able  to

command  majority strength in this House. It is  not,

as  alleged by the Barisan Sosialis, that we are able

to form the Government ---

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Opposition

had better sit outside if they do not want to listen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the people throughout the world realise

this.  If according to what the Barisan Members  have

said,   it   is   possible  to  gain  power   through

suppression,  and  all sorts of tactics,  then  I  am

afraid  that  it is only in a Communist country  that

one  can  gain  power through suppressive  and  other

tactics.  In a democratic country, it is not possible

to  gain  power  through repressive means;  otherwise

there  would not have been so many coup d'etat in  so

many  countries in South-East Asia, for  example,  in

South  Vietnam. The Lim Yew Hock regime in  Singapore

would  not have collapsed. The P.A.P. have been  able

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>



get the continuous support of a great majority of the

people. There are several reasons for this. The first

reason is that our stand is firm. We dare to practise

what we believe. And we are dedicated to the cause of

the  people. The third factor is that the people have

trust   in  us  as  a  clean,  efficient  and  honest

government. Fourthly, we have been able to  face  the

threat  of  the Communists and we have been  able  to

help set up Malaysia, to bring about merger. Fifthly,

the  Government  have carried out all  their  pledges

contained in the Five-Year Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our splendid achievements in the past four years have been known to all. This cannot be effaced by what the Barisan have said. I would like to ask them whether there is any country in South-East Asia which could carry out such a big housing programme as we have done, at such a low

cost.   The  living  conditions  of  the  people   of

Singapore compared with those of four years  ago  are

very  much better. We have been able to build  houses

surpassing our schedule. Provided the family has more

than three members, in just a matter of two weeks  it

will  be able to get allocation of a house. The  back

of  the  housing  problem has  been  broken.  At  the

moment,  although there are several  thousand  people

still  on the waiting list for houses, the Government

are  continuing with the public housing programme  in

order to meet the needs of these people. Our Minister

for  National Development has said that we are trying

to build 10,000 units every year in order to meet the

needs  of  our  people,  but  those  despicable   and

ignominious  Barisan  Sosialis  Members   have   been

distorting   the   facts   and   misconstruing    our

intentions, alleging that the rentals of  the  houses

built  by  the  Housing  Board  are  too  high.   The

Government wanted to develop the Toa Payoh  area  but

the  Barisan  Sosialis  Member  tried  very  hard  to

obstruct   the  Government's  scheme  and   persuaded

residents not to accept Government's compensation but

to  obstruct  their scheme in every way  possible.  A

member  of the Barisan in the Toa Payoh area - he  was

also  a  resident  there  -very  early  had  received

compensation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>



from  the  Government  and  had  chosen  for  himself

housing accommodation given by the Government. He was

the  first  one to choose his own house  and  yet  he

asked  the  people  there not to accept  Government's

alternative housing accommodation. Now these are  the

true  colours  of the Barisan Members.  In  spite  of

this,  the  Government intend to carry on with  their

Toa Payoh building programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for the past four years the Government have dealt very well with the most important problem of the people, namely, the economic problem. The Government have a complete, comprehensive economic plan which is directed towards securing the happiness, prosperity, peaceful living

and  better  future for the people. Even the  Barisan

Assemblymen  cannot deny this. We have been  able  to

rectify the bad economic situation left over  by  the

Lim  Yew  Hock  Government  and  have,  in  the  end,

accumulated a surplus instead. This has all been  due

to   our   integrity  and  to  the  efforts  of   our

Government,  its  acumen, its intelligent  leadership

and  its  integrity and honesty. Therefore, in  every

field   of   work   - building  construction,   roads,

shipping,  etc.  - there have been great  developments

and achievements over the past few years. The economy

of  Singapore  at present is more prosperous  and  is

growing  faster  than ever. The people  are  enjoying

better  and  more  equal  treatment.  There   is   no

distinction of classes: whether you are a merchant or

a  poor  man,  you  can  choose  your  way  of  life.

Foreigners  who come to Singapore describe  Singapore

as  a  paradise. This is not an exaggerated statement

by  them, because they have seen for themselves  many

countries   in  South-East  Asia  which  are   facing

economic  bankruptcy. They have also  seen  in  these

regions  the  prevalence  of poverty,  sickness,  and

other evils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are poor families in Singapore, they

can  at  least  live  a  decent  life.  With  gradual

development,  their living conditions  are  gradually

improving.  From our Budget Estimates and Development

Estimates, we can see how we can achieve our  objects

in this respect.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian confrontation has not brought any

increase  of  taxation  on the people.  Property  tax

rates  for  owner-occupied houses have  been  reduced

from  36  per cent to 27 per cent per year.  This  is

concrete   evidence  to  prove  that  we  have   done

something for the benefit of the poorer classes.  Our

economy  is  very  sound. Our living  conditions  are

improving  day  by day, and through the  co-operation

and   unity  of  the  people,  we  can  achieve   our

objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all day long, the Barisan Assemblymen have been hurling abusive words at us. They have been indulging in this for more than two years. Their role should be to help the Government by advancing constructive criticisms for the betterment of the people. On the contrary, whatever they do and

say  is done with evil intentions, and the effect  is

only  to  worsen things. Without any rhyme or reason,

they  have incited the workers, misappropriated trade

union  funds  and caused many workers to  lose  their

jobs. After creating such chaos, they turn round  and

put  the blame on the Government, accusing us of  not

being  able  to  resolve the unemployment  situation.

[Interruption] If you are impatient,  you  can  leave

this Chamber now!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the achievements of the Government over the past four years have been acknowledged by the people of the Federation of Malaya. On the rights of women, we have been able to provide better and fairer opportunities for them to enjoy equal rights as the men. This has brought a

sense  of  dignity to women. Our women in  the  civil

service  are enjoying equal pay for equal  work.  The

Government have built quite a good number of  creches

to  enable mothers to leave their children there when

they  go out to work. In the coming years, women will

be  able  to  contribute  their  efforts  and  energy

towards  the building of a better socialist  society.

There  is  an  old  Chinese saying that  if  you  are

holding  an  important position you  have  a  greater

burden  and  task before you. We have  fulfilled  the

task entrusted to us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan's attitude and actions in regard to

Indonesian  confrontation are despicable.  They  have

sworn  in this House to support Malaysia. But in  the

face  of  confrontation, they  have  forgotten  their

pledge.  They have not dared to come forward. Instead

they  have  been engaging themselves in anti-national

activities  and  have tried to  speak  on  behalf  of

Indonesia, trying to magnify the serious consequences

of   Indonesian  confrontation.  When  we  thoroughly

expose  them in this House, they turn round  and  say

that   they  advocate  a  peaceful  settlement   with

Indonesia and urge us to negotiate with Indonesia for

a  peaceful settlement. I ask them whether  they  are

only  paying  lip-service.  Even  at  the  time  when

Singapore  accepted the principle  of  Malaysia,  the

Barisan Sosialis had begun creating chaos and trouble

everywhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For about two or three years the Barisan Members

have  never ceased to instigate students and workers

to  go on strike and cause a chaotic situation in the

State. They even went to the extent of lending  their

support  to the Brunei rebels. Today they  even  have

the  effrontery to say in this House  that  they  are

advocating  a  peaceful solution to the  problem.  In

actual  fact, they are earnestly hoping  and  praying

that  the  Indonesian army will march into Singapore.

They  are  like  Wu San Kwee of the Ming  Dynasty  of

China.  He  let in the enemy armies into  China.  The

Barisan's  true colours have been thoroughly  exposed

in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after their great defeat and disaster at the general elections, the Barisan Sosialis have now turned round and accused the Government of having taken repressive action. In fact, the people have taught them a lesson by

their  defeat, at the general elections. The  Barisan

Sosialis   talked   eloquently,   what   with   their

propaganda  tactics,  at the general  elections,  but

nevertheless  their debased actions cost  them  their

defeat. In the end the people were fed up with  them.

This  is  because  even before they  could  form  the

government they were arrogant and unstable  in  their

actions. They created fear and trouble everywhere.  I

would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>



have  thought  that the Barisan Sosialis  would  have

changed  and mended their ways after their defeat.  I

would  have  thought that they would  have  discarded

their  past evil activities. In actual fact,  we  see

that these people can never change. They have instead

persisted  in,  and indeed stepped  up,  their  usual

activities. I would like to give a piece of advice to

the  Members of the Barisan Sosialis. If they do  not

want  to hold back their horses on the brink  of  the

precipice and go back, they will be discarded by  the

people in the end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are filled with emotion when

we  look back over the last four years of our term of

office.  We have discovered some of our shortcomings.

But  the fact remains that we should be happy because

Malaysia  has been achieved. We can see for ourselves

that  the Common Market is now an accomplished  fact.

This  is a great encouragement to the people in  this

area.  History  has also proved that the  P.A.P. can

keep  the trust which the people have placed in them.

The P.A.P. have ended colonialism in this part of the

world.  They have brought about reunification between

Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. In this  way,

we  have  been able to establish a society  in  which

there   is  no  exploitation  of  man  by  man.   The

aspirations  of  the  people are now  being  realised

through  the enlightened leadership of the  Malaysian

Government.  In  spite of intimidation  and  pressure

from  many  quarters,  we are  able  to  ensure  that

everybody  within  the territories of  Malaysia  will

have a decent life. This is our objective.
