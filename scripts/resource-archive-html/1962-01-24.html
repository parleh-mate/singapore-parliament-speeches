<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, I rise

to move the motion standing in my name*.





<hr size="2" noshade>

* The motion reads as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, in pursuance of this national objective of

a  united Malayan nation, enlarged and strengthened

by  the  addition  of our brothers  in  the  Borneo

territories,  this House declares  its  support  in

principle  for  the  plan  proposed  by  the  Prime

Minister  of the Federation of Malaya, Tunku  Abdul

Rahman Putra Al-Haj, and agreed to in principle  in

the  Federation  Parliament on 18th October,  1961,

for   the   establishment  of  the  Federation   of

Malaysia,  comprising  the  eleven  States  of  the

present  Federation, the States  of  Singapore  and

Brunei,  and the territories of Sarawak  and  North

Borneo.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion was first tabled in the House for

debate  in November last year, to be taken  together

with  two other motions; the first supporting merger

in  principle, and the second as accepting the heads

of  agreement published in Cmd. Paper 33 of 1961, as

a  working basis for a merger between Singapore  and

the  Federation of Malaya. As a result of  the  long

debate on the question of merger, it is not possible

to  take  a  vote  on ths motion before  the  second

meeting  of  the  Malaysia  Solidarity  Consultative

Committee which was held in Kuching from the 18th to

the  20th of December last year. This was a  meeting

intended to bring together all those members of  the

legislative  chambers  of the live  territories  who

supported Malaysia in principle and wanted  to  help

the Solidarity Committee quicken its realisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, belated though this motion may be, it is

not  without its value, for it is as well from  time

to time to have all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



Members  of  the  Assembly, state  for  the  record,

whether  they  are,  in principle,  for  or  against

Malaysia, or whether they are, for various  reasons,

unable  to  make a stand and, therefore,  abstaining

from  the  vote, either openly in this  Chamber,  or

surreptitiously by absenting themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in moving this motion, I am assured by

two  facts.  Firstly, that members  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis   have  always  claimed  to   support,   in

principle,  both merger and Malaysia and  had  asked

for  their  representative to attend the  Solidarity

Committee  meetings  as a member  of  the  Singapore

delegation. We had gladly agreed to the  Member  for

Thomson  as their representative and he was  present

at both meetings of the Solidarity Committee meeting

in  Kuching  last  December and in  Kuala  Lumpur  a

fortnight ago. Since only those who support Malaysia

in  principle were invited to attend and the Barisan

Sosialis  had  asked  to attend,  logically  we  can

assume  that  they  support Malaysia  in  principle.

Furthermore, when the Member for Thomson was pressed

to  state  his stand at the meeting in  Kuching,  he

stated  categorically, off the cuff, that  he  fully

supported  Malaysia, but he added  that  he  had  to

ensure  that  the  people of the Borneo  territories

were  fully  looked after - as if the  people  of  the

Borneo  territories could not look after themselves.

The   other   fact   which  has   given   me   great

encouragement was the resolution on West  Irian,  on

which,  Sir,  there  was  studious  effort  made  to

differentiate West Irian from Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, taking a stand on any issue, be it West Irian

or  Malaysia,  presents no difficulty  to  political

Parties with an open and straightforward stand  like

the  P.A.P. But Parties like the Barisan who do  not

stand for what they claim to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



stand   for  may  find  themselves  in  considerable

difficulty if they start supporting things  they  do

not  really  support. I do not  know  whether  these

things  were  carefully  thought  out  and  all  the

implications made as between a stand on  West  Irian

and  a stand on Malaysia. I would have thought  that

here  indeed  was  the height of  contradiction.  In

supporting  the  liberation of  West  Irian  as  the

P.A.P. did, we were supporting the liberation of  an

integral  part  of a European empire  in  South-East

Asia,  which  has  still to be  freed  in  order  to

complete the independence of what were formerly  the

territories of the Dutch Empire in South-East  Asia.

And so Afro-Asian nationalists support the right  of

succession of the Indonesian Republic to West Irian,

for  Dutch  New Guinea was an integral part  of  the

Netherlands  East  Indies.  The  Dutch  Empire  once

spread  over  the 3,000-odd islands now constituting

the  Republic  of Indonesia, and so the  Indonesians

right y dismiss all Dutch talk of self-determination

for  a  few  hundred thousand papuans in  Dutch  New

Guinea  as imperialistic nonsense designed to  delay

matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in the same way, we support the rights of the

people of Singapore and the three Borneo territories

to  be  liberated  from  the  British  and  to  join

together with the Federation of Malaya to constitute

the  Federation of Malaysia consisting  of  all  the

territories which once formed the British Empire  in

South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy that the Barisan Sosialis has

sided   with  the  Indonesians  in  condemning   the

imperialistic  powers  who  support  the  Dutch   in

putting  forward  this excuse of  self-determination

for  the  Papuans. West Irian is part of  Indonesia,

and   to  Indonesia  it  must  return.  But   I   am

disappointed, however, that the same militant  anti-colonial  spirit vanishes completely when  they  are

asked  to  take  a  stand on  Malaysia.  Here  is  a

concrete issue on our own doorstep on which they can

express   their  anti-colonial  fervour   to   fight

colonialism without any danger of being  sent,  ill-equipped,  to  land  on  some  hostile  shores,   or

probably be sunk before they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



landed.  Nobody is asking them to volunteer to  risk

their life and limb. All we are asking them to do is

to  take  a  stand  to  liberate  the  three  Borneo

territories  and  Singapore to form  an  independent

sovereign  nation  together with the  Federation  of

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from what the Member for Thomson has said for

the  Barisan  Sosialis  in Kuching,  I  gather  that

having said that he supported Malaysia in principle,

he  was then interested in taking the Dutch colonial

line   of   gradual  self-determination   for   each

individual  divided territory. This very  same  line

they  condemned  when taken by  the  Dutch  on  West

Irian, but quite shamelessly adopted by them when it

suits  their Communist interests to oppose Malaysia.

So  the fierce fighters of the Barisan Sosialis  and

their Communist friends and supporters were prepared

to  find  women to fight for the liberation of  West

Irian. Sir, the Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis was

somewhat apologetic yesterday when he explained that

he  could  not  find  these  three  women  on  their

records.  Even more shameless, Sir, if they  had  to

sacrifice three of their women members, at least,  I

would  have respected them for it. But to find three

innocent  women, who were not even  members  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis, and ask them to go out  and  talk

the Barisan Sosialis propaganda line was a heartless

and  cold-blooded  act  akin  to  murder.  Sir,  the

strange  thing  about the Barisan Sosialis  is  that

they  always  believe in sending women and  children

first to the front line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Work Brigade!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Work Brigade and the

schools  - a very strange characteristic of the fierce

freedom  fighters. Now, they are actively trying  to

create difficulty and confusion over Malaysia.  They

know   that   with   Malaysia  there   will   be   a

strengthening  of nationalist anti-colonial  forces,

and  their  Communist anti-colonial forces  will  be

isolated and confined. But that is their problem;  a

problem  that faces those who expound the  cause  of

democracy when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



they  do  not  believe in it; expound  non-Communism

when,  in  fact, they are Communists; and  Socialism

when, in fact, they mean Communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 1962 is likely to be a memorable year in the

annals  of South-East Asia for two issues,  Malaysia

and  West  Irian. I am looking forward  during  this

debate  to  see what they are going to say  and  how

they are going to vote, or perhaps, whether they are

going  to vote at all. All good and honest democrats

always  stand  up  to be counted.  It  is  only  the

Communists in democrat clothing who always  find  it

embarrassing when the doctor comes around to  remove

their democratic clothing for a closer examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

it  is a pity the Prime Minister again ridicules the

volunteers  after  what  I had  said  last  evening.

Surely  he  should pay some respect, if not  to  the

volunteers,  at  least,  to  the  Indonesian  people

themselves. He referred again to self-determination.

I  was  very careful to explain last evening to  the

house,   that   words  like  "merger"   and   "self-determination" have been completely twisted  out  of

shape  by the P.A.P. Merger to the P.A.P. means  the

enslavement  of  Singapore; merger to  other  people

means equality, justice and democracy. Everybody  in

this House excepting the P.A.P. says that it is  not

merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly self-determination. In our explanation,

we have to explain to people who are so dense as not

to understand that self-determination in the case of

West  Irian was meant to be a move for sponsoring  a

puppet  regime for the imperialists.  In  our  case,

self-determination would give us an  opportunity  to

decide   our  own  fate  and  would  give   us   the

opportunity  to fight for the unity of  the  people.

However, Sir, the Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>



Minister  in moving this motion is obviously  trying

to  repeat what the Minister for Labour did when  he

moved   the  motion  calling  for  support  on   the

principle  of merger. It does seem to be a favourite

trick  of the P.A.P. to talk of wonderful principles

of  unity,  prosperity  and  what-not  and  then  to

smuggle  in  constitutional changes  that  will,  in

effect, frustrate the people's hopes and aspirations

under  the  cloak of these very same principles.  In

the   case   of   Malaysia,  through  the   Malaysia

Solidarity   Consultative   Committee   and    other

meetings,  the  P.A.P. would  like  us   and   like

everybody  to  get  excited over this  principle  of

Malaysia. They want everybody to start shouting, "We

support Malaysia." And then when everybody is in  an

elated  mood, the P.A.P. hope to twist this euphoria

to mean support for a specific set o proposals which

will not be to the best interests of the people  but

which  will,  on  the contrary,  go  to  consolidate

reactionary rule in this region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister always likes to give us

glowing pictures of El Dorados in his various Press

interviews,  in  his various radio forums.  But  the

Malaysia that is being unfolded before our  eyes  is

not  a  Malaysia  that is going to  bring  equality,

freedom, democracy and social justice to the peoples

of  Singapore,  Sabah, Brunei and  Sarawak.  On  the

contrary, it is going to spread reaction, injustice,

inequality and disunity among these peoples. Sir, we

are not going to fall into the trap of concentrating

on   the   principle   and  forgetting   about   the

details - equally important details -  that go  to  give

form,  substance  and  meaning  to  this  principle.

Today,  we  are  dealing  with  people  whose  first

considerations are not the realisation of the  hopes

and  aspirations of the people. We are dealing  with

desperate  and unscrupulous politicians whose  first

considerations are how to keep themselves in office.

And because of that, we have to be very careful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is this Malaysia scheme that they have

been talking so much about? As far as the people  of

Singapore are concerned, this Malaysia scheme merely

means the P.A.P. White Paper Merger



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



proposals  and  nothing else - just the  P.A.P.  White

Paper  merger  proposals. The Federation  Government

have made it quite clear that Singapore is not going

to   be  accepted  and  be  truly  merged  with  the

Federation.  Singapore is going to  be  only  a  so-called partner with separate citizenship and with no

proportional  representation.  That  is,  Malaysia's

merger and the P.A.P.'s merger are one and the  same

thing.  It is a package-deal. The Tunku has said  so

many  times, "If there is no Malaysia, there  is  no

merger with Singapore." And as we have rejected  the

White Paper proposals, we therefore similarly reject

this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said, the present Malaysia scheme

merely  serves to consolidate reactionary rule  over

the entire region. It is regrettable indeed that the

P.A.P. leaders who call themselves Socialists should

so  eagerly  support a scheme which strengthens  the

forces  of  reaction and colonialism  and  which  is

being  strongly opposed by Socialist Parties in  the

whole region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let it be made quite clear. We do not object

to the concept of Malaysia as a concept. The idea of

a  large  political unit in the Malaysian region  is

not  new. It was originally put forth by progressive

leaders  in  Malaya and Indonesia  after  World  War

II - and  even before that, I understand. The  primary

object  behind the original idea of Malaysia was  to

advance  the interests of the peoples of the region.

It  was  to  unite the peoples in their struggle  to

eradicate  all traces of imperialist domination  and

to   bring   about  political  freedom,  unity   and

stability  to the entire region so that the  peoples

can benefit from a planned socialist development  of

the  rich material resources. Sir, we in the Barisan

Sosialis  fully subscribe to the concept of  peoples

in  more  and  more  countries coming  together  for

mutual interests and mutual benefits. We will always

support  any  move that will bring  about  a  larger

union of countries and peoples and that will help  a

planned  socialist economic development for  benefit

of  all  the people. As socialists, we believe  that

peoples   from  different  lands  can  live  happily

together, not in competition, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



in  co-operation. Socialists do not  see  any  basic

antagonism between the interests of the peoples from

different countries, and we are confident  that  the

day  will  come when the whole human race  on  earth

will live happily together as one happy family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we therefore welcome any move that will

genuinely  bring  about closer relationship  between

the  peoples of the Federation of Malaya, the  three

Borneo territories and Singapore. But any such  move

must  be  based on a genuine desire to  bring  about

greater  benefits to the peoples of this region.  In

other  words, it must be motivated only by a sincere

desire  to  advance the interests of the peoples  of

these  territories and should certainly not  be  for

the  benefit of imperialists and reactionary  forces

in  this region. If the concept of Malaysia is going

to  bring  about happiness to the people,  then  the

only  way  is  to  ensure that the peoples  of  this

region  can  decide  their  own  future.  Let   true

democracy be practised. Sir, I shall deal with  this

aspect in more detail later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let us ask, how do the British come in?

Sir,  you  will realise that colonialism is  on  the

retreat all over the world. We have seen the upsurge

of the Afro-Asian spirit in the struggle for greater

freedom  and greater democratic rights.  The  French

have  been  driven out of Indo-China. The Portuguese

have  just  been evicted from Goa. And  we  see  the

remnants  of  colonialism about to be liquidated  in

West  Irian. But what has happened in Singapore  and

in  the  Borneo  territories? Sir, the  British  are

experienced colonialists. They know their  days  are

numbered  as  far as this region is concerned.  They

know  they  will  have to return the  power  to  the

people soon. The British are, therefore, faced  with

two alternatives: either to continue direct colonial

rule  of these territories in the face of increasing

popular  opposition, in which case  they  know  that

they  may  eventually lose everything;  or  to  rule

indirectly  by transferring political power  to  the

pro-Western politicians while continuing to maintain

an effective economic and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



military control over these territories. Sir,  these

political  concessions, however, are  more  apparent

than  real as the economic and military control will

remain the same as before. Such indirect rule has an

advantage  over  direct and overt colonial  rule  in

that  it can confuse certain sections of our  people

into  believing that the colonial master is no  more

present. But it is not difficult to see that,  after

all,  it  will only be just colonialism in  disguise

and,  in  fact,  it  will help to  prolong  colonial

domination.  It will also enable the colonial  power

to  boast that it has granted "independence" to  its

colonies.  This is important, Sir, in  view  of  the

fact that the United Nations have recently passed  a

resolution   calling  for  an   immediate   end   to

colonialism. Sir, Britain favours or is in favour of

Malaysia,  and in view of what I have  said,  do  we

still  need to ask why Britain is enthusiastic about

Malaysia? From our viewpoint, there are two reasons,

Sir. Firstly, from the long term point of view, this

plan  will provide the British with a safe means  of

retreat  when  the time comes for them  to  give  up

direct  colonial rule. It will allow the British  to

continue  their economic and military domination  of

this   region  by  indirect  control  through  their

influence   over  pro-Western  local  leaders.   The

present Federation Government appears to be  a  safe

bet  for the British, as it has been made very clear

that  it  does  not intend to harm British  economic

interests in this region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the British hope that this plan will

help  to distract the attention of our peoples  from

the  existence of a colonial power by getting us all

too  preoccupied with the problems of  merger,  thus

putting  a  brake on our anti-colonial movement.  We

will  be told that the problem before us is not  one

of  getting  rid of the British but one  of  merging

among  ourselves. And, of course, this problem  will

be  made more difficult by constant harping  on  the

minor  difference existing amongst our peoples.  Our

racial  and religious differences will be  distorted

and emphasised,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



and  our  different  approaches, to  education,  for

example,  will be magnified and made an  excuse  for

obstructing a genuine reunification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have seen all these mischievous political

games  in  Singapore before, and evidently they  are

going to be repeated in the Borneo territories.  The

British  hope  that the energies of  the  people  in

Borneo  will  be  similarly dissipated  in  fighting

amongst   themselves   and   with   the   Federation

Government,  so that the existence of  the  colonial

power will be temporarily forgotten by them. We  see

clearly why this Malaysia plan fits into the British

scheme  of  things. It helps to divert the  people's

attention  from fighting against the colonial  power

to  fighting among themselves. And it is a  move  to

protect British economic interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not need to labour on this point any

further except to say, in passing, that Malaysia  or

no  Malaysia, we are willy-nilly drawn into  a  cold

war.  We  already know that as regards  the  British

bases  in  Singapore, Britain will continue  to  use

them as a matter of right after Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sandra Woodhull agreed to all

this.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Britain will only consult the

proposed   Malaysia  Government  as  a   matter   of

courtesy.  Therefore, there is no  change  regarding

the bases, Malaysia or no Malaysia. For example,  we

learn  that rocket launching sites are already being

placed  around  Singapore and V-bombers  armed  with

nuclear weapons are equipped and on the ready.  This

means that we shall be directly drawn into the  cold

war between the two power blocs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You can go to Borneo.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, if our country is going to

be  used  as a nuclear base in the event of a  major

world war, then the peoples of the whole region will

be  placed right at the front line. This is not what

we want. We want peace and neutrality. We want to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



with  the  non-allied countries  of  Afro-Asia.  The

Malaysia that we want is a Malaysia that must not be

a pawn of big power politics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is significant to note, Sir, that the Permanent

Secretariat  of  the Afro-Asian People's  Solidarity

Organisation had issued a statement in Cairo on  4th

December, 1961, strongly condemning the British plot

to  rig  up  a Federation of Malaysia in  South-East

Asia.  The  statement said that the purpose  of  the

British  in  this Malaysia plan is to  suppress  the

national liberation movement of South-East Asia.  It

calls  on  the  people  of Asia  and  Africa  to  be

vigilant against colonial manoeuvres and to take all

necessary steps to frustrate the British plot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Western powers are also evidently trying

to  use  the  Malaysia scheme  to  bring  about  the

political isolation of our peoples in Singapore  and

the  Borneo territories from the mainstream of Afro-Asia,  which is vigorously led in this part  of  the

world  by Indonesia. The spirit of Afro-Asia is  the

spirit  of oppressed peoples all over the world.  It

is  the  spirit that is crying for freedom, equality

and  justice.  It  is the spirit  of  young  nations

throughout  the  world. It is the  spirit  of  young

nations  refusing  to be drawn  into  the  cold  war

conflict, of young nations trying to stand on  their

own feet after centuries of colonial domination, and

of nations refusing to be used as pawns in big power

politics.  The peoples of Singapore and  the  Borneo

territories  are largely inspired by the  spirit  of

Afro-Asia.  It is this desire to remain neutral  and

to  be free that had led the people of Singapore  to

elect  at  the last general elections a Party  which

then   professed  to  be  non-Communist  and   anti-colonial, but which has since deviated and abandoned

both  these basic platforms, and now become obsessed

with the negative philosophy of anti-Communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our wanting to rally under the banner of Afro-Asia, of course, will not be to the interests of the

colonial  powers, because Afro-Asia means neutrality

between the two power blocs and, understandably, the

British would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



like  to  use  the Malaysia scheme to forestall  the

growing  influence of the Afro-Asian spirit  amongst

the peoples of Singapore and the Borneo territories,

and to help keep our peoples under the influence and

domination of the Western capitalist world  so  that

we  can continue to be exploited and subjugated  and

become mere pawns in big power politics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Prime Minister had on previous occasions

referred  to Brunei as a possible Kuwait if  it  did

not  merge  with  Malaya. He said  that  Kuwait  had

trouble immediately it was given independence.  This

country  has a population of a few hundred  thousand

people  while Brunei has a population of only,  say,

about 80,000 people. He said that Brunei too is oil-rich   and  sudden  independence  might  bring   new

problems. From this, Sir, it is clear that our Prime

Minister  is  even  prepared  to  fit  himself  into

Western designs by souring up relations between  the

people  of the Borneo territories and the people  of

Indonesia.  Let us ask: is it not to imply  that  if

the  people  of  Brunei did not  join  the  proposed

Malaysia  and so become dominated by the  Federation

Government;   their  territory  would   instead   be

conquered  by  Indonesia? That is  the  implication,

Sir.  But the Indonesian Government has already made

it  clear  that  it  has  no  claim  on  the  Borneo

territories now under British rule. So why  such  an

analogy? Is it not a very mischievous thing?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. used to talk about fostering

better relationships with the Indonesian people. But

now,  having  lost the support of  the  people,  the

P.A.P. leadership  is  even prepared  to  help  the

Western powers against Indonesia. I do not believe -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not believe, for one

moment,  Sir,  that  the Indonesian  people,  having

tasted  oppression themselves, would want  to  force

upon the people of Brunei a political system



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



which the people of Brunei themselves do not want. I

am  sure that Indonesia, as a leader of Afro-Asia in

this region, would want to see the people of Brunei -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What about India?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - as free and as equal as they

are   themselves.   It   is,  therefore,   extremely

mischievous on the part of our Prime Minister, if he

knew  what he was doing, to try to stir up suspicion

and  ill-feelings between the people of  Brunei  and

their neighbours and friends, the Indonesian people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, how does Malaysia fit in with the present

Right-wing  Government  of the  Federation?  Judging

from  the  various  statements from  the  Federation

Government and especially from the speech  delivered

by  the  Tunku at the Federal Parliament  debate  on

Malaysia,   it   is  evident  that  the   Federation

Government  is  more  keen to  take  in  the  Borneo

territories  than  to take in Singapore  itself.  In

fact,  the  Tunku has repeatedly said that  he  will

take   in   Singapore  only  if  the  three   Borneo

territories come in at the same time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let us first examine why the Federation

Government  is  more  keen to  take  in  the  Borneo

territories    than   Singapore.   The    Federation

Government  has claimed that it has now changed  its

previous  anti-merger stand and is now  prepared  to

have   some  sort  of  merger  with  Singapore.   As

everybody  knows, aid incidentally, Sir - but  I  had

better leave it alone -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You have not got clearance

from your Committee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I wanted to say, Sir, that when

the  Federation  Government was openly  anti-merger,

the  P.A.P. never  dared  to  call  the  Federation

Government  anti-nationalist or pro-Communist.  That

is what I wanted to say, but I thought that that did

not fit in and so -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> You have said it

already.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But the Federation Government

still   has  a  pathological  fear  of  the  Chinese

population in Singapore. It sees in the addition  of

large  numbers  of Chinese from Singapore  into  the

Federation on a genuine merger a threat against  the

Federation  Government. That is why  the  Federation

Government   and   the   P.A.P. have   devised   a

constitutional  arrangement  whereby  the  political

influence  of Singapore citizens will be kept  to  a

minimum,   and   in  which  we  are   denied   equal

citizenship    and   the   right   of   proportional

representation. Faced with what it considers to be a

problem  of  having  to  counterbalance  the   large

numbers  of  Chinese  in Singapore,  the  Federation

Government sees in the addition of large numbers  of

non-Chinese  in  the  Borneo territories  a  welcome

solution  to its communal fears and prejudices.  But

we  have  heard the Prime Minister telling  us  over

Radio P.A.P. that with Malaysia, by the addition  of

the  Borneo territories, the Communist threat  would

be diluted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is right.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But more to the point is that

with  the  addition  of the Borneo  territories  the

Malays,  together with the indigenous population  of

the Borneo territories, would outnumber the Chinese.

This  is  what will really allay the prejudices  and

fears  of those politicians who, very unfortunately,

analyse  political situations only from  a  communal

angle.  Sir, we have known of this Malaysia plan  of

the Prime Minister of Singapore for quite some time.

Long  ago  he had talked of Malaysia as  being  more

acceptable to the Federation Government than just  a

merger between Singapore and the Federation, because

the  Malays would then form the predominant part  of

the population. It is extremely regrettable that the

Prime Minister who called himself a socialist should

try to play on the communal fears and prejudices  of

the  people. Sir, the Malaysia plan appeals  to  the

Federation Government perhaps also because of, if  I

may  say  so, the rich oil resources of Brunei.  The

yearly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



revenue of Brunei is about $130 million, whereas its

annual expenditure, so far as we know, is only about

$30 million. This is an annual surplus of about $100

million  which will, of course, help the  Federation

Treasury after Malaysia. So I wonder if this is  the

real  attraction of the Borneo territories  for  the

Federation Government. In their eagerness  to  bring

the  Borneo territories under Federation  rule,  the

Federation Government and the P.A.P. are  trying  to

rush  the  people  of  the Borneo  territories  into

making  a  quick decision. Thus we see  attempts  to

convert   the   Malaysia   Solidarity   Consultative

Committee  from  a  purely  consultative  body  into

semblance of a decision-making body. Sir, we do  not

wish to interfere with the affairs of the people  of

the Borneo territories -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Quite right.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - because we believe that the

people there are fully capable of deciding their own

future.  And  we  regret there has been  no  genuine

attempt so far to consult the views of the people of

the  Borneo territories on this Malaysia  plan.  The

proposed  Commission of Inquiry to assess the  views

of the Borneo people, like all official commissions,

will be just an eye-wash. Already there is a lot  of

quarrelling  over  the choice of the  Chairman.  The

Tunku has said many illuminating things on the  true

purpose of this Commission. Let me quote him in  the

Straits  Times, Sir, of 6th December, 1961, on  page

1, column 8. This is a whole paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"If you appoint the wrong type of Commission and

get certain recommendations which you find it is not

possible  to  accept,  then the  whole  question  of

Malaysia will collapse," said the Tunku.'



<br><br>Then  there is another passage. It is on page 20  of

the same day, column 8, and it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The British public know they have very honest and

real  friends.  We  need  the  right  Commission  to

recommend  the  right  things  to  accelerate   this

merger.'



<br><br>The  right Commission to recommend the right  things

for  our Prime Minister so that he may still  be  in

office.  It  is  quite clear from  this  very  frank

statement by the Tunku himself that the real



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



purpose of the Commission is that it must, under all

circumstances,  produce quickly  a  very  favourable

report  for his Malaysia proposals. It is clear  too

that  the  Commission  is  not  intended  to  be  an

unbiased body for the proper assessment of the views

of the people of the Borneo territories. It is meant

to be  -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You expect to be made Chairman

of the Commission?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - a rubber stamp, Sir, so as to

enable   the   Federation  Government   to   declare

officially  that the Borneo people  have  been  consulted  and  that they favour the Tunku's  Malaysia

plan. How nice!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You pray the Commission to

come over!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, this is, to say the very

least,  not a very democratic way of consulting  the

people  of the Borneo territories. We know that  the

peoples  of  the  three Borneo  territories  have  a

genuine   apprehension  about  this  whole  Malaysia

scheme.  All  this  talk about the present  Malaysia

proposals  bringing economic benefits to the  Borneo

territories sounds very hollow indeed, Sir, when  we

remember that there is not only unemployment in  the

Federation  itself  but  also  that  the  Federation

Government has to borrow money from Brunei  to  ease

its own economic difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested that this Malaysia scheme is

going  to  bring  freedom and  independence  to  the

peoples  of  Sabah, Brunei, Sarawak  and  Singapore.

But,  Sir,  is this really going to be  so?  Freedom

does  not mean the exchange of the British flag  for

the  Federation flag. It must mean, when  translated

into  actual  practice,  an  increase  of  political

freedom and democratic rights -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> More subversion!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - so as to bring about an

increase  in  the standard of living of the  people.

But, Sir, this evidently is not to be so. The people

of the Borneo territories are demanding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



the  right  of self-determination. It is  only  fair

that  they  should have this right before  they  are

given   a  new  constitutional  set-up.  Among   the

political  Parties  in the Borneo territories  which

are  demanding self-rule before Malaysia is  set  up

are major political parties like the Party Rakyat of

Brunei  and  the Sarawak United People's Party.  The

Sarawak  United  People's  Party  issued  a   policy

statement on the 6th of December, 1961, saying  that

it  was  opposed  to  plans for  a  Malaysia  before

Sarawak was granted independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis do not wish to

have anything to do with the various manoeuvres  and

intrigues of the P.A.P. to induce the people of  the

Borneo territories to accept the Malaysia proposals.

We  do  not  wish to take part in the  smooth  high-pressure sales talk of the Prime Minister.  We  know

that  the  people of Sabah, Brunei and  Sarawak  are

right now demanding the right of self-determination.

Let it be so. No one can refuse any people the right

of  self-determination. That  is  their  fundamental

democratic  right.  If  the  people  of  the  Borneo

territories  demand elections,  then  they  must  be

given elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You are talking just like the

Dutch now!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Let me quote, Sir, the joint

communique of the Sarawak United People's Party  and

the  People's  Socialist Front dated 10th  November,

1961.  They have this to say, Sir. This is only  one

paragraph, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We firmly oppose the concept of Malaysia hut

reiterate  that  my  constitutional  association  of

Malaya  with  the  Borneo territories  can  only  be

brought  about by those peoples and only  after  the

right of self-determination has been vested in  them

and   that   the  colonial  Governments   of   these

territories should not have the right to enter  into

negotiations with the Malayan Government  on  behalf

of the people of these territories.'



<br><br>Sir,  we wholeheartedly agree with their views.  Let

me  also  quote  from  the joint  statement  of  the

Malayan  People's Socialist Front, the Party  Rakyat

of  Brunei  and  the Barisan Sosialis of  Singapore.

Here are two short paragraphs:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We believe that any constitutional association of

Malaya  with  the Borneo territories  must  only  be

brought  about after the right of self-determination

has  been vested with the peoples of Brunei, Sarawak

and North Borneo. It is a matter of urgency that the

Borneo territories should achieve self-determination

before   they   decide  on  the  nature   of   their

association with Malaya and Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel that any proposal which does not advance

the  self-determination of the people must be firmly

resisted.  We  urge  that  any  move  to  unify  the

territories  and peoples must be based on  equality,

democracy   and  justice, and  must   advance   the

interests of the people.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis would not like to

have  anything to do with all these attempts of  the

British  Government, the Federation Government,  and

the  P.A.P.  Government to deny the  people  of  the

Borneo    territories   their   right    of    self-determination. We wish to have absolutely nothing to

do  with  their attempts to substitute the elections

with  commissions  and consultative  committees.  We

know why the Prime Minister postponed the debate  on

Malaysia. It was partly, I think, to enable  him  to

speak  after the announcement of the appointment  of

the Chairman of the Commission. But -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order. The

Member   is   imputing  not  only   malicious,   but

completely   unfounded   allegations   as   to    my

motivations.  You will remember, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

the  postponement was forced upon us by the  lengthy

seven-hour speeches Members of Barisan Sosialis were

making.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order at all.

The  Prime  Minister  will have his  opportunity  of

replying to that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was saying, Sir, it was to

enable  him to speak after the announcement  of  the

appointment  of the Chairman of the Commission.  But

the   people   of   Singapore  have   had   official

commissions and committees and what-nots before. The

people   know   just  how  useful   these   official

commissions and committees can be in the  assessment

of  our  true  feelings, especially  when  they  are

appointed  by  outsiders and are not responsible  to

our people here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Commission of Inquiry, which, is

supposed to assess the views of the people of  Sabah

and Sarawak, is appointed not by the people of these

territories,   but   by  the  Governments   of   the

Federation   and   Great  Britain,   and   will   be

responsible only to these two Governments and not to

the  peoples of the Borneo territories. What are the

terms  of reference of this Commission? The five-man

Commission  has  to take into account - I  will  quote

from the Straits Times, 18th January, 1962:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... the express agreement of the governments of

the United Kingdom and the Federation of Malaya that

the  inclusion o North Borneo and Sarawak  (together

with  other  territories) in the proposed Federation

of  Malaysia is a desirable aim in the interests  of

the peoples of the territories concerned-'.



<br><br>That, Sir, is in column 2 of page 20.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission, therefore, is going to Borneo with

their  minds  already  made  up.  Members  of   this

Commission with preconceived ideas are going to wear

coloured glasses in their assessment of the views of

the  people. I have no doubts, Sir, that their  ears

will  also be deaf to all those voices of the Borneo

people who state that it is not in the interests  of

the  people  of the Borneo territories to  join  the

Malaysia  scheme. Their ears will  be  deaf  to  all

those voices which say that the Borneo peoples  want

their  rights  of self-determination  and  political

freedom from colonialism in independence and not  in

the  Malaysia  scheme. Sir, this is  the  Commission

that  is  going  to be the sole judge  of  what  are

supposed to be the views of the Borneo people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order. Sir, this

is  not a debate on the Commission. I do not want to

stop  the  Member for Queenstown in criticizing  the

Commission. It is not our Commission. The debate  is

on the principle and the concept of Malaysia. If the

Member for Queenstown wishes to have a debate on the

Commission  by all means let him table a  motion  on

it. Sir, we are now discussing the concept of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



Malaysia. Is it relevant to go into, a tirade on the

Commission? We are not interested in the Commission.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I understood the Member for

Queenstown to say he rejected this motion completely

and he is now giving reasons why he is rejecting  it

completely. That is the theme of his speech.  He  is

perhaps   going  a  little  too  far  into   details

criticizing the Commission. [Interruption] Order. He

is, I think, possibly going a little too far when he

starts criticizing the Commission. All he can say is

that  he  does  not agree with the  Commission.  The

Commission  may  be going there, as  he  says,  with

coloured glasses. That is all. But other than  that,

I  think  the Member for Queenstown is perfectly  in

order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I might add, Sir, I had

previously explained that it is no use just agreeing

to  principles without knowing what the details  are

that  give  form,  substance and  meaning  to  those

principles.  And  we  know  how  principles  can  be

twisted by the P.A.P. to suit their own meaning.  So

in  opposing this so-called principle of theirs,  we

have  to  explain and make it quite clear  that  the

form  and substance which they recommend are not  in

the  interests  of  the people. In  this  particular

case,  the  Commission has a  lot  to  do  with  the

Malaysia  concept, Sir. So, I crave your  indulgence

if  you  will allow me to set my thoughts in  proper

order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the point is that the

Member  for  Queenstown may say  that  he  does  not

believe  the Commission would serve its purpose  and

leave  it at that. He cannot now go into the details

criticizing the Commission as such.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will not go into details,

Sir,  except to say that in this Commission,  not  a

single  man  from among them comes from  the  Borneo

people.   It   is   very   unlikely,   under   those

circumstances, to expect the Commission to find  out

the  true  reflection of the views of the people  of

Borneo   themselves.  Two  of  them  are  from   the

Federation and three are from Great Britain.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>



It  is  very  unlikely  that  the  members  of  this

Commission  will write up reports that  are  not  in

agreement   with   the   policies   of   these   two

Governments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, anyway, we do not believe that any commission,

no  matter  how well intended, could be a substitute

for   a  secret  ballot.  We  believe  that  it   is

absolutely   fundamental  that  any   constitutional

change for the Borneo territories must be decided by

the people themselves and not by appointed so-called

leaders    and   reports   of   carefully   selected

commissions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Sir, if I may be allowed to hark

back  a little. This is to explain about our quarrel

regarding  those  few Chinese words.  These  Chinese

words meant "imposed downwards". You remember,  Sir,

last  night  we  had  different  interpretations  as

regards  those few Chinese words. Now, here  I  have

expressed  the  views  very clearly  and  those  few

Chinese  words  actually mean that we cannot  expect

anything  good  from things which are  imposed  from

self-appointed  leaders and from  those  people  who

happen to be in power. Anyway, Sir, attempts are now

being  made to sugar-coat the Malaysia proposals  by

offering the people of the Borneo territories  local

autonomies over this and that. We in Singapore  know

that  local  autonomy over subjects like labour  and

education is meaningless without -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Internal security.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - control over internal

security. I do not wish to deal with the points that

have  already  been  dealt with  during  the  merger

debate, but recent developments have thrown new  and

important  light  on this whole  question  of  local

autonomy in the context of Malaysia. But I will  now

skip  that. Sir, and wait for a more opportune  time

to mention them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this only goes to prove that the much boasted

terms,  autonomy  in  labour  and  education   after

Malaysia, is nothing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



but  a  mere  deception,  utterly  meaningless  when

internal  security is in the hands  of  the  Central

Government. We have all along said so, especially on

subjects like education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. after 2½ years in office, because

of its broken promises, its well-known arrogance and

its  dictatorial attitude, has completely  alienated

the  people  who  voted  it  to  power.  Instead  of

rectifying its mistakes, it has chosen instead to go

further  and further away from the people. Evidently

it   thinks  that  its  political  future  lies   in

obtaining  the support of the Federation  Government

against  its  political opponents in  Singapore.  It

knows  that  without Malaysia the P.A.P. merger  may

not  come true, and without merger, it faces certain

defeat at the next general election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps now we can understand why the P.A.P.

appears  to  be  more  enthusiastic  than  even  the

Federation  Government itself in trying to  persuade

the   Borneo  territories  to  accept  the   Tunku's

proposal. It is all part of the P.A.P.'s efforts  to

salvage  its own political future and the future  of

the   P.A.P. leaders.  These  leaders   in   their

desperation have tried to apply the Communist  smear

to  all who dare to voice their protest against  the

present  Malaysia  scheme. Hoping perhaps  to  curry

favour  also with London and Washington, the  P.A.P.

has now become out and out anti-Communist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the bogey of Communism has always been raised

by politicians in power whenever they feel insecure.

Permit  me to quote a passage from a book by Mr  D.

N.  Pritt, Q.C. - a world famous lawyer; whom all  the

underprivileged peoples throughout  the  world  have

great  respect  and  love for, and  whom  the  Prime

Minister  in  his  early days and before  he  became

Prime  Minister, used to be proud to  be  associated

with.  It  is  a  book  called Spies  and  Informers

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- people whom the P.A.P. have implicit trust in. It

is on page 45 and the paragraph reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It has often been the habit of governments not

merely   concentrate  their  propaganda  and   other

manifestations of hostility on whichever section  of

public opinion or activity they think most likely to

bring about the defeat



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



of their policies but also to smear that section of

opinion  and  any  other section that  causes  them

anxiety  with  whatever label may  be  judged  most

likely to prejudice the public.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventy years ago [this book was written in 1958],

the  label  was Radical. Forty years  ago,  it  was

Socialist  or Labour. 1,900 years ago, I  fancy  it

was  Christian. In 1921 and today it was and is Red

or  Communists.  At  any rate, to  the  F.B.I. - this

chapter  refers to the F.B.I. of the United States,

Sir - at  that  moment, it was Red, and in  Singapore

today  the  same  smear  is repeated,  (MaCarthyism

twice over).



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information as

to the author of the book.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Prime Minister was

probably  engaged in conversation. The  author  was

given as Mr Pritt. [Interruption]

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, Communism has become

synonymous  with  effective opposition.  The  Prime

Minister  must still clearly remember that  not  so

very  long  ago  he  himself  was  smeared  a  pro-Communist by the Member for Cairnhill and Chew Swee

Kee [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Did I call you a Communist?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He dare not deny it, Sir. It is

true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir. I

promptly  denied it. It was untrue that I was  pro-Communist. It is untrue now to say that I  did  not

deny it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown must

remember  that if he invites an answer, the  proper

thing for him to do is to allow a Member to get  up

on a point of elucidation and to elucidate. I think

the  Member  for  Cairnhill wishes  to  elucidate.

Perhaps the Member for Queenstown will give way.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> At no time during my period of

him as a pro-Communist in the light of his book.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The whole argument is clinched.

I  do  not have to say anything further. But unlike

his    anti-Communist   friend - the   former   Chief

Minister,  the  Member  for  Cairnhill -   our  Prime

Minister  evidently is thinking  of  higher  stakes

today,  Sir. He is not content to be just  a  local

anti-Communist  leader. He wants  to  be  an  anti-Communist of international repute. That is  why  he

not   only  applies  the  Communist  smear  to  his

opponents  in Singapore but also in the  Federation

and in the Borneo territories as well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We invited them to a forum and

they never turned up.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He flies all over the place

just to call them Communists  - to make sure that his

voice  is heard over the air in Washington  and  in

London   - Washington  especially,  Sir.  Our   Prime

Minister is now therefore even willing to become  a

tool   of  power  politics  in  substituting  anti-Communism  for the spirit of Afro-Asia. Today,  our

Prime  Minister and his P.A.P. colleagues by  their

own doings have become completely isolated from the

socialist   movement  throughout  the   Federation,

Singapore and the Borneo territories.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> But they attended the socialist

front conference.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We were invited.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Today the P.A.P. leaders have

completely  become identified with  the  Right-wing

political  movement in the region. The  people  are

saying, Sir, that wherever the Tunku goes our Prime

Minister is sure to follow.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is why they work so well

together  nowadays, Sir. Knowing  how  arrogant  our

P.A.P. leaders  are, I am sure they  are  not  very

happy  in their present role. They have to dance  to

the  tune  of  the Right-wing political leaders  and

Parties  in order that they may survive. This  is  a

very sorry spectacle for the Prime Minister. He  can

try to laugh it oil and put up a front, hut it is  a

real  climb-down  for  the chest-forward  strutting,

arrogant Prime Minister. It is a real climb-down for

leaders  who  at  one  time could  just  snap  their

fingers  and  others would have to dance.  Sir,  the

P.A.P. leaders have only themselves  to  blame  for

thinking  they can secure their political future  by

obtaining  the protection of reactionary  forces  in

the  region.  Circumstances  have  forced  them   to

collaborate with reactionary political Parties  like

the S.P.A.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I thought you were looking for

their votes at one time.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The point is, today there is

only   talk  of  the  Communist  menace.  Even  this

morning,  we  see  headlines  in  the  papers  about

Communism. For the last few days, we have been given

tit-bits  about  Communist this and Communist  that,

and here now we see this booklet about Communism.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> All written by your adviser.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Why the glee and hopeful

expectancy  of  purges and oppression  of  political

opponents?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remind our Prime Minister that in this very

same  House  on 12th September, 1957, he  said - I  am

afraid  I  do  not  have a copy of the  Hansard -   at

Volume 2, column 2634.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is the trouble when other

chaps write their speeches for them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If I may borrow it, Sir.

Anyway,  I have it written down here and it  can  be

confirmed. The Prime Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We would like to remind the Labour Front

Government  that  democracy and political  stability

cannot  be  brought  about  just  by  periodic  mass

arrests. A government which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



relies  only on purges and has no positive programme

with  which to win over the people to the democratic

cause is doomed to failure.'



<br><br>Let the Prime Minister remember that



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Read it carefully - "only".



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He cannot now safeguard his

political   future  by  political   manouvring   and

constitutional  manipulation  so  as  to   fix   his

political  opponents.  That  will  not  ensure   his

political future. The only way, Sir, is for him  and

his colleagues to return to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He will have to resign first.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was just wondering how all

this ties up with the motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Prime Minister has talked a

lot about Communism and I just want to -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Defend the Communists.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - answer in passing what he has

been  trying  to  tell everybody,  that  we  in  the

Barisan   Sosialis  are  Communists   or,   if   not

Communists, pro-Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway. Sir, I was saying the only sure way for

him  is to return to the people. He must try and re-establish the faith they had in him. The people  put

him  to  power and they can similarly take away  the

power  from him. Those who betray the people's trust

will  only incur the people's wrath. Let them return

to the people. It may not be too late.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. claims to have a mandate for this

White  Paper on merger from the people in  1959.  Be

that as it may, let the P.A.P. twist and turn as  it

likes.  But  as  I have previously  said:  does  the

P.A.P. also  claim  to  have  a  mandate  for  this

Malaysia  proposal? Can they say that this  Malaysia

proposal was on the election platform of the P.A.P.?

No amount of Malaysia Weeks will allow the P.A.P. to

say  that  the  Malaysia scheme  is  part  of  their

election promises. In 1955 the Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>



Minister  challenged  the then Chief  Minister,  the

Member  for Anson, to seek a mandate on the P.P.S.O.

issue.  Now it is an issue that involves  the  lives

and   future   of  all  the  people  of   Singapore.

Therefore, let the Prime Minister seek a new mandate

from the people on this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not need to go further, but let me now

summarise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) it is completely unrealistic for us to talk

about  the  principle of Malaysia out of context  to

what is actually being done and to what is happening

now in the name of Malaysia. It will cause confusion

to  the  people  if we merely discuss the  principle

without   also  considering  the  equally  important

details that give meaning to this principle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In practice this proposed Malaysia to the

people  of Singapore means nothing but the  P.A.P.'s

phoney merger, a set-up in which Singapore -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must remind the hon. Member

that if, by the expression "phoney merger", he means

the  heads of agreement set out in Paper Cmd. 33  of

1961 then he has already been ruled out of order  by

using  the words "phoney merger". That proposal  has

been  accepted by this Assembly. There cannot  be  a

reflection on a vote of this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> My apologies; I forgot about

it,  because  to us the White Paper has been  phoney

all along and that is why it escapes my memory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Sir, in practice, the proposed

Malaysia  to  the people of Singapore means  nothing

but the P.A.P.'s White Paper on merger, a set-up  by

which  Singapore will be merged with the  Federation

without   equal  citizenship  status   and   without

proportional  representation. We, therefore,  oppose

this  motion  just  as we opposed the  P.A.P.  White

Paper  on  merger. Malaysia and P.A.P.'s merger  are

one and the same thing under different names.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) While we will always support the concept of a

Malaysia   based  on  equality,  democracy,   mutual

respect, mutual interests and self-determination,  a

Malaysia which will benefit the peoples of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



region,  we are unequivocally opposed to the present

Malaysia   set-up  which  is  aimed   primarily   at

consolidating the forces of reaction and colonialism

in this region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) It is a scheme that is co-sponsored by

reactionary and colonial forces in our country, and

to  which the P.A.P. is lending support, because its

leaders  believe that it will help  them  to  ensure

their political future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) It is a scheme which will allow the

perpetuation of colonial rule in disguise and  which

will continue to involve our people in the cold  war

conflict between the big powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) It is a scheme aimed at forestalling the

political  progress  of  the peoples  of  Singapore,

Sabah,  Brunei and Sarawak, and so at  isolating  us

from the influence of Afro-Asian nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis do not wish to

have  anything  to  do  with this  British-sponsored

Malaysia scheme.



<br><br>4.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you. Mr Speaker, the

concept  of  Malaysia means the integration  of  the

Federation of Malaya, Singapore and the three  North

Borneo  territories  into  one  nation.  Whether  it

originated  before  or after  the  war,  whether  it

originated  in  imperial  minds  or  whether  it  is

sponsored   by   imperialists,  to   me   it   seems

irrelevant.  But  one  time,  Sir,  my  pathological

antagonism for Communism was such that any idea that

emanated  from  the Communists was to  me  a  danger

signal  and  I  was prepared to reject the  proposal

without consideration. Maturer experience has led me

to   the   conclusion   that   that   approach   was

unreasonable.  And  today, Sir, I  honestly  believe

that  an idea should be considered on its own merits

without  prejudice  as  to  its  source,  and  I  am

prepared    to    give   the   same    dispassionate

consideration to a concept whether it is imperialist-sponsored or whether it is Communist-inspired. I say

that  in  my  view and in the view of  the  Workers'

Party,  the  concept  of  Malaysia  is  tremendously

important and valuable:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to the North Borneo territories themselves,

because   it   will  bring  about  their   immediate

emancipation   from   colonial   rule   and    theft

participation in a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>



wider  and  more meaningful sphere of activity  than

they could otherwise achieve;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to the Federation, because it would

immeasurably  enhance  the  economic  and  political

stature of this nation;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) to Singapore which is and would be the natural

pivot  of  this new nation, by ending  the  cramping

political  and economic remnants of imperialism  and

freeing   our  people  to  participate  in   healthy

national  activities, for today neither side  offers

any alternative to merger except a blank wall. It is

only  the  Workers'  Party that has  an  intelligent

alternative;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) it is of value to South-East Asia by bringing

about  a  broad-based, well-balanced,  multi-racial,

democratic nation  - the crescent of the South Seas  - a

vigorous force of stability in a very vital area  of

the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) And finally, Sir, I believe the concept is of

value to the world because it achieves unity instead

of  fragmentation and offers an example  of  genuine

multi-racial harmony and co-operation on  the  broad

road of human progress through democratic conduct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat, Mr Speaker, the concept of Malaysia is,

to  my  mind, a significant contribution to  healthy

progress to millions in this area. I say this  right

at  the  outset  because  I  have  received  unhappy

reports  about reactions of the Borneo  territories,

and  I  note  the reaction of representatives  of  a

large segment of our own population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My impression, Mr Speaker, is that the Borneo

territories  are,  in fact, in  the  position  of  a

bashful  girl  faced with an arranged marriage,  who

says, "I am too young to marry. Please can I hold on

to  Uncle Selkirk's hands for a few more years?"  It

is a remarkable tribute, Mr Speaker, to the Earl of

Selkirk   that  the  Borneo  territories  and   even

political  Parties  in  Singapore,  other  than  the

Workers' Party, should view him as a protector.  Let

us  face  the  truth.  Let us face  the  facts.  The

presence  of White domination in Asia is  no  longer

appropriate and is abhorrent. The Earl of Selkirk is

not a protector. His very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



presence,   charming  though  he  is  and   carrying

gracefully his many qualities, is an offence to  the

people of Asia as long as it embodies the domination

of a foreign race.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would wish to assure the people of the Borneo

territories  that  we  all in Singapore  believe  in

Malaysia  in all sincerity. I think I heard  rightly

the  Member  for Queenstown himself saying  that  he

accepts in principle the concept of Malaysia. I know

that if we in Singapore were offered the same terms,

Mr Speaker, as the Borneo territories to come in as

a  brother and not as a junior partner, we would all

joyfully  and  unhesitatingly accept. Unfortunately,

however, Singapore is being asked to come  in  as  a

junior  partner - hence our misgivings. This does  not

apply  to the Borneo territories who have a generous

unqualified offer from the Federation "to come in as

our  blood brother". It is not for me, nor is it for

this Assembly, to speak in the name of the people of

the   North  Borneo  territories.  And  I  find   it

difficult  to  understand the Member for  Queenstown

when he objects to the motion on the grounds that it

would  in  some fashion implicate the  North  Borneo

territories. We here are being asked to speak in the

name of Singapore. We have a right to do this, as to

our  feelings about the concept of Malaysia. I  say,

Mr Speaker, it is my genuine hope, although no more

than   a  hope,  that  the  people  of  the  Bornean

territories,   who  should  best  know   their   own

requirements,  will see their way to accepting  this

concept of integration of their territories  into  a

great and stable nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, a statement was made in this House during the debate on West Irian of a character which affects the issue before this House on this motion, and from a person who does not lightly make statements of policy. The Member for Thomson said that the Malaysia plan was anti-Indonesian. This I cannot accept. At that time, I sought clarification

from  the  Member for Thomson in a friendly  spirit,

because,  Mr  Speaker,  I would  like  this  to  be

clearly  understood, as I seek to mislead  none:  in

this instance I find myself at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



variance  with  the Barisan Sosialis.  It  does  not

arise  from any issue of enmity or opposition in  so

far  as  the  Workers' Party's  relations  with  the

Barisan Sosialis are concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have found them courteous, friendly and

sincere.  It  is alleged that they are  a  Communist

front  organisation. For ourselves we have no  means

of   ascertaining  the  truth  of  that   statement,

although, quite frankly. Mr Speaker, we would  very

much like to know the truth. It is not in the spirit

of  political  enmity such as one expects  from  the

Front  Benches towards them that I take  issue  with

the  Barisan  Sosialis, in the name of the  Workers'

Party, unequivocally on the statement of policy that

the Malaysia plan is anti-Indonesia. To say this is,

to my mind, to suggest only one thing - if I am wrong,

I  hope  I  will be corrected - to me, that  statement

could  only mean that the Barisan Sosialis considers

that  the  three territories of North Borneo  should

become part of Indonesia and not part of Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Could I clarify that?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There is no such intention in

those words, Sir,I think the Member for Thomson has

said that there are certain people who have put that

up  as  an  explanation of Malaysia in  relation  to

Indonesia.  We ourselves have never for  one  moment

said  that the North Borneo territories should  ever

belong  to Indonesia. I have also clarified that  in

my speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the words still

remain seared in my mind, and I think they will find

it in the Official Report, that the Malaysia plan is

anti-Indonesia.   How  could   anything   be   anti-Indonesia, quite apart from the possibility - and  the

only  possibility  that arose to  my  mind - that  the

Barisan  Sosialis were under the impression that  we

were  taking from Indonesia territories that  should

ultimately  belong to her. But since that impression

has  been corrected - and I take it, though they  have

not  said so categorically, that they do not suggest

that Indonesia has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



any  right,  moral, legal, economic,  historical  or

otherwise,  to  the  North Borneo territories - I  ask

whether  the  Barisan Sosialis have  considered  the

Indonesian  concept of nationalism and  whether,  in

fact,  the concept of Malaysia is not completely  in

conformity   with   the   Indonesian   concept    of

nationalism. And if it is, then how can it be  anti-Indonesia?  Mr  Speaker,  the  very  core  of   the

Indonesian concept of nationalism is that what was a

unity  under  colonial rule should  be  a  unity  in

independence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am not speaking, Mr Speaker,

without  authority, and I would like to  quote  that

authority  so  that  there  should  be  no   further

repetition  of what could become a very  mischievous

concept in this area. I quote from a document  which

the  Indonesian  Consul-General was good  enough  to

send  to  me  only  recently called  "West  Irian - an

essential   part  of  Indonesia"   issued   by   the

Indonesian  Army  Information  Service   dated   1st

November, 1961, about two months ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 6:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Indonesian unity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wave of nationalism is not founded on

similarity of language or similarity of religion  or

similarity of race. What has been the binding  force

of  unity  in  nationalism is  the  common  colonial

past.'



<br><br>Then,   Mr   Speaker,  this  document  quotes   the

representative of the Republic of Indonesia  to  the

United  Nations  Organisation,  Dr  Surjarwo,  when

speaking before the Ninth General Assembly. I  would

like to follow his words. They are not long, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`For many decades, indeed, when Indonesia was

still  the  Dutch  colony known as  the  Dutch  East

Indies,   Indonesia  fought  for  its  freedom   and

independence.  It  fought to be free  from  colonial

domination. It fought for transfer of the Dutch East

Indies  from  colonial status to  that  of  a  free,

independent   national  state  of   Indonesia.   The

boundaries of the state can, therefore, only be  the

boundaries of the former Dutch East Indies,  neither

more nor less.'



<br><br>Notice that - "neither more nor less".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Our national movement for independence, the

national   movement   of  the   Indonesian   people,

consequently and naturally concerned itself with the

freedom of what was then the Dutch East Indies,  the

freedom of the country in which they lived.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



And finally, Sir, a very short paragraph that spells

out  the  Indonesian official approach and  official

policy towards North Borneo.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If all the statements quoted above have been

fully  understood,  it  can be  understood  why  the

Indonesian  people have no thought at  all  nor  any

desire  for  other territories close  to  Indonesia,

like  North Borneo, the eastern part of Timor Island

or  the  eastern part of New Guinea which never  has

been   part   of  the  former  Dutch   East   Indies

territory.'



<br><br>That  is a very instructive booklet, Sir, and I will

be tabling it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore ask this House to notice that in the

words of this official document and in the words  of

the Indonesian representative to the United Nations,

the  Indonesian  Government seeks neither  more  nor

less  than  the boundaries of the former Dutch  East

Indies.  No more. The North Borneo territories  were

never  part of the Dutch East Indies. And  again  no

desire for other territories close to Indonesia like

North Borneo. You see, Mr Speaker, on the basis  of

the  political  philosophy of the Indonesian  people

and  Government,  unity  of colonial  administration

makes  for  unity in nationalism. The  North  Borneo

territories, the Federation of Malaya and  Singapore

were  all  a unity under the colonial administration

of  the British Colonial Office. On that basis,  the

basis of the Indonesian concept of nationalism,  all

these territories then form a single nation. How can

it  then  be  said from any angle that the  Malaysia

concept  is  anti-Indonesia? I trust the Member  for

Thomson, who will be speaking no doubt, will clarify

that position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as the Prime Minister has interjected - sometimes he indulges in interjections of a useful character - he has pointed out that the Communist Party of Indonesia is against the Malaysia concept. In fact, you will find in today's Straits Times a very interesting and factual article on the subject. I think we ought to know, Mr Speaker,

whether this concept that the Malaysia plan is anti-Indonesia  is  part of the Barisan Sosialis  policy,

because, and I say this as one friendly to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



Barisan  Sosialis, as one convinced of the sincerity

of  many of its people, and I do not laugh and in no

spirit  of  derision or sarcasm  that  I  make  this

statement, I say that if that is their policy,  then

it  is  not  a  policy based, on the wishes  or  the

interest of the people of Singapore. And it can only

he inspired from totally foreign sources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It is almost overcoming to hear

words of approval from the Government Front Benches.

Mr  Speaker, however, in so far as this  motion  is

concerned,  in order to ascertain the  plan  therein

referred to, it seeks support in principle  for  the

plan   proposed  by  the  Prime  Minister   of   the

Federation   and   agreed  to  by   the   Federation

Parliament, I have to inform the House that  I  have

repeatedly since November sought from the Federation

the   official   transcript  and  report   of   what

transpired in Parliament, and I regret to inform the

House that I am officially advised that the official

reports  are  not  yet in print. Mr  Speaker,  that

being the case, I have to fall back upon the Straits

Tunes  and  I ask you, Mr Speaker, to look  at  the

Straits  Times of the 17th October, 1961.  There  on

page  8,  in  a  prominent part, we find  the  Prime

Minister's motion, if I might read it:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this House agreeing in principle with the

concept of Malaysia comprising the eleven States  of

the  Federation, the States of Singapore and  Brunei

and  the  territories of North Borneo  and  Sarawak,

endorses  the  Government's  initiative  in   taking

action  for  its realisation the progress  of  which

will be reported to the House by the Honourable  the

Prime Minister from time to time.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  I think you will agree with  me  that there  is not one word of any plan there. It  refers

to   the   concept   of   Malaysia,   approves   the

Government's  initiative,  that  is  to   say,   for

starting the ball rolling, and notes that the  Prime

Minister  will  be reporting to the House.  Not  one

word about any plan at all either in this motion  or

any  agreement, Mr Speaker, by the House on a plan!

I  would  say,  Mr  Speaker, that  this  motion  is

misleading  in that it speaks of a plan proposed  by

the Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



Minister and a plan agreed in principle On the  18th

of  October.  Mr Speaker, in order  to  bring  this

motion  in line with reality, I would like  to  move

that  the word "this" in the first line be left  out

and there to insert the word "the"; to leave out the

word  "plan" in line 4 and there to insert the  word

"motion",  and to leave out the words "in principle"

in line 6.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, the change of the word

"this" to "the" in the first line is merely to  tidy

it  up,  because  there  is  no  reference  back  to

anything,  this  motion  standing  by  itself.   The

important amendment there is to leave out  the  word

"plan"  and  there to substitute the word  "motion",

and  I  shall come to that and the reasons for  that

amendment. Finally, Sir, to leave out the words  "in

principle", because though the Federation can  agree

in  principle to a plan - if in fact I am  tight  that

there was no plan - then it did not agree in principle

to  the motion. It agrees to the motion proper.  Mr

Speaker,  the main object of this amendment  is,  in

fact,  to substitute the word "motion" for the  word

"plan." I had originally thought of deleting all the

words  there and just substituting for the Malaysian

concept comprising the following territories, but it

seems  to me, Sir, that it would be churlish on  the

part  of this House not to give recognition  to  the

fact that it is the Initiative o, the Prime Minister

of  the  Federation  to which we  are  indebted  for

having  made or put on the road of realisation  this

valuable concept which has been in cold storage  for

so long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that the Barisan Sosialis as well

as other Members should be able to accept the motion

in  its present form, Mr Speaker, because it  seeks

support for the motion of the Prime Minister of  the

Federation which merely agreed in principle with the

concept of Malaysia comprising the 11 States of  the

Federation, Singapore, Brunei and the territories of

North Borneo and Sarawak.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I cannot see that anybody could possibly quarrel with the principle enunciated by the Federation Prime Minister. Let me say unequivocally that we disagree with the details if the White Paper proposals are part of the details - and they seem to be part of the details - of the working out of this plan in principle. The

Workers' Party is against the proposals in the White

Paper  because  they are not based on equality.  But

there is nothing in the motion of the Prime Minister

of  the  Federation which in any  way  suggests  any

limitation to the basic principle of integration  of

all  these  territories as equal States  with  equal

rights and responsibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is on this basis that I support and move

my  amendments and I trust the Government Benches as

well as the other Parties of the Opposition will all

get  together  on the principle -  it  is  a  valuable

principle;  it  is  an important principle.  Let  us

enunciate at least our firm beliefs. The Member  for

Queenstown  has said, "I believe in the  concept  of

Malaysia,  but you cannot discuss it except  in  the

context  of  the practical aspects in- which  it  is

worked  out." I say with respect to the  Member  for

Queenstown, the leader of the major political  Party

in the Opposition, that that is not so. I approve of

the  principle  of merger. E do not approve  of  the

White  Paper. I approve of the concept  of  Malaysia

wholeheartedly.  If and when we arc  presented  with

the  White Paper which embodies unacceptable aspects

for  the  integration of these territories, then  we

can  take objection to those aspects and even  vote,

if necessary, against the whole plan of realisation.

But  now  with the word "plan" removed and the  word

"motion"  substituted, it is my  earnest  hope  that

this  House, which has shown itself capable  of  two

unanimous motions, will do a hat-trick and go on  to

the third and most important motion of all, a motion

that  affects  us and our future, that  we  can  all

agree  on  the enunciation of the principle  of  the

Malaysian  concept,  the integration  of  all  these

territories in equality in a united nation.

a  united  Malayan nation, enlarged and strengthened

<br><br>The  Question is, "That the word `this' proposed  to

be left out, be left out."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that meets with agreement, we could deal with

the  first  amendment  first, ft  seems  to  be  an

amendment which is typographical more than  anything

else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I have some indication from the Government

Benches whether that is acceptable?



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Sir,

follows,  Members could range over the amendment  to

leave  out  the words "in principle" in line  6.  It

seems  to  me  that  that amendment  could  well  be

debated  at  the  same time as the main  motion.  If

there  is no dissenting voice, I would suggest  that

the   debate  proceed  not  only  on  the   Original

Question,  but also on the two amendments,  so  that

the  questions on the amendments will be put at  the

end  of the debate. The only person affected is  the

Member  for  Queenstown. If he wishes  to  speak  on

those  amendments, I am sure the House  will  permit

him  to  do so. If there is no dissenting  voice,  I

propose that we proceed on those lines. There is  no

dissenting voice.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

nobody  in  his right frame of mind could object  to

the  concept of Malaysia - a concept which will  bring

the territories of the present Federation of Malaya,

Singapore, Sabah, Sarawak and Brunei together into a

bigger single political and economic unit and  which

will  provide for the 10 million inhabitants of this

new  country wider opportunities for both  political

and economic advancement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not worry ourselves how

the concept of Malaysia came into being. Some people

say  that if Malaysia comes into being it will  save

the  P.A.P. Government from destruction; some people

claim  it  will save particularly the Prime Minister

from political eclipse. Whether this is so or not we

are  not  worried about it. Some people have claimed

that  after  the  Hong  Lim by-election,  the  Prime

Minister  of  Singapore  managed  to  convince   the

Federation Government that for its own security  and

in  its  own  interest, it must do  something  about

Singapore.  But  the  Federation  Government,  being

worried  about the racial composition of Singapore's

inhabitants, would not take in Singapore unless they

could take in the Borneo territories as well.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these allegations could be true

or  could not be true. But as socialists we are  not

worried about whether these allegations are true  or

not  true. As socialists we feel that with a  single

and   bigger   political  entity  there   are   more

opportunities for the advancement, both  politically

and  economically, of the people of all the regions.

After  all,  all the people living in these  regions

have  a lot in common, not only in that they inherit

a  common British colonial administrative past,  but

also  in  that  the races which comprise  the  three

Borneo  territories  are the same  except  for  some

slight qualification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are many advantages

concerned  with  Malaysia. But people  in  Singapore

should be allowed, for instance, to go to the Borneo

territories  either  to get jobs  or, if  they  are

businessmen,  to  go and establish  business  there.

People in Singapore should also be allowed to go  to

the  Federation in order to get jobs  and  do  other

things;  and  people  from other territories  should

also be allowed to come to Singapore. There must  be

free  travel in Malaysia. The education institutions

and  other  opportunities for education in Singapore

can  be  open  to students and people of  the  other

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we support the concept of

Malaysia, but as the Member for Anson has  said,  we

do  not agree with the detailed plan on Malaysia  as

announced by the Federation Government. According to

the  plan, Singapore would come in as a partner  and

not   as  an  equal  State  like  the  three  Borneo

territories. According to the plan, there  would  be

no  freedom  of  travel between  Singapore  and  the

Borneo  territories  or  the Federation  of  Malaya.

According to the plan, there would be no one  single

citizenship for all the inhabitants of this island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we believe that in a real

Malaysia  which comprises the 10 million inhabitants

of  the five territories, there should be one common

citizenship  - a Malaysia citizenship - which should  be

given to all the people who pledge their loyalty and

allegiance to this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>



country.  Mr Speaker, Sir, this concept of Malaysia

is  incompatible with the merger plans as  announced

in the White Paper, because, according to the merger

plan  as pronounced in the White Paper, there  would

be  two types of citizenship  - one for Singapore  and

one  for the Federation of Malaya. And from what  we

have  gathered,  the Federation of  Malaya  and  the

Borneo territories will have one common citizenship.

According  to  plans which have been announced  from

time  to  time, Mr Speaker, Sir, in Malaysia  there

would be two types of citizenship and there would be

three  nations.  The  three  nations  would  be  the

Federation of Malaya, Singapore and the three Borneo

territories. There would be two types of citizenship

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- a Federal citizenship and a Singapore citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> And the Malaysia nationality?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> One nation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to

the  Minister for Culture, Commonwealth citizenship,

which  was  a  concept to bring the peoples  of  the

Commonwealth  together, did  not  bring  the  people

together,  as  the  concept of Malaysia  nationality

could  not  bring  the people of Malaysia  together.

Although the people of the Federation of Malaya also

are Commonwealth citizens, what have they in common,

for  instance, with Australia, which forbids Malayan

citizens   to   live   there,  although   both   are

Commonwealth citizens? Mr Speaker, Sir, it is  only

in  a common citizenship for all the people in these

territories  that we would be able to build  a  real

Malaysia  whereby  everybody would  share  a  common

political destiny.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there must be free travel for

all  the people in Malaysia. According to the  plan,

there would be restrictions on travel. People coming

to  Singapore, people from Singapore  going  to  the

Federation or Borneo are restricted, and this is not

conducive  to  building a strong Malaysia.  We  have

seen the advantages, Mr Speaker, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



of  the  European Common Market, where  people  from

each  country can go to the other country.  Although

the European Common Market is not a single political

entity,  yet it is a common economic entity and  the

people are free to travel. This has in the past  few

years  enhanced the economic prestige  and  economic

potentialities  of  the respective  countries  which

comprise  the  European Common Market. Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  we  understand that in the plan  for  Malaysia

there  would  be  no  common  market.  I  hope   the

Government  would clarify whether there would  be  a

common market for all the territories which comprise

Malaysia,   and   whether  the  people   from   each

respective  region  can  travel  freely   to   other

regions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not for the Members of this

Assembly  to  say whether the people in  the  Borneo

territories want Malaysia or not. It is  up  to  the

political  leaders in these territories to  say,  on

behalf  of their people, whether they want  Malaysia

or  not.  A  strong Malaysia could be  an  important

factor in the politics of this region and we believe

that  if  a  strong  Malaysia is  not  committed  to

S.E.A.T.O. or any of the power blocs,  it  will  be

good for all the people in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we support the amendment moved by

the  Member for Anson because we support the concept

of  Malaysia  although we disagree with the  details

pronounced from time to tune on Malaysia.

Sir,  it  is  expected  that  this  motion  will  be

vociferously  opposed  by  Members  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  because  we all know  how  pig-headed  the

Dutch  colonialists were in regard to West Irian   - a

motion  on  which we discussed yesterday.  Similarly

the pig-headedness of the Barisan Sosialis in regard

to   their  attitude  towards  this  motion  on  the

Federation of Malaysia.

<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not surprising because all the points put

forward  by the Barisan Sosialis clearly show  their

true  colours  and attitude. It is  clear  that  the

points  put forward seem to represent the  views  of

the  Bornean people. Why was it that Members of  the

Barisan Sosialis did not quote the statements issued

by other political Parties? There are many political

Parties in Borneo and Sarawak. Perhaps it is because

they  are fraternizing with their friends in  Borneo

with whom they are in sympathy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I go further on

this  motion  or reply to the points raised  by  the

Members of the Barisan Sosialis, first let me recall

the   history   of  our  fatherland.  The   original

inhabitants  of  the Malayan Archipelago  came  from

Indo-China about 2,000 years ago. They migrated into

the Malayan Archipelago in large numbers. Before the

advent  of Western colonialism, there was already  a

nation in the Malayan Archipelago and, as God willed

it,  Western colonialists came and subjugated  these

people    for    centuries.   Western    colonialism

established a strangle-hold on the people until  the

outbreak of World War II. Three colonial powers were

still   dominating  the  Malayan  Archipelago:   the

Americans   in   the  Philippines,  the   Dutch   in

Indonesia,  and  the British in  the  Federation  of

Malaya,   Singapore  and  the  Borneo   territories.

Indonesia  showed  its strength  by  ejecting  Dutch

colonialism by the use of force except,  of  course,

that the question of Irian Barat still remains to be

solved.    The   Philippines   also    showed    its

determination   - of  course,  it  was  not  Communist

determination  - in their struggle for freedom and the

Americans were forced to grant freedom to the people

of  the Philippines. Similarly in the Federation  of

Malaya,  the  British Government  immediately  after

World  War  II tried to introduce the Malayan  Union

which  was strongly opposed. They had no alternative

but to grant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



freedom to the Federation of Malaya. Singapore  was,

granted  the, right of self-government according  to

the  Constitution. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,  if  the

Indonesian  people were prepared  to  declare  their

independence    and    the   Philippines    achieved

independence, then it is the duty of the  people  of

the  Federation of Malaya, Singapore and the  Borneo

territories to remove British colonialism from  this

region.  The map of the Malayan Archipelago  showing

territories  belonging  to the  British,  Dutch  and

American colonialists will be deleted. Only colonial

puppets   and  colonial  stooges  are  prepared   to

tolerate colonial domination and to fraternise  with

their  colonial masters. They refuse to  join  hands

with  their  brethren in an independent State.  They

are  merely  satisfied  with  the  status  of  self-government  which is the objective  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier on, the Dutch have adopted a pig-headed attitude towards West Irian by wanting to

give  self-determination to  the  Papuan  people  in

order to perpetuate Dutch colonialism in West Irian.

The  Barisan Sosialis in Singapore are no  different

from  the  Dutch. They make use of a few people  who

are  afraid  of internal security. It is  these  few

people  whom  they  claim to represent  the  masses.

Surely  their  voice is not the  voice  of  all  the

people of Singapore. Is it suggested that the P.A.P.

Government  which  has  moved  this  motion  is  not

representative  of the people? We can  likewise  ask

the  Barisan  Sosialis whether  they  represent  the

people.  If they are not satisfied, then we  can  go

back  to the country. If they are elected, then they

can  claim that they have been, in fact, elected  by

the  people under the star of the Barisan  Sosialis.

It  is  just  like  a cock which crows   - as  I  said

yesterday  - which has no meaning whatsoever.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Original Question was as appears

in  item  1  on  the  Order Paper.  Since  which  an

amendment has been moved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out "plan' in line 4 and there to insert

"motion'.



<br><br>The  Question is, "That the word proposed to be left

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been indicated, the debate may range over

the next amendment, which is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave oat "in principle" in line 6.



<br><br>As  further  agreed by the Assembly, the debate  may

proposed  amendments. I have caused to be circulated

the  motion  which was agreed to  by  the  House  of

Representatives in the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I said

earlier that if we are of the opinion that the Dutch

in  West  Irian are stone-headed in their  attitude,

then  in  Singapore too such an attitude  is  to  be

found  among the Barisan Sosialis. In the course  of

his  speech, the leader of the Barisan Sosialis, the

Member  for Queenstown, said that Malaysia will  not

bring about prosperity, justice and equality to  the

peoples  of  Singapore, Brunei and the North  Borneo

territories. I am really surprised. Mr Speaker. Who

are  these  "peoples"? It is only the pro-Communists

who feel -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Chair has been

certainly intimidated. I ask the Member not to raise

his voice in that manner. He can raise his voice  in

any  other  manner,  but pointing  at  the  opposite

Benches   and  raising  his  voice  is  intimidating - intimidating  not only the Chair but,  I  am  sure,

some of the Opposition Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Yaacob (In Malay): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

no  intention  to  intimidate you, especially  on  a

matter as important as this. In confronting a matter

of   this   magnitude,  I  would   not   resort   to

intimidation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said just now, it is only the people who are

pro-Communists,  Communist stooges,  or  open  front

cadres of the Communists who feel that in the future

Malaysia  they  will not find happiness,  prosperity

and  justice. This is clear. If they are imbued with

a  nationalist stand, then they will  have  no  fear

whatever, and it is even more so if they believe  in

parliamentary democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the arguments they put forward is their

analysis - the question of communalism in the  future

Malaysia.  The  Member  for  Queenstown  said   that

earlier  the  Federation of Malaya did not  wish  to

merge  with Singapore because it feared the  Chinese

majority  in Singapore. But with the integration  of

the  Borneo  territories, i.e. Brunei, Sarawak,  and

North  Borneo,  the number of votes  of  the  Malays

would be more than that of the Chinese  - and that  is

the   reason  why  Malaysia  is  proposed   by   the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also alleged that we base Malaysia on

communalism and not on nationalism. I believe it  is

too  clear that  - I had my doubts before, but now  it

is  clear to me - if we can tell the sex of  fish  in

the  water,  we can even more easily tell  what  the

attitude of the Barisan Sosialis is. I would like to

ask the Barisan Sosialis: who are the people who are

against the concept of Malaysia, and which Party  is

against  the concept of Malaysia? I have no wish  to

dwell  at  length on this matter of  the  people  of

Borneo.  I  have  no wish either to  speak  for  the

people of the Federation of Malaya. But I would like

to   voice  my  opinion  concerning  the  people  of

Singapore. Who are the people who oppose Malaysia? I

say  it  is  not  a  matter  of  communalism.  If  a

referendum is to be instituted and carried out on  a

racial   basis  between  the  Chinese,  Indian   and

Eurasian people, I say the Chinese will support  the

concept of Malaysia. I am confident that 99 per cent

of the Indians, with the exception of the Member for

Thomson  and a few others, will accept it.  And  the

majority  of the Chinese, if they are not misled  by

people  who play on racialism, will accept  it  too.

The talk that is going on in the coffee-shops

<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, as I said

just  now, there is no nationalist fighter in Malaya

who  wishes to bring about a nation in which  he  is

not loyal to his country. None of them will bear out

what  the  Barisan Sosialis have said. In conformity

with  your advice, I will try to suppress my temper.

I  was not intimidating, Sir; it is just that it  is

my  natural way of debating. If we want to  be  good

leaders,  we  should not only see one  side  of  the

matter. If we are to be good drivers, and if we look

only  to the left, it is possible that we might meet

with a collision. And if we only keep looking to the

right,  that too might lead to a collision. What  we

must do is to look to the right, to the left, and to

the  front,  and  at times it is important  that  we

glance at the rear-view mirror to see what is  going

on  at the back. Only by this means will we be  able

to proceed on our way with safety.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of Malaysia is accepted by all Parties

in  Singapore -  100 per cent by the Malays, and  more

than  70  per  cent by the Chinese if they  are  not

misled  by  the  Barisan  Sosialis  which  harps  on

communal  lines.  Likewise, the  Indians  and  other

races. Therefore, if any concept is accepted by  the

majority of the various races, it is clear that this

concept is a very good one and would conform to  the

desires and intentions of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis say that this concept is

opposed  by  the people. What do they mean  by  "the

people"?  If  this Malaysian concept is  opposed  by

members  of  the Barisan Sosialis, I would  like  to

pose  a question to them: which concept are they  in

favour  of,  and what kind of concept do they  stand

for?  Let  them say it clearly. Is it a  concept  of

joining  up  with the Philippines, or  Thailand,  or

Taiwan, on Indonesia? Let us know. In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



the   Federation  Parliament,  they   have   already

accepted in principle this concept of Malaysia,  the

details  of  which  are  to  be  clarified  to   the

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stand of the Barisan Sosialis is the same as

if to say this: we oppose the marriage because we do

not  know  what kind of child would be  begotten  of

that  marriage. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is  only  after

the  marriage that the child would be begotten.  But

what  they  are worried about is whether  the  child

would  be  a  boy or a girl. First of  all,  I  say,

decide  on the concept, whether or not you  wish  to

continue  with  the marriage and keep  the  marriage

going.  Then  it is only when the child is  begotten

that  we  decide on its name and how  it  is  to  be

brought up. We should not bother ourselves with what

the child is going to be even before we consider the

proposal  of  marriage. In considering a nationalist

issue of this nature, we must consider this from the

party  stand. This is very important.  If  they  can

forget the political ideology which they believe  in

on a nationalist issue such as this, then I feel the

matter  could be resolved well. The reason  is  that

the  leader of the Barisan Sosialis, the Member  for

Queenstown, has stated that Malaysia is only for the

benefit  of  the reactionary elements.  But  if  Mr

Seenivasagam or Mr Lim Kean Siew was the leader  of

the Federation of Malaya at the moment, would he say

so?  So  I  say their sentiment is a party political

sentiment.  They are merely voicing  the  ideologies

which they believe in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another question now arises.

They  say  the  British are behind this  concept  of

Malaysia. This is the same as saying that any nation

that gets independence from colonialism, whether  it

is from British colonialism or whoever it may be, is

to  be considered as false and phoney. Is that their

stand?  If that is their stand, then it is the  same

as saying that India, Ceylon and Burma have achieved

their  independence from the British without  having

to resort to force of arms. Do they mean to say that

those  independent  countries  which  have  achieved

their independence is a phoney kind of independence?

The  stand  of  the Barisan Sosia1is  is  clear  for

everyone  to  see. They go so far  as  to  say  that

whoever has received independence from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



British - be  it India, Ceylon, Burma or Pakistan - are

puppets of the British. They dare not say so  openly

in  regard  to  those countries. But,  according  to

them,  whoever has received independence by peaceful

means  are the tools of the British, who are  behind

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been alleged before that

the  independence of the Federation of Malaya  is  a

phoney  independence. I believe, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

that  the  Reds  especially have  alleged  that  the

independence  is a phoney one. The  question  to  be

considered  is that independence has to be  achieved

first  of all. How is it that we should bother about

the  ownership of the house before it becomes  ours?

It is after we have occupied it that we could set it

in order. Is the constitution of the future Malaysia

going   to   be   one  that  will  not   adhere   to

parliamentary democracy? If it is not to be so, then

the  representatives of the people  elected  by  the

people  are the people who should set right whatever

is  wrong.  I do not know whether these people  fear

that  on  the coming into being of Malaysia, members

of  the open front Communist organisation would  not

have a chance to be active in Parliament. They would

have no opportunity to subvert the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, Mr Speaker, Sir, we are glad

that  in discussing the concept of Malaysia, Members

of  the  Barisan  Sosialis have mentioned  the  good

relationship of the Federation of Malaya.  Singapore

and  Indonesia. I say clearly that there  is  not  a

single  nationalist movement in Indonesia  which  is

against this concept of Malaysia. We have heard  the

views  of  the  Foreign Minister of  Indonesia,  Mr

Roslan Abdul Ghani, on this concept of Malaysia.  As

has  been  stated by the Member for Anson, Indonesia

has  no wish to take in the Borneo territories.  The

Barisan  Sosialis  merely  are  trying  to  sour  up

relations between Singapore and Indonesia. There was

only  one  party, Mr Speaker, Sir,  which  is  dead

against  the  concept  of  Malaysia.  That  is   the

Communist Party of Indonesia led by Aidit.  So,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, there is no need to hide behind  their

cloak.  The corpse of the elephant cannot be covered

by a tray. Whoever is against



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



the concept of Malaysia is indeed pro-communist.  In

Indonesia  itself there is not a single  nationalist

movement  which is against the concept of  Malaysia,

except, of course, the Communist Party of Indonesia.

It is said that the P. M. I. P, of Malaya is against

the concept of Malaysia. But what they actually want

is  a  Melayu Raya, which is greater in extent  than

what  is  being proposed. This particular  Patty  is

already  a  communal  Party. What  they  want  is  a

concept  of Malaysia which embraces a wider area  of

Malaysia than what is being proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in discussing this nationalist

proposal,  we  must sink our political  differences.

Let us not bring up communalism which can damage the

solidarity  of the people in their march forward  to

bring about a nation which has undivided loyalty. We

should remember that we are Malayans for Malaya  and

in the interest of our motherland.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to say,

on behalf of the Alliance, that we accept the motion

as amended by the Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, a lot of hard things have

been  said by the leader of the Barisan Sosialis  in

regard  to this very important motion which concerns

the  Malaysian territory getting away  from  British

colonial control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as far back as November 1960, when the S P.A.

knew  that  merger  with  the  Federation  was   not

possible because of, may I now be so bold as to say,

the Communist content in the P.A.P., we thought that

there   must   be  another  step  forward   in   our

constitutional advance, and since merger was  closed

to  us  as  a result of the coming to power  of  the

P.A.P.  Government, the S.P.A. in 1960 said,  and  I

would like to quote from its paper of November 1960:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore's political future



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merger road closed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last general elections the S.P.A.

advocated  merger with the Federation of Malaya  and

we firmly believe that had we been returned to power

we would have achieved our objective during our term

of  office.  But this road to independence  has  now

been closed by the folly of the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other avenues



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the S.P.A. does not believe that because

this  road has been closed we should cease  to  look

for  other avenues for independence. We believe that

owing  to  the  changed  political  conditions   now

prevailing,  it  is unrealistic to  try  to  seek  a

merger  with the Federation. We should readjust  our

political  thinking on the question of how Singapore

should achieve its independence. We believe that  we

can  best achieve our objective of independence  for

Singapore  by  advocating  a  political   union   of

Malaysian States. Firstly, Singapore would join  the

Federation  of  Malaya  and  later  with  any  other

neighbouring territories willing to come  into  this

political union which would become a virile union of

sovereign States within the Commonwealth.'



<br><br>That was in November 1960. I can say here that as  a

result  of  that statement of policy,  I  have  been

having  discussions with the Tunku on the future  of

the  relationship of Singapore with the  Federation,

and also the Bornean territories. There was a number

of  friendly discussions and I was glad that on 27th

of  May, at a foreign correspondents' luncheon,  the

Tunku  for  the  first time gave a  talk  on  closer

relationship  between Singapore and  the  Federation

and  on  a greater Malaysia. Since then, the  P.A.P.

has  been cashing in on that and has done their best

to  work towards the realisation of that plan. It is

not  for me to say here whether the P.A.P. has  done

it  with  a  political motive or in  order  to  save

themselves from extinction. But suffice to say  that

there  has  been  a greater cry of merger  with  the

Federation  and a greater Malaysia. Sir, there  have

been talks in the Bornean territories themselves and

there have been a lot of statements coming out  from

leaders  in  those territories, some  for  and  some

against.  But with the appointment of a  Commission,

the  leaders in the territories and the people there

can  voice their views before the Commission and the

Commission will be in a position to assess the views

of the people of the Bornean territories and give  a

report.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Barisan Sosialis leader to say that the

Commission will be appointed there just to carry out

the   wishes  of  the  two  Governments  which  have

appointed   them,  that  is  to  say,  the   British

Government and the Federation Government, is a grave

distortion  of  facts  and  a  reflection   on   the

integrity of this Commission. No doubt there  was  a

lot of misgivings and a lot of discussions as to who

should be the Chairman. Tunku Abdul Rahman, being  a

forthright and frank man, always likes to  say  his

views in public and does not beat about the bush. He

game  out straight with a statement that unless they

have  a  Chairman who is knowledgeable in the matter

and  who  will  lead the Commission and  investigate

impartially,  the  Commission  may  fail.  One  must

remember  this and, in regard to this, I would  like

to  tell the Barisan Sosialis that there has been  a

lot  of  talk coming out of the Bornean territories.

The   people  there  say  that  while  the   British

Government say one thing and agree with Tunku  Abdul

Rahman  on  the desirability of a Greater  Malaysia,

the  Government  officials in these territories  are

doing their best to dampen the people's desire for a

Greater  Malaysia. Therefore, it is to  be  expected

that  whoever becomes the Chairman of the Commission

should be one who is known to be impartial and  will

be  impartial. I can say that Lord Cobbold, who  has

now  been appointed the Chairman of this Commission,

is  a very impartial man. He will be able to inquire

into  the  feelings  of the people  in  the  Bornean

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all the meetings of this Commission will

surely  be  made public. There will be no cloak  and

dagger  meetings.  I  am sure the  meetings  of  the

Commission  will be open to the public.  There  will

also  be  Press reports. Not only the newspapers  in

Malaya  will  be interested, but I think  newspapers

throughout the world will also be interested in  the

investigations  of  this Commission  of  Inquiry.  I

would  ask the Barisan Sosialis not to stick to  the

wrong idea that this Commission is there to do  what

it  is instructed to do. What it is instructed to do

is  to  inquire from the people whether or not  they

are in favour of Malaysia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know what the findings of this

Commission   will  be,  but  there  has   been   an

indication that more and more people in the  Bornean

territories  are  alive to the thrill  of  Malaysia.

They  want to be free of British control. But  while

they  want  to be free, they too want to be  assured

that they will be able to carry on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while on this subject of Malaysia, which

includes  closer relationship between Singapore  and

the  Federation of Malaya, I would like to touch  on

Press  reports a few days ago reporting a  statement

alleged  to  have been made by the Chairman  of  the

P.A.P.,  the Deputy Prime Minister, that the  P.A.P.

was  trying  to  claim credit for achieving  merger.

That,  I think, is wrong. The P.A.P. did admit  even

as  far back as May 1961, that prospects of a merger

were  quite dim. But because of a change of attitude

in  the mind of Tunku Abdul Rahman, who felt that it

would  be  better to have a Malaysia to ensure  that

the  political and economic future of the people  in

this  area,  who were closely connected  during  the

British  regime,  should  come  together  under  one

political unit, it was then that the P.A.P. came in.

Because   they  are  the  government  of  the   day,

discussions  have  to  be  held  with   the   P.A.P.

Government. I would ask the P.A.P. Government not to

try to claim political credit for anything that they

have not done. To be more correct, it was because of

the  presence  of  the  P.A.P. Government  that  the

relationship  with the Federation was  bad  for  the

past  two years. It is only until recently  - it might

be  because of the realisation of the error of their

ways  and  the  parting of company of the  Communist

group  in the Party - that there has been a change  in

the attitude of the Federation Government. That I do

not  know.  The  P.A.P.  Government  ought  to  know

better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the leader of the Barisan Sosialis brought in

these communal fears. He suggested that because  the

Malays feared the Chinese in Singapore, that was why

the  Federation Government wanted to  bring  in  the

Bornean  territories in order to balance the  number

of  the Chinese population in the whole of Malaysia.

Sir, it cannot be denied that in the Federation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



of   Malaya.  Tunku  Abdul  Rahman  has  been   very

realistic  in  his approach to the problems  of  the

country.  He has at no time in his office  as  Prime

Minister  of the Federation done anything  that  has

been  against the Chinese. He has been treating  the

races  fairly  and squarely. Yet the leader  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis  has the temerity  to  infer  that

Tunku  Abdul Rahman would be wanting to do something

against the Chinese because he fears the Chinese. In

this particular case, it would seem that the Barisan

Sosialis  are very keen to look after the  interests

of  the  Chinese  in Malaya. The P.A.P. accuse  the

Barisan Sosialis of being Chinese chauvinists. I  do

not know whether this is a fact or not a fact. But I

find  it  difficult  to  believe  they  are  Chinese

chauvinists if they are prepared to come out on  the

West  Irian  issue  and support President  Soekarno,

whose  policy in regard to the Chinese in  Indonesia

is  well  known. They cannot be Chinese chauvinists.

In  one  case, we have a man here in Malaya who  has

done  his best and has even staked his own political

future  and integrity and said that all races  shall

come  together  and live together as one  big  happy

family. Yet that man is attacked. In the other case,

they  had a very big portrait of their great  leader

at their great mass rally in Geylang Serai.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the concept of Malaysia - it is inevitable that

Malaysia  will arise. We  - the Federation, Singapore,

Borneo,  Sarawak  and  Brunei - have  been  under  one

colonial  master  and because there  has  been  this

desire  on the part of tile British Colonial  Office

to  retain their territories for as long as they can

reasonably hold on to them, they have therefore  not

allowed   the   Bornean   territories   to   develop

politically  at the same pace as Singapore  and  the

Federation of Malaya. We are much ahead in so far as

political  evolution  goes.  But  for  the   Barisan

Sosialis  to suggest that Malaysia should await  the

self-determination of the Bornean territories is  to

say that the British colonial masters can remain  in

Borneo for the next 10 or 15 years. Singapore, after

the  war, started with this political evolution.  It

was only in 1948



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



that elections were held. From 1959, II years after,

we  have internal self-government. Now we are  going

ahead   for  independence  with  merger   with   the

Federation,  and  yet the Barisan  Sosialis  do  not

quite like the idea. They do not even like the  idea

that  the  Bornean territories need not have  to  go

through  all  the  stages that  Singapore  has  gone

through,  but  to come straight into a  Malaysia  as

units  of  an  independent Malaysia. I do  not  know

their  way  of  thinking; I would  not  like  to  be

uncharitable  and suggest that the longer  there  is

colonialism in this territory the easier it will  be

for  Communist forces to work because they will keep

on  whipping  up  the  people on this  anti-colonial

slogan. Therefore, once the colonial masters are out

of  the  picture, there is nothing more to  whip  up

because   it   will  be  difficult  to   rouse   the

nationalists of the countries to work against  their

own  interests. I cannot understand why the  Barisan

Sosialis  should be so much against Malaysia,  which

means that the British will be out of Malaysia. They

are against it. I cannot understand that. Of course,

it  is  now  left  to  the  people  of  the  Bornean

territories. It is not for us to say what  political

future they should have. It is now left for them  to

go  before  the Commission which has been  appointed

and  which will be sitting quite soon, and  tell  it

what they would like to have for their own political

future. We can only express the hope that they  will

see  the  same  concept as we have, that  they,  our

brothers  who  live in Borneo, Sarawak  and  Brunei,

will  awaken  to  their call of  Malaysia.  We  look

forward  to  the  day when Malaysia  will  become  a

reality  and  all  of us, who were  living  together

under  one  colonial master, will live  together  in

peace,  happiness and prosperity as  freed  brothers

from colonial control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Barisan Sosialis, of course, as usual

attacked  the Internal Security Council. They  could

not  understand  why the Internal  Security  Council

should  be  vested  in  the  hands  of  the  Central

Government  Sir, internal security is  pan-Malaysian

if  there is a Malaysia. What happens in Borneo will

affect   Sarawak,   Brunei,   Singapore   and    the

Federation. So what happens in Kuala Lumpur will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>



affect Singapore and vice versa. Therefore, internal security  is pan-Malaysian and, being pan-Malaysian,

the control of internal security should be vested in

the Central Government. It is as simple as that.  It

should  be vested in the Central Government  because

internal security affects the whole territory.  When

we  were  at  one  time  fighting  hard  for  closer

relationship with the Federation of Malaya - that  was

before    the   Tunku's   talk   to   the    foreign

correspondents  Association - we  did  say  that   the

Federation  Government would, of  course,  have  the

final  say on internal security, because even if  we

were to have a joint committee of Singapore and  the

Federation working on internal security, but because

the  Federation  is a bigger territory,  bigger  not

only  in  area but also in population and in  annual

revenue, the final say will, of course, be in  their

hands.  So  the  P.A.P. in  agreeing  to  surrender

internal   security   straight   to   the    Central

Government, to say the least, do not like  to  carry

on  this  responsibility. They would  like  somebody

else  to do the work for them. It is for the  P.A.P.

to explain why they take that kind of line. It is  a

funny line: the Prime Minister of Singapore going to

the  extent  of  spending money on "The  Battle  for

Merger" describing a man a Communist and saying that

he has evidence to prove that the man is a Communist

and   still  not  doing  anything  about   it.   The

Government  of the country has the security  of  the

people  in their custody. If they believe  that  the

Communists or the Communist front line, the  central

line  or  the back line are people who  are  out  to

damage  the security of the country, then  there  is

only  one course of action to take. But if  they  do

not  believe that, then what is the point of  saying

that  the  handwriting experts have  already  proved

that  this  Communist document is in the handwriting

of Mr Lim Ching Siong?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The September debate of 1957 was referred to by

the leader of the Barisan Sosialis. At that time  it

was the Prime Minister who, sitting on this side  of

the House, described the Lim Yew Hock Government  as

most  undemocratic  and doing all  sorts  of  things

against his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>



comrades  who were good, democratic people  fighting

against the colonial cause. Now he has even gone  to

the  extent of publishing a book to say how right  I

was.  If  the Government really mean what they  say,

there is only one way open to them: they either look

after the interest of the country or they do not. If

they do not, there is only one answer.

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no

doubt in my mind that the concept of Malaysia is due

to  sincere and genuine national leaders in  Malaya,

especially in the person of Tunku Abdul Rahman. I am

forced  to mention Tunku Abdul Rahman in this matter

because  he initiated this concept of Malaysia.  The

Malaysia Plan is still being pursued despite certain

sections who are opposed to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear from the results of the Malaysia

Solidarity  Consultative  Committee  that  all   the

political Parties in the various territories support

this  Malaysia  proposal. At the moment,  we  should

expect every citizen in the five territories to give

his  wholehearted support and to have nothing to  do

with  anything that will sabotage the  formation  of

the  Federation of Malaysia. It is clear that  those

quarters which have issued misleading and disruptive

statements do not wish to see the peoples  of  these

five territories live in peace and harmony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard the arguments that the Federation of

Malaysia Plan will give more opportunities to  every

citizen in the field of economy and politics and  in

various  other spheres. From past experience  gained

in  political  developments here, it can  be  safely

said  that more encouragement will be given in these

spheres. From the beginning we know that because  of

the  multi-racial  composition  of  the  people   of

Malaya,  it  is  almost  impossible  to  solve   the

differences which may arise. But with the  emergence

of  a leader, Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra, and also  of

Sir  Cheng  Lock Tan, these two have  been  able  to

cement friendly relationships between



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>



the  two major races in Malaya. As a result of this,

the  struggle to achieve independence for Malaya was

pursued relentlessly without any bloodshed.  It  can

be  said  that if by a stroke of the pen the British

colonised  Malaya,  they  were  also  expelled  from

Malaya by a stroke of the pen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have every reason to be proud

of  our achievements. At the same time, the work  of

nation-building  and  of further  strengthening  the

unity  of  the  various peoples in  Malaya  must  be

carried out and opportunities must be given  to  all

citizens. But we cannot expect to see results within

a  short  space of time. It will take a considerable

period  of  time  before we  can  see  results.  The

leaders must be sincere and honest, otherwise  there

will  be chaos in the country and this will lead  to

the   destruction  of  the  State  with   consequent

suffering to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our position today is this.

Certain  sections  of the people  in  their  sincere

desire  to bring about happiness are bound  to  meet

with  opposition.  There will be  many  difficulties

which  will have to be overcome. Of course, we  must

also not blind ourselves to the dangers around us - as

the  Tunku  said  in a speech which  came  from  his

heart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion before the House urges each and

every  citizen of Singapore who wants  to  show  his

undivided  loyalty to ths country  to  support  this

plan. As I said earlier on, the plan will bring us a

step  forward and it will enable us to continue with

the   progress  which  has  been  achieved  in   the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am compelled to say, and I will continue to say

to  the Barisan Sosialis, that when they oppose this

motion, they attempt to play the obsolete game, that

is to say, the Federation of Malaysia is intended to

counter balance the predominantly Chinese population

in   Singapore  by  the  inclusion  of  the   Borneo

territories.  I strongly repudiate this  allegation,

Mr Speaker. As I have said, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



fears and misgivings of the various communities have

disappeared,  especially among the  Malays  when  we

have seen what has happened with our own eyes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what exists among the people, Mr Speaker, is

that  there is no genuine loyalty to the State. This

is  not  only prevalent among the Chinese  but  also

among  the  Malays.  I say that  the  Malays  cannot

accept   Communism.  They  are  prepared  to  oppose

Communism tooth and nail. So the tactic or manoeuvre

of  the  Barisan Sosialis is to flog a  dead  horse.

They  hope that by so doing, the people, who do  not

really understand the objects of this Malaysia plan,

will  be  worried. But I say this on behalf  of  the

Malays  in  Singapore: we have given talks  on  this

plan  and  they  fully support  this  concept  of  a

Federation  of Malaysia. They now await  with  great

interest  the  establishment  of  a  Federation   of

Malaysia,  as is contained in the motion before  the

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the leaders of the Barisan Sosialis, the Member for Queenstown, has also employed another tactic by saying that the Malaysia plan is anti-Indonesia plan. I have explained, Mr Speaker, that the Barisan Sosialis is toeing the line of the Communist Party in Indonesia. We have read in an article today that the Communist Party in Indonesia

not only opposes but condemns the Malaysian plan  as

a  colonial  intrigue. But they have forgotten  that

what  we  consider most vital must be  realised  and

that  is  that on achieving independence the  nation

must be able to give the people food, clothing,  and

so  on.  It is not just a matter of independence  as

the  people  will  then be in an impoverished  state

with  no  bright  prospects for them  or  for  their

generations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So accusations designed to sour up relations

between  the people of Indonesia and the  people  of

Malaya  are  motivated by political bankrupts.  They

have  nothing to explain to the people how they  can

obstruct  the  formation  of  Malaysia.  They   have

ridiculed  the Federation of Malaysia. For instance,

they  say  that  the  people of  Brunei  oppose  the

Malaysia plan and that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>



Federation of Malaya is keen to take Brunei  because

Brunei is a rich country and that territory has been

given  to the Federation of Malaya by the Government

of   Brunei.  They  also  say  that,  in  fact,  the

Federation  Government has accepted a  loan  of  $40

million  out of $100 million offered by  the  Brunei

Government without any interest. This is an  example

which clearly shows the mutual agreement on the part

of  the Brunei Government to help the Federation  of

Malaya in its future development plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no basis for such an allegation that the

Federation of Malaya has territorial ambitions. Such

an  allegation  is  without foundation.  The  Borneo

territories are still under colonial domination.  So

this  Malaysia plan strengthens the peoples of these

territories  and  at the same time  free  them  from

colonial  domination.  If  we  are  genuinely  anti-colonial, such a noble plan as this will bring about

prosperity to all sections concerned by negotiations

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- be it with the British Government or with any other

Party.  There is agreement from all Parties to  form

Malaysia as enuniciated by Tunku Abdul Rahman  Putra

Al-Haj in the Federation Parliament in October 1961.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

is  really unthinkable that  any loyal and sensible

Singapore  citizen could be opposed to the principle

of  a Federation of Malaysia. Sir, even if we ask  a

secondary school student this question - "If you  look

at   the  map  of  South-East  Asia,  do  you  think

Singapore  can  survive and prosper economically  by

being  isolated?"   - he  will  at  once  answer  that

Singapore's survival and prosperity must  depend  on

the  good  relations of the regions around  her.  If

there  is  a move to tighten up relations and  bring

closer  the  parts which have been kept together  by

the British but not brought together voluntarily,  I

am  sure  the student will say: that is a very  good

move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sirs history shows that there are these trends by

which  countries get to know one another better  and

come together on a federation or on a confederation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



basis;  they  grow  stronger and  they  become  more

prosperous. But when they divide and split up,  they

become  weaker  and  poorer. We  see  that  even  in

politics   - where  parties  break  up,  they   become

weaker; where they get united, they become stronger.

That  is  simple,  and I therefore  wonder  why  our

Barisan  friends at this point cannot agree when  so

many  other  political groups can see the  necessity

for  greater strength and prosperity through  closer

relations and groupings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask our Barisan friends or

anybody   who  is  opposed  to  the  Federation   of

Malaysia,   this  question:  can  Singapore   really

survive and prosper economically to be able to  give

employment  and  a decent livelihood  to  its  ever-growing population by being isolated? Can it be left

out  of  a Federation of Malaysia and still prosper?

Hitherto  we have had the traditions left behind  by

the   British,  who  really  had  a  Federation   of

Malaysia,  Sir, because there was the  Commissioner-General  for  South-East  Asia  with  the  different

Governors governing the different colonies, and they

got  together  once in a while at  a  conference  in

Singapore.  Naturally divergent policies that  would

be  injurious to Singapore would not be allowed. But

if  Sarawak, North Borneo, Brunei and the Federation

were   to   adopt  different  policies  hostile   to

Singapore, we in Singapore would be bound to suffer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember the time when we had a

Commonwealth   Parliamentary   Regional   Conference

here - meeting  in a room in this House.  The  Barisan

Sosialis  Party had not as yet been formed.  But  if

their  leader had been present at those meetings,  I

think perhaps his attitude would have changed.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir. Is

it  in order for the Minister for Culture to do  his

homework and read his newspaper in this Assembly?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is a Standing Order and I had

better read it for it to be understood. The Standing

Order is Standing Order 48, paragraph (d):

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Members shall not read newspapers, books, letters

or  other  documents except such matters therein  as

may  be  directly connected with the business  under

debate.'



<br><br>I think I have seen the Minister for Culture busy

under-lining certain words. I take it he is reading

passages directly concerned with this debate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was at the

point  where I was describing what happened at those

meetings    of    the   Commonwealth   Parliamentary

Association Regional Conference held in the  Library

in  this  House. Sir, I remember well the Leader  of

the  North  Borneo delegation, Mr Donald  Stephens,

standing  up  and,  in a very forthright  and  blunt

manner telling the rest of us how fearful the  North

Borneo  territory  was of this Malaysia  idea.  They

feared that their Civil Service would be Malayanised

instead  of  Borneonised, and how they,  being  more

backward,  would  be  left  behind  and  would  lose

through  this kind of Federation and so  forth.  But

when he found that we were appreciative of all their

fears - because the Federation people were fearful  of

Singapore,  and Singapore citizens were  fearful  of

Federation citizens -  and we shared with them similar

fears, but that if we really had the desire to  come

closer  together there would be adequate  safeguards

for  all these fears, Mr Donald Stephens got up and

said,  "It looks as if we are all of the same  mind.

We  realise  these fears and, therefore,  we  should

really  now stop talking about these fears  and  get

down  to  practical realities."  There  was  also  a

member  of another delegation, Sir, who had  in  his

pocket  a  draft of a speech which was  against  the

idea of a Federation of Malaysia. But as he listened

to  the  arguments and the sincerity of the speakers

in  their  desire  really to help  one  another,  he

decided not to deliver his speech. I was glad when I

found  that  out afterwards. It shows that  when  we

really  get  down  to brass tacks and  realise  that

there are fears, we must not ignore these fears. But

if  we  are  willing to provide safeguards  for  all

these  fears  then  the fears  disappear.  There  is

trust.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that if the Barisan Sosialis leader

had  been there and had felt the atmosphere  in  the

conference,  very likely he would have  changed  his

attitude.  Now to arouse our fears of  Indonesia,  I

think,  Sir, is not contributing towards the welfare

of  the  citizens of this part of the world.  If  we

know  these fears, we want to remove them. I believe

that   having  agreed  to  the  principle   of   the

Federation  of Malaysia, the constitutional  experts

could  provide  safeguards for all  these  fears.  I

understand that one of the delegates at one  of  his

subsequent meetings said that he was glad  that  out

of the discussions they had arrived at one principle

to  which  they had agreed. There would be unity  in

diversity.  So  we have stressed that  that  is  the

principle  which Singaporeans in particular  favour,

because we have diverse interests sometimes. We have

diverse  fears. But we can be united in our  loyalty

and  in our desire to contribute, each his part,  to

the  general well-being of the people of this place.

I  do hope, Sir, that on second considerations,  our

Barisan  friends will realise that they can  play  a

great part by not applying the brakes or throwing  a

spanner  into the machinery because they are against

the  P.A.P. We too have been against the P.A.P., and

in  many things we too cannot agree with the P.A.P.;

but, Sir, when it comes to an issue like this, which

is  for the good of our people and our children,  we

should  really  rise  above  party  differences  and

welcome  an  idea  that  can bring  benefit  to  all

concerned.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, nobody of any repute - not even the

Communists  and  their stereophonic,  high  fidelity

tape   recorders   in  this  Assembly - have   opposed

Malaysia in principle.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is rather an extravagant

phrase  used about stereophonic, high fidelity  tape

recorders. I do not know whether that was  meant  to

apply to Members of the Assembly or to hidden tapes.

But if that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



expression  is  meant to apply to  Members  of  this

Assembly,  it might appear to be offensive.  Perhaps

the Minister could withdraw that extravagant phrase.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> As you wish, Sir, I withdraw

those  words. Nevertheless, everybody in this  House

knows  how  repetitive the Members  of  the  Barisan

could  be.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan  Sosialis,

for example, support Malaysia in principle; just  as

they  support  merger  in principle;  just  as  they

support democracy in principle; just as they support

non-Communist socialism in principle.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Do you not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Nobody doubts it. However, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, this does not deprive them  of  their

right  to  reject in practice what they  support  in

principle  and, as I shall show later,  the  Barisan

Sosialis,   at   the  behest  of   their   Communist

manipulators, oppose Malaysia in practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the fact that the Barisan Sosialis and

other opponents have to accept Malaysia in principle

is  proof  that  they  recognise  that  Malaysia  is

historically  inevitable and logically  irrefutable.

In  fighting  what  is historically  inevitable  and

logically  irrefutable, the  opponents  of  Malaysia

know  that they have launched on an enterprise  that

must  end  in defeat and disaster for them.  But  in

embarking  on  such  a foolish  encounter  they  are

themselves  the  helpless  victims  of   their   own

machinations.  They are caught  in  a  dilemma  they

cannot  resolve.  Their  political  philosophy   and

practice is built on a pathetic fallacy - the  fallacy

that  in  the Malaysian region Communism can triumph

against  the  mounting  tide  of  nationalism.  This

essentially is the fallacy which is responsib1e  for

the  dilemma in which the Barisan Sosialis and their

Communist mentors find themselves over the issue  of

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cannot deny the desirability or inevitability

of  Malaysia but they have to resist its realisation

because  it  is,  at  the moment,  inimical  to  the

interests of Communism. In other words, the  Barisan

Sosialis want to roll back the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



tide of Malaysia but every time the waves break they

have to scoot for dry ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good indication of how difficult it is for them

to resist the tide of Malaysia was their reaction to

the  question of merger  - for, in the final analysis,

merger  and Malaysia are integral parts of the  same

historical movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose today to deal with the merger

question which had been thoroughly thrashed  out  in

this  Assembly. However, I would like  to  make  one

observation  which substantiates my point  that  the

Malaysia  movement  is the wave of  the  future -  the

inevitable  process of history which  not  even  the

Barisan Sosialis and their manipulators can halt  in

the long run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Sir, at the end of the debate on

merger, when everyone was laboriously scrapping  the

bottom of the barrel for fresh ideas on the subject,

the  time came for a vote to be taken on the matter.

Instead of boldly declaring their stand, the Barisan

Sosialis  walked out on the pretext that freedom  of

debate was being denied.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker,

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, was one of those who

walked  out,  and I object to the use  of  the  word

"pretext".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The use of the word "pretext" imports

a  matter of opinion, and that is the opinion of the

Minister.  If it is the opinion of the Minister  for

Home Affairs, he is entitled to voice it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, incidentally

I  have forgotten the Member for Anson also followed

the  Barisan Sosialis in the walk-out. Nevertheless.

Mr  Speaker, it is my submission that  the  Barisan

Sosialis walked out because they felt in their bones

that   for  all  their  protestations  and   lengthy

discourses,  they  could not halt  the  irresistible

drive towards merger.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same feeling of helplessness and inevitable

defeat  is evidenced in their reactions to Malaysia.

They may claim to support Malaysia in principle  but

they have the uncomfortable feeling that Malaysia is

a noose tightening slowly about their necks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state why we think that Malaysia is

inevitable  and desirable and why the anti-Malaysian

forces  have failed to halt the Malaysian  movement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of Malaysia is not new. It has been mooted

by  different  peoples at different times.  We  know

that  immediately  after the  last  war  progressive

nationalist  and  socialist leaders  championed  the

idea  of  Melayu Raya - a vast Federation  of  Malay-speaking  States stretching from the Philippines  to

Malaya and Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists, too, joined in the cry of Melayu

Raya   because   at  that  time  Communism   enjoyed

considerable influence and prestige throughout  Asia

and the Communists were therefore of the view that a

Melayu  Raya  would  be a Communist-directed  Melayu

Raya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at that time, the concept of Melayu Raya

did  not  accord  with political realities  in  this

region.  For  one thing, the concept of Melayu  Raya

was  merely  an incidental weapon in furtherance  of

the  real  and  major objective - the elimination  of

colonialism.  Melayu  Raya  was  merely   one   more

battering ram against colonialism in the armoury  of

the  nationalists. The concept of  Melayu  Raya  was

itself  too vague and remote to make any  impact  on

the   minds   of  ordinary  people.  The   immediate

preoccupation  of  the masses and their  leaders  in

those  days  was  how to get rid of  colonialism  in

their respective countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result was that the ideal of Melayu Raya was

forgotten  and  soon  ceased to  exercise  even  the

imagination of the intellectuals who gave  birth  to

the concept.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of Malaysia was then mooted by the

British. The purpose of Malaysia as conceived by the

British in those days was to use it as a counter  to

anti-colonial  nationalism in the  Malaysian  region

and,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



for this reason, it failed to evoke any response. It

failed because it was seen by the nationalists as  a

Malaysia controlled and dominated by the British.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for the second time the ideal of Malaysia

failed   to  evoke  any  popular  response   because

objectively the conditions were not ripe for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then early last year the Tengku revived the

concept  of Malaysia and, unlike on the two previous

occasions, the idea not only caught on but  it  also

developed with a rapidity which nobody expected.  At

first the opponents of Malaysia tried to dismiss the

whole thing as just a bit of whim on the part of the

Tengku. They expected that after the initial call to

Malaysia the whole business would be forgotten.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when it looked like gathering momentum the

first strong reaction came strangely enough from the

Communists  and the pro-Communists  - the same  people

who  once waxed eloquent over Melayu Raya. The  more

extreme  of  the Communist faction lost no  time  in

branding Malaysia as the "Super Merger Trap"  and  a

British  colonialist plot  - just  as  merger  between

Singapore  and the Federation of Malaya was  branded

as  a  British plot by the very same people who were

secretly making offers to the U.K. Commission to  do

the  P.A.P. in, in return for British guarantee that

a new government headed presumably by the Member for

Queenstown would be tolerated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a measure of the confusion that exists among

the Communist and the pro-Communist circles over the

question   of   Malaysia  that   others   of   their

sympathisers took a more indulgent view of Malaysia.

This  was  because  they  had  to  accommodate   the

sentiments  of Malayan Leftist nationalists  on  the

question  of Malaysia. For example, the Chairman  of

the  Party  Rakyat of Malaya, Inche Ahmad Boestaman,

issued a statement that in principle he thought that

the   Tengku's  plan  for  Malaysia  was   a   "good

suggestion   and  deserved  support"  provided,   of

course,  this resulted in the Federation of Malaysia

becoming economically and politically independent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, on the one hand, there were the Communists who

claimed that Malaysia was a super-merger trap and  a

British  colonialist plot and, on the other, another

group  which  was  prepared to support  Malaysia  in

principle  because  they did not  want  to  alienate

Malayan  nationalists. This dithering is, I believe,

now coming to an end because the line on Malaysia is

now being laid for them by the popes and archbishops

of  Communism  who  have now come  to  realise  that

Malaysia  is  definitely round the corner,  and  the

time has come for it to be broken up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long period of silence Radio Moscow, Radio

Peking,  the  P.K.I. of Indonesia  and  the  Bintang

Timur,  a  pro-Communist Indonesian newspaper,  have

all   branded  Malaysia  as  a  bad  thing,  a  pro-colonialist device, and as anti-Indonesia.

a  good  thing  in principle. They have  made  their

final  pronouncement on Malaysia and their disciples

in  this  part of the world would have  to  toe  the

line. Malaysia must be broken up.

<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But can it be broken up? That is the problem that

must  be  exercising the minds of even the so-called

non-Communists  in  the Barisan Sosialis  and  their

even  more  feeble  counter-parts  in  Kuching   and

elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my contention, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it

is  the disconsolate opponents of Malaysia who  will

be  crushed  and broken up by what the Minister  for

Culture has described as the locomotive of history".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia is inevitable not because of the Tengku

or the Malaysia Solidarity Consultative Committee or

any  one  else,  but because events and  forces  are

thrusting  us  in  that direction. Malaysia  is  the

epilogue  to  the  anti-colonial  history  in   this

region.  Malaysia  is not, as some  Members  of  the

Barisan Sosialis contend, a movement inspired by the

British   to  consolidate  their  hold  over   these

territories. Under Malaysia Britain must  relinquish

her  sovereignty over these territories and transfer

it  to the new Federation of Malaysia. Of course, it

is  the  fashion among pro-Communists - to brand  as

phoney  any  grant of independence  which  does  not

result  in  a  Communist take over.  For  years  the

Communists refused to accept as genuine the grant of

independence to India, Ceylon and other  ex-colonial

countries  where  non-Communist  regimes  came  into

power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in Malaya the less perceptive doctrinaire

Communists  never fail to repeat that the Federation

is  still  subject to colonial control, unlike  Chin

Peng  who,  at  the Baling Talks, in response  to  a

direct question by the Tengku, said that he did  not

regard  the Tengku as a colonial stooge but  as  the

properly  elected  leader  of  the  people  of   the

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Malaysia comes, the transfer of sovereignty

will  be  genuine in that it will be  recognised  as

such in international law and in the United Nations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, it may be asked, are the British prepared to

hand  over sovereignty over the Borneo States  to  a

new Federation constituted out of 15 States?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are granting sovereignty to the Malaysia

Federation for exactly the same reason that led them

to  grant  independence  to  India,  Ceylon,  Burma,

Ghana, Malaya and other territories for a long time.

The British are well aware of the convulsive changes

going on in South-East Asia and how vulnerable their

position  can  be  as a colonial overlord.  The  two

forces ranged against them are Communism on the  one

hand and anti-colonial nationalism on the other  and

they know that they cannot meet the assault of both.

Only  a  few  weeks ago the British  Prime  Minister

reminded  the  British people that Britain  was  now

reduced  to  the status of a third-class  power.  In

other  words,  the  British  realise  that  time  is

running out for them in the Borneo territories  and,

with  typical realism, they have decided to come  to

terms  with  nationalism rather than with  Communism

because  they understand that nationalism is  likely

to be the stronger force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did so in the case of India and Ceylon. Will

the   Barisan  Sosialis  therefore  say   that   independence  for  India  and Ceylon  was  phoney  and

should have been resisted?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem therefore is who is to take over in

the Borneo territories  - the nationalists or the anti-nationalists?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear what the struggle is now boiling

down  to.  The anti-nationalists, like  the  Barisan

Sosialis, want to break up Malaysia into small units

so  that  they  can be subverted  one  by  one.  The

nationalists,  on  the other hand,  want  a  unified

Malaysia -  a strong Malaysia.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I wish to say

is,  are  the  Barisan. Sosialis rude, or  will  the

motion  being debated in this Assembly be  left  not

only  to  ourselves but also to the  people  of  the

territories involved to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



decide? I say so, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, because I

cannot  accept for a moment the accusation that  the

Tunku  is  a  communalist. Let us leave  it  to  the

people  to judge whether we or the Barisan  Sosialis

are communalists. The Barisan Sosialis were prepared

to  hold mass rallies in Geylang Serai in support of

the  West Irian struggle. I now invite them to  come

over  to  Geylang Serai to hold similar  rallies  if

they  are prepared to do so. I feel that the Barisan

Sosialis, as a socialist political Party, is  not  a

genuine  socialist Party, because I  have  heard  it

said in this Assembly that today they represent only

the  Chinese section of the community. I shall leave

the  question  as  to  who are communalists  to  the

Assembly  to  decide.  I think  they  only  pay  lip

service  when they say they are attempting  to  help

the Malays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was very much surprised to hear such

charges made by the Member for Queenstown. He is not

satisfied. But he does not know what to do for  fear

that if he takes the wrong step he might become mad.

Is  it wrong to seek a closer relationship with  our

brothers  in  Borneo? Is it wrong to obtain  a  loan

from Brunei, or must we obtain it from Moscow? It is

a wrong attitude on the part of the Barisan Sosialis

if  they  think otherwise. It is fortunate that  the

Tunku has initiated his Malaysia plan. I may be  one

of  those  who  will demand that the British  should

transfer sovereignty to the Malays. These fears will

cause anxiety among those who have been accepted  as

our  brothers with citizenship rights  and  who,  we

feel, should owe undivided loyalty to the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to reply to the accusation made by the

leader  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  concerning   the

Cobbold  Commission which they regard  as  a  rubber

stamp. We can use the Malaysia rubber stamp on those

people  whom  we wish to exterminate from  our  fair

land.  The  purpose of the rubber stamp will  be  to

eliminate  people who are pro-Communists or  genuine

Communists in our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to clarify another point. We all remember

very  well  that  after  the Japanese  surrender  in

Malaya and Singapore, there was evidence that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



M.P.A.J.A. or  the  M.C.P. fought  to   establish

Communist rule over Malaya and Singapore. What  they

fought for al that time was based on communal lines.

So   I   wish   to  say  to  the  Barisan   Sosialis

particularly  that  they  cannot  allege  that   the

Alliance  Government has been adopting the  communal

line.  Mr  Deputy Speaker, Sir, we  should  not  be

blamed if we ourselves start communal feelings among

our  people, the blame should be put squarely on the

Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Barisan Sosialis have alleged that the

Malaysia plan is anti-Indonesian and that  it  is  a

British  plan.  This opinion cannot find  acceptance

among  the  Members of U.M.N.O. Perhaps the  Barisan

Sosialis  have  entirely forgotten  that  the  Malay

population  in Malaya and Singapore originated  from

Java  or  Sumatra. We have a sense  of  loyalty  and

responsibility  to  our  country.  If  the   Barisan

Sosialis wish to teach the Malays in Malaya, then  I

believe   - as  the saying goes - blood is thicker  than

water.  So let them take heed of this proverb.  They

should  not try to teach the ducks to swim. If  they

persist  in doing so, it will not be the  ducks  who

will drown but the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to refute the

unfounded  allegations made by the Barisan  Sosialis

concerning   the  Malaysia  plan  and  the   charges

directed against the leaders of U.M.N.O.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker. Sir, we believe that all those  who

are  loyal  to the State and to the Federation  must

sincerely support the motion of the day. But  it  is

surprising  to  us to note that the  leader  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis has today come forward  openly  to

oppose   this   motion.  He  is   opposed   to   the

establishment of Malaysia. He has said  many  things

which   sound  hollow.  He  says  that   after   the

establishment  of Malaysia there  will  not  be  any

freedom, equality and democracy. How can there be an

absence  of equality and freedom? He has  not  given

any  explanation for this matter. He  has  also  Mid

that the Malaysia plan is a plan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



brought  forward by the P.A.P. leadership for  their

own survival. This again is an affront to the people

of Singapore, and also to the people of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, the leader of the Barisan

Sosialis  has clearly realised that as soon  as  the

Malaysia plan is fulfilled, their back-seat  drivers

will  fail  in their plot to bring about a Communist

Malaysia.  They know that their plan of a  Communist

Malaysia  will become a dream. As a result of  this,

they  have to come forward to oppose merger  between

Singapore  and  the Federation. They object  to  the

White Paper of the Government. They have put forward

so  many  conditions which are unacceptable  to  the

Federation in order to sabotage the merger plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we have brought out this Malaysia plan, and

they  have  also come forward to oppose  it  openly.

Initially we did not know what they were up  to.  We

did  not know what they were actually trying to  do.

But  now everything is as clear as crystal.  In  the

Straits  Times  of today, an article by  Alex  Josey

states  that  the Communist leader in  Indonesia  is

opposed  to  the  Malaysia plan.  The  Minister  for

Culture  will  be dealing with the details  of  this

article,  but to put it in a nutshell, it says  that

the Barisan Sosialis are advancing similar arguments

to  those  forwarded by the Communists in Indonesia.

It   is  obvious  that  in  South.  East  Asia,  the

Communists  in  Indonesia seem to  have  become  the

centre  of  attraction. We can now see clearly  that

the  Barisan  Sosialis do not like merger  with  the

Federation  of Malaya at this juncture,  neither  do

they like to see the Malaysia plan materialised.  On

the contrary they have brought forward arguments  to

the effect that Singapore, the Federation of Malaya,

Brunei,  Sarawak,  North Borneo, should  shelve  the

Malaysia  plan,  or else they must  have  a  greater

Malaysia to include Indonesia. That is to say,  they

want a greater Malaysia to include Indonesia and the

five  territories comprising Borneo, Singapore,  the

Federation, and so on. From this we can see  clearly

that they do not hope for a merger at this juncture.

They are trying to gain time because they think that

the proper time for merger will be when the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



Indonesian  Communists are in control of  Indonesia.

That will be the best time for merger, according  to

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is a very clear example. They say they like

us.  "We are in support of Indonesia recovering West

Irian  because  West Irian is, after all,  part  and

parcel of Indonesia, and we are of the opinion  that

similarly  they should come forward to  support  our

plan  to  get  rid  of the remnant forces  from  the

Malaysia  plan entirely." But they do not think  so.

They  do  not  support our getting  rid  of  British

colonialism in this area. They say, "You wait for  a

while. Wait until the Borneo territories have  self-determination."  They do not like a  merger  between

Singapore  and the Federation. They do not  want  to

have  an early merger and a union of the peoples  of

these territories. Instead they want us to be merged

with Indonesia. This does not mean that they are  in

support  of the Indonesian Communists. Is it because

there  is  suppression of the Indonesian Communists?

They  are  trying to sell out the interests  of  the

people of Singapore. They are hoping to sell out the

interests  of the people of all the five territories

to  the  Communists in Indonesia. We members of  the

P.A.P.,  including  those in  the  Barisan  Sosialis

before  they  left us, already signed  an  agreement

before  the elections in which we declared  that  we

are  non-Communist,  socialist  disciples.  We  also

signed   a   declaration  analysing  the   political

development and situation in Malaya. It was  clearly

stated  what  we wanted to achieve  - an  independent,

democratic, free and non-Communist Malaya, and not a

Communist   Malaya.   And   so   it   is   not   our

responsibility  to  work for any  influence  or  any

forces.  But it is our responsibility to try  to  do

our  best  to  raise the standard of living  of  the

peoples of the two territories. We must develop  our

country on our own. We do not want to be stooges  of

any foreign country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very clear at this juncture that the Barisan

Sosialis  is  being  controlled  by  the  Indonesian

Communists. The Member for Queenstown,  who  is  the

Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis, has said that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



he  is  in  favour  of the peoples  of  the  various

countries  coming together, but he is  opposing  the

merging  of our close neighbours. He talks  about  a

common  world  in the universe. It is but  an  empty

dream.  We  know that a common world is a very  high

ideal  of  a human being. But in every country  that

has  achieved independence, especially in South-East

Asia,  we see that they are faced with a phenomenon.

This  phenomenon is very objective as  predicted  by

history - that  it  is a struggle between  nationalism

and  Communism. Here it is the same. In Burma  there

were  three  schools  of  Communist  thinking  after

independence.  Countries  in  South-East  Asia   are

generally faced with a similar situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown talks about Afro-Asian

people and spirit and say that we must keep in  line

with  this spirit of Afro-Asia. I remember that when

an  Afro-Asian meeting was held, I went there  as  a

reporter and I listened to the Member for Queenstown

and  other  members talking about their support  for

the  Indonesians to take back West Irian. But on the

other hand, when they oppose this Malaysia motion, I

feel  like  laughing at them. But if the Member  tom

Queenstown likes to see it, I can let him  read  the

article  written by me in support of the  Indonesian

struggle  for  the recovery of West Irian.  I  wrote

that article before the independence of Malaya, that

we  should support the Indonesian struggle  for  the

recovery  of West Irian. At that time a  person  who

dared write such an article would be thought to be a

Leftist and would even face the possibility of being

arrested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I can see the heroes opposite me talk a great

deal about how to get others to become soldiers when

they themselves stay at home enjoying their comfort.

I  feel  like  laughing at them when they  say  such

things. The so-called Afro-Asian spirit, to my mind,

means that all those countries that took part in the

Bandoeng Conference of Afro-Asian countries were pro-Communists:  there were Communists  and  there  were

also  pro-Western countries. Now if you want to talk

about  the spirit of Afro-Asian conference you  must

give the whole picture and all the resolutions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



passed  there  as a whole in order to call  this  an

Afro-Asian conference spirit. One resolution was  to

the  effect that all colonialism in Asia and  Africa

must   be  eradicated  entirely,  and  these   areas

included  Malaya and Malaysia. Now this is the  true

spirit of the Afro-Asian conference. I would like to

ask the Member for Queenstown what he means when  he

refers  to the Afro-Asian spirit. He says  that  the

Prime  Minister deliberately tries to  sabotage  the

good relationship between the Borneo people and  the

Indonesian  people.  But it is  he  himself  who  is

souring up the relationship between these two groups

of  people. It is not the Prime Minister at all. The

representatives  of the Barisan Sosialis  have  come

out openly to say that the Malaysia plan is an anti-Indonesian plan. Is this not a deliberate attempt to

sour  out  relationship between these two countries?

Mr  Deputy  Speaker, Sir, it is  obvious  that  the

Barisan  Sosialis, in whatever they do, do not  mean

what  they  say.  They  say that  they  support,  in

principle, the concept of Malaysia. Everything  they

say  is  in  principle. But what they  are  actually

doing is detrimental to the Malaysia plan. They  say

things  with only one aim. That is, they are  trying

deliberately to delay merger. They want deliberately

to  delay the materialisation of the Malaysia  plan.

They  think that the proper time for merger will  be

when  the  Communist force is at its peak. They  are

waiting  for the time when the Indonesian Communists

will gain a victory in Indonesia. They think that it

would be at this time that Malaysia or merger should

come forward so that the Indonesian Communists would

be able to include Singapore and the Federation in a

greater   Malaysia  controlled  by  the   Indonesian

Communists. Is ths not a sell-out of the interest of

the  people  in Singapore and in the Federation?  We

have  already  said that our stand is non-Communist.

We  do  not  want  to  become  the  stooges  of  the

Communists or any Western country. We have  our  own

objective  and our own stand. What we are trying  to

fight for is a socialist, non-Communist independent,

democratic  Malaysia. Recently,  during  the  opening

ceremony of the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



headquarters,  the Secretary-General  of  our  Party

said  that our present responsibility is to  realise

this ideal, so that it will spread to all the people

in Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already said just

now  that the Barisan Sosialis do not represent  the

people of Singapore or the people in Malaysia.  What

they represent are those who want to go over to  the

Indonesian  Communists in  order to  realise  their

Communist international.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, the motion of the day is  very

clear  and simple. We the P.A.P. are concerned  that

in  a  multi-racial  society we should  establish  a

harmonious  and  strong Malaysia. This  question  is

very  simple and clear. We want to achieve  merger

as  a step towards the eradication of colonialism in

our  country. This motion should be supported by all

socialists  in our country. All those who  have  the

interest  of  the people at heart, or socialists  of

this  type, should come forward in support  of  this

motion  in  order to help us realise this plan.  But

let  us  look  at the Barisan Sosialis  Members  and

their  desperate struggle to wreck  merger.  We  can

pause  to think why they should adopt this attitude.

As a matter of fact, it is a mistake for them not to

be  able  to  analyse the whole political situation.

Political adventurers like the Member for Queenstown

will  not be able to understand the requirements  of

the people. How can he reflect the desire of all the

peoples in the Malaysian countries? We know that for

a  very  long time the people in Singapore  and  the

Federation  had  wanted  a  merger.  Similarly,  the

Malaysian  people  also  desire  to  have  a  strong

Malaysian country. We who are responsible people and

responsible  workers in a political  Party  must  be

patient  and  try to understand the requirements  of

the  people.  It  is  our  main  job  to  place  the

interests of the people above party interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is a very important

question. The controversy over the Malaysian concept

lies in the fact



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



that  the P.A.P. wants to place the interest of  the

people  above  all things. But the Barisan  Sosialis

representatives  are  trying  to  put   their   pro-Communist  and Communist interests above the  people

of  these territories. That is why in the debate  in

this  House,  the  arguments  centre  on  these  two

different  policies.  The  Malaysian  plan  is   not

intended  to  look after the interests of  the  P.A.P.

What  we  are  interested in is the welfare  of  the

broad masses of the people. What we want to build up

is  a  strong, prosperous and stable nation. We  the

P.A.P. are  not afraid that after the establishment

of  Malaysia, an end might be put to us. We  do  not

care  whether we go to gaol or not. We do  not  care

whether  our  interests will be protected.  But  the

representatives of the Barisan Sosialis  are  afraid

that  if  there is a strong Malaysian  nation,  they

night  fail  to  know where to go. And  so  whenever

there  is  any talk of building up a strong  nation,

they  will ask their bosses within their own  Party,

as  has  been exposed by the Prime Minister  in  his

booklet, whether this idea of the people in building

up  a  strong  nation will be detrimental  to  their

interest.  They have to consult their  bosses  about

this  before  they  could make up their  minds.  Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis of  today

has  a very strange stand. They want to have a self-governing  Singapore.  Why  should  we  have   self-government?  We know clearly that Singapore  is  now

still  under the British rule. Why should we have  a

pro-British  inclination?  They  claim  to  be  very

strong anti-colonialists. But, as a matter of  fact,

they  are  pro-British colonialists. It is really  a

very  humorous  situation for them  to  say  such  a

thing.  They  claim  to  be great  anti-colonialists

heroes  of the Barisan Sosialis! They hope  that  on

the  stage they can start shouting slogans.  But  in

the  streets  and at street corners, they  come  and

smear   the  Malaysia  plan  and  the  merger  plan.

Hitherto  the  adventurers in the  Barisan  Sosialis

have not levelled any attack on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



the British colonialists. It is again a very strange

situation.  How  is it that they  never  attack  the

colonialists in Singapore? The Minister for  Finance

is  very  correct.  They have an adventurer  in  the

Member  for  Queenstown, who is the  leader  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis. How can you have a  blind  person

leading an elephant? How can you have a blind person

riding on a blind person? The so-called great  anti-colonialists  claim that they are  very  farsighted.

They  can  see things miles away. They can  see  the

Dutch  rule  in Indonesia. But right  in  their  own

house they cannot see the British colonialists.  And

they  in  turn  say that they want to have  a  self-government   in   Singapore.  How   ridiculous   and

preposterous! Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if  we  pause

to think carefully for a while, then we will be able

to  understand  how the Barisan Sosialis  have  been

making  such attempts. The main thing is  that  they

are  afraid of all the nationalists. That  is  their

weak  point.  They want to have Communist  rule  and

they  therefore  treat  the  nationalists  as  their

opponents.  They attack the nationalists instead  of

attacking  the  colonialists. In fact,  they  attack

even  harder  the nationalists. This is  their  very

main  failing. They hope that the nationalists  will

come  to a united front with them. But they  have  a

sinister  way  of coming round to the backs  of  the

nationalists  and  stab  them.  They  say  that  the

Malaysia plan of Tunku Abdul Rahman is aimed at  the

exploitation of one country by another. This kind of

argument  is being advanced by the people who  claim

to be leaders!
