<div align="center"><b>SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 43 of 1956)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency's authority to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of

$4,308,250  shall  be supplied to  the  Government

under  the  heads  of  expenditure  and  for   the

services  specified in the Schedule  contained  in

Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 43 of 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule contains the applications for

supplementary  vote which have  accumulated  since

the last sitting of the Assembly. The applications

amount to a total of about $4.3 millions, making a

total  of supplementary votes for this year  of  a

little over $11 millions compared to the total  of

$27  millions on approximately the same date  last

year.  I  mention these figures because  strenuous

efforts  have,  in  fact,  been  made  to   reduce

Government expenditure in general and to limit the

number  of applications for supplementary vote  in

particular,  and  because  criticisms  have   been

levelled  at  the  rate of Government  expenditure

both in and outside the Assembly. The fact of  the

matter is that applications for supplementary vote

are  inevitable and inescapable. It is  impossible

to  foresee  future needs when the  estimates  are

framed. Needs arise which it would be shortsighted

not   to  meet  as  soon  as  possible.  The  same

situation arises in every type of organisation. It

is not peculiar to Government alone. All we can do

is    to    endeavour   to   limit   supplementary

applications to essential services. I do think  we

are making some progress in that direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first task is to report that, contrary to my

undertaking at an earlier sitting of the Assembly,

I  have authorised two applications for funds  for

posts  in  anticipation of  the  approval  of  the

Assembly. The first item is No.202. In this  case,

which  is fully explained in the Schedule, it  was

represented to me by the Chief Justice through  my

hon.   Friend  the  Attorney-General   (Mr C.   H.

Butterfield)   that   the   appointment   of   two

additional  Reporters  was  a  matter   of   great

urgency.   In   consequence,   I   approved    the

appointments with effect from the 1st of June.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second item is No. 238. In this case, it was

represented  to  me  by the Registrar  of  Malayan

Statistics  that the work of preparation  for  the

field census tests proposed for the autumn of this

year  would be seriously held up if a stenographer

were not appointed immediately to keep the minutes

and  act  as  Assistant Secretary  to  the  Census

Advisory   Committee.   After   a   very   careful

examination   of   the  case  submitted   by   the

Registrar,  I agreed to his request and authorised

the  creation  of the post with effect  from  10th

July, 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also report that I have authorised a start

to  be  made with the construction of hutted  camp

accommodation for the Singapore Battalion.  It  is

desirable  to  raise  the  Battalion  as  soon  as

possible.  The rate of recruitment  depends  to  a

certain    extent    on   the   availability    of

accommodation  and it was therefore  important  to

authorise  the immediate commencement of  work  so

that recruitment should not be held up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that it was in the interest of

efficient  administration that  these  authorities

should  be given. May I ask hon. Members  to  give

covering approval?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various applications are explained in some

detail  in  the  Schedule  but  perhaps  attention

should be drawn to one or two items.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain amount of publicity has been given to

item  206, Cost of Telegrams, which, incidentally,

has no direct connection with the Merdeka Mission.

As means of communication develop, so one tends to

use  them. The habit has grown steadily  over  the

years to communicate by telegram and radiogram. It

saves  much  time and, I think, leads  to  greater

efficiency   and   the   speedier   despatch   of

Government  business. The practice is  common  not

only  in Government but also in business and other

circles.  Following this growing habit, Government

expenditure  on telegrams has tended to  increase.

Expenditure over the past five years has  been  as

follows:1952,   $12,000;  1953,   $19,000;   1954,

$23,000;  1955, $38,000; from 1st January  to  9th

August,  1956, $32,000. The considerable  increase

in 1956 over 1955



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>

figures  has  been due, in the main, to  increased

communication  on constitutional  matters  in  the

early part of this year. The original vote has now

been expended and a supplement of $30,000 is asked

for.  This estimate was made in early June on  the

basis  of average monthly expenditure in the first

part  of the year. There has been a slight falling

off   in  expenditure  since  that  date  but  the

application  has been kept to the  same  level  in

order  to cover all possible contingencies in  the

future.   There   has  been  no  extravagance   in

expenditure.  Telegrams  are  despatched  to   all

quarters  of  the globe and cover the multifarious

business of government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items 209 to 216 inclusive provide staff for the

reorganisation  of the Office of the  Director  of

Personnel.   This   office  has   been   seriously

understaffed  with the result that staff  matters,

staff negotiations and other similar matters  have

been  considerably delayed. It is hoped  that  the

reorganisation  of  the Branch now  proposed  will

enable these matters to be speeded up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 218 seeks funds for ten Supernumerary posts

to  enable officers of the subordinate services to

be  tried  out for promotion to the Administrative

Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 233 provides, inter alia, for a small car

for  a  most  courageous  police  officer  who  is

completely  paralysed from the  waist  down  as  a

result  of  a  wound incurred in a  fight  with  a

gunman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items 220 to 232 inclusive seek provision for the

initial  steps  required for the  raising  of  the

Singapore Battalion which is regarded as a  matter

of top priority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues and I shall be happy to amplify any

of the explanations given in the Schedule. Sir,  I

beg to move.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,  I  refer to item 195, Portrait of  Sir  John

Nicoll.  It appears from the explanation that  the

Friends  of Singapore have sponsored this painting

of  Sir John Nicoll for a sum of $5,500. They have

been  able to collect only $2,100 and they  expect

or they are hoping that the City Council will bear

half  the balance and this Assembly will bear half

the balance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have no objections to people forming

quaint  societies  like the Friends  of  Singapore

amongst whose objects is the entertainment of past

and  present Governors and one of whose duties  is

to  collect  portraits of previous Governors.  But

having launched this undertaking, to come round to

the  Government  and expect it  to  pay  half  the

balance  which they cannot raise is,  to  say  the

very  least,  just  not good form.  If  they  want

kudos,  as I am sure the President of the  Friends

of Singapore, who was once A.D.C. to the Governor,

wants  kudos for paying tribute to past Governors,

then  let  them  cough up and  not  come  to  this

Assembly and ask for a vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

I am a founder and life member of this Society. It

is not a Society to entertain Governors or to give

farewell  parties and so on. The  main  object  of

this  Society is to keep the relics  of  past  and

present Singapore. It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



possible   that   they  might   have   entertained

Governors, though personally since the last  three

years   I   have  not  attended  any  meeting - none

whatsoever.  This is what I want to point  out  to

the Member for Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the principle whether or not this Society

should  come  to  the Government for  meeting  the

balance  of  the cost of a portrait of a  Governor

and   whether  the  Government  should  contribute

towards it, that is a matter of opinion. I am  not

going to express any opinion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir, I fully endorse the remarks of the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar. If the Friends of Singapore  as  a

Society sponsored this portrait, it is up to  them

to bear the expense for it and if they cannot find

the  money  themselves, then let them  go  to  the

public. A portrait of the Governor should be  paid

for  by  individual contributions from the  public

and  not through this Assembly. Let them go to the

public    and    ask   for   contributions.    The

contributions may be ten cents, a dollar  or  five

dollars individually. That should be the right way

rather than that this Assembly should be asked  to

vote  for meeting the balance of the cost of  this

portrait. I will definitely not support this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I am very sorry indeed, Sir, that this

application  for supplementary provision  has  met

with  the opposition which it has and I also  much

regret that the Friends of Singapore have come  in

for so much unjustifiable criticism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the application was received, it was

realised  that  it could well be argued  that  the

Friends  of Singapore, having voluntarily  decided

to  embark  on this project, should be allowed  to

complete  the  matter on their own.  At  the  same

time,  it  was considered that this was a somewhat

unsympathetic attitude to adopt to an  association

which has done a great deal to arouse and maintain

interest   in   the  historical  associations   of

Singapore,  which  many of  my  colleagues  and  I

regard as a most important matter. It is right and pro-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



per that Singapore should possess portraits of her

distinguished  citizens. It was a  public-spirited

move  on  the part of the Friends of Singapore  to

put  in train the matter of a portrait of Sir John

Nicoll,  who by all standards is one of  the  most

distinguished  of Singapore's citizens.  In  these

circumstances, it was considered that the  Friends

of    Singapore    deserved    some    assistance,

particularly as they are finding great  difficulty

in  raising  funds. They have made public  appeals

and   have  other  commitments  in  hand.  It  was

therefore decided that Government would contribute

half  of  the  deficit if the City  Council  would

contribute  the other half. This, I  am  happy  to

say,  the City Council has agreed to do and I  now

ask  and I am sure I will have the support of  the

Assembly that this supplementary provision  should

be approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

this  Assembly what has happened to the  equipment

<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> The explanations are there. Due to

expansion, these posts are necessary. On item 262,

the post is being filled by a Ear, Nose and Throat

Specialist; and under item 263, these  are  filled

by  local  medical practitioners who are necessary

for   the  expansion  of  the  services  of   that

particular unit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, that is most

unsatisfactory. We can all read the notes  and  we

know  that  $10  (Token) is to  try  and  get  two

private medical practitioners. What we want is  an

explanation why these things could not  have  been

foreseen when the Budget was debated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, these specialists have been

employed for some time. It was envisaged, when the

Estimates  were  drafted,  that  there  would   be

savings on vacant posts for medical officers  from

which  these specialists could be paid, but  these

posts  have  since  been  filled  and  it  is  now

necessary to take a vote to enable the payment  of

these specialists to continue. That is why we  ask

for  the  token votes. It is a simple  and  normal

procedure. That, I think, is the explanation which

I have given and it is repeated in the Schedule.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, did I

understand the Hon. the Financial Secretary to say

that the reason why this thing was not claimed  in

the  Budget  was because, at the time, there  were

substantive appointments which were not filled and

it  was  hoped that these people would  be  pushed

into those substantive appointments?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> From savings.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Paid for? I do not understand

how  this Budget is being run. I thought that  the

Assembly  is  asked to pay against specific  items

for  specific  duties. Now we  are  informed  that

there could be some form of shuffling without  the

knowledge  of this Assembly and that, although  we

are  asked  a certain vote for a particular  post,

the person who was holding the post at the time of

the  Budget debate was either just acting  or temporary  and  it was hoped that when he  moved  up,

those persons who were already then in the service

could be pushed into those posts. But how does  it

work? I do not understand this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The position is briefly this, Sir. The

establishment of the Medical Department allows for

a certain number of posts for medical officers and

provision   is  entered  against  these  posts - the

provision  which we think we will spend.  Now,  in

the  past,  when  we  have been  short  of  staff,

doctors from outside the service have been engaged

on  my authority in a purely temporary capacity to

do precisely the same job as medical officers were

intended  to do and have been paid from  the  vote

for medical officers. That is quite proper. I give

the  authority for the employment of these  people

on  a  purely temporary month-to-month  basis.  In

some  cases,  as  in this case,  they  are  merely

employed  on  payment of a fee. What  happened  in

this  particular  case was that the  Minister  for

Health,  in  framing his estimates,  thought  that

there  would still be sufficient posts and savings

available  from which these temporary  specialists

who had come to the assistance of Government could

be   paid.   It  has  now  happened   that,   with

recruitment from the University of Malaya  medical

school,  these  posts  have  been  filled.  It  is

therefore  necessary to create a vote to  pay  the

specialists.  That is why we ask for  these  token

votes.  Sir,  I  cannot explain  the  matter  more

clearly. Perhaps -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please. I think possibly

this  is  exactly  the  type  of  item  which  the

if  the  Member  for Tanjong Pagar wishes  to  say

something else, he can do so by all means.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> As I understand it now, the

position   is  this.  Take,  for  instance,   this

specialist  under item 262. At  the  time  of  the

Budget, there was somebody who was acting. It  was

thought then that savings could be made and  there

would  be  some particular Head under  which  this

person,  who was acting, could be paid. But  since

then somebody else has been recruited to fill that

particular Head, and therefore this token vote  is

necessary  to  pay the person who, it  was  hoped,

would  be pushed under that vacant Head.  But,  in

effect, what it means is this: at the time of  the

Budget, it was expected that only one person would

be  acting  in that capacity, or would  fill  that

particular post, but now two persons are doing the

job - one,  the person who filled the Head would  be

newly recruited; and, two, this person.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I agree with the Member for Tanjong

Pagar that it would be desirable in the future  if

we  have  special provision in the  Estimates  for

payments to specialists. I will bear that in  mind

in connection with the Estimates this year so that

it  will  be clear to everybody that the honoraria

or fees due to these specialists will be paid from

a specific item under Personal Emoluments Subhead.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That is elementary accounting.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The point I did make, I

think,  appears  quite clearly in  Standing  Order 61(6)  where it does state:

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I ask this question on

the  science apparatus because I am connected with

quite  a number of schools and usually the  grants

given  under this Heading are always small and  it

is quite impossible sometimes for schools to cater

for  teaching as well as for examination  purposes

and that is why I put this question.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think hon. Members have

shall not deal with the details of expenditure...",

either  the  Estimates  Committee  or  the  Public

Accounts Committee.

<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency the Governor's permission to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of $3,410,96 shall be supplied to the Government

under  the  heads  of  expenditure  and  for   the

services  specified  in Schedule  B  contained  in

Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 44 of 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, when the Development Estimates were

under discussion I said that it was unlikely  that

the Public Works Department would be able to spend

all  the money voted in the various items  in  the

Estimates. For a variety of reasons, work on  some

items would be held up and funds, and Public Works

capacity, would be available for reallocation.  If

this proved to be the case, a switch programme  of

work should be introduced. Events have turned  out

as  expected. It is now clear that there  will  be

under-expenditure  on  some  items  and  that  the

Public  Works Department will be able  to  utilise

the  funds  made  available on other  projects  of

importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedule A lists the projects on which under-expenditure will occur. The total estimated under-expenditure is over $5 millions. The reasons for

the   under-expenditure  are  explained   in   the

Schedule.  I  use  the  phrase "under-expenditure"

advisedly.  The  word "savings"  in  this  context

apparently leads to misunderstanding. In the great

majority of cases, the under-expenditure is merely

deferred  expenditure. There  are,  of  course,  a

number of cases in which the under-expenditure  is

true  saving. It will also be noted, not  only  in

Schedule  A  but  also  in Schedule  B,  that  the

original  estimate of cost has been revised  in  a

number  of  cases. It is not easy for  the  Public

Works  Department to make an accurate estimate  of

the  cost  of a new project in advance of detailed

planning  and  investigation. Many estimates  have

been  made  on the basis of a rough  guide  as  to

requirements from a department without  plans  and

without  knowledge of the site. It  is  only  when

plans and working drawings are made and when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



quantities  are  taken  and  sites  obtained   and

examined, that accurate estimates of cost  can  be

made.  Even  these sometimes have to  be  revised.

Changes  of  mind and ideas are not  unknown.  The

surprising   thing  is  not  that   the   original

estimates have to be revised but that they have to

be  revised so seldom and by so little. There are,

however,  one  or  two  cases  where  the  revised

estimate  has  differed  substantially  from   the

original. One case is that of the Polytechnic. The

original  estimate of cost shown in the  Estimates

was $5.19 millions. This was based on the estimate

made in the Gibson Report. It was taken as a rough

guide  until  a more accurate estimate,  based  on

plans, could be made. Of the $5.19 millions,  $1.4

million was for equipment for the workshops,  etc.

No  allowance  was made for quarters and  playing-fields.  Plans  were, drawn up by  the  architects

commissioned for the job and it became clear  that

the  sum of $3.8 millions would only go a part  of

the  way  towards  meeting the cost  of  essential

buildings. Later, these plans had to be revised in

the  light  of  advice obtained from the  Advisory

Council  in  London  about the  latest  trends  in

technical college buildings. Only recently has  it

been  possible  to  arrive at a  reliable  revised

estimate  of cost. This totals $11.4 millions  and

includes  $7.5  millions for  buildings  and  site

preparation;  $2½  millions  for  equipment   and

fittings;  $1  million  for  staff  quarters;  and

$500,000 for playing fields. The whole project has

been  reexamined  in the light  of  this  somewhat

startling increase in cost. Plans prepared by  the

architects  were examined with great care  by  the

Director  of  Public Works and  his  architectural

staff.  The increase in cost is due in part  to  a

substantial  rise in the cost of structural  steel

and  other  building materials,  and  in  part  to

changes  in  the  plan.  In  the  opinion  of  the

Director  of  Public Works, the maximum  economies

have been practised in planning the buildings  and

there is little opportunity for further reduction.

It  has been decided, however, to refer the  plans

once  more  to the Advisory Committee on  Building

Costs  to  find  out whether economies  cannot  be

achieved on finishes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the proposed scope of the Polytechnic has

been  examined  with a view to seeing  whether  it

could  not  be reduced, at least at the start.  As

hon.  Members are aware, it is intended  that  the

Polytechnic should teach engineering, commerce and

general    education,   science,   building    and

architecture,  pure  and applied  art,  management

and,  for women, dressmaking and cookery. However,

the   general  conclusion  reached  is   that   if

Singapore is to have the type of institution which

it undoubtedly needs, the proposed scope will have

to  be maintained and buildings of the type and on

the  scale suggested will have to be erected.  All

that  can be achieved in the way of saving  is  to

cut   out  the  proposed  canteen,  gymnasium  and

auditorium  blocks  for  the  time  being.   These

buildings,   which  are  estimated  to   cost   $2

millions,  are not essential for the operation  of

the  Polytechnic.  They can be  deferred  until  a

later   date  when  their  construction   can   be

considered  in  the  light of the  then  financial

position.  In addition, efforts will  be  made  to

reduce  expenditure on quarters by the  allocation

of Government quarters which may become surplus in

the  future. No decision has yet been  reached  on

the  question of provision of playing  fields.  In

this  way, the existing commitment can be  reduced

to   $8  millions,  that  is,  $5.5  millions  for

essential   buildings  and   $2.5   millions   for

equipment, part of which may, we hope, be obtained

from  the  Colombo  Plan and other  sources,  thus

achieving a further saving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Hospital is another case in which the

original   estimate  of  cost  has  been   revised

upwards.  In this case, the original estimate  was

merely  a  rough guess at the possible cost  of  a

district   hospital.  Since  then,  more  detailed

requirements  as to quarters, kitchens,  theatres,

hostels, etc., have been made available and it has

been  possible to make a further estimate.  Again,

site  investigation has indicated  that  extensive

and  expensive  piling will be  required  if  this

Kallang  site is to be used. Even so, this  latest

estimate  is still a rough one in the  absence  of

final  details  about the site and  of  plans  and

working



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



drawings.  The cost of the Hospital is certain  to

be   more   than   $3.2  millions  as   originally

estimated,  but  the  latest  estimate   of   $6.5

millions  should  be  regarded  with  considerable

reserve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there are a number of items in

which  the  original estimate  of  cost  has  been

reduced;  for  example, the  Mount  Vernon  Police

project,  the  Teachers Training College  and  the

Kallang Bridge - to mention only three.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedule B contains a list of the items in which

it  is  desired to use part of the surplus  funds.

These  items will utilise $3.4 millions.  Some  of

the  projects are of interest. A start  is  to  be

made   with  a  new  programme  of  six  secondary

schools: that at Bukit Panjang will commence  this

year.  A start will be made in preparing the  site

for  the  Raffles National Library. A  start  will

also  be  made  for a new institution  for  mental

defectives at Woodbridge. A postal sorting  office

at  Paya Lebar Airport should speed up the sorting

and  delivery  of mails by 24 hours. Provision  is

made  for  the  first phase of the  Geylang  flood

prevention scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall end by saying that provision will be made

in   the   1957   Development  Estimates   for   a

continuation, where necessary, of the items listed

in  Schedule B and for a continuation of the items

listed in Schedule A. Sir, I beg to move.

$880,000. The revised estimated cost is now double

estimated cost is now $1,750,000?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The answer here, I think, is that it is

proposed   an  increase  in  their  programme   of

quarters  and, consequently, the revised  estimate

other  hand,  those  items in the  1957  programme

with some interest to the explanation given by the

Hon. the Financial Secretary on the savings  made

in  respect  of the Teachers Training College  and

the great increase that is expected in the case of

the Polytechnic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, there is a great deal of public

disquiet about this Polytechnic, not only  because

they have decided now that it is going to cost $11

million. For quite some time, the public have been

wondering what progress has been going on  and  we

are  told  that  there  is a  strict  priority  of

buildings. But the public sees that buildings have

gone up for quarters to house the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



staff while no effort is being made to launch  the

building itself. There is a great deal of disquiet

also  as  to the chairmanship of this Polytechnic.

There   has  always  been  a  certain  amount   of

criticism  about the undue lavishness  with  which

those  connected with this Polytechnic  have  been

spending  public  funds,  particularly  when  they

travel  abroad.  We  want an  assurance  that  the

expenditure   that  will  be  incurred   on   this

Polytechnic will be strictly scrutinised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I am not certain whether this question

of  the  Polytechnic arises under this  particular

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please. I think the Member

for Tanjong Pagar has raised the point because  it

did  arise out of the remarks made by the Hon. the

Financial  Secretary  when  he  dealt  with   this

supplementary  provision. I myself was  not  quite

certain  whether  or  not the Hon. the  Financial

Secretary   was   in  order  in   mentioning   the

Polytechnic when we, in fact, were going  to  deal

with  Schedule B. I, for one, have not  found  any

item  in  Schedule B dealing with the  Polytechnic

but  the  remarks,  I take it,  by  the  Hon. the

Financial Secretary were merely incidental  and  I

think  the Member for Tanjong Pagar was  quite  in

order in commenting on those remarks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, my remarks about the Polytechnic

came  under  the question of the revision  of  the

I feel that in all probability the remarks made by

my  hon. Friend the Member for Tanjong Pagar  more

appropriately come under general discussion of the

motion, but since he has raised them now, I  would

like   to  say  that  we  are  conscious  of   the

accusations  and  criticisms  of  alleged   lavish

expenditure in connection with the Polytechnic.  I

have

We  have  here  on  pages 2 to 14  certain  items,

particularly  Postal Services,  where  there  have

been  some  deletions and we are now dealing  with

supplementary provision from page 15 onwards. Now,

I  have  some  important comments to make  on  the

Postal Services regarding the deletions and  I  do

not know the appropriate time to make them.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The item we are on is item 337.

which  deals  with  New  Subhead-Post  Office  and

Quarters  at  Pulau Semakau. The hon. Member  must

confine his remarks to that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Yes, Sir, but that estimate is made

arising  out of certain deletions. Is it in  order

for me to deal with these deletions?

continue with his submission?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, under the Head, Postal Services,

on   page  11  it  is  noted  that  the  estimated

expenditure  during 1956 for the  Post  Office  in

Jalan  Kayu  is only $25,000. I must  remind  this

House, Sir, that the sum of $80,000 was voted for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



this  Post Office sometime in 1954 and there have

been  delays. I was given to understand that there

was some delay in acquiring the land but, I think,

Sir, this delay of nearly two years is beyond  the

comprehension of anybody. The people are  entirely

dissatisfied  and  I would have thought  that  the

Post  Office  could  have been completed,  at  the

latest,  by  1956.  No amount of  explanation  can

convince  me,  Sir, because there  is  a  standard

specification  for these rural  post  offices  and

only  some  supervision is needed  by  the  Public

Works  Department. Yet we see that the Post Office

is not built.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I am afraid I cannot add to the

explanation given on page 11, Sir, which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As the site for this Post Office (Jalan Kayu)

has only now been finally approved work will start

later in the year than was originally expected."



<br><br>The  site  has been obtained and work will  start.

More than that I cannot say.

very   carefully  looked  into  by  the  Estimates

Committee,  because  it  does  appear  that   hon.

<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I am myself slightly puzzled, Mr

Chairman. I have got a note here which might be of

a  little help. The basic trouble with the site in

Jalan Kayu has been because a number of cooks have

been  stirring away and muddling it up and it  had

been  very  hard  to get a final decision  because

people  wanted  it  here or there,  or  there,  or

there, and once the site was finally decided, then

we  had  to get the squatters off it and  all  the

places of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



acquisition. It is very regrettable that  we  have

this trouble with sites again and again. We had it

with the new City Exchange and Telephone Board. We

are  always getting it and we shall have to go  on

plugging   away   with  our  land  clearance   and

resettlement  trying to get the sites  quickly  so

that we can go on with these development jobs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I would like

to  refer to item 345 where we are told there will

be  a further expenditure of $40,000 to carry  out

certain works requested by the Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, many of us have spent over a year

in  this  building  and we are somewhat  disturbed

that  so  much money has been spent  on  this  old

building. In spite of all the replastering inside,

the  damp is seeping through, particularly in  the

Commonwealth Parliamentary Association  room,  and

every three or four months, we see carpenters  and

painters having to spend more public money to keep

up  the appearance of this building. I would  like

very much to know on what this $40,000 is going to

be  spent.  Is this in connection with  the  stone

from  Westminster that was taken in here, or  what

is it for? As I have said, unless it is absolutely

necessary, I think it is unwise to sink more money

into this building.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I understand that the money is required

for extensions to the seating accommodotion of the

Strangers'  Gallery,  certain alterations  outside

the Chamber and the provision of extra



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



furniture for the Assembly House. As far as  I  am

aware,  no  part  of  this provision  is  for  the

eradication of damp or for the maintenance of  the

building. It is primarily for capital works.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Can we know how many more will

be accommodated by these alterations? It is not  a

project  that we are opposed to if, in  fact,  the

money  is to be spent to arrange for more  seating

accommodation for the public and for  the  comfort

of those who have to work in this building, but we

would  like to know how many more are expected  to

be accommodated by these alterations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I regret, Sir, that I cannot answer

that  question offhand. I suggest that since  this

is  a matter involving measures which you yourself

have  put  in  train,  if any questions  arise  in

connection  with them, they should be referred  to

the  House  Committee and they should not  be  the

subject of a debate here.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, would it not be wise to

postpone the implementation of this item  in  view

of  the  coming elections for 50 Members  and  the

consequent  extension of the Gallery? I  think  it

will be wise not to spend the money at the present

time.  Would  the  Hon. the  Financial  Secretary

consider this?

is incurred under this vote.

their  welfare generally by providing medical  and

surgical    treatment,   education   in   nautical

subjects,  and the granting of relief  to  members

draw the hon. Member's attention to Standing Order 24, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a Member desires to alter the terms of a

motion  standing  in his name, he  may  do  so  by

giving  to the Clerk an amended notice of  motion,

provided  that such alteration does  not,  in  the

opinion  of  the  Speaker or in  his  absence  the

Deputy  Speaker,  materially alter  any  principle

embodied  in  the  original motion  or  the  scope

thereof. The amended



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



notice  shall  run  from the  time  at  which  the

original notice was given."



<br><br>The motion, of course, incorporates the Rules and

it would have been correct if the hon. Member had

given notice as required by Standing Order 24.

Will the hon. Member first indicate what his

amendments are?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I think it may be helpful if

we ask the Minister for Labour and Welfare to come

in and help instead of wasting time.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. I am just trying to

get this straightened out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the hon. Member would like to adjourn

consideration  for  a  few minutes?  We  can  then

proceed  with  the other two items  on  the  Order Paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mak Pak Shee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mak Pak Shee:</b> As you please, Mr Speaker, Sir.

standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with subsection

(2)   of  section  490  of  the  Merchant  Shipping

Ordinance   (Chapter  207),  resolves   that   the

Merchant  Shipping (Passenger Certificate  Partial

No.  55  dated 17th August, 1956, as contained  in

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Deliberately left comment -->Hon. Members will recall that, at the February

sitting of this Assembly, I moved a similar motion

to  bring into force fees laid down for survey  of

parts of the machinery and equipment of ships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion, Sir, now seeks to enforce the

Notification in the Gazette made on  the  17th  of

August  for fees laid down for partial surveys  of

the  internal and external hulls of ships.  It  is

anticipated  that, in the near future,  owners  of

passenger vessels registered in the United Kingdom

may call upon us to survey



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



parts  of the internal hull of a ship and we  also

expect  them to call upon us to survey  parts  of

the external hull of ships. This is the first time

that  such  partial surveys will be recognised  by

the  Ministry of Transport and Civil  Aviation  in

the  United Kingdom as going towards a full survey

for a Passenger Safety Certificate to be issued by

the United Kingdom Government. The opportunity has

also  been taken to see that these fees are  fixed

as  a  fair proportion of the full prescribed fees

for  the complete survey of hulls. Sir, I  beg  to

move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I second the motion. Question

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with subsection

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a straightforward matter. The

Registration of Deeds (Amendment) Ordinance, 1956,

which  came  into operation on the 20th  of  June,

1956, gave legal sanction to the inspection by the

public  of  microfilm copies of deeds  instead  of

original  copies. The amendment of  the  Ordinance

made  necessary a few consequential amendments  to

the  Registration of Deeds Rules,  1934,  and  the

approval of this Assembly for these amendments  is

required under section
