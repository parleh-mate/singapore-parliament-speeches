   <b>TRAINING COURSES TO UPGRADE</b>

   <b>TECHNOLOGICAL SKILLS</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Prime Minister what plans are in hand to provide training courses to upgrade the technological skills in the more sophisticated
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> industries as well as to enable workers to acquire higher skills.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar (Acting Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Social Affairs (Dr Ahmad Mattar) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of ITB's objectives is to provide the skilled manpower required by manufacturing industries, particularly the new and technologyintensive industries. All ITB courses are therefore structured to provide broad-based practical and theoretical grounding in each trade area so that its graduates can be more readily developed on-the-job as specialised skilled workers to the requirements of each firm.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter depends on the foresight and response of industry as well. The Board's Apprenticeship and Placement Division carries out an active programme of visiting firms to discuss their manpower needs. 251 firms were contacted during 1977 and a total of 61 firms currently have apprenticeship programmes with ITB. In addition 12 ad hoc courses were conducted during the year specially tailored to the requirements of firms.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anticipation of the extending range of sophisticated skills training required, ITB has,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> at a total cost of $4.4 million, developed new workshops and facilities to provide higher-level training in Instrumentation and Control Mechanics, Automotive Engineering and Plant Mechanics and the Shipbuilding and Repairing trades. The requirements for additional facilities for precision metal engineering and tool and die-making are also being examined. The latter are already being provided for by the three existing Government-Industry Joint Training Centres. Agreement in principle has also been reached with the Japanese Government for another centre for sophisticated electrical and electronics skills training. All the facilities and services of ITB are available to industry at subsidised cost.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ITB also conducts an extensive range of part-time and day release courses for upgrading workers employed in relevant trades. Currently there are 31 part-time and day release programmes with a total enrolment of 2,021. These courses will be extended as areas of skill upgrading are identified by the Board's 10 Trade Advisory Committees on which Industry is represented.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could the Hon. Minister describe the types of apprenticeship schemes? Moreover, since some firms are currently having apprenticeship programmes with ITB, could the Minister also indicate the number of apprentices and type of such apprenticeship that they have?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Sir, at present ITB conducts three types of apprenticeship training schemes: the Integrated Apprenticeship Scheme, the On-the-Job Training Supplemented by Theoretical Instruction Scheme, and the Direct On-the-Job Training Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first scheme consists of two parts. Part I of the scheme is a full-time institutional training at a vocational institute. Part 11 consists of on-the-job training.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the scheme, employers are encouraged to recruit apprentices well in advance in anticipation of projected manpower needs and to sponsor them through a period of full-time institutional training prior to on-the-job training. The institutional training period can either be of six months or one year duration. It is possible to tailor the training to meet the requirements of employers. After the period of institutional training, apprentices are normally put through a two-year period of on-the-job training on the shop floor. Such training on the job is to enable the apprentices to learn progressively as he works.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the On-the-Job Training Supplemented by Theoretical Instruction Scheme, the apprentices are placed on a two-year on-the-job training supplemented by theoretical instructions provided by employers on part-time day release courses at a vocational institute.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Direct On-the-Job Training Scheme is for employers who are unable to provide theoretical instructions or release apprentices for part-time or day release courses. They are encouraged to launch this third scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the Member's second supplementary question, there are at the moment 3,537 apprentices currently undergoing training with ITB. Of the 3,537 apprentices in training, 44% are under SASAR (Singapore Association of Shipbuilders and Repairers), 26% are in the Government-industry Joint Training Centres, and 17% in SIA (Singapore Airlines).

  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist</b> asked the Minister for Health (i) the separate yearly breakdown figures for the last three years of persons X-rayed by the Singapore Anti-Tuberculosis Association, Government hospitals and others for the purpose of detecting tuberculosis; and (ii) the separate yearly breakdown figures for the last three years of cases of tuberculosis notified by SATA,

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Health (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the number of persons X-rayed from 1974 to 1977 was 365,971; 381,642; 402,593 and 295,712 respectively.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of tuberculosis cases notified for the years 1975 to 1977 by Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Other Government Hospitals and Outpatient Dispensaries, SATA, private medical practitioners and through the Registry of Births and Deaths was 3,097, 2,813 and 2,747 respectively.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given to the Clerk a breakdown of the statistical details (Cols. 721 - 722), and he will make them available to Members if they so desire.

  <!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Does the Hon. Minister realise that SATA was founded in 1947 with the specific objective of promoting measures for the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis? Thirty-one years later, it would appear from a recent statement (Straits Times, Monday, 27th February, 1978) by the Chairman of the Flag Day Committee of SATA that "TB still remains a scourge." Does the Minister not realise that this is an indictment on the non-success of SATA's programmes? Could we have some comments on this, please?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The Member for Potong Pasir should understand that I am not responsible for SATA. SATA is an independent body.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> But the Ministry of Social Affairs is still giving them a grant of $25,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I am very sorry the Ministry of Social Affairs gives them that grant. The Member for Potong Pasir would like to know further that SATA is not solely involved in screening tuberculosis cases. It is also involved in "clinics" which look after lungs and hearts as well.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Could the Minister then recommend to the Ministry of Social Affairs that this $25,000 grant be used instead to solve the drug problem in Singapore?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I would suggest that the Member for Potong Pasir make that appeal to the Minister for Social Affairs. I would not like to be accused of being an unkind person.

  <b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b> asked the Minister for Health, in view of the inadequate space at the existing Tiong Bahru Outpatient Dispensary at Jalan Membina, whether he has any plans for the expansion of that Dispensary in order to ease the overcrowding.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, the Ministry was aware as early as 1976 that there was overcrowding at the Tiong Bahru Outpatient Department. Now we are in the Year of our Lord 1978. It has taken us two years of correspondence to-ing and fro-ing between the officials of my Ministry and the Housing and Development Board, so that they can allocate us two suitable units of flats to be rented to us. Then we have got to correspond with the Senior Architect (Works and Buildings) and the Senior Architect's plan has got to be handed to the Housing and Development Board's architects for their approval. We also have to approach the Government Building Committee for approval to rent the two units of Housing and Development Board flats. Then we have to approach Budget Division to seek the release of funds so that renovation work can be put up. All I can say is that, after two long last years, I can assure the Member for Tiong Bahru that the Outpatient Dispensary in his constituency will see some improvement in the year 1978.

  <br>
  <br> Communications what action is being taken to ease the traffic congestion at the junctions in front of Mount Alvernia Hospital, and whether it is feasible to construct a new road from Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 passing through Peirce Reservoir Reserve and joining Upper Bukit Timah Road, to alleviate the traffic congestion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for</b>
  <b>National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the peak period congestion at the two intersections in front of Mount Alvernia Hospital is caused primarily by heavy peak hour traffic approaching from the various major roads, namely, Upper Thomson Road, Braddell Road, Thomson Road and Lornie Road.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following measures have been taken to ease the congestion:-
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) an additional lane has been provided to allow traffic from Braddell Road to turn right into Upper Thomson Road.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) an additional lane has also been provided along the Upper Thomson Road approach to the Upper Thomson Road/Lornie Road intersection to, cater for traffic from Upper Thomson Road to Lornie Road.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the bus stop has been shifted from its original position in front of the Mount Alvernia Hospital to a lay-by nearer the traffic junction. This will reduce interference to traffic as the buses will be stopping off the main kerb.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the North-South Arterial Road from Avenue 1 /Avenue 6 Ang Mo Kio to Thomson Road is being constructed. Much of the traffic from Ang Mo Kio using Upper Thomson Road at present is expected to be diverted to this new road when it is completed in October 1979.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no plans for the westward extension of Avenue 1 Ang Mo Kio through the Peirce Reservoir Reserve to link up with Upper Bukit Timah Road. The extension would disturb the quiet environment of the reservoir. The existing links between Upper Thomson Road/Sembawang Road and Bukit

  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee</b> asked the Minister for National Development and Communications what will be the area around the new Changi International Airport which will have adverse noise effect on the residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (for the Minister</b>
  <b>for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, tolerance to noise is very subjective in nature. It varies from person to person and from
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> community to community. Nevertheless the planners had given serious consideration to noise generated by aircraft during landings and take-offs when drawing up the Master Plan for Changi Airport. The second runway for Changi Airport will be constructed on reclaimed land so that all landings and take-offs from this runway will be over water. This means less noise to residents living near the Airport. Landings and take-offs from the first runway will generate some noise for residents living near the Airport.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study of the noise that is generated by the noisier aircraft such as the Boeing 707 or DC 8 during landings and take-offs from the first runway, indicates that only those areas close to Somapah Road, Wing Loong Road and that stretch of Upper Changi Road from Wing Loong Road to the northern coastline would have Perceived Noise Levels about
  <br>
  <br>100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PNdb. This is approximately the noise level produced by a nearby power lawnmower. As a matter of interest, this is less than the noise produced by a rock-n-roll band (105 PNdb). Sir, I am tabling in the Library a detailed plan showing the anticipated noise level around Changi Airport for Members to study.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, the noisier aircraft are the Boeing 707 and the DC 8. The wide-bodied aircraft like the Boeing 747, the DC 10, the Lockheed 1011, and the Airbus are much quieter. Most airlines are now using more and more quieter aircraft. Furthermore, all new aircraft manufactured on or after 1st January 1976 are required by international standards to be just as quiet, if not more so, than the wide-bodied aircraft. The older and noisier Boeing 707s and DC 8s are being gradually phased out. Presently, 30% of the aircraft passing through Singapore are in the "noisy" category. By 1982, this is expected to drop to only about 20%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending on the amount and pattern of traffic, the Department of Civil Aviation may be able to confine all aircraft movements after midnight to the second runway, thus further reducing the noise level.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Baptist:</b> Sir, a supplementary question. Is it not true that Changi Airport
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> will have heavier traffic with greater frequency? This would most certainly increase the noise exposure duration to the people in Somapah Road and the areas nearby. If the noise level is 100 db or more and if the duration is for more than six hours, there would be a possibility of Noise Induced Deafness for the people living in those areas. What plans has the Minister in mind to ensure that the people living there do not contract Noise Induced Deafness?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, would the Member for Potong Pasir not agree that it is better that the airport is now moved to Changi than to remain at Paya Lebar where the effect on the population there would be greater?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, we have the choice of two runways to select from in the future whereby the noisier aircraft will be diverted to use the second runway. I agree with the Member that the frequency will increase but it is not a constant exposure over a period of six hours. The peak period would be in the evenings and this would be controlled through careful management when we move to Changi.

  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Haig Road Market was built by the Housing and Development Board. It has 125 market produce stalls selling goods like fish and meat and articles of daily necessities. In addition to this, there are 72 cooked food stalls to cater for the needs of the residents in the new housing estate. As this is a new market, it will take some time for business to pick up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Geylang Serai Market at Jalan Pasar Baru is an old market managed by the Ministry of the Environment. It has 225 market produce stalls and 85 cooked food stalls and these are adequate to serve the people in the area. Any further increase of market produce hawkers in the market could affect the viability of the business of the existing hawkers. We will then be faced with more complaints.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not advisable to transfer the hawkers, as mentioned by the hon. Member, as putting market produce and cooked food hawkers in separate markets would not only affect the business of the hawkers but also cause inconvenience to residents who will have to travel longer distances for their requirements.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also insufficient space in Geylang Serai market to accommodate all the market produce hawkers from Haig Road market. Moreover, such a move would involve major alterations to the stalls in both markets at great cost.

However, such detectors have been installed in some commercial and industrial buildings as part of their centralised fire detection system. Since September 1974, when the Radiation Protection Act came into force, the Radiation Protection lnspectorate of the Ministry of Science and Technology, has imposed strict licensing control over distributors on the use and sale of these detectors. But recently, battery operated ionization smoke detectors for use in the home have appeared in the world market for sale to the general public. In Singapore such detectors have not been allowed to be sold freely.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some studies have been carried out by the Radiation Protection Inspectorate on the possible danger to the users and to the general public.

  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Member is aware, the main problem of these detectors is, as he has put it, the disposal. Obviously the manufacturers will have to provide proper disposal measures before these detectors are sold or allowed to be sold on retail in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, does the Hon. Minister realise that about 75% of all fires in the homes begin as smouldering fires and the smoky fires which result are responsible for the fire fatalities? Consumer product tests show that photo-electric smoke detectors, the safer ones and no radiation possibilities, are more sensitive to smouldering fires than the ionization type. Why therefore risk the possibility of radiation contamination by allowing the ionization type detectors to be marketed?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Barker:</b> We have not allowed the ionization detectors to be marketed.

  <!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> The Minister has mentioned that they are available.
  <br>
  <br>

  <b>Mr Barker:</b> They are available but under very strict control. In fact, the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in its draft report has recommended the unrestricted use of home smoke detectors provided they observe strict safety requirements. When the report is published, the Ministry will review the situation whether to exempt users from licensing requirements. But until then, we must have a strict supervision, licensing and, as the Member wants, proper maintenance.
  <br>
  <br>

  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Senior Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, contributions to the Central Provident Fund of a deceased person are liable to duty under the Estate Duty Act. For purposes of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> calculating the duty payable, the contributions are aggregated with the deceased's estate. Estate duty is payable on the value of the estate in excess of $100,000 whether or not the estate comprises wholly of CPF contributions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no compelling reason to accord special treatment to CPF contributions from the other assets of a person who dies before the age of 55. Moreover, the provisions of the Estate Duty Act do not discriminate on grounds of age of a deceased person.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, other forms of provisions for old age and dependants, such as insurance policies, family homes and superannuation or retirement benefits also do not enjoy special consideration for estate duty purposes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions to the Central Provident Fund are exempt from income tax up to a limit of $4,000 a year, which is generous enough. Contributions by employers are tax deductible, and at the same time do not incur income tax for the beneficiaries. It is difficult therefore to justify additional tax concessions for CPF contributions under the Estate Duty Act. That Act does not provide either for special concessions for those who die before their 55th year, and I see no reason to make an exception for CPF contributions.

  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17.
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Finance (a) how many taxpayers in the years 1975 to 1977 did not receive reliefs from income tax for sums in excess of $4,000 paid by them in respect of Central Provident Fund contributions and life assurance premiums; and (b) if the CPF contributions of a taxpayer exceed $4,000, will the Minister consider allowing income tax relief for the full amount contributed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the total number of taxpayers who enjoyed the maximum relief of $4,000 a year in respect of CPF contributions and life assurance premiums
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> were 5,700 for 1975, 9,689 for 1976 and 12,665 for 1 977. They represent 2.6%, 4.0% and 4.5% of the total number of taxpayers for the three years respectively.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceiling of $4,000, as I have indicated in my earlier reply, is already generous. Moreover, the CPF member does not suffer income tax on his employer's contributions to CPF on his behalf whatever the amount. I would also draw attention to the income tax reductions in this year's Budget Statement which, in absolute terms, benefit most those taxpayers paying more than $4,000 into the CPF. In view of this, we do not intend to grant further relief to these taxpayers as suggested by the Member for Punggol.

  <!-- Mr Tan Cheng San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.
  <b>Mr Tan Cheng San</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that the monthly take-home pay of some employees of statutory boards has been affected as a result of the consolidation of the 1973-77 National Wages Council allowances into salary scales and if he will consider taking steps to ensure that the take-home pay of those employees is not so affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure the hon. Member for Paya Lebar that no officer in the Civil Service or the statutory boards loses out in terms of gross salary as a result of the consolidation of the 1973-77 National Wages Council allowances into salary scales. The new consolidated scales and conversion tables were so formulated that, generally, an officer would not convert to a consolidated salary point which is less than the sum of his basic salary and 1973-77 NWC allowances. In the few exceptional cases where the consolidated salary is lower than the sum of the basic salary and allowances of the officer concerned, he is allowed to retain the difference as an allowance personal to himself.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that, in referring to the statutory board employees, the hon. Member has in mind the cessation of the Temporary Adjustment Allowance. This Allowance was introduced in April 1972 for employees of certain statutory boards when Government decided to increase the CPF superannuation benefits of pensionable civil servants by a 2% contribution to the CPF. Non-pensionable civil servants had their rate of contribution increased from 10% to 12%. The Allowance of 2% was given to employees of these statutory boards because the rate of superannuation contributions of these employees was already 15% of their basic salaries. Under the CPF Scheme, the superannuation contributions are computed on gross salaries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the statutory boards concerned have now switched over to CPF and the superannuation benefits of their employees are at 15 1/2% of gross salaries, as is the case for other Government and statutory board employees on CPF, the justification for paying the Allowance no longer exists. Even in the two statutory boards which have retained their own superannuation schemes, the employer's contribution to the superannuation fund is now not less than under the CPF scheme. Finally, the continued payment of the Allowance will place these statutory board employees in a privileged position in that they will be compensated for a rate of CPF contributions which now applies to all Government and statutory board employees on CPF.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cessation of the Allowance is really a separate matter from the salary consolidation. The timing of the cessation of the Allowance has, unfortunately, given rise to the erroneous impression that it is as a result of the salary consolidation.

  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19.
  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee</b> asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether he will request the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board to arrange with tour agencies for more east coast tours to include Changi Village, as the present number of tours per month is inadequate to enhance the shopkeepers' business in the Housing and Development Board flats in the Village; and (b) whether he will request the STPB to arrange for some cultural performances in the park near the HDB flats as entertainment for tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (STPB) has been working closely with tour operators and travel agents to promote Changi Village as a tourist stopover point. In April 1977, STPB inaugurated a "special interest" Changi and East Coast Tour. As an incentive, all tourists who visit Changi Village in any each coast conducted tour are given a free drink coupon by STPB.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, eight major travel agents in Singapore conduct regular east coast tours to Changi Village and other places of interest like Selarang Barracks, East Coast Lagoon, Changi Murals and Changi Prison. The number of tours per month to Changi Village has increased from 96 in April 1977 to 104 in February this year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The STPB will continue to work closely with tour operators to increase the number of tourists visiting Changi Village. Besides existing activities, the Board will also be helping to finance part of a project to beautify Changi Village.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the most popular cultural performance for tourists is the Instant Asia Cultural Show. The STPB is building a cultural theatre behind Handicraft Centre in the vicinity of Orchard Road to promote more cultural programmes in Singapore. When the building is completed, it is planned to stage the Instant Asia Cultural Show there, as it is the most convenient location for tourists and easily accessible to locals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While most of the future cultural performances promoted by STPB will be centred in the new cultural theatre or in hotels and convention centres for special conventions, the STPB will be requested to look into the possibility of arranging occasional cultural performances in parks near Housing and Development Board estates for tourists and locals as part of its cultural development programme.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.
  <br>3.20 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1954 the People's Action Party, in enunciating its determination to strive for a more just and equal society for all citizens, spelt out this fundamental principle in its Constitution in the following terms, and I quote: -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To abolish the unjust inequalities of wealth and opportunity inherent in the present system; to establish an economic order which will give to all citizens the right to work and full economic returns for their labour and skill; to ensure a decent living, and social security to all those who through sickness, infirmity or old age can no longer work.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This basic objective was steadfastly adhered to when our Party first came to power to form the Government and the financial policies of the Government were directed towards this end. There were inevitably some minor modifications in procedures from time to time, to meet changing situations, but we did not swerve from our declared principles of democratic socialism - for a more just and equal society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understandable since ours is an open economy that we should take into account international situations and take the necessary precautions to cushion our Republic and our people from the adverse effects of conditions that arise from time to time in our region and on the international scene. We have rightly developed an economy which can be described as a capitalist-socialist mix, Such an economy is required for our survival.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last few years, however, Mr Speaker, Sir, we have observed a disturbing trend towards rank capitalistic practices, with no corresponding countervailing action to maintain our socialistic objectives. These changes in policy have been rationalised as being necessary for our continued economic growth in the face of changing world
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> situations. And the people of Singapore, having confidence in our Government which has led us through difficult times and given us a higher living and continued economic and social development despite the many problems that have beset us from time to time, have accepted the new strategies of the Government as being the inevitable concomitance of development and economic progress for their continued welfare.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mr Speaker, Sir, the budget of the Minister for Finance represents a major departure from the fundamental principle of the People's Action Party for a more just and equal society. It is obvious that this budget is a capitalistic budget, for the benefit of the rich and the affluent. It is a budget aimed at making the rich richer and the poor poorer, negating the fundamental principle of socialism.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is evident from a glance at the proposed tax schedules that the so called "tax concessions" are calculated to mainly benefit those in the upper income brackets. The new tax rates clearly indicate that it is only those who draw above $35,000 a year are the real beneficiaries of the reductions in the income tax rates. Those in the lower income brackets get practically nothing except what may be termed a "token concession". It would appear that the token concessions for those in the lower income brackets are merely to justify the substantial concession for those in the higher income brackets. It is difficult to understand the rationale of the Hon. Minister for Finance for this unprecedented budget.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has informed us that the Consumer Price Index has increased by 3.2% since last year. It will be appreciated that the Consumer Price Index variations are of greater concern to those in the lower income brackets - any increase in the Consumer Price Index will affect them more than those in the higher income brackets. But the tax reduction for those in the lower income group - those who really need concessions - is only around 1% to 2%. It will be evident, therefore, that the so-called "tax reduction" for those with small incomes has been more than eroded by the increase in the Consumer Price
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Index. This means that the larger section of the society - those at the bottom of the economic scale - will be worse off this year than last year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, 1977 was a difficult year and we were asked to work harder and to be more prudent in our spending habits, and to accept certain other constraints, in the interests of national survival. This we all did cheerfully and collectively. The end-result was that, as a consequence of the cooperation and co-ordination of the efforts of the Government, Labour and Management, our economy grew by 7.8%. It is a credit to all concerned.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it would seem from the Hon. Finance Minister's budget that he seeks to reward only management and those in the higher income brackets through tax concessions. What about the poor working class? Do they not also merit some consideration? But no. Their pittance is 1% to 2% which has already been wiped out by the rise in the Consumer Price Index of 3.2%; whereas the more affluent and the rich get tax reductions of up to 18%. Where then is the equality in treatment? Are we not still dedicated to a more just and equal society?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I find the budget even more puzzling because in 1976, when the Consumer Price Index dropped by 1.9%, there was apparently no need for tax increases in the 1977 budget. But now that the Consumer Price Index increased last year by 3.2% bringing with it attendant hardship to those in the lower income brackets, the Minister for Finance has chosen to add insult to injury by increasing the tax on telephones, televisions, cars, etc. - small amenities which bring happiness to workers when they are able to afford a little luxury here and there. It would appear then that the intention is to make the working class pay dearly for the small pleasures of life. They will feel acutely the additional tax burden, especially as the illusory tax concessions for them - the 1% to 2% - have already been wiped out by the rise in the Consumer Price Index. It is clear, therefore, that they were better off last year when there were no income tax reductions.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the last few years several voices have been raised in this House urging that the personal relief of $2,000 which was fixed in 1948 at the inception of income tax in Singapore, and has remained stagnant since then, be raised in view of the inflation that has taken place during the last three decades. All our representations, which reflect the sentiments, especially of those in the lower income brackets, have fallen on deaf ears, as far as the Ministry of Finance is concerned.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various excuses have been given to reject any increase in the personal relief. It would seem that this inflexible attitude is because wage earners are captives in the income tax net. The Income Tax Department finds them easy prey, although the revenue collected from those in the lower income brackets is minimal in terms of the $3,400 million collected by the Income Tax Department last year. The fact that a disproportionate amount of manpower is required to collect this minimal tax does not bother the Income Tax Department.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be noted that on this rare occasion, in justifying the income tax concessions for those in the higher income brackets, the Minister for Finance has had at last conceded that he has taken into account the matter of inflation. I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fuelling this tendency was the effect of inflation, relatively mild in Singapore, which has pushed some income earners at all levels into higher taxation brackets."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now that at last the Minister for Finance has conceded that there is inflation in the context of income tax, has he taken into account how this inflation has hit those in the lower income brackets and eroded the purchasing power of their hard-earned dollar? The 1% to 2% tax reduction for those in the lower income bracket is a mockery in the face of the rise in the cost of living and inflation during the last 30 years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One wonders at times whether the Minister for Finance is at all concerned with the views expressed in this House, or
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> whether he is solely guided by the advice of his bureaucracy? I say this because on the one hand, although there have been frequent requests in this House for increasing the personal relief, the Minister for Finance has chosen to ignore the views of elected representatives. On the other hand, out of the blue, he has chosen to lower the rate of income tax for the benefit of those in the higher income brackets, although there was no representation in this House for such a change. One wonders what prompted the Minister to do this. Perhaps he has his own advisors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am astounded at the rationale given for the concessions for those in the higher income bracket. I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aggravating the problem of equity or fairness in sharing the tax burden is the ability of many self-employed professionals to incorporate themselves into companies in order to sell their personal services, and thereby quite legally avoid paying tax at more than 40%, the company rate. Professionals and executives working for the public sector on salaries are unable to take advantage of this loophole in the law. Nor do they enjoy the perks of tax free 'expenses'."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am appalled at this argument. This is tantamount to saying that because some of those in the professions are organising themselves into corporations and have thus been able to avoid paying a higher rate of income tax, the Government has to grant them income tax concessions although they are perfectly within their rights to band themselves into companies. In any case, it is not at all certain that they are forming themselves into companies to avoid a higher rate of income tax. They may well be organising themselves into companies because the boom is over and money is more tight, thus making it more prudent and profitable for them to work in groups.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the tendency for many self-employed professionals to "incorporate themselves into companies in order to sell their personal services" is as old as the hills. A large number of the older professionals incorporated themselves into companies many, many years ago, after working independently for a few years. This is a natural process among professionals. The
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ambitious young professional prefers to operate alone for a few years in the open market to prove his worth. After a few years, having demonstrated the value of his services, he seeks a greater measure of stability by getting together with a few colleagues and incorporating themselves into a company, so that collectively not only do they have greater security, but are able to offer more expertise by pooling their talents and resources. A closer examination of the newer companies will probably show that it is the younger generation who are now incorporating themselves into companies. This is a logical development. But the Hon. Minister for Finance appears to have misconstrued the situation and having been unduly alarmed by his misconception, has been stampeded into making concessions for fears which are absolutely unfounded.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also astounded by the argument that tax reductions at the upper levels of income are necessary because "professionals and executives working for the public sector on salaries are unable to take advantage of this loophole in the law" and that they do not enjoy the "perks of tax free expenses".
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in regard to salaries it should be remembered that Government salary scales and allowances especially for professionals have increased considerably in recent years with rapid promotions so as to bring them almost at par with their colleagues in the private sector. Therefore, there is no need for those in the public sector to seek any "loophole" because at present under the existing tax schedule, they are subject to the same levels of taxation as their colleagues in the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the so-called "perks of tax free expenses", what exactly are they? Is the Minister referring to entertainment allowance or the use of the company car? Or the company house? Surely all these perks have to be declared by those in the private sector to the Comptroller of Income Tax, and my understanding is that they are also taken into account in assessing the income tax payable. An entertainment allowance has to be justified as being necessary for the promotion of business.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case comparable facilities are also available to senior officials in the public sector. My understanding of the situation is that if they have to entertain on official business, funds could be made available, provided the Minister for Finance is satisfied that such entertainment is necessary. Senior civil servants go abroad on official business at Government expense in the same way as their counterparts in the private sector proceed on company business. It is obvious, therefore, that the so-called perks are also available to the professionals in the public sector and if perchance the rules for these perks are a bit too rigid they could perhaps be liberalised by administrative action. Thus parity in treatment could be achieved without having to reduce the taxation rates in the upper income brackets and widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a few years ago at an UNCTAD meeting our Ministerial representative, in protesting against certain GATT regulations, pointed out that the end-result of certain regulations was that the rich countries were becoming richer and the poor countries poorer. He underscored the need for a revision in the existing regulations so as to close the gap between the rich nations and the poor nations. That was indeed necessary. But while on the one hand, we are seeking a more equitable distribution of wealth on a global scale, on the other hand, in our own Republic, new taxation scales are being introduced to make rich Singaporeans richer and poor Singaporeans poorer. There appears to be a contradiction in our approach.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to turn to another weak excuse given by the Minister for Finance to justify the increase in tax to meet the shortfalls created by reductions in income tax rates. I refer to the 150,000 people who, he says, should be paying tax on their income but do not do so because they are self-employed and keep no accounts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Income Tax Department has been in existence for nearly 30 years and if at the end of 30 years they still say that they are unable to assess the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> income of 150,000 people, that is to say, another 50% of the existing number of 300,000 taxpayers, then something is radically wrong with the department. Or the Income Tax Department is content only to collect tax from law-abiding citizens while letting those who are clever enough to get away scot-free. This is a most inequitable situation. It is high time that those responsible bestirred themselves and made an effort to ensure that all Singaporeans are treated equally before the Income Tax law.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is an old Chinese saying that "a journey of a thousand miles begins with the first stop". Has the first step been taken by the Income Tax Department in this direction? They have had 30 years to work on this problem and I feel sure that the 300,000 captives of the Income Tax Department would be glad to learn whether they are paying a higher rate of income tax because there are 150,000 income tax evaders whom the Income Tax Department have so far been unable to reach and give parity of treatment in the matter of income tax.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it may well be that this budget could be the proverbial straw to break the camel's back.

  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1976 we had a GDP growth rate of 7% and in 1977, which is generally considered a difficult year, we have bettered our economic performance to finish up with a growth rate of 7.8%. Little wonder that with such consistently good track record we are having difficulties convincing people that we are still a developing country. Our position is an exceptional one, so we say, and we should not be judged on the sole criterion of per capita income level. We have a good cause and let us hope that we succeed in our arguments with the world at large. However, what I am concerned about is not so much what outsiders come to regard us although this is important; what is equally, if not more,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> important is how our own citizens view the economic situation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite forecasts of difficulties, we have had good news year after year of continued growth so much so that I suspect that a large number of our citizens do not really take seriously the repeated exhortation to work hard and to prepare for hard times ahead. They have come to take for granted, "Come what may, the political leadership will be there to take care of things". To these people, 'energy crisis', 'stagflation' or 'protectionism' are no more than meaningless jargons. Frankly I do not blame them for their indifference to the economic realities and the difficulties that are being experienced elsewhere in the world, when we take note of the obvious signs of affluence around us. Our success is paradoxically also our dilemma - the dilemma of having to go on satisfying the rising expectations of our people on the one hand and yet making sure that they do not become soft and opt for a hedonistic attitude in life.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It leads me therefore to wonder whether there is not a better way to report on our economic situation from year to year so that it can be seen more realistically, not in isolation but very much more in the context of the entire world, that over-emphasising GDP growth as an indicator of growth does not, to my lay mind, put things in their proper perspective and is extremely misleading. A cursory glance at our balance of payments position for the year 1977 shows us that we are in surplus by $717 million. However, the capital inflows have amounted to approximately $1,500 million, that is, more than twice the sum total of the surplus in 1976 which was $737.4 million, as against capital inflows of $2,097.7 million. Are such inflows of a portfolio nature, or are they direct investments? To what extent do these capital inflows contribute towards our diversification programme and our exports earnings? To what extent do direct investments from external sources result in transfer of technology in real terms benefiting the indigenous sector, and for how much longer do we have to go on relying heavily on these inflows to produce the surpluses for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> us? These are in my humble opinion some of he pertinent points that need to be examined in much greater detail than hitherto.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present analysis as contained in Chapter VI of the Economic Survey of Singapore 1977 is, to my mind, far too brief to be meaningful. There will come a time when the level of capital inflows will reduce drastically, and it is then important for us to ensure that at that point of time our export trade does pick up sufficient momentum and that our invisible earnings increase to the extent that the combined earnings from these sources are more than sufficient to offset any reduction in capital inflows.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the financial year 1978, on the face of it, there are plenty of tax concessions and incentives for the corporate sector. But if these well meaning measures are to achieve their desired objectives, then I submit there is need for those responsible for implementation to be much more responsive and sensitive to the problems faced by the business community. I am saying this upon the reflection of a number of instances of delays in the implementation of the announced policies of Government. For example, during last year's Budget debate, the Hon. Minister accepted quite enthusiastically the need for the setting up of an Export Promotion Agency or Trade Development Council as it is now called. There appears to be quite a bit of feet-dragging in this connection. After a lapse of exactly a year the matter is still under discussion with the various Chambers of Commerce. Although we now have the Export Credit Insurance Scheme, Members will recall that the idea was mooted at least some five or six years ago but it did not take off until quite recently. Some few years ago the Export Incentive Scheme was introduced. I believe it is still in existence but I understand that in practice the system is so complicated and the requirements so stringent that only a handful of companies were able to qualify. The Small Industries Finance Scheme, which has been paraded as a shining example of Government's efforts to assist industries in export promotion, has
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> only granted loans totalling $9 million to 60 establishments. This works out to be a meagre $150,000 per establishment and the disbursements and approvals of the $9 million have taken place over a period of, I believe, more than 12 months.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not consider this to be an impressive record. Surely there must be many more small industries worthy of help but due perhaps to inadequate publicity given to the scheme and the lack of promotion efforts at the administrative level, many industries which would otherwise have benefitted were either not aware of the existence of the scheme or simply they were not sufficiently encouraged to come forward.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the ensuing year, six types of tax concessions will be extended to the corporate sector. I can only hope that the performance of those responsible for implementation will parallel the excellent intentions behind all incentive schemes, otherwise they will remain forever incentives on paper. Let us hope also that red tape will be kept to the minimum and a good common sense approach will prevail throughout the civil service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the change in the personal income tax structure, I have a feeling that the year 1978 will go down in history as an important turning point in our basic thinking on taxation. It signals a gradual shift in emphasis from our traditional approach of taxing on incomes to taxing on consumption. It is, in my view, a much better system in that the high spenders who obviously belong to the more affluent will have to pay more for their higher standard of living. This is socially equitable. Unlike the Member for Khe Bong, I feel sure that the change will continue to ensure a more even distribution of wealth provided, of course, that we take care to differentiate between luxury and necessities. For items failing under the category of luxury, I do not think many people will be too unhappy if heavier taxes are imposed, but to tax on items that have universally come to be regarded as necessities there should be sufficient reasons on the part of the Government before doing so. A case in point
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> is the telephone tax. I do like to question the rationale behind it. A telephone has become very much a part of our daily life and bearing in mind the substantial capital investments that the Government has already committed on exchange installations and equipment, not to mention the very substantial profits being made by TAS from year to year, one would have thought that our policy should be to encourage even greater use of telephones and not to discourage.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In selecting items for application of consumption tax, we must not overlook also the social and cultural values that we are trying to cultivate and how our efforts in this direction may be affected. Take, for example, the increase in entertainment duty introduced for FY 78. It would have been more logical to treat stage plays, concerts, recitals, music performances and dances of significant cultural worth on a different basis entirely from, say, nightclub acts and shows. As things stand, they are all lumped together, giving the impression that we are totally indiscriminate in our cultural and artistic tastes. If it is not too late, I would urge the Minister to seriously consider granting special exemptions to all cultural activities aiming at qualitative improvement of our life-style. We talk so much against "moneytheism" and of the need to guard against the emergence of the "ugly Singaporean" and yet, in practice, we do not seem to take quite seriously what we preach. Only too often we have shown our pre-occupation with revenue generation for the purpose of economic development almost to the total exclusion of social and cultural activities. This unbalanced attitude should be corrected. This is, I feel sure, well within the capability of the Hon. Finance Minister to do so. As we put on the extra gallop in the Year of the Horse, let the gallop be not only energetic but graceful.

  <!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this year's tax measures introduced by the Finance Minister
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> demonstrate that he is capable of inflicting pain, as well as soothing away some of the pain, on the taxpayers. He implements his measures with such artifice that at the end of it he generally gets more cheers than boos for his tax proposals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has done the unexpected this year by decreasing income tax rates for the benefit of the taxpayers to the tune of $53.9 million. This move certainly makes a lot of sense and brings good cheer to the taxpayers. Making sense and bringing good cheer, I must say, is not one of those things that the Finance Minister often does when it involves the giving away of money. This is clearly illustrated in the Finance Minister's rigid adherence to his ruling on the non-payment of the 13th Month Allowance, even on a prorata basis, to civil servants who retire or to their dependants if they die before the 31st December of each year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps with the passage of time, the Finance Minister will develop a greater sense of generosity towards such civil servants or their dependants as the case may be, and a more propitious time may yet come when the Finance Minister will relent on this issue. Let us hope that this propitious time is not too far away.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to his tax measures, Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to make certain observations in regard to the Finance Minister's proposal to increase the rate of entertainment duty. Like the hon. Member for Jalan Kayu, I must point out here, with regret, that no distinction is made between nightclub entertainment on the one hand, and cultural and recreational entertainment, on the other. To impose an additional rate of entertainment duty on nightclub entertainment, including strip tease, lewd and sexy shows, is a proposal with which no one can find fault. But to impose an additional duty on admission charges for cultural entertainment, such as stage plays, concerts, music performances and dances, etc. is, I think, to put an unnecessary impediment in the way of the organisers and promoters of such cultural performances. As
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> it is, such people are already finding it hard to stage such performances simply because the cost of staging them is quite high. The prices they fix for admission tickets to such performances have to be related to the costs of the production; as a result, the prices of admission tickets are often too high for the shows to be popular, since they are within the reach of a small circle of Singaporeans, among whom young Singaporeans are not likely to be found.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often lamented that Singapore is a cultural desert. It is bad enough that the Government has not seen it fit to give greater financial aid for the promotion of such cultural pursuits. Now the Finance Minister wants to impose an unnecessary burden on the enthusiasts, who are doing what they can in promoting the cultural development for the enrichment of our society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imposition of additional duty on admission to the cinemas is also ill-conceived. We can be quite sure that the cinema-owners, sooner or later, will pass on the additional duty to the cinemagoers, most of whom must surely be our HDB flat dwellers. Cinema-going is surely one pleasant source of recreation - one safe outlet for the great bulk of our flat-dwellers, who at times need to escape from their crowded environment. After all, there are insufficient recreational facilities in Singapore within the reach of their pocket to cater for their recreational needs. How much can Government get out of this additional duty? Is this additional duty really necessary to balance the Budget? The ordinary man must have his share of entertainment and recreation. Due recognition must be given to his right to such entertainment and recreation if we are earnest in what we say about caring, not only for his material well-being, but also his social needs. There is already a duty on admission charges. There is also talk that the cinema-owners are contemplating raising admission charges to cinemas. Increasing further the duty rate on admission charges will only provide them with an excuse to raise the charges at the expense of the cinemagoers.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to make some observations on the tax proposals of the Hon. Minister for Finance. First, the personal income tax. When i read the Table that was handed out, I would have thought that the tax burden would be shared more largely by those who earn more. However, this is not the case. Those earning a chargeable income of $2,500 will only get 1%, and it goes up to 10% for those earning a chargeable income of up to $200,000. Sir, if I may refer to the Inland Revenue Department's Annual Report of 1976, page 55, Income Tax, Abstract E:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For assessments paid up to 31st December, 1976 for the year of assessment, 1975, there is a total of 229,970 taxpayers.' Out of this, Sir, those earning $30,001 to $200,000 make up about 13,000 taxpayers and those earning over $200,000, 228 taxpayers. The total tax concession is, according to the Hon. Minister for Finance, about $53.9 million. So the figures that I have given just now go on to show that those who earn between $30,000 and above $200,000 are the ones who benefit more in terms of dollars and cents. Those who earn $10,001 to $30,000 which make up roughly 71,000 taxpayers will get less benefit in terms of dollars and cents. They form the majority, as my good friend, the Member for Khe Bong, has also observed. So where is the equitable distribution of wealth? This is the point. It widens the gap rather than narrows it down. I do hope the Minister for Finance will bear this in mind when presenting his next Budget.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, along with the $53.9 million loss of revenue, the Minister for Finance introduces a number of measures to recover the revenue loss. First, when he imposes with immediate effect the 25% Additional Registration Fee on private motor cars, as well as the 25% increase on Preferential Additional Registration Fee, he says, and I quote him:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This additional tax is most necessary if we are to prevent the release of $54 million freed by the new income tax rates for the lower and middle income groups from going into private cars excessively, once again cluttering up the roads.'
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Sir, I cannot follow the rationale. To my lay mind, at the moment if a person wishes to purchase a new motor car, unless he can look around and get an old car to scrap off he will have to pay more tax. Even if he has an old car to scrap, and the tax that he will have to pay is less, is there any real advantage to him? I cannot follow the logic that the release of $54 million will mean cluttering up the roads with new cars. I hope the Hon. Minister for Finance can enlighten this House on how he arrives at this solution of a so-called equation of loss of revenue against increase in motor cars.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, as pointed out by the Members for Moulmein and Jalan Kayu, is the question of entertainment duty. Singapore is such a small place. What are the places of entertainment? I do not think many of our people can afford to go to night clubs. So perhaps one of the forms of entertainment would be the cinemas. The additional rate will bring in only $7.5 million. Is it really worth it? Then the driving licence, 100% increase. I think this is quite reasonable. But I cannot agree with the increase of another 5% to the telephone bill, also mentioned by my good friend, the Member for Jalan Kayu. This no doubt will net some $5.7 million. But the telephone is a necessity for speedier and easier communication. It is a form of social service. So why impose additional tax by another 5%?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will come to another point, Sir. Colour television licence goes up from $36 to $54, an increase of 50%. If my mind serves me right, what is broadcasting service for? What does broadcasting service provide the programmes for? It is to entertain, to be informative, to explain Government's policies and the like. Just because the TV is a colour set and with more colour TV programmes, the Government chooses to increase by another 50% of the TV licence fee. I recall that sometime ago there was a leek that television licence fee would be increased. But as a result of the leak, Sir, the licence fee was not increased. Then there is the airport tax.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these measures will bring in a total sum of $41.8 million, not forgetting the good cheer that the Minister for Finance has brought by abolishing the 5% tax on PUB bills ranging from $35 to $50. This is something which the Housing Board flat dwellers have been grumbling about for some years. Everything is taxed. Even the consumption of water is taxed. Electricity that is used is also taxed. So this small sweetener is most welcome by the lower income group in the Housing Board estates. Whilst this may incur a loss of revenue of some $17.1 million, as the Minister for Finance has pointed out, I think it certainly softens the burden of having to maintain a HDB flat. On the one hand there are tax concessions, but on the other hand the hand stretches out and grabs in all directions to recover the loss of revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Give and take!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Give and take, that is right. Now, one last point. This has been mentioned by the Member for Khe Bong. Over the last 30 years some 150,000 persons have escaped the tax net. How come? The Minister for Finance mentioned that it is difficult to bring them in. I do not see where the difficulty is. If there are measures to ensure that all these 150,000 persons, whether they are self-employed or otherwise, do submit tax returns, it may cost the Government some money and manpower, but surely over a period of time these people will realise that it is better to declare their income and to pay tax than to be in default and to pay heavily. The penalty should be more than, as suggested by the Member for Khe Bong, 200% or maybe 1,000%, so that they will be discouraged from evading payment of income tax.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another good source of revenue, I suggest, is to impose tax on luxury items. I agree with the Member for Jalan Kayu that we have got to differentiate between what is a necessity and what is a luxury. All basic necessities should not carry extra tax. But as far as luxury items are concerned, yes by all
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> means increase the tax. This will make up for the loss in revenue. There are so many luxury items.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Such as colour TV?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> No, not colour TV because a colour TV set is a necessity at home. Maybe cosmetics is a luxury. The Finance Minister previously mentioned about the bad habit of smoking and drinking. This has escaped him this year. I wonder why.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am trying to say, Sir, is that surely there are many other ways and means by which the Hon. Finance Minister could not only recover the loss in revenue but also bring in more revenue if he had studied the matter in greater depth.
  <br>4.17 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during this period when the world economic growth has slowed down and yet to recover from the shocks of the oil crisis, for a City state like ours with no natural resources to speak of and with no agricultural sector, except for manpower and providing services, to achieve an economic growth rate of 7.8% is a marvellous achievement, when compared to the major countries of the OECD whose growth was only 4%. This achievement is due to the wisdom of the Finance Minister and the stable Government with its prudent policy, efficient management and hard work of the productive workers. I do not want to criticise. I must support the Minister for Finance. I therefore join my colleagues to commend the Finance Minister for producing an excellent economic survey of the country and delivering an excellent Budget address in this House on 27th February.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this year's Budget statement is indeed a glorious example of a realistic, well-thought out and, needless to say, an express statement of great achievements despite the very many setbacks we have faced since the middle of 1973.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the PAP took office in 1959, year in and year out we have seen continuous progress in every field and no stone was left
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> untouched. This is proven by the statistics produced over the last 18 years. We are able to control our population growth. The crude birth rate is now 16.8 per 1,000 people, whereas in 1960 it was 37.5 per 1,000 people. This shows our Family Planning Scheme has been a success. Our unemployment rate too has gone down tremendously during the last decade. In 1968, the rate was 7.3% whereas today it stands at a record figure of 3.9%. These are just some examples. This is possible- because of the stability of our government, whose leaders have a great sense of foresight and are prepared to work hard for the interest of the nation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the last two weeks there has been much talk all over the island about the tax changes that have been announced in this House by the Finance Minister. There seems to be a misconception. In my opinion, this year the Finance Minister has presented a "caring budget". If we are to study the tax changes, we will notice that the tax increases are levied on non-essential items. As long as food, shelter and clothing which are the main necessities and essential items are not restricted, then there is no ground for any one to grumble.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned, the "caring budget" has given great thought for the workers, for the Finance Minister has revised the income tax rates. The tax reduction varies from 7.8% to 18.8% depending on the tax bracket and the average tax cut is 14.6%. This tax reduction is indeed long over-due and will definitely benefit the majority of the taxpayers whose sweat and toil has contributed to the fine performance of the economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget has also abolished the 5% tax on PUB bills within the range of $35 to $50. This is also a timely gesture to the majority of the low-consumption consumers whose bills are within that range. This gesture will also help other consumers to be thrifty in the use of utilities so as to avoid paying the 10% tax on bills which are above $50. These two benefits will be felt directly by the individuals.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, to keep up with the challenging year ahead, tax concessions have also been considered for companies. This is in the form of an investment credit scheme where a number of benefits have been granted so that we can secure markets for our exports which we greatly need.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is noted that the loss in revenue due to the income tax revision is estimated at $54 million and the revenue loss on tax on PUB bills is estimated at $5 million. With the various tax increases on non-essential items, the Government faces a total revenue loss of $17.1 million for the first year. In other words, the Government will not gain from the tax changes but it is fair to the masses who have a moderate living standard.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The income tax issue has been a controversial one over the past few years. Year after year, Backbenchers have voiced for increased relief for taxpayers. Even the present Senior Minister of State for Finance who was on this side of the House last year, had also strongly supported the move. At last, we have seen some concessions in this year's budget.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister is aware that social circumstances are unfair because the burden falls heavily on the honest and hardworking salaried wage-earners who faithfully and loyally pay tax on their earnings. However, there are many loopholes for the 'big fish' to dodge paying tax on their income with legality and frequently these loopholes are not noticed by the income tax department.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember some six months ago, during the Public Accounts Committee's inquiry, it was stated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue that $22.2 million was not collected from taxpayers and he gave reasons which were the perennial problem of shortage of manpower, equipment and space. It seems that the outstanding amount is more than what the Minister expects to collect from the increases of taxes on any of the non-essential items. What steps are being taken to recover the uncollected taxes expeditiously?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also mentioned that the Inland Revenue Department has $42 million in its coffers which should be returned to the taxpayers. What steps are being taken by the Department to return the credit balances of taxpayers who have over-estimated their tax assessments? What is the guideline here? Is there any precaution taken that the refundable amount is given back to the taxpayers? No wonder in their midst a single clerk outwitted all the tax intellects and managed to get away with a large sum of money amounting to a million dollars. This had been going on for many years and right at their doorstep. What measures have been taken to ensure that no such repetition occurs, not only in the income tax department but also in other Government departments?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Inland Revenue Department collects the main source of revenue for the Government which amounts to some 40% of the total revenue. It is time that the Department was properly organised. Priority should be given to this Department in the allocation of manpower and equipment and all its other divisions should be put under one roof instead of locating them in different parts of the city. If urgent attention is not given to this matter, we will notice a heavy "bad debt" in the long run and legal administration would be impossible and economically unwise.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the large expenditure on Development has been made possible because of stringent pruning of the recurrent expenditure estimates especially on staff and manpower in the civil service. This is quite reasonable. But then the working conditions of many civil servants are not properly attended to. We find that many officers are working in cubicles with neither comfort nor privacy. This could be due to their supervisors' lack of interest on the working conditions of the staff.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has also been a certain amount of dissatisfaction in the civil service, e.g. the 13th month annual allowance. A retiring officer who has put in many years of loyal and dedicated service is denied this
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> allowance even if he were to retire just one day before the end of the year whereas a new recruit who has been in service for just two months is entitled to this benefit. Sir, the question here is, why are the civil servants who have put in so many years of loyal and dedicated service given a poor deal? Are they all being neglected? These are some of the frustrations that affect the work performance of the civil servants. We must remember that these are the workers who have played a major role in our Government's efforts in achieving excellent performance over the years and also in maintaining a stable Government. These people should not be forgotten. They are partly responsible for our success.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to educate the people and to maintain discipline and a healthy society, in our legislations we have penalties in the form of fines. But then it appears that there are too many people who are involved in the issuing of summonses. Many years ago, only the Police were given the authority to issue summonses. At the moment, the masses are rather confused. It looks like any Tom, Dick and Harry from the various departments have the authority to book offenders. And some of the summonses are issued indiscriminately. I will quote a few instances when the Committee of Supply is in session. At times, offences committed are not intentional and the persons involved are not given a chance to explain but are advised that they can give their explanations in Court. How many of our citizens would really want to go to Court and argue their cases, which may be economically unwise?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is apparent that once you are on the road either as a pedestrian or a motorist, there are so many regulations to abide and if you make a slip, the lawman is there to book you.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this subject, even a day's delay of payment on certain bills will subject a person to a fine, despite going to the department concerned to explain the reasons. However, some officers at the counter will invariably give a negative reply. It is only when one makes a nuisance there that a senior officer will intervene to help solve the problem.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everytime this happens, the law is always quoted, that is, the regulations in the notices, etc. It appears there are numerous minor instructions and regulations to be complied with and if one does not comply with any regulation, one is liable. On the other hand, if the mistakes are committed by the department concerned, then the matter is covered up after the wrongly booked person had been inconvenienced by having to go to the department to explain. What is the reason for the double standards? I hope the civil service will work with better understanding and courtesy with the erring public. It is true that laws have to be observed. But then surely discretion too plays a part, but in many cases there is no discretion and everything is being referred to the court. No wonder there is a glut of cases being pushed to the courts, where our learned Judges are already burdened with so many other cases. So it would be wise to maintain some sort of control over the issue of summons from the various Ministries and thus avoid the impression that is being created that fines are revenue-orientated which, in fact, is not true.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at present we see extensive developments taking place in the Republic. We find the city entirely different from what it was some 20 years' ago. We find many skyscrapers replacing the old dilapidated and low structures. These developments are, in fact, changing the skyline and also uplifting the image of the country. But then some of the skyscrapers are under-utilised. Probably because of the heavy overhead costs the business community does not want to occupy the buildings. Some of these buildings are therefore made to look as though they are 'white elephants'. Every attempt must be made to get all the vacant units occupied.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very frequently we notice road digging taking place along many roads, paths, circuses, etc. Sometimes we find developments going on in the same location over a short period of time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development is good for the country. But then it should not be over-emphasised. I know that there is a co-ordinating committee to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> look into this and that it has got the final say. The question here is, how effective is the co-ordinating committee in its functions? Though there may be acceptable reasons for the changes, I think the planning and the co-ordinating committee should play a greater role in this control. I personally feel that the change in officers, which is quite common in the civil service, is the cause for the frequent changes in the physical outlook. This is because every new officer has his own way of thinking and working. Therefore, the now officer might not accept the ideas and plans of his predecessor and so changes have to take place.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the years the public bus transport has improved tremendously after the numerous complaints voiced by the Members in this House. Credit should be given to the Government and the bus workers for this improvement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last few years, in the hope of limiting vehicles on our limited stretch of roads, the motoring public has been greatly hit by the various taxes and restrictions imposed by the Government. Many car owners have given up their vehicles and are prepared to rely on public transport. However, in this respect there arises a new problem, and that is a great demand for taxis. Even though statistics have shown that there are many taxis on the roads, what has happened to them? Every taxi is seen to be fully occupied, so much so that some taxi drivers take advantage of the situation and do not provide the good services as before. The Ministry should seriously look into this matter and rectify the problems. Otherwise the Government will not be able to further reduce the number of private cars on the roads. It is very difficult to get a taxi in Maxwell Road at one o'clock in the afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Health Ministry is aware of the plight of those who are over 60 years of age and who are vulnerable to illness because of the degenerative process. Old people in most cases are not well-off like the others. The marginal utility of money for them is great.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> With the present high cost of living, medical bills are quite often a burden to them. It is a fact that a general reduction of hospital charges will not be possible. Perhaps a concession for the aged could be considered. I know of many old people who do not consult doctors because of the heavy charges. It is no wonder that on scrutinising the statistics for the last few years, this age group has got the most number of suicides, attempted suicides, missing persons, etc., when compared with the age group of 30 to 60 years over an interval of 10 years. Something must be done to help this group of people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to sum up the Economic Survey of Singapore over the last 13 years, Singapore has made tremendous progress in all fields of human activity, as has been analysed. To have achieved so much within so short a period is a great credit to the Government and the people of Singapore. The Government's ceaseless efforts at mapping out a clearly unique, self-reliant and undauntingly surging Singapore has created a facade of truth, honesty and incorruptibility of and a great faith in her leaders. The people of Singapore have a share in the cake of achievement, and it is no little share in these efforts, who by their faith and confidence in and unstinting co-operation with their leaders have made this possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, we can proudly say that it is now a Singapore which is the "Pearl of the Orient" and a model city in this part of the world. Let us hope the 'Horse' would gallop better in the Year of the Horse, leading to a brighter budget for next year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give my wholehearted support for the Budget address presented in Parliament by the Finance Minister on the 27th February, 1978.
  <br>4.40 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, last year was a turbulent year for the world economy. Inflation was persistent and economic growth was sluggish and rising unemployment particularly in OECD countries gave impetus to the tide of protectionism. In the face of all
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> these difficulties, our economic performance of 7.8% real GDP growth was commendable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister for Finance has rightly warned that difficult economic conditions in the OECD countries will persist despite attempts at expansionary policies. Unemployment, inflation, balance of payments difficulties and turbulence in currency markets are but symptoms of a deeper malady. The engine of growth in the industrial countries is faltering and the best indication of this is the insufficient and uncertain pace of new investments. The energy crisis has, of course, further compounded the problem by raising costs of transportation and production and by creating huge imbalances in trading accounts. The U.S. Government has announced a tax cut and has been trying to persuade West Germany and Japan to expand their economies so as to pull the world economy out of economic stagnation. Unfortunately, expansionary fiscal and monetary measures have only a limited and temporary impact. Moreover, the cost could be high in terms of greater inflation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The declining fortunes of the US dollar vis-a-vis the Yen, the Mark and the Swiss Franc should be cause for concern. The net effect will be inflationary and a retardation in the growth of world trade. The depreciation of the US dollar will raise prices of imported goods in the United States but the corresponding appreciation of the Yen, the Mark and the Swiss Franc will not lead to a lowering of import prices to the same extent in Germany, Switzerland and Japan. At a later stage, higher US inflation will be re, exported. In the meantime, the volume of world trade will suffer as imports into America are reduced while United States exports will not enjoy compensating expansion because her exports comprise high technology, military and agricultural goods which are not so responsive to changes in price competitiveness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are at one of those critical junctures in world economic history when failure to identify common interests among nations leads to adoption of myopic and nationalistic
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> measures which can only hun every nation in the world. The balance of world economic power in the non-Communist world has shifted significantly since the Second World War. Although the United States is still predominant, its share of market-economy GNP has shrunk from almost half to one-third. The EEC has increased its share of G NP from 19% to 27% while Japan's share has increased from 3% to 10%. The pattern of shares in world trade has also changed significantly. This shift in the balance of economic power lies behind the U.S. exhortation to Western Europe and Japan to assume their proper share of responsibility for the orderly development of world trade and finance. Abdication of such responsibility and failure to achieve the required degree of coordination can have disastrous consequences. One recent historical parallel is a chilling reminder, as one noted observer puts it: "part of the reason for the length, and most of the expansion for the depth of the world depression [of the thirties], was the inability of the British to continue their role of underwriter of the system and the reluctance of the U.S. to take it on until 1936." (Charles Kindleberger, The World in Depression 1929-1939). He was referring to the consequences of the shift in the balance of economic power from Britain to the U.S. in the years immediately preceding the Great Depression. Today we are witnessing a shift in a balance of power from the United States towards Western Europe and Japan.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, we in Singapore can only watch with apprehension, developments in the industrial countries and do our best to avoid being swamped. We can expect more protectionism in the developed countries. Euphemisms like orderly marketing arrangements, organised free trade, orderly growth of trade cannot hide the ugly reality of protectionism. Honourable Members are undoubtedly aware of increasing restrictions on our exports like electronic calculators, plywood, black and white T.V. sets and textiles. And when the French hit a spell of dry weather, their umbrella industry suffered. An investigation found that umbrella imports were mainly from Singapore. The
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> consequence was a quota on our GSP exports. Even our orchid exports to the EEC have been the object of lobbying by tulip growers in the Netherlands and Italy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tragedy of protectionism is that it is a negative sum game for everybody. Cheap imports from developing countries like Singapore have lowered costs of living significantly for workers in industrial countries. There has been net job creation in these countries as a result of trade. Yet imports are now chief targets by trade unions in the advanced countries as a result of rising unemployment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also in danger of re-classification of our status as a developing country, as the Finance Minister and other hon. Members have mentioned. This is patently unfair. We are being penalized, as it were, for the successful efforts we have made to reduce unemployment, poverty and inequality. We should bend every effort to resist the re-classification. At the same time, we should realistically prepare for the day when GSP and other concessions are removed. Even under the GSP, products are easily re-classified as sensitive items, subject to onerous quotas. The Finance Minister's call to shift our production to goods and services which are less sensitive to protectionism should be implemented expeditiously.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incentives he has announced to encourage the diversification process are steps in the right direction. The investment credit scheme should give a boost to capital formation. Hon. Members may note that our Gross Domestic Fixed Capital Formation or investment, in short, rose by only 1.3% in real terms last year. Machinery and equipment investment was less than the previous year's by 2%. Indeed, the private sector's investment in this category declined by 6.2%. There is every need therefore to stimulate investment in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have a wide variety of measures to encourage new investments, including the accelerated depreciation allowances for industrial buildings and concessions on
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> earnings from export and offshore financial activities. We have not been given any idea of the cost of these measures nor any evaluation of the effectiveness of past measures. Perhaps the Finance Minister can enlighten us on this. Furthermore, concessionary measures require control and monitoring. It may be simpler and more effective to simply lower company taxes generally so as to provide greater stimulus all around to investment activity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lowering of the maximum marginal tax rate on profits which are repatriated back to Singapore to 40% may not be sufficient incentive to encourage repatriation when unremitted income is not taxed at all. It may be more effective to exempt entirely repatriated profits or income which are put to investment purposes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to provide a 20% concessionary tax rate for overseas-oriented sales and service companies is a good one except that the scale of operations required seems unduly high if the intention is to promote local entrepreneurship. It might be more effective to offer a graduated scale of concessions with a low enough minimum scale of operations so as to attract new entrants.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis on trade development may well be critical for us. If OECD economies remain sluggish and turn increasingly protectionist, we shall need new markets. West Asia and China are two likely growth areas. Greater efforts should therefore be made to tap these markets and to orientate our production accordingly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The personal income tax concessions have been widely welcomed. The intention of providing greater incentive for individual effort and enterprise is a sound one because our economy depends upon such effort and enterprise. However, the Minister could have spread his present more evenly, to provide more relief to the middle and lower income ranges. The upper income groups would not have lost in the process by the spreading because their tax benefits are cumulative.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concession on the tax on PUB bills is most welcome because it has been a burden to the lower income group.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shift from income tax to taxes on expenditure is a sound move. Burdensome income taxes in more advanced countries have stifled initiative to the detriment of growth and job creation. We need to give encouragement to our entrepreneurs who, through their skill and enterprise, can create the industries that provide the jobs and rising standards of living.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of revenue from income taxes has to be made up by other taxes unless we are prepared to dispense with some Government services. Taxes on expenditure can provide the shortfall in revenue. Moreover they discourage wasteful consumption and encourage saving. Last year, private consumption expenditure rose to $9.9 billion or 8.7% in real terms. Transportation, particularly new cars, and communication expenditure increased by 17.5% while residents' expenditure abroad rose by 26.4%. The Finance Minister is therefore understandably concerned. But he should not forget that expenditure taxes add to the cost of living, especially when they bear upon necessities, and that the cost of buying and maintaining a car has already risen by a fair amount. Government has been very prudent in its fiscal management but I am sure there are always economies that can be made to save taxpayers additional burden. I would urge the Finance Minister to increase productivity of civil servants. All of us, however, need to realize that we are now in an era of much slower growth - thrift in general is necessary. Thrift will also enable us as tax-payers to avoid paying the expenditure taxes that the Finance Minister may feel the urge to impose from time to time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, subject to these few qualifications, I give my support to the Motion standing in the name of the Minister for Finance.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff (Kolam Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Modern Civilization, whether it is the Western capitalism or the Communist Socialism is characteristically materialistic. There is a belief that this attitude or character has been deeply influenced by at least four great modern philosophers:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Sigmund Freud, who dealt on the significance of overwhelming urge of sex in human nature.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Karl Marx, who said that the belly is the most important and significant human factor, coaxing the realisation of "the realm of liberty".
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Machiavelli, who preached politics and the use of deceit in politics and diplomacy or political intrigue, and last but not least.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Darwin, with his theory, who traced human origin to the animal.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what happened next as a conclusion is everybody's guess: that man is full of sex (Freud), tormented by a hungry stomach (Marx), deceitful in politics (Machiavelli) and, on top of it, he was in fact the direct progeny of animals and became man only by accident as a next step from the monkey (Darwin). Succinctly, it is only natural that we live in the present chaotic conditions of the world. A sick world. A very sick world. I believe that this ugly atmosphere could easily be changed if we have faith. Either faith in religion, philosophy, leaders of your country and, above all, your fellow human beings. With faith, we will have a fuller meaningful sex life, legally of course through marriage, as an answer to Freud; we could use the most important instrument - the brain - so that our stomachs are not empty even for a country without natural resources or reproducible commodities, as an answer to Karl Marx; we need politics and politicians who
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> are serious and fully committed to the profession the kind of sense of commitment that will produce a non-corrupt government, as corruption is the cancer of development and the sign of inefficiency as the answer to Machiavelli; and last but not least, whether Darwin, or recently Richard Leakey and the other anthropologists, want to claim kinship with animals such as monkey, ape or gorilla, that is your pleasure and liberty to think so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civilization has given man a high level of progress in every field: economy, education, politics, individual freedom and social justice. Unfortunately, it is always threatened by misfortune and dangers created by man himself. There is an element of truth when it said:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the dingy uniformity of international fashion in dress, man remains what he always has been: a splendid fighting animal, a self sacrificing hero and a blood thirsty savage.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So history has given us both these good and bad elements. For example, preparation for any conflict or war took top priority as it did among Shepherds of Inner Asia and the agriculturists who took the beating by herdsmen warriors. On the other hand, we can also learn from the example of the Scandinavian people who were once warriors and brigands but who are now highly respected and honoured because of their respect for civility.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must hope and vigorously try so that the good qualities will continuously develop between man and man all over the world. We have seen enough and we do not want to see the repeat of world wars or any other wars for that matter, such as the guerilla wars; puppet states and war by proxy in small countries by major powers who mask their participation in order to avoid direct confrontation among themselves. We also note with relief the fact that 1960's saw the beginning of international efforts to commonly share the outer space and prevent it from becoming a battle ground between nations for the simple reason that if we fail to avert it that could be the beginning of an end of civilization - so much more potently devastating than what had happened in the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> last world war. Or as early as last month during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting in Sydney, Australia, where 12 Heads of Government met to solve some urgent economic and political problems of the region, participants were given a warm welcome by Prime Minister Fraser and the Australian people, only to be marred by the act of some madmen which turned the warm welcome into an explosive welcome.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, society owes its existence to three important distinct elements: (1) An aggregate of individuals; (2) An organized system; and (3) An esprit de corps or the feeling of oneness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these elements hopefully we could produce thinkers, planners and deliverers. It would be better still if these qualities are possessed by every one of them or at least some individuals. We need people with "intellectual courage" - courage enough to say "yes" when things are right and a simple "no" when they are wrong. To say "no" all the time is unfair to our intelligence and to say "yes" all the time even when things are wrong is an insult to our intelligence. This is what makes a country tick. And any education system in any country will project a society that could "think". Since thinking is a complex activity it is of prime importance that it must be nurtured from young and equally important that we learn and share our experiences, for example, through organisation within the country and among countries of the region or of the world. This is where we can pronounce views and solve important problems, such as international trade, intraregional trade, terrorism, drugs or energy crisis, and so on and so forth. And if the esprit de corps can flourish and we always try our best not to be selfish, I am confident our country, the region or even the world for that matter will be a better place to live in. And this needs education.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education, being one of the most important instruments in the national endeavours for the progress of a country still dominates the scene. Hopefully the emphasis on the second language and the introduction of German, Japanese and French languages
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> as the third language will further encourage education which is sought for by our highly achievement-oriented society. Radical changes will take place in a country because of two vitally important factors, its political system within which is entrenched the value of its education policy. We have to keep pace with the progress of the industrial world. To progress means to industrialise. Otherwise we will miss the boat. Because when we discuss about education we are, in fact, dealing with the future. Yet the future is one that can never be rightly ascertained. However, the discussion, and later on the decision, is always useful simply because the future has one vital advantage. It gives us the benefit of past experiences and exposes us with the realities of today. From here, we embark on the future. This future is our ultimate and constant challenge. It must be explored with dedication and aspiration so that our expectations could always be met.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes are quite a normal happening everywhere. Anything static would be most unnatural. In other words, to change is normal and not to change is abnormal. And as an agent of social change, whether it is exogenous, endogenous, episodic or patterned, education should be able to evolve for us a nation or society that is rugged, poised and bold in facing, the challenges ahead, while at the same time appreciative of our own aesthetic value.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully this aspiration is internalised and inspiring, and will inculcate in the minds of the people of Singapore the importance of living together peacefully and share their progress with others.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us hope that the big industrial powers which had planned for a concerted effort to relieve the world economic doldrums - irrespective of whether or not their specialists are no longer talking of the "locomotive theory" headed by Japan and West Germany and now prefer the "convoy approach" - will always remember to share their progress with others too, and to remember that protectionism is not a long-term advantage. It is mere selfishness.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I am touching on selfishness, let me illustrate this with the unique primitive example of the African Folk thought as stated by Emory S. Borgadus in his book, the Development of Social Thought. He says, "The high crime and misdemeanour of the town is to dine alone". It may be primitive but still relevant. In other words, the criminal, of all persons, is not the murder, as it is, but the "mask mass-murder" of "Mr Eat Along; Mr Selfish and Mr Protectionism".
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take this as a reminder to fulfil our duty as the decision makers, and hopefully it will be a stark reminder to Mondale or George Meany or others who share this short-term view of protectionism the danger they have created. If they do, I think Devan Nair and others can have a second thought of declaring 1978 as "Anti-Protectionism Year". And the galloping horse will surely surpass last year's 7.8% GNP.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, I have the same views as that of several other Members on the matter of telephones, TV, the cinema and cultural entertainment. I think they are now a necessity rather than a luxury for the ordinary people. The telephone, for instance, is very necessary as more and more mothers, brothers and sisters are working, some at odd hours. We want them to work hard. They do so. We want them to contribute to the nation. They do so. But in return what is our contribution to them? Certainly not more tax.

  <!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the major countries in the OECD were able to register a GNP growth rate of only 4% last year and there had been a slow recovery from world recession. In the face of this situation, coupled with an upsurge in protectionism, it is indeed gratifying to note that we have been able to achieve a 7.8% growth last year. Not only that, our foreign exchange reserves have increased to $9 billion. This further indicates that our economic position has been sound and stable. The Budget statement by the Minister besides giving us such good news has also announced tax concessions on
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> income tax and a reduction in the tax on PUB bills. All these concessions will benefit our people. The tax concessions to investors will encourage local businessmen to invest more and attract foreign capital. These factors will also promote our economic development. I support the Budget statement of the Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have no natural resources and yet we have been able to surmount all kinds of difficulties and achieve such remarkable results in our economy. All this can be attributed to the enlightened leadership of the Government, cooperation between management and labour and the people's hard work in these past years. However, we must not be complacent and satisfied with what we have achieved at present, because complacency is the root cause of failure. In order to achieve better results in our economic production, it is necessary to constantly review our efforts in this regard. In the past year Government and Labour have been working very hard in the paramount interest of our nation. This is a fact well known to all the people. However, the attitude of some employers needs to be brought up for criticism. Raising productivity is an essential factor for increasing our production. Towards this end the Government has established the National Productivity Board to deal with matters related thereto. In this respect, the NTUC has also engaged specialists to constantly study the ways and means of solving problems within this sphere. Whenever union representatives negotiate with the employer over collective agreement, they would ask for the setting up of a Productivity Committee to be embodied in their agreement. On the contrary, the employers appear cold and always tried to dilly dally on this point or they would send representatives without any authority to make decisions to tackle the workers' representatives. They have not seriously understood the connection between productivity and national economy. Such employers are more a hindrance than a help to our efforts in achieving higher economic development. Such an attitude is most regrettable.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the NTUC has frequently conducted educational courses for workers in order to instil proper consciousness and better understanding of the need for productivity in the minds of the workers. There were among others two-week residential courses, week-end seminars and so on. When the workers are imbued with such proper work consciousness, obviously it will enhance productivity which will also be in the interest of the employer. However, certain employers who are shortsighted have adopted a negative, indifferent and non-cooperative attitude. They have refused to allow workers to take time off to take part in these courses and seminars. They have even forbidden union officials to take part in meetings for such purposes. Such an attitude will hinder our economic development. In their attitude towards the workers, certain employers appeared to regard diligent work and raising of productivity to be the business of the workers, and none of their own business. Therefore, they appeared perfunctory and indifferent in this regard. Worse still, certain employers even make use of productivity as a pretext and means to exploit the workers. Such a behaviour is also intolerable. In fact, in raising productivity, not only should the workers acquire the relevant know-how and work diligently and efficiently, the employers should also do the same. But the employers are too preoccupied with making money and would not humble themselves to understand the problems involved. As a result, erroneous measures in management. occurred. This has given rise to mutual suspicion among the workers, leading to workers' dissatisfaction of the employers and a lowering of work morale. All these consequences can be attributed to the attitude of the employers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, fortunately there are still some enlightened employers who realise the importance of productivity which is not only beneficial to the national economy as a whole but also in keeping with their long term business interest. They have conducted various kinds of courses and training programmes in their workshops for the workers. I hope that errant employers who had been negligent in the past would learn from these enlightened employers.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to emphasise once more that only with honest cooperation among the Government, Labour and Management and their diligent effort can our economy be able to achieve yet greater and more glamorous results.

  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion moved by the Minister for Finance on the financial policy for FY 78.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite the unfavourable international trends in 1977, Singapore achieved a growth rate of 7.8% which is higher than the 7% achieved in 1976. This growth was obtained together with an increase in external trade by 18%, expansion in international banking, relative price stability and a fall in unemployment to 3.9%. In this year's budget, to stimulate further growth in our industrial and trade development, the Minister has provided considerable incentives, like the Capital Assistance Scheme and the investment credit scheme, to the export-oriented manufacturers, the bankers and the foreign investors. Further, by the revision of the personal income tax structure, the Minister has provided rewards for higher skills, productivity and talents. Thus, it is hoped that with the various proposals, Singapore can advance and maintain its present growth rate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a global city state and we need to be reminded of our inter-dependency with other countries, especially those on whom we look to for markets, capital investment and high technology. In this respect, we should be aware of the foreign and international developments which have implications for our economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain political and economic crises persist in the international environment and our growth rate will be affected by whether they turn for the worse or the better. These international events involve the major powers, including the OECD countries. These seemingly insoluble issues include the Palestinian problem, the Jewish settlements in occupied territories, the Ethiopian-Somali
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> War over the Ogaden desert and the future of South Africa. These conflicts all occur in regions where the major powers have vital interests and hence, if they were to escalate, could lead to disaster for the rest of the world. It is hoped that with the statesmanship and leadership of the leaders in those states affected and the constraint of the major powers, these issues could be resolved. This in turn will promote a better international climate for trade and industrial development for both the developing and industrial states.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the OECD countries, especially in Western Europe, there are political and economic developments which may have implications for our relations with these states. The international recession, domestic unemployment especially among the youths, and the weakening American dollar may lead to radical changes in the political and economic systems of these countries. The intensity of industrial unrest, continuing inflation, the trend toward protectionism and the rising tide of Euro-communism may have unfortunate consequences for developing countries such as Singapore. Thus for example, the OECD countries may revise their system of Generalised System of Preferences in favour of restricting imports of manufactured products from developing countries. Thus, we have to be constantly alert to these events so that adjustments can be made to offset any reverses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our prospects for growth are boosted by the encouraging developments within the region, in particular the economic cooperation among the Asean countries and the normalisation of relations between the Asean and Indo-China states. The gradual implementation of the Agreement of Tariff Arrangements from August, 1977 among the Asean countries and the continuing interest in the promotion of the industrial projects, augur well for intra-regional trade and the industrial development of the Asean countries. I hope that the Asean governments will take advantage of the Japanese offer of financial assistance of US $1 billion for the industrial projects. Further, I call upon
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the Asean governments to provide incentives for the private sector to participate in these projects. The normalisation of relations between Asean and the Indo-China states will create peace and stability in the region, which is essential for the economic growth of every Southeast Asian state. Singapore's role will be crucial and pivotal in the promotion of economic cooperation and I hope that every effort will be made to support Asean economic cooperation and economic ties with the Indo-China states.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asean countries should achieve progress in their economic relations with the OECD countries. Thus, every effort must be made to present a cohesive front in all negotiations between Asean governments and Japan, the United States, the EEC, Australia and New Zealand. As far as the Asean-US discussions are concerned, the Asean governments should urge the American public and the American Congress to reject President Carter's proposal to abolish the tax deferral for US companies abroad. It should be impressed upon the US government that such a move will be a backward step in Asean-US relations, and that it will retard the economic growth of the Asean countries which is vital for the peace and stability of the region.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just comment on the increase in entertainment tax, tax increase on telephone bills and the removal of the garden tax remission. In the Budget debate last year, I called for increased taxes on certain entertainment establishments, especially the nightclubs. On this point, I would like to oppose the Minister's proposal to increase cinema duty. This move is grossly unfair to the majority of the people who are cinemagoers. On the other hand, I support the Minister's proposal to increase the tax on such establishments as nightclubs. In fact, he should consider a higher tax on such places, lest the present proposal may not be sufficient to deter our
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> people, especially the youths, from patronising such places.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, presently, one out of six Singaporeans has a telephone and it has become not a luxury but a necessity to the majority of the people. Households having telephones are already paying Government tax and there is no reason to increase their burden by the additional tax. Then, on the garden tax, I cannot agree with the Minister's argument that since our objective of clean and green city state has been achieved, there is no longer any need for this remission for the maintenance of private gardens. Mr Speaker, Sir, just as there are disincentives for undesirable social practices like having big families, taking drugs, owning more than one car, there should be incentives to promote desirable ones. Maintaining a private garden is a desirable habit and should be encouraged. Moreover, it is not just a matter of maintaining a private garden; it is also the inculcation of values such as the appreciation of our natural environment and our clean and green areas. So I appeal to the Minister to withdraw his proposals to increase tax on telephone bills and to discontinue the tax remission for the maintenance of private gardens.

  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr S. Dhanabalan (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, given the economic conditions that prevailed internationally, Singapore did well in 1977. In fact, many Finance Ministers would give their right arm to be in the happy position of our Finance Minister, to be able to report year after year steady overall progress of the economy and healthy accumulation of government surpluses. Members are aware that Government finances are in even better shape than is apparent in the annual budgets presented to Parliament. There is a vast difference between the actual position and the budget estimates, even the revised estimates, presented to us every year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have prepared two Tables (Cols. 723 - 724) and with your permission I would like to distribute them to Members so that they can follow the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> figures that I will be quoting. [Copies of Tables distributed to Members.] As it can be seen in Table I, for the Fiscal Years 1972-1976, a period of five years, actual revenues exceeded budget estimates by an average of about $525 million per year with a low variance of plus $370 million in Fiscal Year 1972 and a high variance of plus $752 million in Fiscal Year 1975. For the same period, total Government expenditure both under the Main and Development Heads was less than estimate by an average of $860 million per year with a low variance of minus $375 million in Fiscal Year 1973 to a high variance of minus $1,698 million in 1976. There is no reason to believe, Sir, that the variances will be different or much less in Fiscal Year 1977. The true state of Government finances can be seen more clearly in Table II. Although this shows a period of six years, the picture has been the same since 1968. Every year, current revenues have been more than sufficient to finance all current and direct Government development expenditures and loans to statutory boards and companies without the need to borrow or drawdown from the Development Fund. The greater part of the amount shown as Development Expenditure in the estimates is loans to statutory boards and companies which, apart from some minor exceptions are used for investment in viable projects. The statutory boards and companies are expected to, and in fact do, pay interest and principal to the Government. These loans by the Government can therefore be considered to be in the nature of investment of Government surpluses. I am aware that to treat such loans as investments does not fit in with the orthodox definition of development expenditure but it is a treatment that can be justified both on accounting and economic principles. Column (5) of Table II shows the surplus from current revenue after meeting current expenditure and direct Government development expenditure. This surplus is more than sufficient to meet the net loan requirements of statutory boards and companies to finance projects undertaken by them and column (7) of Table II shows the surplus after meeting all requirements i.e. after current expenditure, direct Government
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> development expenditure and loans to statutory boards and companies.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, if the trend of the past 10 years continues, the Government will have to tax its ingenuity to find profitable local investment outlets for its surpluses. One must also remember that the surpluses of other Government institutions, such as the Monetary Authority and the Currency Board or even the income from investment and loans made from the Development Fund, which income was about $300 million for the year 1976/1977, are not included in the figures shown in the Tables. My point in drawing attention to the very healthy state of Government finances is not to suggest that we can enter an era of reckless spending or that we can indulge in some of the excesses that we see in the welfare states of the West. Our sober and hardheaded approach to Government financial management is one of the main reasons for our record in growth and stability and it is a philosophy that we should continue to adhere to. But I would like to suggest that while preserving caution and prudence, we could be a little more bold than in the past in raising the quality of some of our social services. For example, under our urban renewal programme, the approach appears to be to put all sites acquired to commercial use. Surely we can now afford to acquire land in the city area, for example in the Chinatown area, for use as parks. Take another example, the field of education. Up till now, in order to conserve resources we have had two sessions, a morning and an afternoon session, in every school. Could we not afford to plan to phase out this system over the next ten years or so by building more schools and employing more principals? If we can have all children in morning sessions, it will have a tremendous impact in raising the standard of education. To quote one advantage, children and teachers will have more conducive times for extra curricular activities and special or extra classes can be arranged in the afternoons to help slow learners or for difficult subjects. Obviously, there are problems in such an upgrading of social services but these are not insoluble given our financial strength. As shown, every year our
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> current revenue has been more than sufficient to meet all our requirements and we have had no need to borrow whether locally or abroad to meet our requirements. This is of course not to say that the government should not raise loans both locally and abroad. There are various good reasons why government should continue to borrow which I need not go into at this juncture. But the point I would like to make is that there is an urgent need to set up a mechanism in government to plan and set new priorities to guide government expenditures. We can afford to make substantial improvements in our social services and be more bold in our investment in economic services and at the same time keep sufficient in our reserves to take care of our requirements in years when our economic performance may be poor.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our performance in 1977 was satisfactory, it is clear that greater efforts are needed to maintain this in the coming years. The Minister for Finance has presented a package of tax concessions to promote further growth of the manufacturing sector as well as the traditional trading sectors. Through judicious use of tax concessions, we have managed to promote the growth of our manufacturing sector. We should be able to do the same in other sectors. Our tax concessions have been effective in attracting foreign investment because of the enlightened approach of some of the countries from which we obtain our investment. Countries like Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom recognise that tax concessions given by us should not be nullified by their actions and have agreed in Double Tax Agreements that taxes foregone by us can be deemed to have been paid in Singapore when they calculate the tax liability of the investors when these investors take back their profits to their home country. Unfortunately, USA has never recognised that it should not collect taxes foregone by other countries. However, because it has a tax deferral system that only taxes incomes earned abroad when they are returned to USA as dividends, our tax concessions still have an advantage to US
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> investors. If tax deferral is ended, it will nullify our tax concessions. While one can sympathise with the US government's attempt to remove the tax advantage it gives US investors abroad through its own tax policies, one cannot accept its attempts to collect taxes sacrificed by us who make such sacrifices in order to close the wide gap in economic development that we have with the developed countries. If tax deferral is ended, we must make every attempt to enter into some bilateral arrangement which will prevent taxes sacrificed by us ending up in US government coffers thus completely nullifying our tax concessions. One can only hope that the US government can be persuaded to adopt the more enlightened tax approach of countries like Germany and Japan.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also heartening to note that the Minister intends to fix the maximum marginal tax on repatriated profits at 40%. We are beginning to recognise that Singaporeans who have investments abroad should not be discouraged from bringing back their profits into Singapore. The move, however, does not go far enough. There is at present no hindrance to Singapore resident companies and individuals investing abroad. The various measures to liberalise exchange controls have really been adjustments of rules to reflect what is already possible rather than a real liberalisation. We still have scheduled and unscheduled territories in our exchange control regulations which are vestiges of the sterling area system. To scheduled territories like Hong Kong, a Singaporean can remit capital without limit. But Hong Kong itself has long ago abandoned the kind of controls associated with the sterling area concept so that funds that come into Hong Kong can quite freely be invested in any part of the world. Thus, a Singapore resident can, if he goes through certain legal steps, invest any amount in any part of the world through Hong Kong or even the United Kingdom. Having adopted a de facto system that is free of exchange controls on investment by Singaporeans abroad, our tax system has thus far been maintained to discourage them from bringing their foreign profits back to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Singapore. While the move to reduce the maximum marginal rate to 40% is welcome and should at least offer no discouragement for Singapore investors in Malaysia to bring their profits back to Singapore, it still does not encourage Singaporeans to bring back profits from other places which have lower taxes than Singapore. I am not suggesting that there should be no taxes on foreign income brought into Singapore by residents but the situation should be carefully monitored and taxes reduced to a level that will not discourage the return of profits accumulated by Singaporeans abroad.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Finance Minister's budget speech as announced at the end of last month fully reflects the stability of our economy. In spite of the sluggish recovery in the economy of the world, we have been able to achieve 7.8% growth, which exceeds the growth rate of some West European countries. This is something we should be proud of. Of course, we are fortunate to have a very wise and capable Finance Minister to help us achieve this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his new financial policy, the Finance Minister has also made the necessary adjustments to our tax structure which will lighten, equalise and rationalise the tax burden of our people in general. There are also new incentives offered by the Finance Minister to stimulate industrial and economic activities. On the whole, over the past ten years or so as a result of our successful industrialisation programme the profits of the industries have been growing. This helps to improve the standard of living of the people over the years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore, we have already solved the immediate economic problems of the incipient stage of our nationhood. Economic prosperity has solved the problem of livelihood of the people, and it has also brought about radical changes to our society. In the wake of economic prosperity,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> we are confronted with new urban social problems. As we know, Singapore is an open society, vulnerable to the influences from the external sources, particularly in the process of imbibing and importing science and technology and other things from the West. So we have also been subjected to the undesirable influences from other countries. Increased drug taking is one example. So there is the need for us to emphasise mother tongue education and together with our indigenous culture we can counter the influence of the decadent culture from the West. If we launch a cultural campaign, we will be more successful in our efforts. We must emphasise that culture plays an important role. In this respect I regret to note that in the next financial year the expenditure for cultural promotion is a very small amount of $49 million. This is a very meagre sum to develop culture. It is my hope that in subsequent financial years the Finance Minister will increase the vote for cultural promotion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with the lack of funds, it does not mean that cultural activities cannot be promoted. For instance, the Government can adopt other measures to promote cultural activities. Here, I would like to make some proposals for the consideration of the Finance Minister. In the past few years art circles have had quite a thriving activity but the trouble is that there were more viewers than buyers. I do not mean to say that works of art should be sold like a commercial commodity. Artists are human beings and they have to earn a livelihood. The cost of producing a work of art is increasing, and if artists are unable to sell their works, their spirit will be dampened because they will not earn enough to pay for their art materials. On the other hand, if we can encourage the people to buy works of art created by our local artists, it will be a great help to our artists. The Ministry of Finance should therefore provide the incentive by granting tax concession for the purchase of works of art produced by local artists. In the meantime, the income derived from the sales of works of local artists should be able to enjoy income tax exemption. To prevent any malpractices we can approach the National
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Art Gallery to act as the middleman for the transaction and to produce proof of sale for tax relief or tax deduction. I believe that with such encouragement, many companies, collectors and ordinary people will buy more paintings or other works of an. In this way, we can stimulate the promotion of art and culture in Singapore, thereby helping to bring about the graceful society of more cultured people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Finance will give serious consideration to my proposal. With this note, I support the financial policy of the Government.
  <br>6.12 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, from the point of view of the workers in Singapore, the shift and the impact of taxation in income to consumption tax is most welcome by Labour, as the tax burden would fall upon those who are most able to pay. It will be a welcome relief to the majority of workers who have to live within their basic needs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been another major concession in this Budget statement for the Finance Minister's decision to scrap the 5% tax on PUB bills of between $35 and $ 50. I am glad that this Government is not oblivious to the voice of its people through their representatives in Parliament. This is a popular move because there is an actual savings of about $2 per household per month. I am happy that the merits of the abolition of this tax will no doubt provide an added incentive for Singaporeans to save water and to conserve energy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the workers in Singapore will give their wholehearted support to the efforts of the Government to strengthen the economy and create employment opportunities for our people. I must, however, share my reservation with the Members of this House over some of the other proposals made by the Finance Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget Statement has also spelt out the Government's policy on manpower
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> development and it is in this area that I must comment on the system of training conducted at the Industrial Training Board and other training centres. It has been a common complaint by workers in manufacturing establishments that the prospect for upgrading their skills is remote because the ITB and other training centres conduct classes catering more to school leavers and employees working on normal office hours. We are aware that ITB also conducts evening courses but since the majority of industrial workers are on shift work, they are not able to take advantage of such training schemes. In line with the Government's objectives of upgrading the level of skills in our industries, it is my view that more companies should provide inplant training and that training centres, including those managed by ITB, exercise some measure of flexibility in the arrangement of the time schedules for such training courses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There would appear to be no justifiable basis for the 100% increase in the driving licence fees. The $10 increase is intended to bring in additional revenue amounting to $7 million in this financial year, but I am of the opinion that there are better ways of raising this revenue without adding on to the financial burden of the many thousands of workers whose occupations require the possession of a driving licence,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to express my reservation in respect of the increase in entertainment duty for live entertainments such as stage plays, concerts, recitals, music performances and dances. The increase in entertainment duty runs counter to Singapore's objective of promoting cultural activities. We have too often being dubbed a nation without a soul and, to prevent the Republic from becoming a cultural desert, there should not be an increase in the levy of this very form of entertainment which is not promoted for the purpose of profit-making. A distinction must be made between this form of cultural activity and the commercial entertainment provided in our nightclubs and cinemas.

  <!-- Mr Lim Chee Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Chee Onn (Bukit Merah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Hon. Minister for Finance began his Budget speech with the welcome news that Singapore did well in 1977 despite the difficult international economic situation. This simple and modest statement does not reflect the tremendous efforts that have gone into charting the proper course for our Ship of State. To be able to generate a growth of 7.8% in our economy and reduce unemployment to 3.9% in the face of falling world trade and slow recovery of the world economy takes more than just good fortune. The pragmatic policies and flexible approach which have been the hallmark of our development strategy have served us well in the past. We will do well to continue on these lines but at the same time we must bolster our shock absorbers to enable us to withstand the jolts of still higher fuel prices, increasingly protectionist policies of the industrialised countries and a slower growth in world trade.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the elements in our economic strategy over the next few years is to further upgrade our industries, especially in the production of capital goods. It is only right that the Government, especially the taxman, should lead the way in stimulating the corporate sector to achieve this. However, the success of our industrial, trade and services development programmes ultimately depends on much more than tax incentives alone. It requires our local entrepreneurs to develop, in addition to a razor-sharp mind, the keen perception of an opportunist and the acumen of an accomplished businessman. The question we must ask, is, how do our own entrepreneurs fare in comparison with those elsewhere, say, in Hong Kong or South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I am trying to make, Sir, is that such sterling qualities can only be developed and sharpened by active engagement in the competition for profits, especially in the international arena, and such battles must be fought without excessive molly coddling from the Government. Should our local entrepreneurs come to rely too much on the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Government to bail them out when the going gets tough, or worse still, become unwilling to make a move unless safe profits are assured either through further tax incentives or other fiscal aids, then I am afraid that one of two things can happen in a real hard crisis. Either our economic shock absorbers will break at the first impact with a sizable economic pothole, or the Government will have to keep on pouring incentive schemes one after the other into a bottomless pit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the fiscal policies outlined in the Minister's Budget Statement have not overlooked the need to encourage our entrepreneurs in prudent risk taking and to develop in them a true entrepreneurial ability. For this reason, I support these policies and welcome the proposed company tax package aimed at widening and deepening our industrial and financial sectors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While incentives can be given to channel resources in the right direction and to encourage investment in the more desirable industries, the whole plan will not got off the ground unless there are skilled and trained personnel to operate and maintain the lines of production.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am referring to the need to improve and upgrade our most precious assets, namely, our human resources. It is indeed strange that while acknowledging the immaturity of our industrial workforce, there has been little or nothing said regarding plans for its further development. In fact, I find it difficult to reconcile the desire to accelerate the deepening of our industrial sector with the fact that only 11 lines out of a 33-page Budget Statement were devoted to discussing manpower development.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I am slightly reassured by the fact that 15% of the estimated expenditure under the Main Estimates for FY 78 has been set aside for Education, out of which the vocational training institutes, secondary technical schools, education centres and universities will be getting their fair share, and the fact that over $15 million have been earmarked for expenditure in manpower planning under the Ministry of Finance's
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> vote, I hope that the passing reference to manpower development in the Budget speech does not mean that the Ministry of Finance has relegated the training and re-training of our workforce to a lower priority.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With greater emphasis placed on higher skills, and the setting up of high technology industries, it is inevitable that some members of the labour force will become apprehensive about the security of their future. This applies especially to those who are relatively older, and could even affect those who are semi-skilled or skilled. This is exemplified by the recent call by our local ship radio operators for assistance in upgrading themselves to radio officers as they have found it increasingly difficult to get jobs as radio operators.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In-house training programmes to upgrade the skills of existing employees would be ideal, but unfortunately not many factories at present undertake this task. I would urge the Government to look into this matter and consider ways of helping those who are in this predicament. Since most of the statutory boards which are also large users of manpower have fairly comprehensive training programmes, perhaps some arrangements can be made for them to help employees who have found themselves out on a limb as a result of technological change in our industries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same vein, Sir, I hope that in its anxiety and efforts to improve the lot of the senior civil servants so as to retain their services, the Ministry of Finance has not forgotten the people at the bottom of the civil service pyramid. The Government has reassured the public that every attempt will be made to improve the grade of services provided, be it in hospitals, airports, police stations or across counters in public offices. Much of the daily routine in such places is handled by Divisions III and IV officers, who more often than not are by-passed when plans for upgrading the conditions of employment for civil servants are formulated.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is these same officers who come into contact with the public most frequently. Should there be genuine grievances which create discontentment among junior officers, it will be in the interest of the Department or Ministry concerned to try to resolve these problems rather than to sweep them under the carpet or to will them away. Unless these problems are given an airing and are tackled squarely, efforts to raise the standard of service provided to the public will be to no avail. Sir, I hope that this remark will not be construed by the Hon. Minister to be in support of rudeness on the part of civil servants, for on the contrary, I would be the last to condone slipshod work and poor work ethics from any sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I do not wish to detract from the contributions made by senior civil servants, I wonder how often have the authorities spared a thought to improving the conditions and job prospects for junior officers. Obviously not every Division III or IV officer will have the aptitude for self-improvement through the acquisition of higher skills. But for those who have and are so inclined every assistance should be granted to them. For the others, either because of age or circumstances who have to persist in their jobs, my hope is that the Ministry of Finance would ensure that fair and sympathetic treatment is meted out to them either in improving their working conditions or in alleviating the tediousness of their work through mechanisation or other improvements of the systems in which they operate. In fact, it is in a Department's self-interest to ensure higher productivity from its staff by introducing mechanisation and establishing better working conditions.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister has acknowledged that there are shortages of officers in a number of Ministries. According to statistics given in the Budget for FY 78, out of 67,685 approved posts, there were 6,866 vacancies as at 30th November, 1977. The Ministry of Finance would do well to examine and identify the underlying causes for the relatively high number of vacancies in the Ministries of Health, Education and Home Affairs. It is not enough simply to carry out recruitment

  <br> exercises all the year and repeatedly turn-up figures reflecting a high turnover rate of staff. Positive steps must be initiated to counteract the trend.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being the largest employer, the Government should take the lead in introducing innovative measures to improve the skills of and working conditions for its employees, especially junior officers. Hopefully, the private sector will gradually follow suit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the unions, both in the public and private sectors, are more than willing to give their full support in any such exercise.

  <!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to congratulate the Hon. Minister for Finance on a Budget that will add wings to the "Horse" and change its gallop to flight like the mythical Pegasus.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, although 1977 was a difficult year and the world economic recovery slowed down and although the GNP of the seven major countries of the OECD grew by only 4%, Singapore has done well with an economic growth of 7.8% which is an 0.8% increase over 1976. This growth was achieved with relative price stability and the creation of 33,500 new jobs resulting in the fall of unemployment to 3.9%. All this has been the result of a sound Government with its sound financial policies and pragmatism, complemented by a resilient and hard working population. A further sound financial policy for 1978 backed by a people willing to meet challenges will see Singapore able to withstand the rigours of 1978 and next year we will be able to see the fruits of our labour and of our confidence in the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protectionism, Singapore being reclassified as a developed country, President Carter's proposal to end tax deferral, are some of the problems we are facing which could be detrimental to our achieving better growth rates in 1978. We therefore need to hasten the economical maturity of our skilled and managerial work force. To do this, we would also need expertise in these fields
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> from developed countries. When attracting investment, it is necessary for us to ensure that Singapore is attractive for the expertise that must inevitably arrive to start off the industry. The better the calibre of the experts, the more advantageous will it be for Singapore and Singaporeans. This would necessitate Singapore being able to offer an attractive environment with all the necessary paraphernalia like easy commuting on roads which are not congested, private schools with adequate facilities, leisure and recreational facilities, and so on. In short, those who come to Singapore to work for overseas investors from developed countries must find in Singapore a life for themselves and their families equal to, if not better than, what they enjoyed at home.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the world is becoming quite concerned about the problem of exposure to noise both in the industrial and urban environment, Singapore is a city state. In a few years' time 80% of our population will be living in HDB flats. The proximity of one household to another has been reduced tremendously; coupled with this is the noise generated by modern household equipment like the television, radio, washing machine, vacuum cleaner and so on. Modern entertainment too produces noise, music to many, unfortunately, of very high levels. A survey conducted by the Industrial Health Department, Ministry of Labour, confirmed noise levels in discotheques to be well above 9OdBA. The Senior Minister of State for Communications did mention a figure of about 105dBA. In the United Kingdom, an article I read indicated that there is a real hazard of noise-induced deafness among people exposed to musical noise of a high level.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need in Singapore to enhance our quality of life. Hence we should begin thinking of acceptable noise levels not only in our industry but also in our environment. Noise and vibration are regarded as the two factors that contribute to the pollution of the environment and have a detrimental effect on the health and comfort of the population. If exceeding certain thresholds, noise and vibration impair health and working capacity

  <!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to join my colleagues in congratulating the Hon. Minister for Finance for presenting a reasonable and fair Budget to this House on 27th February, 1978, especially the reduction in the payment of personal income tax for the Year of Assessment 1978 and the various tax incentives to the corporate sector. Although the Hon. Minister for Finance has reduced rates on personal income tax, he has also increased a number of taxes on expenditure, such as, registration fee on private cars, entertainment duty, driving licence fees, telephone tax, colour TV licence fee and airport tax. Fortunately, he ended with one concession, i.e. the abolition of 5% tax on PUB bills for consumption levels between $35 and $50 a month with effect from 1st April, 1978. However, the Budget that he has presented to Parliament is acceptable to us, and I hope in the next Budget presentation, he will not further increase tax on expenditure! He should concentrate on the 150,000 tax dodgers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in spite of the difficult international economic conditions, Singapore's economy grew by 7.8% which is slightly higher than 7% for 1976. In addition to this achievement, 33,500 new jobs were found in the commerce and manufacturing sectors. All these achievements have been made possible because of the Government's wise policy of diversified economy and dynamic drive in promoting local and foreign investments. It is also due to the Management for its capable and intelligent handling of business and to the workers for their hard work and productivity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully agree with the Hon. Minister for Finance that unless the United States, West Germany and Japan adopt expansionary policies, the world economy will not improve in 1978. If the world economy collapses, there will be chaos and more unemploy-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ment. The world is already over-populated. There are millions of workers being retrenched and they are waiting for new jobs. Several more millions of young people are also looking for jobs when they leave school, college or university. For these millions of unemployed people who are distressed, very frustrated and with empty stomachs, jobs should be created for them as soon as possible. I still believe the world economy will not collapse, especially if there is a kind of World Economic Aid Plan to be sponsored by Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait and other Middle East oil producing countries, together with the United States, West Germany and Japan. Through this World Economic Aid Plan, it will definitely boost industrial growth and expansion, eliminate protectionism and reduce unemployment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. Minister for Finance's 1978 Budget Statement stated that there is further progress in the ASEAN economic cooperation. There is also some progress in the ASEAN industrial projects. Since Japan has indicated giving financial assistance totalling US$l billion for these projects, I hope all the ASEAN leaders will expedite the launching of these projects which will give employment to the young people in ASEAN and strengthen the ASEAN economy as well.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy to hear from the Minister for Finance that unemployment fell from 4.5% to 3.9% while labour productivity improved as a result of continued upgrading of skills. The commerce and manufacturing sectors have created 33,500 new jobs. With the yearly increase of young people leaving school, college and the university looking for jobs, the Government, employers and workers must continue the present tripartite co-operation to create another 35,000 new jobs for them in 1978. I hope we can achieve this target if we have the will, guts and determination to strive for it. Also, we must see to it that our population growth is under control and to accept the fact that two children for a family is good enough whether two boys or two girls, especially for the middle and lower income wage earners. Too many children will be a burden to the worker and will make life miserable for him, his wife and children.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Wages Council recommended that for the year 1.7.77 to 30.6.78, the national wage increase guideline be 6% with full offsetting of all forms of increases in remuneration on a group basis. It has been calculated on the basis of the increase in the total annual wage bill arising from not only annual increments but also all other forms of remuneration, i.e. merit and promotion increments and collective agreement on wage adjustments, and prorated bonus and annual wage supplements but excluding CPF contributions by employees, overtime payments and fringe benefits.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, thousands of workers did not get a single cent of benefit at all from the NWC Wage Increase Guideline for 1977, because of the full offsetting of all forms of increases in remuneration on a group basis. Added to this disappointment, they have to contribute from their pay packet another 1/2% for saving in the CPF which has been increased from 15% to 15 1/2%. These workers are very unhappy. They ask: 'How can we save 1/2% of our wages for the CPF when we are not benefiting from the NWC Wage Increase Guideline for 1977? Why is them no NWC Wage Increase Guideline for the Managerial and Executive staff? Why is there no guideline when the companies are making bigger profits and therefore the workers should also get bigger bonus or Annual Wage Supplement? How can the same NWC Wage Increase Guideline be applied to all industries or business enterprises when comparing the profits of petroleum industry, banks and insurance companies with the small factories or small firms?' Surely the oil companies, banks and insurance companies can give better bonus or Annual Wage Supplement. However, if the workers are not going to get any benefit in the 1978 NWC Wage Increase Guideline, they should not be made to contribute extra CPF contribution.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the NTUC gave full support to the need for increased productivity by the workers, the employers' group immediately echoed their consent. When the NTUC and its affiliates requested for the formation of a Productivity Committee to increase productivity, and to formulate incentive payment for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the workers immediately you find a dead silence from them. In other words, their attitude is: 'You workers work harder; you increase productivity; we make bigger profit; Directors, Executive and Managerial Staff get bigger monetary reward. Shareholders get bigger dividend, but we pay you according to the NWC Annual Wage Increase. If you are not happy, you ask your NTUC and your Government!'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is very hard to believe that the employers are willing to give serious consideration to reward the workers for their toil and sweat for increasing productivity. They are only interested in making more profit. They are not interested in establishing Productivity Committees or pay incentive payment for increased productivity. Sir, to prove what I have said, may I quote from the Straits Times report dated 10th March, 1978, under the heading "NPB ON DEARTH OF PRODUCTIVITY COMMITTEES". I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So far 28 firms or 0.56 per cent of the 5000 in Singapore has set up productivity committees since the National Productivity Board started a campaign to form such committees about three years ago." Perhaps, Sir, in another three years, i.e. by 1980, another 28 firms will form Productivity Committees! In fact, some of the present established Productivity Com- mittees of the 28 firms are not active at all, or may I call them "Coffee Talk Committees" just to give an impression that there is such a Productivity Committee in Company XYZ! It would be interesting to know how many of the 28 Productivity Committees have achieved increased productivity and how many incentive payments have been made to the workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let us see how much progress or success we can achieve from the coming two-day National Conference of Productivity Committees which will be held on 21st and 22nd April, 1978. I am sure there will be papers presented by various representatives for the participants to read, study and digest. After this Conference, I hope it will produce some good results and progress for the benefit of the employers and workers especially monetary reward to the workers for their sweat and toil to increase produc-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> tivity or else do not waste time or waste papers just for the sake of producing papers only. The workers want currency notes and not just printed papers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I quote what the Minister for Finance said in Parliament from the Hansard, Volume 36, No. 10, column 530:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'While workers must put in their best efforts, employers have an equal responsibility to improve their management of personnel or of plant and machinery to increase productivity. Employers should consider the introduction of appropriate incentive schemes to reward efficient workers for their productivity. The initiative for formulating such schemes is clearly their responsibility as they have the greater resources and experience in this area.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, representatives of the employers' group will present papers at the coming two-day National Conference of Productivity Committees as from 21 st April 1978, and if they have no incentive scheme to pay the workers for increased productivity, they are wasting the workers' time. Lip service will not help to increase productivity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the presidents of the two associations, i.e. the Singapore Foochow Coffee Restaurant and Bar Merchants Association and the Kheng Keow Coffee Merchants Restaurant and Bar Owners Association, had admitted publicly in the Straits Times report dated the 8th March, 1978, I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'it is true that the price of coffee beans has gone down from over $900 to over $400 per 60.5 kg. a drop of 50%. But before the adjustment of the price of a cup of coffee, coffee beans cost only between $180 and $200 for 60.5 kg.' Sir, the fact remains unshakeable that the price of coffee beans has dropped 50% and therefore there is no excuse for them to refuse to reduce the price of a cup of coffee by five cents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I join my colleagues in support of the Financial Policy presented to Parliament by the Hon. Minister for Finance in his 1 978 Budget Statement on 27th February, 1978.

  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is encouraging to hear that
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> despite the poor shape of the world economy, we managed not only to hold our own but actually achieved a 7.8% growth. Obviously, the Government's monetary and fiscal policies have so far been very successful. For this, the Cabinet and in particular the Hon. Minister for Finance deserves our as well as the nation's congratulations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the strength of the Government's past achievements, I have every confidence that we will continue to do well. It is apparent that attracting new investments into Singapore is not an easy task. Advanced countries are being pressured into instituting protectionist measures to protect their own sagging economy. By using various means at their disposal, these advanced countries are making overseas investments financially unattractive. It is therefore incumbent upon us to offset this by offering potential investors a disciplined, hard-working and skilled workforce, a stable political environment and as an extra special effort to tip the scales in our favour, tax incentives like those proposed by the Hon. Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With little to offer by way of natural resources, any serious reversal in the present influx of capital into Singapore will have dire consequences. The Government should be commended for this aspect of its tax policy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the same cannot be said for some of the other tax changes that have been proposed. Although attempts are being made to make taxation more equitable, the steps taken so far do not seem to be very successful. The working population are paying their income tax faithfully, but this is not true with the self-employed and businessmen. Despite acknowledging the existence of tax dodgers, the Hon. Minister has not suggested any measure to bring them under this fold. Perhaps the Government could consider abolishing or modifying the present system of taxation and instituting in its place a system that taxes at source.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's concern over the continued increase in the number of cars on our roads is understandable, but it seems to me that the only means known to the Government to discourage car ownership is fiscal in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> nature. Increasing the additional registration fee by 25%, 100% or even 200% will not affect the upper income group. They can still afford to buy new cars and probably will. For some of the self-employed, expenditure on new cars are listed as business expenses and therefore eligible for tax benefits. However, has the Government thought of the problems that have been created for those fellow citizens who are in the lower income group? To these people, transportation is equally important. If they are discouraged to own cars, the only means of transportation is the public transport. However, our present public transport system is still not up to the required standard. Thus, these people are subject to a lot of inconvenience because they cannot afford to own cars and on the other hand they cannot rely on our bus services. Perhaps the Government should defer increases in Additional Registration Fee until such time when the people can rely on the public transport system. Another method of limiting car ownership without creating problems for the lower income group is to have a discrimination in taxing motorist. For example, we can have a progressive form of taxation for motorists.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having had his vehicle taxes increased, the motorist finds that he now has to pay a 100% increase in driving licence fees. The point that the last revision was some 12 years ago is appreciated. But I Wonder what is the aim of the Government in increasing this tax. Is the objective of the Government to discourage people from getting a driving licence, or has the administrative cost increased so much so that licence fees have to be increased so drastically? We should bear in mind that many farmers, delivery boys and even lorry drivers need driving licences to earn their living. For them, to pay $10 more a year is not a small sum.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past years, the Government has actively encouraged our citizens to appreciate some of the finer things in life such as music, drama and poetry. Officials from the Ministry of Culture have worked hard at organising concerts and recitals and establishing orchestras. Lately, even RTS announced the expansion of its FM stereo
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> service. However, we are now told that there will be an increase in the Entertainment Duty which affect duty rates for cinemas, amusement parks, trade fairs and live entertainment such as stage plays, concerts, recitals, music performances and dances. If the increase in duty is not passed on to the consumers, we have nothing to grumble about. However, is the Government going to stand firm on this and make sure the increase in duty does not affect the consumers?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the aim of the Government to make Singapore a clean and green city and to achieve this objective a tax incentive was given to owners and occupiers of houses to encourage them to maintain clean and attractive gardens. Today we can see many houses maintaining attractive and clean gardens and this is largely due to the tax concession offered by the Government. Unfortunately, the Government has decided to take away this concession at this juncture when more people should be encouraged to make the living environment more congenial and pleasant. Will not the people neglect their gardens once this tax concession is taken away or has the Government now believed that maintaining a clean and attractive garden is part of the people's way of life?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is my hope that the Minister for Finance would be able to devote sometime to devise a more equitable means of taxation.

  <!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when the budget was presented by the Finance Minister last month, the Minister made a comprehensive survey on the economy of Singapore. He also made out the prospects of our economy this year together with an appropriate and realistic appraisal of the various problems that we have to face in the next two to three years. He has given a good analysis of the whole situation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout last year, despite the world economy still in a state of stagnation and a very slow recovery of economic growth, Singapore's growth rate has been better than
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that in the advanced countries of the world. Our GDP increased by 7.8%, which is higher than the average growth rate of the countries in the world. For Singapore, a small island country without natural resources and independent for 13 years, it is quite a great achievement to be able to attain this growth rate in spite of strong protectionist pressure and sluggish economic growth of the major industrialised countries in the world.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this achievement is mainly attributed to the foresight of our Finance Minister who has adopted a realistic and enlightened policy to seize whatever opportunities advantageous to Singapore to promote our economic activities. He has also been able to take the necessary measures to cope with the ever changing situations in the international scene. On the domestic scene, the Government has been able at the same time to maintain political and social stability to provide a good investment climate. With the cooperation and effort of the Government, the employees and the employers, productivity has been increased, and it is through the hard work put in by the tripartite parties that we have been able to tide over many difficult times. This has come about definitely not by luck or chance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, the Budget presented by the Finance Minister reflects the wisdom of the Government, particularly in respect of tax adjustments which have great significance. The reduction in income tax and the increase in consumption tax is one of the main features of this budget before the House. It has significant merit in encouraging savings by the people. The reduction in personal income tax is also a piece of good news to the general wage earner. This measure reflects the intention and the determination of the Government to rationalise the tax structure in Singapore to bring about a more equal and just society. For the middle and upper middle income groups earning between $40,000 and $80,000 there will be a tax reduction of 10%. This is to prevent brain drain from this group of professionals on the one hand and to encourage greater and positive contribution from them on the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> other. In addition, this will assist in the further development of Singapore as a services centre.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Budget statement the Finance Minister stated that in the new financial year the main industrial thrust will be to develop products that will be less sensitive to the political climate in the industrial countries. This is a correct measure. Only with this measure will we be able to find an outlet for our products in the face of increasing trade protectionism. For example, in the recent signing of the textile agreement with the United States, it is only after our textile manufacturers have agreed to reduce the quota of the items sensitive to the political climate in the United States that they have been able to get increased quotas of less sensitive items.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget statement, the Finance Minister also stated that he would welcome multi-national corporations, and medium-sized and small-sized industries into Singapore to strengthen our industrial base. No doubt, multi-national corporations do make some economic contribution to our country and with our local existing medium and small-sized enterprises these two do complement each other. However, to a certain extent, are the multi-national corporations not strong competitors to the latter? It is my hope that the Government would look after these local medium- and small-sized enterprises as they are smaller in size and financially not strong enough and theref6re likely to become victims of this unequal competition. With the Government's assistance, they will be able to contribute to Singapore's economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past ten years or so, our emphasis has all along been on industrial development. At present, major industrial establishments are to a large degree as a result of foreign investments. Even in the case of joint ventures, they are mainly joint ventures between foreign capital and the Government. Local capital participation is still not ideal. I feel that the Government is not giving enough encouragement to local capital participation. While we could not
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> deny the importance of foreign capital to our economic development, there should also be more local participation in our industrialisation. The mobility of foreign capital is high, because profits are the main consideration. If there are profits, it will stay. If there are little or no profits, it will run away. But it is different in the case of local capital, simply because local capital is deeply rooted. It just cannot run away. It is an integral part of our economy and grows with it. Therefore, it will be a judicious measure to give greater encouragement and assistance to our local capital to participate in industrial development.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While touching on industrial development, the Finance Minister has also directed his attention to trade development. This will strike a balance in our economic development. However, on trade development the Finance Minister has given emphasis only on the promotion of export of industrial goods. All along, we have been giving the same emphasis when allowing deduction of double taxation for the participation in international trade fairs and trade missions abroad. The reduction of double taxation for permanent trade offices abroad for the first two years is also in the same vein. No adequate attention therefore has been given to our entrepot trade and trade with third world countries. Our entrepot trade has maintained our economic life-line over the past century. It is therefore regrettable that the concessional rate of 20% company tax is only applicable to offshore trading in respect of non-traditional commodities. It is said that over the past few years, because of our tax measures, many traders dealing in traditional products like rubber, copra, palm oil and pepper have shifted their operation base to Hong Kong. This shift is not only a loss in terms of revenue to Singapore but also in terms of other chain benefits, such as banking, financing, insurance and shipping businesses. I therefore hope that the Finance Minister will also grant this concessional company tax rate to such offshore trading companies dealing in traditional products.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past few years, with the concerted effort and cooperation of the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> various quarters, Singapore has been able to make progress in adversity and difficulty. With continued efforts and further cooperation from all concerned in the direction of our laid down development policies formulated in the interest of the people and the country, we will be able to move ahead together towards a more stable economic foundation and establishing a more fair and sound society, thus making Singapore a healthier and more progressive country.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion standing in the name of the Hon. Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past fortnight or so since presenting his Budget for FY 78, the Hon. Minister has received more than his share of bouquets and brickbats. Some have called his Budget a "happy surprise" while others have accused him of taking back with one hand what he dishes out with the other. His is not a job that most of us would envy. He knows he cannot please everyone.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cautious optimism that was reflective in the Minister's Budget statement of last year is again evident this year. He is right when he says that 1978 "may turn out to be a difficult year". Unemployment in developed countries and the tendency towards protectionism are two of the factors that he has pointed out and which would make it more difficult for us to export. Aside from these, there is the problem of unstable currency exchange rates. The US dollar continues to fall and it is now a question of whether or not the US Government will quickly take measures to stop it from collapsing. One can well understand the plight of oil-rich nations who are seeing their dollar reserves dwindling in value day by day. Some of them are already pressing for a revision in the price of oil and are even thinking of abandoning the US dollar in favour of another currency for their oil transactions. An international monetary disorder may just result. The increase in the price of oil, which was tactfully avoided at the end of last year, may
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> just occur in the coming months as those who have been pressing for the increase in price have even greater grounds to do so now. One can well imagine the economic crisis that can come.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this means we face a year of grave uncertainty. But no doubt the measures in the economic strategy of our Government will enable us to overcome some of the difficulties that lie ahead.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the principles underlying our democratic system is that those who are given the powers and the authority to discharge their responsibilities are also held accountable for the manner in which such responsibilities are discharged. In our parliamentary system a Minister is empowered with the administration of his Ministry. He is in turn accountable to Parliament for whatever is done by, or in, his Ministry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has however been recognised by many governments that certain functions cannot be performed efficiently and expediently if these are to be carried out amidst bureaucratic red-tape which is so characteristic of Government departments. Such functions are normally those of a commercial nature such as the provision of air services in competition with other airlines, or of an industrial nature. Or it may be a function involving the Provision of gas and water, or the promotion of sports or certain cultural activities. In all such instances Government has been able to Circumvent administrative rigidity by enshrining these functions in statutory boards or Government-owned enterprises. Of course there are other reasons for doing so, such as the need to identify precisely cost and revenue elements, which may not be easily done in government departments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while this device may result in efficiency in that the responsibilities can be carried out expediently, the accountability of such institutions remains debateable since they are now invariably removed from the rules and regulations which first bound them but which can no longer be applied to serve as a check on their performance.
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutory boards in Singapore are accountable to Parliament. They are created by Acts of Parliament. Their objectives are debated upon. The line of accountability is clearly established. Each statutory board is answerable to Parliament through its Minister in charge. Their annual reports are tabled in Parliament. Their accounts are audited by the Auditor-General and are scrutinised also by the Public Accounts Committee which is empowered to call up officers and papers of the boards for examination.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this manner of accountability, those who have been delegated the powers to discharge their duties are also required to give explanations as and when required. Where there have been abuses and excesses, the findings are transmitted by the Auditor-General or the Public Accounts Committee to Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the case of Government-owned companies, the situation is in contrast. In the first place they are formed by simply registering with the Registrar of Companies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for forming such companies need not be debated upon; on the contrary the public may not even be aware that such-and-such a company has been formed. Its policies and activities may not even be known. This must be viewed with concern especially when public funds are being used in forming the capital of such companies. Secondly the manner in which such public funds have been used in order to attain the objectives of the company cannot be questioned. The accounts are not audited by the Auditor-General; neither are they presented to Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that they are audited by commercial auditors but audit by commercial auditors and audit by the Auditor-General are two different things. For one thing, the commercial auditor is more concerned that accounting procedures are carried out in accordance with accepted accounting principles and standards, the Auditor-General of the country is concerned with matters such as wastage and irregularities. Without having to go into further details regarding
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> these two different types of audit, it would suffice for me to say that a commercial audit of a Government-owned company would certainly be inadequate in providing for even the tiniest measure of accountability.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be fair, Sir, I am sure that our Government-owned companies are accountable to their Ministers-in-charge but the questions are, to what degree are they accountable, and how effective has the accountability been? Does it mean only the presentation of annual financial statements showing healthy profits?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again to be fair, Sir, Ministers have in fact answered questions posed in this House in relation to Government-owned companies. For instance, recently the Honourable Minister for Finance has answered questions on companies such as Sugar Industry of Singapore and Singapore International Airlines but it is clear that he can choose not to do so if the answer required of him entails disclosure of commercial matters that would be useful to competitors. The lines of accountability are therefore vague. Parliament cannot debate on the need to form a company, or the objectives and policy of a company. I cannot help but just reflect on the decision of the Port of Singapore Authority to form Changi International Airport Services to provide ground services at the new Changi Airport. Should not Parliament debate on such a decision while it was in its proposal stage?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many questions can be asked: Is it not sufficient for Singapore Airport Terminal Services to provide this service? Why allow a port authority to provide airport services? Why allow one Government-owned company to compete with another? Above all, why duplicate your investments?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that lines of accountability and I mean effective accountability must be clearly established. This must start with Parliament voting on the capital investment, and debating on the formation of such companies. The auditing of the accounts of such companies by the Auditor-General whose report would supplement those of the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> commercial auditors would be presented to Parliament for scrutiny by the Public Accounts Committee. Close monitoring of policies and activities and evaluation of performance can then be better achieved.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in ensuring this measure of accountability, caution must be taken that this does not result in rigid control that would strangle the efficiency of such companies. One must remember that a Government-owned company competes with others in a free market economy, and too rigid a control for the purpose of ensuring accountability would only bring it back to the very same situation which by its formation it was trying to avoid, and would tantamount to strangling the life out of it. Somewhere along the line there is a need to strike a balance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the trade-off point where the rules can provide for the accountability of those who have been entrusted with wealth not of their own and who have been empowered to utilise such wealth, without unnecessarily stifling the initiative, enthusiasm and efficiency that are so necessary if at all the results that are desired are in fact to materialise? This is the delicate question which I hope will generate food for thought. It is a question that must be asked now if we consider the mushrooming of Government-owned enterprises over the past 10 years. It is perhaps even more delicate a question if you consider that some of these enterprises are wholly Government-owned while some are joint ventures between the Government and the private sector. Some distinction in the extent of accountability between these two types of Government companieS have to be made. It is a question which, as of the moment, cannot be easily answered, but I hope that some thought will be given to this question.

  <!-- Mr Tan Cheng San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tan Cheng San (Paya Lebar)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion for approval of the financial policy of the Government, moved by the Finance Minister on 27th February, 1978.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the midst of slow economic growth and increasing protectionism in the advanced industrial countries, we are glad to hear the announcement by the Finance Minister of certain tax concession measures for the benefit of the people, such as the lowering of personal income tax, abolition of the 5% tax on PUB bills for those whose monthly consumption is between $35 and $50 and other tax concessions for companies. The adjustments in the additional registration fees of private cars and colour TV licence fees, etc. are also very timely measures, as all these are a step towards the rationalisation of our tax and revenue structure that will be beneficial to our people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we all know, all these years personal income tax has been a matter of great concern for our people. Because of the success of our industrialisation programme, economic prosperity and the continued flow of foreign capital into Singapore, the incomes of our people have risen over the past 10 years. So the tax base has been broadened to include more wage earners. This is one of the main sources of revenue for the Government. Obviously, the announcement of a tax reduction will benefit the great majority of wage earners. The next announcement regarding the abolition of 5% tax on PUB bills on consumption between $35 and $50 is yet another measure that will benefit wage earners generally and will certainly be welcome by the broad masses in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in my humble view, the increase in the Additional Registration Fee on private cars is also reasonable and in keeping with the Government's policy of encouraging greater use of public transport. But as for the increase in driving licence fees, I hope the Government will give special consideration for the professional drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the increase in the licence fee for colour TV, I think it is also reasonable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of company tax, the investment tax credit scheme and other tax incentives, I think they are a step in the right direction as they will promote the development of manufacturing and servicing sectors in Singapore, attracting more local and foreign investments, thus creating more job opportunities for Singapore. But I would like to point out that while the trade unions are promoting workers' productivity very strongly it is regrettable to note that some employers are not very enthusiastic and nonchalant about productivity councils or committees. Therefore, I think the Government should take a more positive step to further increase the understanding and interest of the employers on the importance of productivity. Only then will our manufactured goods be able to compete favourably in the competitive international markets.

  <!-- Haji Sha'ari bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Haji Sha'ari bin Tadin (Bedok):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, allow me to make some comments and observations with the little time at my disposal, and I shall try to be as brief as possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the budget has been described by a leading newspaper as "being pragmatic and appropriate" and also hailed by business circles as "fair". One thing, Sir, which struck me and many of us both inside and outside the House is the unexpected "tax concessions" in personal income tax which came rather as a surprise. Here, Sir, I would like to quote the Finance Minister's remarks, inter alia, "the need to reward effort whether manual skills or intellectual discipline and at all levels," is well taken. The Government was prepared to lose $53.9 million in the first year and this gesture was welcomed by all of us in this House as well as those 26% of the work-force who are paying annual income tax. Much to everyone's relief it comes at a time when Singapore's economy is slowly picking up. The 7.8% growth achievement for the year 1977 was, in fact, a satisfactory performance considering the year was a difficult one.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the prospects for 1978 the Minister predicted that this year 1978 may turn out to be a difficult year in view of the protectionist measures taken by developed nations against our products. As rightly pointed out by the Minister, if this tendency towards protectionism increases our own exports will be greatly affected and we may be in for hard times. However, Sir, the economic strategy and measures, like diversifying our economy and moving into higher technological and more sophisticated products as outlined by the Minister, will put us in good stead and Singapore's economic prospects will not be that gloomy in the coming years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one disturbing fact of the Minister's Budget which he pointed out posed a threat to our economic growth, i.e. the reclassification of Singapore as a "developed country" according to IMF yardstick. Our per capita income, which is second only to Japan because of our high GNP growth and our much publicised success story, has earned us the reputation of the most "developed" of all developing countries in the Third World countries. However, I do not think it is to our advantage to be reclassified as a developed country like the advanced and developed countries in Europe and North America. We have quite a long way to go to achieve the same level as that of the countries mentioned. We have enjoyed a good measure of political and economic stability making us unmatched not only in all Asia but also in almost the entire world. However, the fact still remains that Singapore is a city state with no natural resources to depend on and our economy is so vulnerable to external factors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I now touch on another aspect of the growth and prospect of our Budget, i.e. our industrial development. In this respect, Sir, I must commend the efforts made by the Economic Development Board in their promotional efforts to get more investment to Singapore. The steps taken by the Minister to improve upon the present incentives in the Economic Expansion Incentives Act by introducing an investment credit scheme in order to allow
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the local and foreign companies to expand is definitely a big booster and will help our economy tremendously, especially in the field of industrialisation. The other thing, Sir, the financial assistance to be extended to our local entrepreneurs who wish to enter into business of their own after acquiring the necessary skills will be most welcome. Singapore as a city state with no natural resources will have to push its market through participation at international trade fairs and trade missions abroad. In this respect, Sir, the Department of Trade which carries out this function of export promotion must be commended for its relentless effort in trying to sill and find new markets for our Singapore-made products.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the account given by the Hon. Minister in his Budget and financial policies, it is clear that our main economic growth seems to be in the services sector (mainly in commerce and transportation which accounted for 64% of the increase). It is therefore important and necessary that our efforts to make Singapore a financial, convention, warehouse and services centre be stepped up, especially when we also face competition from cities like Hong Kong, Manila and Tokyo. The measures taken by the Hon. Minister to reduce the company taxes and other tax concessionary measures auger well for the future of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore's economic success and rapid industrial growth were not due to miracles but through hard work and pain-staking effort on the part of our economic planners. Yet, today, Sir, many Singaporeans take our success story for granted. For example, the recent outbursts and comments made by some students of Junior Colleges over the long stay in campus is a case in point. These youngsters should be grateful for what they are getting or enjoying.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, speaking of tax increases introduced by the Finance Minister to recover the loss in revenue, I share the views expressed by Members of this House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a closing remark, Sir, may I make one final observation. To many Singaporeans,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> only the tax concessions interest them. They do not realise the full implication of the Budget. They are only interested in what way the tax concessions affect their income and expenditure. Other than this aspect, very little is discussed in terms of economic growth. What more when the Budget language is such that it is full of economic terms such as GNP, GDP, etc, which mean very little to the man-in-the-street. Sir, if I may suggest (whether this comes under the purview of the Ministry of Finance or Education) that informative booklets to explain in very simple language, the implication of the Budget, be brought out so that even secondary school children can understand it. The Budget has always generated interest amongst certain people but the time has come for us to make the Budget better understood among our young and the not-so-well educated. Perhaps, the Press would start a series called "Understanding Our Budget" to achieve this. In this way, more of our people will appreciate the efforts made by our Government to achieve greater economic growth.
  <br>7.28 p.m.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to thank all Members again for their most interesting and valuable contributions to the Budget debate this year. In spite of many critical comments and some reservations, the general impression which I received from the remarks was one of general approval for the Government's economic and financial policy. Contrary to what one or two Members have stated, I have listened most carefully to all the remarks and I can assure Members that they have not fallen on deaf ears.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the remarks I made in the Budget Statement, the opening section was On economic growth. While some attention has been given to this part of my Budget Statement, I think it has perhaps aroused less interest than others. Most Members were congratulatory of Singapore's attaining a 7.8% growth in spite of the very difficult
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> conditions. One or two Members thought that the achievement of favourable growth rates was to be expected and that the remarks which were made in the Budget Statement, or perhaps in public statements by other Ministers, have been rather too scary to be true - that the warnings of economic difficulties to come should not always be accepted and that the performance can always be expected to be better than the expectation. I will only remind Members that two years ago we had a growth rate of only 4% so that if we are not to revert to growth rates of this order, we will have to continue to be vigilant, I do not wish to touch in the very short time at my disposal, on the many remarks which have been made on this part of my Budget Statement. In any case. some Members have already partly done my job for me, and perhaps better than I can do myself. I will therefore confine myself to matters which have not yet been touched upon.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, with regard to trade restrictions and protectionism. Many Members have referred to this and the need for getting away from textiles which have given us some problems and will continue to do so in the future. I think this is only prudent and that we should move as rapidly as possible to very less sensitive products. There was general support for my views on tax deferral and on ASEAN matters.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On productivity, the Member for Aljunied, the Member for Paya Lebar and other Members too complained about certain sections of our employers who were not perhaps quite as enthusiastic as they would like on the need to increase productivity. I am most gratified to note the very strong support of the NTUC on this particular aspect of our economic policy. I have no doubt that the more enlightened employers also welcome this attitude of the NTUC and will be gratified with such a response which in many countries is not to be expected. There are, of course, already in many companies those who are convinced of the need for greater productivity, not excluding the Governmentowned companies, especially the shipyards
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> which have done more than pay lip service to the idea and have shown their enthusiasm for it in the form of currency notes, as one of the Members wanted, I am sure this example will be followed by very many employers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Boon Teck complained that the ITB training was not available for industrial workers because they were not able to take advantage of training schemes as many workers were on shift duty and therefore could not even attend those training schemes after office hours. This is a matter which will surely be given attention. This particular subject was also given attention by the Member for Bukit Merah. I certainly agree with him that plans for the further development of skilled personnel should, be given more emphasis. I hasten to assure him that the brief treatment of this matter in my Budget Statement does not mean that the highest priority is not being given to it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Ho Swee expressed some dissatisfaction with the National Wages Council's guidelines and the increases which Labour has obtained. I hope his representations can be made more forcefully, and I am sure they will be given full consideration, in the NWC itself. I am in agreement with the need to increase more local investments. I cannot agree, however, with the Member for Tiong Bahru that I should give concessions to present businesses in the entrepot trade. The whole purpose of giving concessions is that they should be induced to go into additional lines of activity, and I hope that the present entrepot traders will move into those areas.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the criteria for tax concessions for the brain industries, or the industries for off-shore trading, the intention was that there should be a greater concentration of expertise and effort, and a merger of many different kinds of expertise into a bigger company which would then be enabled to operate effectively overseas. I hope that Singapore will be able to develop some trading corporations of the kind that the Japanese or the Koreans at present have, which do not mean just one or two traders
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> but a whole body of experts in marketing as well as in packaging, distribution and perhaps even going backwards into manufacturing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to turn to the Budget. Representations from Members on this have been very few. Perhaps I have missed a few remarks, but only two have been noted by me. The Member for Kallang submitted some interesting tables on public finance. I have not checked the figures but I think they are substantially correct, although a brief glance at the section on Public Finance in my Economic Survey indicates that perhaps we do not agree on the figure for 1975, where the Overall Surplus was given as $740 million in my Economic Survey against a somewhat lower figure in his Table 11, which is $142 million. His figure of $189 million more closely agrees with the figure of $188 million in Table IX of my Economic Survey. But in the analysis on Public Finance, it has been shown in my Economic Survey that overall for the public sector there is, in fact, a deficit. I would refer him to cols. 485-6 of the Economic Survey.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Merah spoke of the need for improvement of schemes and conditions of service for the lower echelons in the Civil Service and the need for improvement of the machinery of Government. This is a matter on which I have the fullest agreement. This will be given attention in due time. The need for innovative measures is certainly very much accepted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Alexandra raised the problems of the accountability of statutOry boards and Government-owned companies. I had the impression that he was satisfied with the position as far as statutory boards are concerned but he was not quite so happy about the accountability of Government-owned companies. I am not exactly clear what the Member intends. The desirability of the formation of Government-owned companies is, of course, a matter for the Ministers of the various Ministries or, if there is any dispute as to whether there is a need for such companies, then the matters can be resolved by the different Ministries concerned. I am not sure whether the House
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ought to be in a position to monitor and take over the decision-making job or, in fact, the management of such companies. If, of course, there are irregularities or failures on the part of such companies, the House is always at liberty to put the Minister concerned on the carpet.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the part of the Budget which seems to generate much greater interest, the sections on taxes. The reaction of Members has been rather varied. Many seem to approve certain taxes. Others seem to find some objection to them. Only the Member for Anson, I believe, appeared to approve all the measures, very generally. The Member for Khe Bong was perhaps the most critical.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> It is because I love you more than they do!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> He spoke of this as being capitalistic. I ought to remind him that the allocation in our Budget for social expenditure is now very much the largest of all the allocations. It is in the region of 40% and if this is capitalistic, then I do not know what would be more socialistic. The fact is that many of these social expenditures require a viable economy to be able to sustain them, and I make no apologies for the nature of the Budget which has been presented here.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of the incentives which have been offered, there was fairly general approval of the tax incentives for companies and of the need which I expressed for expansion of the economy by inducing more investments, particularly in new industries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some criticism, however, of the implementation, particularly the delay in getting schemes moving and in getting better results from these schemes. The Member for Jalan Kayu suggested that we have delayed the implementation of the credit scheme for exports and that the result for the small industries scheme was rather meagre. I myself would be very happy if we could get more action moving on some of these
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> schemes. The problem is that we have to rely on the private sector for some of these schemes to be implemented. For example, in the small industries scheme, we would like a lot more small entrepreneurs, small industries, to make applications. The funding of these entrepreneurs and schemes would be no problem. It is a matter of getting enough projects and getting good projects. On the other hand, we do not want to just give money away. We want to make quite sure that the schemes are viable and that the people to whom we give the money will learn how to run a viable business.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concession on personal income tax was not so generally well received. Some Members were dissatisfied with the distribution of the reductions in tax. Obviously, if one is paying very little tax, it is not possible to reduce it very much. So for the lower levels, the absolute amounts must be much smaller. If one is paying only $50 in tax, it can only be reduced by $50 at the most. On the other hand, if one has an income tax payment of $50,000, the amount that can bo reduced must be considerably greater. In percentage terms, I think we have tried to be equitable in the reduction of tax. Of course, it is not possible to satisfy everyone. If there are any suggestions for a better method, in spite of the fact that I am accused of not listening to Members' representations, I will be very happy to consider them at the next budget presentation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some reference to the 150,000 potential taxpayers. I hasten to assure Members that while it is administratively and economically not very practicable to bring all the 150,000 potential taxpayers to book, in the more flagrant cases I think we will be very happy to make an example. Many budget sessions ago, I asked Members for names so that our Income Tax Department could pursue the question of taxes which should be imposed upon certain occupations. I have not received a single suggestion so far. But I will be happy to receive them even at this date.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consumption tax aroused much greater heat. There were a number of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> comments on entertainment tax. I congratulate Members for being so culture-minded as to suggest that all the cultural shows should, in fact, not have the entertainment taxes increased. I do make a distinction between cultural shows and shows in nightclubs. In fact, most cultural shows are exempt from entertainment duty and I give Members an assurance that the exemption will continue for cultural shows.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as consumption taxes are concerned, I must remind Members that there is no need for anyone to pay these taxes. The way to avoid tax is very simple. Just do not pay. You do not have to buy a new car. In any case, the increase in ARF is only for people who want to buy new cars. There has been no increase in the expenditure for people who are already motorists. The need for this particular tax is clear from the figures of car registration which have been coming in over the last few months. There has been a considerable net increase in the number of cars registered and apparently, just like in the case of tobacco, people have got accustomed to the tax and are now going back again to the previous frequency of expenditure. Therefore, with the amount of money which has been released by reductions in personal income tax, there are very few more likely consumption expenditures which people in those income tax bracket are likely to want to splurge on. I am sure that motorcars, like in many other countries are items which very few people give up until the very last. So it is very necessary that these particular increases in the ARF should be imposed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On colour TV, I was very careful, because of the increase in entertainment tax, not to impose too high a tax on colour TV licences. The increase is only $18. I thought the first reaction of many people was correct - that this is a very small increase. A lot of people expected that the increase would have been not 50% but 100% or even 200%. $18 works out to $1.50 a month. I am sure anyone who purchases a colour TV set should be able to afford this. In fact, I was a bit surprised that Members did not, as I expected, compliment me on my moderation in this respect
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> although the Member for Paya Lebar was one of the exceptions. He thought that it was very reasonable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a bit surprised that among the tax concessions which were withdrawn, the Member for Serangoon Gardens, the Member for Changi and maybe one or two others spoke against the withdrawal of the concession for gardens. The amount which was given did not I think make very much difference to the people who own gardens and therefore I did not expect very much of a reaction. I must say that I am rather pleasantly surprised.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a number of novel suggestions for future concessions; one of these was the question of works of art being eligible for tax concessions. I must say that this would be one of the last articles that I would have thought of. But I will certainly give this some consideration when the proper time comes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think I have concluded my speech. I would merely want to end by making two quotations. One is that there are only two things certain in this world - death and taxes. I hope Members would accept that taxes must be paid. I have authority for this in St. Paul's epistle to the Romans. This is in a very modern translation of The New Testament. It is paraphrased, and it says:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Obey the laws, then, for two reasons: first, to keep from being punished, and second, just because you know you should.
  <br>
