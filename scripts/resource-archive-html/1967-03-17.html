<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wish  to  draw the attention of this House to Chapter

III  of  the Report of the Constitutional Commission,

1966. While appreciating that the Commission has gone

thoroughly  into the pros and cons of the setting  up

of the proposed Council of State, I have a few points

to  comment  on the recommendation, as the Commission

did   not   seem   to  have  taken  them   into   its

consideration when deliberating on its recommendation

for a Council of State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission in its Report has advanced various

reasons  why there should be a Council of State.  The

Commission also has envisaged the proposed Council of

State  as  a  purely  advisory  body  to  which   the

Government  can  look for serious and weighty  advice

without  being subject to its control.  Thinking  the

matter  over carefully, I have serious doubts whether

such   a   Council  of  State  is  really  necessary.

Singapore is an island Republic of scarcely more than

220  square miles. We are not a continent. We have  a

population  of less than 2 million. In  addition,  we

have  a  unicameral  legislature  whose  Members  are

elected by secret ballot periodically. The plain fact

is  that  no  citizen of Singapore is  so  physically

remote  from his elected representative in Parliament

that  he  cannot air his views or grievances  through

such  elected  Members. Conversely,  because  of  the

relatively  small physical area of his  constituency,

no elected Member of Parliament has any excuse to say

that  he  does not know what is going on  within  his

constituency. This brings me back to the  question  I

have  posed earlier to this House, which is, what  is

the necessity and purpose of such a Council of State?

In  brief,  the  question is  whether  Singapore  can

afford  to have such a luxury as a Council  of  State

which,  though proposed as an advisory body, performs

the function of an Upper House of the Legislature. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>



am  of the view that the proposed Council of State is

a  luxury,  because  I  do  not  consider  it  to  be

essential or necessary for the proper government  and

management of the Republic of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am further strengthened in my

belief that the Council of State is superfluous  when

it  is considered that the Commission has seen fit to

place  certain  limitations  on  the  powers  to   be

exercised  by the proposed Council of State.  One  of

these  restrictions on the functions of the  proposed

Council  of State is that the Council would  have  no

power to consider any Supply Bill or a Bill presented

on  a Certificate of Urgency. I do not intend to make

any further comment on such restriction in so far  as

it concerns a Supply Bill, for I am in agreement with

the  Commission that it is hardly proper for such  an

advisory  body to be in a position to  comment  on  a

Bill which merely authorises expenditure or outlay of

money  from  the  Consolidated Fund  in  relation  to

matters  on which this House has voted. I  am  rather

puzzled about the exemption of Bills presented  on  a

Certificate of Urgency from the jurisdiction  of  the

Council of State. It is always open to the Government

to  present  any  Bill it wishes on a Certificate  of

Urgency. I am not by any means implying that if  this

recommendation for a Council of State is accepted  by

this House, the Government of the day would pursue  a

course  of action which would have the effect of  by-passing  such  an advisory body as much as  possible.

Nevertheless, with the formation and establishment of

such  an  advisory  body,  it  is  possible  that   a

situation  would  arise  where  the  members  of  the

proposed  Council of State might not see eye  to  eye

with  the Government on the subject matters contained

in  certain Bills. Such a situation is not  that  all

far-fetched  when it is noted that  in  the  proposed

recommendation for a Council of State. The Commission

has expressed its opinion that security of tenure for

the  members of the proposed Council of  State  is  a

necessary  element to enable the proposed Council  to

discharge its function



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>



without  fear  or favour  in  relation  to  the

Government.  Thus  a  situation  would  arise   where

persons  appointed  to such Council  might  entertain

convictions  or beliefs which might differ  radically

from  the  policy  of  the Government.  When  such  a

situation  arises,  it would become  obvious  to  the

Government  of the day that it would be  useless  for

the  Government to submit a Bill to such  Council  of

State  which does not have consensus of opinion  with

the  Government  in  respect of the  subject  matters

contained in such Bill. And as I have stated  before,

it  would  be  quite  natural  and  logical  for  the

Government  to  submit a Bill  on  a  Certificate  of

Urgency  in  order  to avoid being  delayed  by  such

Council of State. No recommendation has been made  by

the  Commission as to how to restrict the  Government

from  indiscriminately  introducing  any  Bill  on  a

Certificate  of Urgency. Nor, for the reasons  stated

in  relation to the independence of decision of  such

Council,   can   any  provision  be   made   in   the

Constitution of Singapore in relation to the proposed

Council  of  State  to provide  for  the  removal  of

Council   members  who  might  prove  to  be   unduly

obstructive   to   the   effective   and    immediate

implementation of any decision by the Legislature. As

I  have  said, such a provision would be inconsistent

with  the  very  existence of such an  advisory  body

which  is meant to function independently and  freely

of the executive body of the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if the members of the Council of

State  are readily amenable to the Government's  view

on  any  matter contained in any Bill, it would  give

rise  to  cynical  stories and jokes  that  the  most

important  qualification a person can possess  to  be

considered for appointment to such Council is that of

political  sympathy  with the Party  in  power.  This

would  be  a  natural consequence even  though  these

members  have  no political sympathy or affinity.  In

actual  fact,  they  have no  political  sympathy  or

connection with the Party in power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, where a Council of State contains members who

are  obstinate in their views, the temptation is very

strong for the Government to introduce a Bill on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>



a  Certificate  of  Urgency in order  to  bypass  the

Council.  And  against such temptation  there  is  no

constitutional  check.  But  where  members  of   the

Council of State are reasonable and endorse any  Bill

of the Government in power, I am doubtful what useful

function  such  Council performs as a  constitutional

check on the Government of the day in the exercise of

its powers. Here I am using the words "obstinate" and

"reasonable" in the subjective sense as seen from the

Government's viewpoint.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to return to the point, the very fact that the

proposed Council of State is envisaged as an advisory

body  to Parliament implies that the persons who  are

likely  to comprise such a Council are in a  position

to   advise   the   elected  Members  of   Parliament

correctly.   But  what  is  the  nature   of   advice

contemplated  by the Commission? As  I  see  it,  the

advice  is  in  the form of specialist and  technical

representation  or  reflection  of  the  electorate's

feelings or temper. The Commission has not shown  how

such  Council  would be more effective and  efficient

than  the  prevailing  machinery  or  procedure   for

gauging  public opinion or reaction to  any  proposed

Bill by referring such Bill to a Select Committee  of

this  House.  I cannot see how a Council,  comprising

persons  appointed  for  a fixed  term,  can  provide

comprehensive specialist guidance in relation to  any

Bill at any one time. As for gauging public reaction,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I should think that  the  elected

Members of this House are better equipped and  placed

than the members of the proposed Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am thus of the opinion that the recommendation of

the Commission in respect of the proposed Council  of

Stale  should not be accepted by this House for these

two main reasons:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Such Council is a luxury which Singapore can

ill-afford, because it is not only a luxury but  also

a   rather   expensive  luxury.   Although   in   its

recommendation the Commission has suggested that  the

Council of State should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>



use  the  existing facilities that are  available  to

Parliament   and   to   the   executive   body    and

administrative organ of the Singapore Government,  it

is  nonetheless necessary to make provision  for  new

staff and new facilities to meet the requirements  of

such Council of State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The very concept of such a Council of State

implies  that  the present unicameral system  of  our

Government  is inadequate and unsatisfactory  in  the

discharge of its functions. That being the  case,  it

is  hard  to  believe,  for reasons  I  have  already

stated,  that  the proposed Council of  State,  which

consists of nominated members (Parliament is composed

of  elected Members), would supplement and remedy the

implied   deficiency  of  the   present   system   of

Government.  The Commission has in its recommendation

put  forward  its view that the proposed  Council  of

State  serves as an advisory body to Parliament.  But

it  has  not  indicated  in what  way  that  such  an

advisory  body  would be in closer  contact  with  an

electorate   which  elects  by  secret   ballot   its

representatives  in Parliament. I do  not  share  the

optimism   of   the   Commission  that   persons   of

respectable  standing in their respective  profession

or  community  are  in  a better  position  than  the

elected  Members  of  Parliament  to  ascertain   the

feelings  and aspirations of members of  the  general

public.  If anything, such persons are likely  to  be

more  aloof  and removed from the general members  of

the  public.  It  is difficult to  envisage  that  an

eminent   lawyer   or  a  highly  qualified   medical

specialist  is  more accessible  to  members  of  the

public  than, say, an ordinary Member of this  House.

If   the   Members  of  the  House  discharge   their

obligations   to   their  respective   constituencies

faithfully and regularly, I think this question of  a

Council  of  State  will take  care  of  itself.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  that  is all I have  to  say  on  the

Council of State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the recommendation of the Commission for

the  setting  up  of  an Ombudsman (or  Parliamentary

Commissioner  for  Administration)  as  contained  in

Chapter  IV  of  its  Report,  I  have  in  mind  the

observation of the Commission that it is likely  that

some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>



act  or  decision of Government or the administration

or  any statutory board or public body can give  rise

to   complaints  by  citizens  whose  interests   are

affected  by such acts. From my own experience  as  a

trade  unionist, I can assure this House that workers

do  sometimes  feel frustrated and let down  by  laws

which  are  expressly designed for their  protection.

For  instance,  an arbitration machinery  is  set  up

under  the Industrial Relations Ordinance,  1960,  to

expedite the settlement of disputes and grievances of

the workers. Circumstances, for which no provision is

made  in  the  Ordinance, have arisen  where  workers

cannot  have  recourse to such arbitration  machinery

for the settlement of their grievances. This is all I

say on the matter of the Ombudsman.



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I am confident that the

Report of the Constitutional Commission, 1966,  which

is  being  debated in this House is a wise Report.  I

believe  our people will accept it in good faith  and

with   open   arms,  because  the  members   of   the

Commission,  who  deliberated on the  representations

from  individuals  and  from political  and  cultural

organisations   and   other  associations,   comprise

citizens of Singapore of diverse origins. If we refer

to  page  28 of the Report, we can see the  names  of

members  of  the Commission. They come  from  diverse

communities and they therefore represent the  various

communities.  And it goes without saying  that  these

members profess various religions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, Mr Speaker, I see that the

Constitutional Commission is a non-party  commission,

and its members are not active in politics except for

Syed  Esa  Bin  Syed  Hassan  Almenoar  who  is   the

Secretary-General of U.M.N.O., Singapore. The  ruling

Party, the P.A.P., however, is not represented in the

Commission by its Secretary-General.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After considering the memoranda which it received

from  individuals  and  political  associations,  the

Commission drafted its Report which has been received

unanimously - and this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>



includes the Secretary-General of U.M.N.O. This  goes

to  prove  that this Report is very wise  indeed  and

will be a very significant document in the annals  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the recommendations of the

Commission,  these have been accepted unanimously  by

its  members, as I have said earlier. Article  89  of

the Constitution of Singapore provides that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government shall exercise its functions in

such  manner as to recognise the special position  of

the   Malays,  who  are  the  indigenous  people   of

Singapore,   and   accordingly  it   shall   be   the

responsibility   of   the  Government   to   protect,

safeguard,   support,  foster   and   promote   their

political,  educational, religious, economic,  social

and cultural interests and the Malay language.'



<br><br>I  would  like  to  explain to this  House  that  the

Government has already implemented the provisions  of

this  Article  since it assumed office in  1959.  For

instance,  the  Government has been  responsible  for

protecting,  safeguarding, supporting, fostering  and

promoting   the  economic,  religious,   social   and

cultural  interests  of  the  Malays  and  the  Malay

language.   Regarding   political   interests,    the

Government has not deprived the rights of the  Malays

who  are  the  indigenous people, as has happened  in

South  Africa and Rhodesia where the political rights

of  the majority, who are the indigenous people, have

been  deprived by the white minority. But in our coun

try,  although the non-Malays constitute a  majority,

the  rights of the Malays, the indigenous people, are

protected, safeguarded and fostered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relating to education, the Government has given all

facilities to Malay students - free education  up  to

University level. Similarly in religious matters, the

teaching of Islam has been made a subject in schools,

and  every registered religious school which requires

aid has been given such aid. These two privileges are

not  accorded to other religious schools.  The  Malay

language  has  been made the national language.  This

has been accepted by all sections of the population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the special position of the Malays, as

recommended by the Commission, is enough  to  protect

in all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>



aspects the Malays as the indigenous people. It is up

to  the  Malays themselves to make full use  of  this

opportunity  to  inculcate  in  them  the  spirit  of

competition with the other races in our Republic. The

Malays  need  have  no  fear because  the  Secretary-General  of  U.M.N.O. himself has signed the  Report,

and they must never allow the special position of the

Malays  to  be used as a means to get some privileges

or to threaten the Government in any way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Malays should realise that the

recommendation regarding the special position of  the

Malays is sufficient and can he an inducement to them

to  make progress if they are prepared to work  hard.

The  religion of Islam, which is the religion of  the

Malays, has the Koran as its bible. It says that  God

will not help those who do not help themselves. As an

example, I would like to cite here an article in page

3  of the Berita Harian of yesterday. It says that  a

sweeper  will  take his Cambridge School  Certificate

Examination. This is an example which the  Malays  as

the   indigenous  people  with  a  special   position

provided   for  them  in  the  Constitution,   should

emulate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 35 of the Report makes mention of a Malay

political organisation without naming it. However,  I

can  guess that the political party is no other  than

U.M.N.O, led by Ahmad Haji Taff as the Chairman, Syed

Esa  Almenoar as the Secretary-General, and  Syed  Au

Redha Alsagoff as Head of the Religious Section. This

political organisation has urged the Commission  that

a definition be given to the word "Malays" in Article

89  (2)  of the Constitution to be in line  with  the

definition contained in the Constitution of Malaysia.

I would like to quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"Malay" means a person who professes the Muslim

religion,   habitually  speaks  the  Malay  language,

conforms to Malay custom ...'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if this definition is accepted by the

Constitutional Commission as suggested  by  U.M.N.O.,

it means that all the other races can become



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>



Malays and will enjoy the special position. Yesterday

my  colleague,  the Minister of State for  Education,

stated that Mr Tan Siew Sin can become a Malay if he

embraces   Islam.  Likewise,  Mr  Speaker,   if   an

Englishman, who has lived many years in Singapore and

has  become  a  Singapore  citizen,  embraces  Islam,

speaks  Malay, and conforms to Malay custom, then  he

can  become  a  Malay,  and will  enjoy  the  special

position  of  the  Malays. So the  Malays  in  future

cannot  be regarded as the indigenous people if  this

article  is  embodied in the Singapore  Constitution.

Although the Commission has not accepted the U.M.N.O.

suggestion for the perpetuation of Article 89 (2)  of

the  Constitution without any alteration, I hope  the

Minister  for  Law  and  National  Development   will

seriously  consider  the  definition  of   the   word

"Malay",  because  if there is a definition  for  the

word "Malay", then there will be difficulties when it

comes  to  the implementation of the special position

of  the  Malays. So I wish to suggest to the Minister

to  have the definition of "Malay" embodied; that is,

the standard definition of the word "Malay".



For  example, "Malay" means a person who  comes  from

the   Malay  Archipelago,  including  the  Indonesian

islands,  professes the Muslim religion,  speaks  the

Malay  language as used in our country, and  conforms

to Malay custom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Article 11 of the Constitution of

Malaysia  which  deals with freedom of  religion  and

gives  every person the right to profess and practise

his religion, only one memorandum was received by the

Commission  requesting that the  exception  regarding

the  propagation of religion be left untouched.  This

exception  permits any State in Malaysia to  restrict

by  law  the  propagation of any  religious  doctrine

amongst persons professing the Muslim religion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, our country exercises freedom of

religion and gives every person the right to practise

his  religion.  This  practice  has  been  going   on

satisfactorily  and there has been  understanding  in

the  Inter-Religious Council in Singapore to maintain

religious    tolerance   without   any   legislation.

Therefore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Speaker,  it  is better that  such  a  state  of

affairs  be allowed to continue without the necessity

of   legislation.  If  the  suggestion  put  to   the

Commission  can be used as a guide when it  comes  to

considering the Constitution of Singapore, it will be

a  model  Constitution for other countries to follow,

because  we  can  show that we are practising  multi-racialism  and we are guided by the system  practised

in  Switzerland. However, many of them  profess  only

Christianity.  Various religions  are  tolerated  and

practised  in  Singapore. In Indonesia,  there  is  a

multiplicity of religions; some profess Islam, others

Hinduism, Christianity and Buddhism, but they are all

Indonesian citizens of one nation. So if our  country

can  practise the multi-racial concept in  peace  and

harmony,  it follows that it will be a model  to  the

world  and will show how unity among diverse  peoples

and   diverse  religions  is  maintained  among   our

population.



<br><br>3.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, firstly, allow me to thank the  members

of  the  Constitutional Commission, 1966,  for  their

services   to   the   State.  On   the   whole,   the

Constitutional  Commission's Report can  be  accepted

but,  in  my  opinion, there are some recommendations

which  are  superfluous.  Of  course,  there   is   a

fundamental   issue  before  the   members   of   the

Constitutional Commission. It is like this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If man cannot help his fellow beings to get the

fundamental  rights  of  men,  then  he   cannot   be

protected from oppression.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the Commission shows a spirit of

patriotism and a love of mankind. It shows  also  the

hatred of men towards men for perpetuating oppression

as   the   code   of   life.  Mr  Speaker,   without

consideration of race or creed, we cannot  allow  any

form  of oppression regarding the fundamental  rights

of   man  which  have  been  our  responsibility   to

safeguard.   We   are  prepared   to   shoulder   any

responsibility and face any difficulties to safeguard

and maintain the peace and harmony of our people. But

we cannot, at all times,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>



follow the footsteps of other countries. There  is  a

saying, Mr Speaker, "When in Rome, do as the  Romans

do."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Constitutional Report, 1966, it is mentioned

briefly  that  it is desirable - it can be  practised

having regard to the existing conditions and also  in

future  - to protect the common faith of our  people.

There  is  no  recommendation on  fundamental  rights

except where they are deemed necessary. I would  like

to  congratulate  the members of  the  Constitutional

Commission on this. My reason for saying so  is  that

we  must  adapt  ourselves and we must  envisage  our

future  progress. We cannot quote what  happened  200

years  ago  as  an example. Tarzan did not  wear  any

clothes;  but now we see that Tarzan puts on clothes!

We  must  forget the past and look to the future  for

good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Constitutional Commission's

Report  also  recommends a Council of  State.  In  my

opinion,  it can be established, but perhaps  because

of  the political questions involved, our people have

not reached that stage yet. If I am not mistaken,  in

today's  issue of the Berita Harian, the Municipality

in   Kuala  Lumpur  asked  for  assistance  from  the

Selangor State Council. The application was rejected.

If  the Council of State exists, it is possible  that

laws  may be passed here and submitted to the Council

of  State.  And  then  a  situation  may  arise;  or,

alternatively,  if Bills are first  referred  to  the

Council  of  State and later submitted to Parliament.

If we want to expedite matters, we must have only one

responsible  legislative body.  It  is  not  that  we

cannot afford to pay the allowances of the members of

the  Council of State. The basic issue rests  on  the

reasons as I have outlined earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker. In the proposed Council

of  State,  its  members are  nominated  by  us,  and

although  we  are  of  the  opinion  that  they   can

discharge their duties, the Opposition may  say  that

these people are merely our tools. We must also  take

this into consideration. Because of the low level  of

political  consciousness, we  have  not  reached  the

stage  where we can establish a Council of State.  It

happened in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1401</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  in 1958 when we had the City  Council  and

the  State  Government. The City  Council  asked  for

assistance  from  the Minister, but the  request  was

turned  down.  We  do not want a recurrence  of  this

nature. If there is, the people will be confused  and

will  not  be  able to comprehend the  true  facts  -

whether the Council or the State is right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 17 of the Report, the Commission

recommends  the creation of the office  of  Ombudsman

(or   Parliamentary   Commissioner).   Some   of   my

colleagues call it Ombudsman or Omboodsman, but there

is  no  Ombudswoman  which could apply  to  the  hon.

Members  for Moulmein and Delta! However, whether  it

is  Ombudsman, Omboodsman, or Ombudswoman, I say that

the   establishment  of  this  office  will   further

complicate  the  situation in  Singapore.  We  should

carry  on  with the present organisation  until  such

time as it is necessary to consider the pros and cons

of the creation of the office of Ombudsman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I have heard the hon. Member for Kampong

Kembangan  touching upon the definition of  the  word

"Malays". He was thankful to the Commission  for  not

accepting  the definition as given by a  neighbouring

country.  So I am doubtful as to his real  intention.

But  according  to  the definition  as  contained  in

paragraph 35 of the Report,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"Malay means a person who professes the Muslim

religion,  habitually speaks the Malay  language  and

conforms  to  Malay  custom", but  conceded  that  it

should be limited to citizens only.'



<br><br>If   this  definition  had  been  accepted   by   the

Commission, it would have given rise to a big debate.

But, like the Member for Kampong Kembangan, I wish to

thank  the  Commission for rejecting this suggestion.

In  my  opinion,  it is not easy to define  the  word

"Malays". For instance, take the case of an Arab  who

was  born in Indonesia. His mother is of Arab  origin

and  his  father, also of Arab origin,  was  born  in

Indonesia. In my opinion, he is an Indonesian of Arab

origin. Then this Arab migrated to Malaya and  became

a  Malay.  That really surprises me. Both his  father

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1402</b></font><br><br>



mother  are  Arabs,  and when he came  to  Malaya  he

became -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Inche Mohd. Ariff</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it on a point of order or

clarification?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff:</b> Point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is Inche Mahmud prepared to give way?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): No, I cannot, Mr

Speaker,  because I fear that he may quote  Thailand,

Korea and, therefore, I am not prepared to give  way.

So  a  Malay means a person who professes the  Muslim

religion and habitually speaks the Malay language.  I

am  an  Arab.  When  I  speak to my  father,  mother,

brothers - they are Arabs - I speak Arabic and  I  do

not  speak the Malay language. Take the case  of  the

hon.  Member  for  Kallang. He is  of  Boyan  origin.

Possibly at home he speaks Boyanese and not Malay. In

my  constituency there are many Boyanese, and if I am

invited  to  dinner  there  will  be  all  kinds   of

delicacies - Indonesian food. Likewise the  clothing

of the Malays and the Boyanese. The Boyanese wears  a

coat,  the chapal, and a cap, whereas the Malay wears

a  Malay  baju, baju kurong, a sarong, shoes,  and  a

cap.  I  fail  to  understand how the  definition  of

"Malays" came into being 10 years ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Kampong Kembangan is also of

Indonesian  origin.  If  the definition  of  "Malays"

includes  Malays  of  Indonesian  origin,  then   the

Indonesians  are  Malays, and that will  include  the

people  in  Thailand, the Philippines,  Korea,  Indo-China  and the Chinese too. But when it comes to  the

Chinese, it stops there. According to historians,  we

are  descendants  from Yunan. From  history,  we  can

trace  that  we are of one stock. For instance,  take

the Federation of Malaya, Sabah and Sarawak. There is

no longer the Malay Peninsula; it is now known as the

Federation  of Malaysia. As from 1963 the  nation  is

called Malaysia. This is all the creation of man.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1403</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we need not be too fanatic about racial

origins.  As mentioned in paragraph 14 of the  Report

of  the  Constitutional Commission, we must  consider

what  fundamental rights we should recommend and what

can  be practised. I think this is the most important

recommendation of the Commission. And my friends  say

that we can include Indonesians in the definition  of

"Malays".  This is very complicated indeed.  Perhaps

this  Malay  organisation considers that  the  Malays

should  be limited to citizens only. Let us take  the

citizens of Brunei and Sarawak. I am a Malay. If I am

not  a  citizen,  I  am  not a Malay.  This  will  be

confusing  and  misleading. I cannot understand  this

definition at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the whole, the Report of the

Constitutional Commission, 1966, as mentioned by  the

Minister for Law and National Development on the 21st

December, 1966, is indeed good and coincides with the

sentiments  of  the  Constitution  as  contained   in

paragraph  14  of  its Report. We  must  protect  the

interests  of the people in future and the Commission

cannot  accept some recommendations. As  I  said,  we

should not be made victims.



<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, in 1954 the P.A.P, had in one  of  its

policy  statements pledged the setting up of a multi-racial  democratic socialist country as  one  of  its

platforms.  Obviously we can see that  that  platform

will   be   most  appropriate  for  the  purpose   of

establishing an equal multi-racial society where  the

people can live harmoniously together and enjoy equal

rights  irrespective of racial and other differences.

And  we  have  all along for the past 13  years  been

working for this ideal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that in a society such as ours, if we insist

upon  one language, one race and one religion as  our

national basis, then it will surely lead to chaos and

perdition.  Therefore,  at  the  first  Parliamentary

sitting   after  our  independence,   in   order   to

perpetuate the institution of a multi-racial society,

we set up a Commission to study the provisions that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1404</b></font><br><br>



should  be  included in Singapore's  Constitution  to

safeguard  the  basic  rights and  interests  of  the

minorities  so as to ensure their equal  position  in

our independent Republic. And I thank the members  of

the  Commission for their work over the period of one

year. I must also thank members of the Commission for

having  made  the  recommendations  relating  to  the

various   provisions   to  be   entrenched   in   the

Constitution,   which  are  very  valuable   to   our

constitutional    history    and    our    democratic

institution.  From the Report we can  also  know  the

background and history of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission have studied the history, geography,

the  ethnic  composition and every  other  aspect  of

Singapore.  After lengthy discussions and study,  and

after  having taken into consideration the  interests

and  aspirations of the various races, the Commission

have  arrived at this Report which will  serve  as  a

guide to our future course of action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, most of the people here, including the

minority   races,  have  taken  Singapore  as   their

homeland,  and  they  share  common  sympathies   and

sentiments  in  relation to this country.  They  have

been living together in the same milieu, whether they

are  the minority or the majority, and they have been

working together and seeking the same objectives  and

enjoying  equal opportunities. They have  adopted  an

attitude in keeping with the new independent position

of  Singapore. In other words, at this stage  of  our

development,  we should have a new attitude  and  new

kind  of  concept. In order to achieve this, we  must

have  a  new  sense  of  national  consciousness  and

outlook. We must discard past history and look  ahead

and  build  a better future. We can jointly  help  to

build  our  country, and the people can  elect  their

representatives  to Parliament. These representatives

can  represent various interests - religious,  racial

and others. I see no reason why our country cannot do

that.  We  should  be proud of a common  nationality.

Although  we  cannot  be  proud  of  a  common   past

heritage, we can be proud of a common nationality and

a common destiny.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>



Representation in proportion of race is  a  poisonous

seed which we must not sow now. We must endeavour  to

seek further achievements. With concerted effort,  we

shall be able to realise our objectives in creating a

better future and a new society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the tenet of multi-racialism means mutual

tolerance,  co-operation and joint effort.  If  every

citizen, irrespective of his race, creed, descent  or

differences of culture, language or other things, can

work   jointly  with  other  citizens,  discard   any

suspicion about others, we shall all be able to enjoy

equal  opportunities and live harmoniously together..

It is better, safer and more meaningful this way than

to  stress  special privileges or a special  position

for any group in society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Report can be said to be based on the

principle of multi-racialism and equality of  rights.

It can ensure the establishment and development of  a

multi-racial  country where the rights and  interests

of  the  various races are safeguarded. It  will  not

only  enlighten people of other societies,  but  will

also  enable our people to understand that we have  a

common  destiny  and  in the end  we  shall  be  able

jointly to build up a harmonious multi-racial society

in  which every component will enjoy equal rights and

prosperity.  It  helps to remove any conflicts  which

may exist among people of different races.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the Commission have spent much

energy  and  have undertaken much research  in  their

work.  They  have spent one year on the  problem  and

have now finalised their conclusions as presented  in

the  Report  which  can serve as  a  model  to  other

people.   Most  of  the  recommendations  have   been

accepted by the Government. The comprehensiveness and

the  depth of this Report can be appreciated by  all.

The  Government, in accepting certain recommendations

of  the  Report, have, by doing so, laid a foundation

to  wards a better future. This goes to show that the

P.A.P.  Government  is  planning  not  only  for  the

immediate 10 years, but also for the next and  future

generations. We can say that we now plant so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1406</b></font><br><br>



that  our  future generations may reap the fruits  of

our labours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I express my support for the motion by the

Minister  for  Law. But I would like  to  raise  some

points  relating to certain details. About the system

of  Ombudsman, the Government has refused  to  accept

the recommendation on it. I can say that Government's

action is judicious. Other than the opinion aired  by

the  Prime  Minister  that  the  setting  up  of  the

Ombudsman   may   delay  Government's  administrative

machinery,  in  addition  to other  disadvantages,  I

agree  with  the views expressed by the Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the  Minister  for  Culture  that  the

Ombudsman  will be having a kind of function  similar

to  that  exercised by the Central Complaints Bureau.

If any citizen has any complaints to make against the

administration,  he  can  complain  to  the   Central

Complaints Bureau to get redress. I must add that the

P.A.P. Members of Parliament come from the people and

they  meet  and  mingle with the people.  Because  of

this, they understand very well the conditions of the

people. If there is anything amiss or if there is any

complaint,  they  can serve as a bridge  between  the

Government and the people by raising the matter  with

the  Ministry concerned to be dealt with. At the same

time,  the P.A.P. Members of Parliament go to various

parts  of  the  Republic to see  for  themselves  the

actual conditions existing among the people there. If

there  is  any complaint or anything to  he  improved

upon,  the P.A.P. Members will no doubt take care  of

that.  Members  of Parliament have been  assigned  to

various  Government departments to serve  as  liaison

officers between the Government and the people. So if

there    is    any   malpractice   or   any    faulty

administration, Members of Parliament can,  in  their

capacity  as  liaison officers,  negotiate  with  the

Ministry concerned and put it right. Therefore, I  do

not  agree  that it is necessary now  to  set  up  an

Ombudsman  system  here. The  recommendation  by  the

Commission  is  that  the Ombudsman  should  be  well

qualified,  is a distinguished personage, and  should

be  remunerated adequately for this specialised  job.

But I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1407</b></font><br><br>



agree  with this view, because if we do, it  will  be

tantamount  to paying undue respect to a  person  who

has  the  wealth to get himself educated  to  achieve

such  a  position. So I should say that this  is  an

outdated idea. If any man is capable of doing such  a

job, he should be glad to contribute his services  to

the   country  and  not  just  look  after  his   own

interests. If he is so capable, then, as a citizen of

the country, he should contribute his bit and not  be

mercenary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has advanced the reason that

because  the  Council of State  may  serve  the  same

purpose as a Select Committee of Parliament, there is

no  need for such a Council. I disagree with that. As

the Prime Minister has said, the Council of State can

save  the  President of making any decision which  is

unpleasant. I would like to add that the  Council  of

State  is merely an advisory body. It should  not  be

something like an Upper House with all the rights and

powers  of  an Upper House. About the composition  of

the  Council  of  State, I feel that  the  number  of

members on it is rather unwieldy, and I think  it  is

also  not necessary to categorise them into different

types.  The term of removable members should  not  be

three  years  or nine years. It should be  the  same;

five  years  should  be  better.  If  they  are  non-political  appointments or if they do not  belong  to

any   political  party,  then  when  they   come   to

deliberate upon any matter in private, they will  not

be doing so with a view to publicity or for political

gain  and  they  can  deliberate  more  frankly   and

constructively and arrive at conclusions more easily.

At the same time, the impression that this Council of

State would be serving the same purpose as that of  a

Select  Committee  may be erased. The  recommendation

for  the  Council of State seems to have arisen  from

the  fact  that  there is no effective Opposition  in

this  House.  Although at present  Select  Committees

consist  of  all P.A.P, members because there  is  no

Opposition,  it  does not mean that  in  future  when

there  is  an Opposition Select Committees  will  not

consist  of the majority of members of the  Party  in

power. So if you want to use this argument



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>



alone  to  justify  the  establishment  of  the

Council  of State, it cannot hold any water,  for  it

will give the same impression to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as regards the recommendation relating to

the  Public  Service Commission, the  Government  has

agreed  that  all  members  of  the  P.S.C, must  be

distinguished  members  of  the  public   with   high

administrative  ability and wide experience  who  can

command the respect and enjoy the confidence  of  all

sections  of  the  society. The Government  has  also

accepted  the principle that the P.S.C, must  be  an

absolutely  independent body, in  this  respect,  the

Government  has agreed to increase the membership  of

the  P.S.C, in order to facilitate its  business.  I

agree that this is a matter of urgency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, ever since we attained independence

there  has  been  a rapid expansion  in  the  various

Government  departments and  the  staff  required  in

these departments are increasing from day to day.  So

the  existing number of seven members on  the  Public

Service  Commission  have their responsibilities  and

duties  increased manifold, and I am afraid they  may

not  be  able  to cope with the increased  volume  of

work.   This  may  cause  some  delay  in  processing

applications   and  the  appointments  of   officers,

thereby giving dissatisfaction all round. In my view,

therefore,  the immediate increase of the  membership

of  the  P.S.C, will be a very good solution  to  the

present problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, many views in the Report of the

Constitutional    Commission   are    valuable    and

acceptable. I support the Government's endorsement of

such views expressed in the Report.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hup Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hup Teck (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  for  the past few  days  many  P.A.P.

Members of Parliament have been discussing the Report

of  the  Constitutional  Commission  in  this  House.

Outside  the  House, the electorate  is  also  paying

great  attention  to  see whether  their  Members  of

Parliament are giving any constructive criticisms  to

or constructive views on the Report. They want to see

whether the views of the Commission have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>



carefully studied by Parliament. They are paying full

attention to what we are saying in this House.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Tang See Chim in the Chair]</b></div>

<br><br>3.52 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I comment on any of the items in the Report,

let  me,  first  of  all, express my  thanks  to  the

members of the Commission for their effort and  their

good  work.  Sir, since 8th January, 1966,  when  the

Commission   was  appointed  by  the   President   of

Singapore,  every member of the Commission  has  been

contributing  his  bit  and doing  his  duty  hearing

representations from various quarters and considering

how  safeguards  can be provided in the  Constitution

for  the  interests and the rights of the minorities.

They have produced the Report which is now before  us

for  discussion.  In the course of  their  work,  the

Commission  have also put forward reasoned  arguments

for   their  recommendations.  They  have  also  made

criticisms on certain representations and have  given

their views on what they have accepted and what  they

have rejected. They have made a very careful analysis

of  the representations submitted to them. They  have

studied  the pros and cons of the whole matter.  They

have  done their duty well, and their efforts in  the

service  of the country are laudable and deserve  our

admiration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one thing that is regrettable is that certain

people  and certain organisations have given opinions

which are contrary to the multi-racial principles and

recommendations in the Report. They have put  forward

representations  on  how  to safeguard  the  minority

rights in religion, language and other matters. Their

suggestions  are  inimical to  all.  These  can  only

benefit  themselves and will do no  good  to  others.

Today,  what I want to touch upon is Chapter  III  of

the  Report, which is about the Council of State, and

give my views and criticisms thereon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Report, the Commission have found

that  there  is  only P.A.P. representation  in  this

House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>



There  is  no political Party which can take  up  the

duty of an effective Opposition here. Therefore,  the

Commission,  for  the sake of public  interest,  have

recommended the setting up of a Council of  State  in

order  that  it may exercise the function  of  making

constructive  suggestions to Parliament  or  offering

criticisms   or  amendments  to  legislation   before

Parliament.  In so doing, any Bill which affects  the

interests   of  the  minorities  will  be  thoroughly

studied before it can be passed. It is suggested that

in  such a situation, when there is no Opposition  in

the House, that the Council of State may serve a good

purpose  by preventing the passage of any legislation

discriminating  against the minorities.  But  I  have

something to say about this Council of State  if  the

sole reason for its establishment is for that purpose

alone.  There are both merits and demerits in  it.  I

can  say that although we have 49 out of 51 seats  in

this   House,   the  P.A.P. has  its  platform   and

principles, and we will never act in any way contrary

to  the  interests and rights of the  minorities  and

will  not  do anything that will harm the  religious,

cultural  or  racial interests of anybody.  Today  we

have  come to a situation where there is only  P.A.P.

representation  in Parliament and no Opposition.  The

blame for this should not be put on the P.A.P. but on

the Opposition Parties instead. It is also the choice

of  the electorate. It is because today the P.A.P. is

working  in  the  interest of the people.  Its  every

action  is based on the interest of the people.  That

is  why we have so many seats in, this House, and the

absence  of the' Opposition in this House is  because

the Opposition has not done its duty as an Opposition

in  this House. It is also because their platform and

principles are contrary to the interest of the people

and  they have actually done harm to the people. That

is  why  they have been discarded by the  people  and

today they cannot have any footing in the House. Just

look  at  the Legislative Assembly of 1955  when  the

P.A.P. had only three representatives in it. Today we

have 49 P.A.P. Members in this House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>



How  did we achieve this? Obviously it is because the

P.A.P. has been able to represent the interest of the

people and it has the support of the people.



That is why we have achieved the present position. In

the  general  elections in 1963 the Barisan  Sosialis

had  13 seats in this House. They could have made use

of  that  opportunity to express the  wishes  of  the

people  in  this  House. Yet  they  did  not  do  so.

Instead,  they  withdrew  from  Parliament,  ignoring

their  constituents. From this, we  can  see  clearly

that they are not concerned with the interests of the

people  of  Singapore.  Their object  of  loyalty  is

elsewhere  - China.  Because  of  this,  they   cannot

receive the support of the people. Therefore, if they

dare  to  compete  with the P.A.P, in  the  political

arena  they  will  definitely meet  with  defeat  and

disaster. Because of these various reasons, they  are

no  longer able to represent the people today.  As  a

result, they have no representation in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, if the setting up of the Council of

State is merely because of this situation, that there

is  an  absence of the Opposition in the House,  then

the reason is wrong. If the setting up of the Council

of  State is to safeguard the rights and interests of

the  minorities, then it may serve a useful  purpose,

as  we  cannot guarantee that in the next I U  or  20

years  the P.A.P, will definitely retain the majority

in  this  House. By that time the leadership  of  the

P.A.P, will  be  getting  old,  and  if  no  capable

leadership has emerged then, there may be some crisis

in  this  House, namely, there may come  a  day  when

there is no political Party which can truly represent

the  interests  of  all the people.  Other  political

Parties  in  authority may then discriminate  against

the   minorities,  whether  on  religious,  cultural,

linguistic  or  racial grounds. For  this  reason,  I

support  the principle underlying the setting  up  of

this  Council  of  State.  But  the  reason  for  the

recommendation of this Council of State has been ---

Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hup Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hup Teck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank the

Member for Changi for reminding me that there are two

seats  reserved for two absent Barisan Members.  Just

now I have said that the Barisan Sosialis do not care

for the people. That is why the two Members have also

disappeared.  But I would not like  to  elaborate  on

this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission's reason for setting up the Council

of State is that the P.A.P. is the sole Party in this

House.  We can be proud of one fact, i.e., the P.A.P.

is  able to inculcate in the people a new concept and

a  new  type of education for a multi-racial  society

acceptable  to  all the people. And  the  P.A.P. has

continuously received their support because it has no

communalistic concept or bias. It has  been  able  to

educate  the people and make them aware that,  though

we  are  people of different races, yet we all belong

to  the same country. We enjoy equal rights and share

a common destiny. We have been able to look after the

interest of the various races and have respected  the

languages of the various races. For instance, in this

House we have representatives from the Chinese, Malay

and  Indian  communities. We can freely  address  the

House  in  Malay.  Chinese, Indian or  English.  This

shows that we are treating all the races equally.  We

are  also  giving  equal treatment in  all  the  four

streams  of  education, so that they can all  develop

equally. We have been able to inculcate in the people

a  sense of multi-racialism and a new concept  for  a

multi-racial society. From this we can see  that  the

P.A.P. is  one  political Party that represents  the

people  and  whatever candidate of whatever  race  we

have  put up in any election has always been  elected

to   the  House.  The  Opposition  have  always  been

defeated in any elections. It is because they are not

supported  by  the people and some of the  Opposition

Parties



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>



operate on a communalistic basis. Even in non-Chinese

constituencies,  a P.A.P. Chinese  candidate  may  be

returned; whereas a communal Party will fail with its

communal candidate in his own racial community.  This

clearly  shows  that multi-racialism is  the  correct

proposition   acceptable  to  all   the   people   in

Singapore.   In  the  Report,  it  seems   that   the

recommendation for the setting up of the  Council  of

State  is because the P.A.P. may become a dictatorial

Party  in this House. I do not agree that because  of

that   situation  there  can  be  any  discrimination

against  any  minority. In principle  I  support  the

motion before the House.



<br><br>4.09 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Sir, I will

endeavour   to   be   brief.  The   Report   of   the

Constitutional  Commission, 1966, now  tabled  before

this  House  for  debate, is  yet  another  important

parliamentary document that has passed  through  this

Parliament  since  December  1965  when   the   House

approved  two Bills of similar importance, i.e.,  the

Constitution  (Amendment) Bill and  the  Republic  of

Singapore Independence Bill. This House must  express

its   sincere   gratitude   to   the   Constitutional

Commission   and   its  eminent   members   for   its

distinguished work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many views were expressed by hon. Members in this

House  yesterday  and  the  day  before,  and  whilst

associating myself with some of their views, may I be

allowed. Sir, to touch a little on the setting up  of

the   Council   of  State  as  recommended   by   the

Constitutional      Commission      among       other

recommendations?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Government has, in principle, agreed

to  the  recommendation of creating this  non-elected

advisory  body,  but  differed  in  opinion  in   its

composition and function. The Council of State  would

consist  of  two types of membership - the  permanent

members  and  the  members  who  are  removable.  The

permanent members would consist of men of distinction

who either hold or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>



have  held  high offices, such as Cabinet  Ministers,

former  Chief  Ministers,  the  Chief  Justice,   the

Speaker  and  so on. Needless to say, the  choice  of

these  men  as permanent members for the  Council  of

State  is  certainly the most ideal one, as they  are

either concerned with policy making or are conversant

with  Government  policies. As for  members  who  are

removable, it has been suggested that persons who are

mature   citizens  and  have  rendered  distinguished

public   service  or  attained  eminence   in   their

respective walks of life, are to he appointed on  the

advice of the Cabinet for a term of 3 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, Sir, you are aware of the existence, in

every  constituency in our Republic, of  an  advisory

committee  to assist Members of Parliament  known  as

the  Citizens' Consultative Committee.  Some  of  the

community  leaders  are men of some  distinction  and

ability.  They  constantly keep in close  association

with  the masses and I wonder if the Government would

consider  appointing some of them to the  Council  of

State, for they are the persons who can really make a

contribution by reflecting the views of the masses in

our Republic to the Government through the Council of

State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, since the composition of the Council

of  State will be men of high status who will also be

accorded  the  same  immunities  and  privileges   as

enjoyed by Members of Parliament as suggested by  the

Commission in paragraph 52 of the Report,  I  suggest

that,  if  they  are  to be paid any  allowances,  an

honorarium  of  only a nominal sum be paid  to  them.

This  will  save  the  Government considerable  extra

expenditure.  Sir,  our Republic,  with  its  limited

resources of incomes, cannot afford the luxury  of  a

two-House  system. In fact, the Commission has  taken

into  consideration the financial  implications  once

the Council of State is created.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the term of office, the Commission has

in  its Report originally suggested that in the first

Council,  one-third of the members shall hold  office

for  three years, another one-third for six years and

the  remaining one-third for nine years. But  in  the

Ministerial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>



statement  by  the  Minister  for  Law  and  National

Development  made  in this House  on  21st  December,

1966, two types of membership were suggested in place

of the recommendation by the Commission, of which one

is permanent.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>4.13 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this mean that the Government is not even

prepared to review the position in future in case  an

Opposition is returned to this House? In this case, I

would  like  to endorse the views of the hon.  Member

for   Bukit   Merah   yesterday,   i.e.,   that   the

recommendation  of setting up the  Council  of  State

should not be embodied in the Constitution yet  until

it  has  been put to a test for five years so  as  to

prove  its practicability. This is a good suggestion,

and  I  further  wish to supplement it by  suggesting

that it would be wiser to commence the term of office

from the year 1968 when new Members of Parliament are

returned  for the next Session. In other  words,  the

Council  of State will have to withstand a  test  for

five years before such recommendation is written into

the Constitution of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is absolutely no sign of fear expressed

by the general public that the P.A.P. will turn to be

dictatorial simply because there is no Opposition  in

Parliament.  Since  the P.A.P. obtained  its  second

mandate  from the electorate in 1963, the  people  of

Singapore,  not counting those who are  anti-national

elements,   have  never  dissented  from  any   major

Government  policies. There has been no controversial

issue of any sort that irritates the masses or causes

them to stage an uproar against the Government. There

is no better illustration of the full confidence that

the  people  of Singapore have in our Government  and

the  P.A.P. than  that  shown  by  the  overwhelming

support  in  the  by-election  in  Thomson,  an  area

hitherto considered to be a stronghold of the Barisan

Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the lack of Opposition in this

Parliament,  which is not our fault,  does  not  mean

that this House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>



has not been functioning well. In fact, it has put us

more  on the alert and made us more conscious of  the

grave   responsibilities  and  duties  we   have   to

discharge to the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the recommendation of the office of Ombudsman, a

lot has been said by hon. Members during the past two

days.  I do not wish to repeat except to say that  it

is  not  advisable to implement it at this  juncture.

There   are  ample  facilities  under  the   existing

machinery   whereby  grievances  or   complaints   of

maladministration can be redressed. Our Ministers are

being    assisted   by   Parliamentary   Secretaries,

Political  Secretaries,  and  Permanent  Secretaries.

Members  of  Parliament  are  also  attached  to  the

Ministries to assist the Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as you very well know, our

Ministers and M.P.s are accessible to the public, and

any  grievances by the public against any  department

concerned  can  be easily lodged with the  respective

Ministers.  And  if the public so wishes,  complaints

can  also be brought to the Central Complaints Bureau

or the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude by touching on the

acquisition of land for public development.  You  are

aware  that land in Singapore is a scarcity now,  and

will  be  more so in future. In fact, we are  getting

more  land  by  reclamation to cope  with  the  ever-increasing rate of development. When the city  is  to

be  rebuilt under the Urban Renewal Scheme, more land

will have to be acquired from private landowners  for

public development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sir Stamford Raffles first landed in Singapore

in  1819, he saw a need to develop the island.  As  a

result,  jungle  land  was  offered  to  whoever  was

prepared to open it up and cultivate it and  make  it

inhabitable by way of grants for freehold  leases  of

999  years during subsequent years. Ownership of this

land  was  handed  down from our forefathers  to  our

contemporaries. Sir, you will agree that if we are to

progress  we must develop by acquiring land  for  the

benefit of our future generation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see why there is so much concern about

compulsory  acquisition  of  private  properties  for

public  purpose  or  for purposes beneficial  to  the

public. Compensation, reasonable and just, of course,

will have to be paid for such acquisition. Sir, I  am

sure  not all of us here in this House possess landed

property.  Even  if  they do, it  is  for  their  own

occupation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believe me, Sir, many of our contemporaries are

enjoying  the  good things of life on  the  gains  or

income  from  the sources of private properties  that

they  have  inherited from their forefathers,  whilst

many  others  have to toil hard and sweat  for  their

daily  bread.  This surely is not  a  fair  state  of

things in our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Government's policy

concerning land acquisition, and I fully support  the

motion  standing in the name of the Minister for  Law

and National Development.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As there are no other Members wishing

to  speak, I will call upon the Minister for Law. Mr

Barker,  before you commence, there has been quite  a

long  debate and many points have been made.  If  you

anticipate the possibility of your speaking for  more

than an hour, perhaps I can obtain the consent of the

House now rather than interrupt you in the middle  of

your speech. Would you prefer that to be done?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> I shall be grateful if you will do so

now, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Do I have the general assent of

Members  to permit the Minister for Law to speak  for

longer  than  the Standing Orders allow,  should  the

necessity arise?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Aye.



<br><br>4.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this debate on the

Report  of the Constitutional Commission on  Minority

Rights



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1418</b></font><br><br>



is  one  of the most important, and perhaps the  most

important, of the many debates that have taken  place

in  Parliament. I am grateful to all Members who have

spoken and given their views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate itself touches upon the protection of

minority  rights in our cosmopolitan  city  and  will

always be remembered in the annals of the history  of

Singapore.  It  is in this House that the  debate  is

taking place, and I feel that it would be appropriate

and  instructive for us to look around  this  Chamber

and  see  who and what are within the four  walls  of

this  House. I cast my eye first on you, Mr Speaker.

You  come from a member of the minority race. I  then

look at your Clerks; one is from a minority race  and

the other is a representative of the majority race. I

look around the House and I see mostly Chinese. I see

a   few   Indians,  a  few  Malays,  and  even  fewer

Eurasians. As for the Members they all belong to  one

Party,  though  some  sit on the Opposition  Benches.

They  only do so because the previous occupiers chose

to    shirk   their   duties   and   abandon    their

constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, many religions are

represented   here.  We  have  Muslims,   Christians,

Hindus, Buddhists, some free thinkers, of course, and

others. If one looks up at the Gallery, one will find

also   a   multi-racial   crowd.   This   is   fairly

representative of the city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sound system in this House and every

seat  is  supplied  with  an  earphone  so  that  the

occupier  can listen to the speeches in  one  of  the

four official languages that are spoken here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a unique situation, but

we  have had it for some time now and we are inclined

to  take  things  for granted. Two  questions  arise.

First,  how did all this come about? Second, how  can

we  preserve this forever? To answer these questions,

one  has to go back to the history of Singapore.  Sir

Stamford Raffles, as we all know, came here  in  1819

and  founded  Singapore. He  called  it,  or  it  was

called, Singapura or the Lion City, though



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>



there  were  no lions here. And even the tigers  have

disappeared across the Causeway! But at that time, as

the   Commissioners  pointed  out,  this  island  was

covered "with thick jungle and mangrove swamp with  a

few  inhabitants  living near the  river  mouths'.  I

believe  my colleague, the Minister for Culture,  can

trace his history to one of the few who were then  in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> He was a pirate!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Raffles Lighthouse was erected 35 years

later,  and on the plaque commemorating the  occasion

were  inscribed Latin words describing  Singapore  as

"Opportunissimo sito" - an opportune site or  a  well

selected  site. And below the Latin words appears  an

inscription in English, and I would like to  read  it

to the House, Sir. It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Raffles Lighthouse, erected in the Year of our

Lord  1854  by the Honourable East India Company  and

dedicated to the memory of Sir Stamford Raffles,  the

founder   of   Singapore,  to   whose   liberal   and

comprehensive policy this Settlement is indebted  for

its  free  port  and the unrivalled position  it  now

holds  as  an  emporium  in the  Indian  Seas-Colonel

Butterworth, Governor of the Prince of Wales  Island,

Singapore and Malacca.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, whoever wrote those words saw  far

into  the  future, and as the Commission  reports,  I

quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We find today a small island nation situated

geographically at the Southern-most end of the  Malay

Peninsula,  strategically located as  a  vital  trade

link  between China, Japan and America to  the  East,

India,  Africa and Europe to the West, and Australia,

New Zealand and Indonesia to the South.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also find a nation comprising people of many

races,  speaking  many languages and practising  many

religions.'



<br><br>This  leads  me, Mr Speaker, to my second  question:

how can we preserve all this? It was with this object

in  mind  that the Commission on Minority Rights  was

appointed. They have given us their Report, which has

been  debated for nearly two days. It is  significant

that  I,  as a member of one of the smallest minority

racial  groups  in  Singapore, have  been  given  the

privilege to wind up this debate. This privilege has,

of course, been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1420</b></font><br><br>



courteously extended to me by my colleagues, most  of

whom belong to the majority race in Singapore. And to

them I would like to express my deep gratification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I shall now turn to the Report itself

and  also  deal, as far as I can in the limited  time

available, with some of the arguments that have  been

put forth in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report is a unanimous one, though it was a non-Party Commission, and almost every minority group in

Singapore was represented thereon, whether  by  race,

religion,   or  language.  Members  of  this   House,

however,  certainly do not appear to  have  unanimous

views.  Even  on  the  major representations  of  the

Commission  some  are  for the  Ombudsman,  like  the

Member  for  Choa  Chu Kang, who has  very  ably  put

forward, I must say, arguments for commencing such an

institution  in  Singapore. The  Member  for  Punggol

wants  more  than one Ombudsman. He  feels  that  two

heads are better than one and he says three are  even

better still. But perhaps he has forgotten that there

are  49 Ombudsmen in this House. There are others who

feel,  of course, like the Government does, that  the

time has not yet come for us to have an Ombudsman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Council of State, some are in favour and

they  share  the Government's views on the  Council's

composition and function. Others say, "Throw it out."

And  at one stage, Mr Speaker, certain Members  even

threatened  to move an amendment to my motion  before

the  House. They agree that we should have a  Council

of  State, but they are afraid that it will, with the

passage  of  time, develop and become a second  Upper

House.  At the outset, I would like to assure Members

that  as  long  as we are the Party  in  power,  this

Council of State will not become a second Upper House

- a Senate if you like. I myself would prefer to call

it  the  President's Council and not the  Council  of

State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for entrenchment, I am glad that most Members

are  in  favour of the first two methods and  against

the third.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards land acquisition, it is satisfying to

note that there are hardly any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>



Members  against  Government  acquisition  of  public

property   as   provided  for  in  our  recent   Land

Acquisition Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I propose to deal separately and

in   more   detail  with  some  of  the  four   major

recommendations. But before I do so,  I  would  first

like  to  dispose  of some minor  ones.  As  for  the

judges,  the  Prime Minister has set out Government's

views  that  we  are  against a  small  body  of  men

perpetuating  themselves forever. I do  not  think  I

need  say  much  more.  As  for  our  Public  Service

Commission,  I  stated  in  December  last  that  the

Government  agrees that the Chairman and  members  of

the  Commission should be persons who can demand  the

respect  and enjoy the confidence of all sections  of

the  population  and should not  be  members  of  any

political Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one minor recommendation which I must deal

with,  and  that  is with regard to  the  secrecy  of

voting.  The  Commission  recommended  at  page   12,

paragraph  43,  that  ballot  papers  should  not  be

numbered.  There  is  a provision  in  the  Elections

Ordinance  which  says that each ballot  paper  shall

have  a  number printed on the back, and  shall  have

attached  a counterfoil with the same number  printed

on  the  face.  The  Commission feels  that  this  is

inconsistent with the right of secrecy of  the  vote.

There  must be some good reasons for having  numbers,

and  this provision has survived many a protest.  The

reason  is obvious. If ballot papers have no numbers,

there  is a possibility of fraud. Who is to know  how

many   ballot  papers  have  been  issued?  If   this

provision is scrapped, more vigorous protests will he

made  to  the effect that the Government  rigged  the

elections.  At  present  it  is  possible   for   the

Government to find out who voted for whom.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> We never do that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> But I can assure you, as Mr Ho See

Beng has said, we do not do that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Bras Basah. You are

referring to the Member for Bras Basah.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> But, Sir, it is even more possible for

Government  to  distribute to their  supporters  more

unnumbered  ballot papers than their  supporters  are

entitled  to.  However honest this Government  is,  I

would  say  that  protests against unnumbered  ballot

papers  would  be more vociferous than those  against

numbered papers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is clear that the Government's

stand  on  the  recommendations of the Constitutional

Commission,  which  have not been accepted  in  toto,

needs amplification. I propose to deal with these one

by one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to fundamental rights, the only

recommendation  which  is not accepted  in  the  form

recommended  is  the  one  with  regard  to  property

rights.  But  before I deal with property  rights,  I

would  like to touch on one recommendation which  has

been  accepted  and which appears to have  upset  the

Member  for  Kampong  Kembangan. The  Commission  has

recommended  that we should not define "Malays",  and

for  good  reasons. The Member for Kampong  Kembangan

feels  that  it  would be better  for  us  to  define

"Malays", and he has suggested a definition. I do not

propose  to criticise his definition. But in whatever

way  we  define a Malay, some people must object.  If

you  restrict  the  class merely to  Malays  born  in

Singapore,  those born outside will  object.  If  you

take people born in the Malay Archipelago, how far do

we go? Do we stop before we come to West Irian, or do

we  go further to Australian New Guinea? If we define

a  Malay,  the next step would be, perhaps, that  the

Chinese  would  like  to  be defined,  and  then  the

Indians are not going to keep quiet. Then where do we

stop? But I am glad that the Member for Kampong Kapor

would like to leave things as they are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now go on to the question of

land  acquisition which, in my view, was outside  the

terms of reference of the Commission. But since  they

feel so strongly about the protection



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>



of  the  individual, as far as his property  goes,  I

intend to deal with their recommendations and set out

Government's views which have been stated in the past

but which I think are worth repeating.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at page 11, paragraphs 41 and 42,

the    Commission   made   certain   recommendations.

Paragraph 41 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The next fundamental right that needs to be

considered  by us is the right to property.  This  is

accorded  by  Article  13  of  the  Constitution   of

Malaysia but, as we have said in paragraph 14 of this

Report,  it  has  not been retained as  part  of  our

constitutional law after separation from Malaysia. In

the  light  of  the  fact that  the  Legislature  has

decided   that   this  particular  Article   of   the

Constitution  of Malaysia should not be so  retained,

we   have   given  the  most  serious  and   detailed

consideration, having regard always to our  Terms  of

Reference,  to  the  subject of a person's  right  to

property.  We find that all the written Constitutions

we   have  looked  at  specifically  provide,  as   a

fundamental  human right, the right of  every  person

not to be deprived of his property save in accordance

with  law and the right to compensation whenever  his

property is compulsorily acquired. We find also  that

one   of  the  human  rights  proclaimed  under   the

Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the  General

Assembly  of  the  United Nations on  10th  December,

1948,  is  the  right  of an  individual  not  to  be

arbitrarily deprived of his property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42. We are convinced that it is necessary, sound

and  wise and in the best interests of the people  of

Singapore,  with the multiracial composition  of  its

population,  that  its Constitution should  recognise

and  proclaim  this  fundamental  right.  We  do  not

propose, however, to recommend the reintroduction  of

Article  13  of the Constitution of Malaysia  in  its

present  form.  We  recognise the fact  that  as  the

population  increases over the years  more  and  more

land  will  be  required for public purposes  if  the

needs  of  the  general public are to  be  adequately

served. We recognise also that, Singapore being  only

a  small  island  of 225 square miles,  as  Singapore

becomes  more and more developed and more and  better

public  amenities are provided out of  public  funds,

land   will,   largely  by  reason  of  such   public

expenditure,  increasingly become  a  more  and  more

valuable   commodity  in  the  future.  We  therefore

consider  it  is  imperative that  a  just  and  fair

balance must be struck between the public interest on

the  one hand and private ownership on the other, and

we think that this result will best be achieved if we

recommend  as  we  now do that  there  should  be  an

Article in the Constitution providing as follows -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"l4.-(1) No person shall be deprived of property

save in accordance with law.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) No law shall provide for the compulsory

acquisition  or use of property except for  a  public

purpose  or  a  purpose useful or beneficial  to  the

public and except upon just terms."'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, I have with me the Federal Constitution

of Malaysia. Article 13 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) No person shall be deprived of property save

in accordance with law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) No law shall provide for the compulsory

acquisition  or  use  of  property  without  adequate

compensation.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst we were in Malaysia, we desired to

delete  Article 13 as far as Singapore was concerned.

We were not thinking of acquiring land without paying

compensation. We wanted to acquire land for a  public

purpose   with  compensation,  but  not   necessarily

adequate.  Having  scrapped  Article  13  after   the

separation,  as  pointed out by the  Commission,  the

Commission  now  wants us to put in  another  clause.

Instead of the words "adequate compensation", we have

the  words "upon just terms". Mr Speaker, Sir, there

might  be  a difference between these words,  but  if

there is one, the difference is very small. And if we

were  to  accept  the  Commission's  recommendations,

there would be a flood of litigation in Singapore and

our  Courts  would have to construe  the  meaning  of

"upon  just  terms". Acceptance of the Constitutional

Commission's   recommendation   would    mean    that

Government would have to pay the full market value in

all cases of acquisition of land for public purposes.

This  would make land acquisition, which is necessary

to  implement  the Government's economic  and  social

programmes, exorbitant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's policy on land acquisition was

enunciated  by  the  Prime  Minister  in   the   then

Legislative  Assembly on 16th December,  1963,  [col.

653]  when he stated, and I think I must repeat  what

he then stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The first principle is that nobody should get a

windfall because of development at public expense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second principle is that whenever land is

required for a public purpose, the price to  be  paid

for that land should not be higher than what it would

have  been  worth had the Government not contemplated

development generally in that area.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Hansard, 10th June, 1964, col. 25] `Land is a

fixed  commodity, and with mounting pressure on  land

as  a result of population expansion and development,

land  values tend inevitably to rise. But for  public

purposes of acquisition, we attempt in this  Bill  to

exclude   the  landowner  from  windfall   gains   in

increases  of  land  values as a  result,  first,  of

either  public  expenditure already incurred  in  the

area,  or speculative increases in the price of  land

in an area which has been earmarked for development.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these principles have been

embodied  in the new Land Acquisition Act  passed  by

Parliament  last  year.  A  constitutional  provision

requiring  the payment of just terms would mean  that

our  intentions in the Land Acquisition Act would  be

stifled   by   landowners   being   able   to   raise

constitutional issues when disputes over the  quantum

of  compensation arise. The Government's intention is

to  follow  the provisions in the Indian Constitution

which state, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No person shall be deprived of his property save

by the authority of law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No property shall be compulsorily acquired or

requisitioned save for a public purpose and  save  by

authority  of the law which provides for compensation

for  the  property so acquired or requisitioned,  and

either  fixes the amount of compensation or specifies

the  principles on which and the manner in which  the

compensation  is to be determined and given,  and  no

such law shall be called in question in any court  on

the ground that the compensation provided by that law

is not adequate.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the provision of the Constitution

of  India  was  as  a  result of an  amendment  found

necessary  after considerable experience showed  that

an   unqualified  constitutional  guarantee  of   the

sanctity  of property led to interminable  litigation

on the adequacy of compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps to support my arguments, I can just cite

one  example. Take the case of Jurong. Five,  six  or

seven  years ago - I do not know exactly when - Jurong

was  just one big swamp. The price of land there  was

in  the region of 10 to 20 cents per square foot. The

Government  went in and reclaimed part of the  swamp.

We  built  roads.  We  supplied  water.  We  supplied

electricity.  Now there is a little  town  in  Jurong

with many industries around. The price of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1426</b></font><br><br>



land  in the surrounding areas outside the industrial

complex  has  risen  as a result  of  the  money  the

Government  has put into Jurong. Let us  assume  that

industries in Jurong expand and we require more land.

This means acquisition for a public purpose. If we go

in  today and acquire land, must we pay $1, $1.50  or

$2  for  a square foot of land which previously  only

cost 10 cents and which has risen to $1 or $2 because

of our efforts? Mr Speaker, this is the argument. It

has  been  put before by the' Prime Minister,  citing

the  Bukit  Ho  Swee site. A fire comes  along;  land

which was not vacant before becomes vacant. The  land

is  no longer encumbered with some tenants. The price

of  the land goes up. If we are to acquire that  fire

site,  is  it fair that we should pay the  owner  for

vacant  possession when he never had  it  before  the

fire?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the Select Committee on the Land

Acquisition  Bill,  as you are  well  aware,  several

representations were made by the public and  quite  a

few  suggestions and recommendations  were  accepted.

One   was  to  the  effect  that  appeals  of  owners

dissatisfied with the amount of compensation paid  to

them  for acquisition should be heard by someone with

legal  qualifications, preferably the  qualifications

of a Judge of the High Court, and in particular not a

civil   servant.   They  wanted  someone   completely

independent of Government views or pressures, if  you

like to put it that way. It was suggested that a High

Court  Judge should hear these appeals. Mr  Speaker,

it is my pleasure to inform this House that the Chief

Justice  of  our Supreme Court has agreed to  release

two of his Judges to sit in turn and hear the backlog

of  appeals  in cases of land acquisition which  have

piled up over the last two or three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, before I go on to the Ombudsman, it

might be a convenient time to adjourn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, another

recommendation - regarding the creation of the office

of an Ombudsman (or Parliamentary Commissioner) - was

not rejected by the Government. In fact, I had stated

that  Government was in agreement with  the  thinking

behind this recommendation but that the time was  not

opportune for the recommendation of such an office in

Singapore  to  be  accepted.  That  the  concept   is

acceptable to this Government must be clear from  the

fact  that one of the first measures taken soon after

May  1959 was the setting up of the Complaints Bureau

to which many Members have referred. We have somewhat

the  same  objective  of promptly  investigating  and

remedying allegations of maladministration  or  abuse

of  power. This Bureau, which is still operating,  no

doubt  has  certainly  not  got  the  powers  of  the

Ombudsman.  But  it  could be  said  to  contain  the

nucleus of the concept of the Ombudsman, albeit at  a

very  much  lower  level  than  the  office  of   the

Parliamentary Commissioner. Mr Speaker, Sir, when  I

say  that  the  time  is not ripe  as  conditions  in

Singapore  are  not  yet suitable,  the  question  is

asked, why? In Singapore, parliamentary democracy  is

still  in its infancy and our citizens have  not  yet

developed a full civic sense and awareness  of  their

legal  rights and obligations, as is the case in  the

more    established    countries    following     the

parliamentary   form  of  government.   In   such   a

situation, parliamentary democracy has to be nurtured

so  that it can take effective root. There are doubts

whether  the  creation at this stage of  institutions

like  the  Ombudsman might detract from the  role  of

Members  of  Parliament,  the Citizens'  Consultative

Committees  and  other  existing  channels  for   the

communication  of  grievances  in  order  to   obtain

redress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is relevant to note that in

the  United Kingdom, the Whyatt Committee  under  the

chairmanship   of   the  former  Chief   Justice   of

Singapore, Sir John Whyatt, when recommending



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>



the   creation   of   the   office    of

Parliamentary  Commissioner in  the  United  Kingdom,

considered that complaints to the Commissioner should

be channelled through Members of Parliament. This was

considered   a   necessary  interim   measure   while

Parliament  and  the  people got  used  to  this  new

institution.   The  Committee  also   considered   it

necessary  to  have  reserve  powers  with  Ministers

vetoing  inquiries  in any particular  case.  As  the

Member  for Bukit Panjang pointed out yesterday,  the

Parliamentary Commissioner in the United Kingdom  has

only  powers to investigate where a written complaint

is  made  to  a Member of the House of Commons  by  a

member  of the public, and the complaint can only  be

referred by the Member of the House of Commons to the

Parliamentary  Commissioner with the consent  of  the

complainant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this should illustrate the fact

that even in an old parliamentary democracy like  the

United Kingdom, this institution is considered  novel

and  there  are  opinions  for  and  against  it.  In

Singapore,  we  are  even  much  younger  and  it  is

considered  best to make haste slowly and learn  from

experience  elsewhere  before  introducing  such   an

office  here. When we do so, it will be necessary  to

consider  what modifications should be made  to  suit

our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members say it may be novel in the United

Kingdom,  but  what  about  Scandinavia  where   this

institution  has  existed for  more  than  a  hundred

years?  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, today  in  Canada  a  big

argument  is  going on whether or not  the  Ombudsman

should  be introduced into that country, and I  would

like  to  quote  extensively from an article  in  the

Scottish Law Gazette on this subject.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can you quote the date and volume

number of the publication?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Vol. 34, No. 3, September 1966. It

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It might well be that under some forms of

government or constitution, some device for tempering

the  harsh winds of the supposedly omnipotent  powers

of  government to the shorn lamb of the  man  in  the

street is necessary, or at least desirable...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Scandinavian country where the idea seems to

have originated the political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>



set-up  is  quite  different from that  operating  in

Canada or any of its provinces.'



<br><br>Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  if  Canada  is  different  from

Scandinavia, what about Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This perhaps is not so obvious in the case of New

Zealand, where at least the form of government is  in

its  origin  the  same as in Canada.  .  ..  Probably

therefore bureaucracy is much more firmly entrenched,

and  the  need for relief of the individual far  more

urgent.  Perhaps also the basic livestock  and  dairy

farming economy of New Zealand may have an effect  on

the political needs of that dominion.'



<br><br>It goes on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Perhaps it would be as well to take a look first

of  all  to see what is the problem, for the solution

of  which it is proposed to resort to the appointment

of  an  Ombudsman. This may not be an easy  task,  as

there  does  not seem to be any degree  of  unanimity

among  those who advocate the appointment of such  an

official. From time to time situations arise in which

it  can  be  made to appear that some  individual  is

being  oppressively  dealt with  by  some  government

agency or bureaucracy. Some enthusiastic newspaperman

hears  of  it  and  seizes upon it  as  an  excellent

opportunity  to  ring the changes  on  the  brand  of

sensationalism which is the guiding principle of  the

modern  journalist. The man in the street  rarely  if

ever  waits to hear what the other side has  to  say,

and  indeed only does so if driven to it, and so  the

cry  is raised for some remedial means to redress the

imagined oppression. In this instance the clamour has

been  raised  for the appointment of an  official  or

creation  of  an  office to be  called  Ombudsman  as

pointing the way to another utopian panacea.'



<br><br>If I may go on, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This forces the conclusion that to be effective an

Ombudsman must be given real powers and to  give  him

real   powers  would  be  a  violation  of  the  most

fundamental  of  all  the  principles  on  which  the

parliamentary  system of government is founded,  that

is, that no one shall be above the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many, if not most, of the instances that are

clamourously  pilloried by the drama-conscious  press

as  grievous oppressions, arise from the  actions  of

government agencies and administrative bodies created

under  regulations,  the  power  to  make  which  the

legislature has delegated to another or others.  This

group  of vicarious authorities is generically called

the  bureaucracy and bureaucracy can put  rabbits  to

shame  in the ability to proliferate. The demand  for

an  Ombudsman  or its equivalent really  arises  from

this multiplication of authorities responsible to  no

one,  and  who  therefore arrogate to themselves  the

right to set themselves above the law. Essentially an

Ombudsman would be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>



another bureaucrat and while the proverbial principle

of  setting  a thief to catch a thief has in  certain

contexts   a  specious  merit,  it  has  a   doubtful

application  to the case of putting  a  curb  on  the

abuses  of bureaucracy. The situation falls far  more

nearly  within the principle of the old  adage  about

locking  the  stable door after the  horse  has  been

stolen.  What  is really needed is much more  careful

consideration of powers glibly handed over to  people

who  owe,  or  at least consider that  they  owe,  no

responsibility  to anyone, so long as  they  strictly

obey  the  letter of their charter as they  interpret

it,  and  much stronger safeguards written  into  the

relevant  statutes against abuse of any  powers  that

can conceivably be exercised arbitrarily.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net result, they conclude, is that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`if the law is for the general benefit, and the

attention  of the legislators has been drawn  to  the

danger  and  they  nevertheless enact  it,  then  the

public must accept it. That is one of the hazards  of

the  parliamentary system and the remedy, if any,  is

at the polls.'



<br><br>I think that if the people are dissatisfied with this

Government, their remedy is at the polls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One main reason against the introduction of this

institution in Singapore is the standard of literacy.

No  doubt  every child in Singapore is educated,  and

perhaps  when  they  all grow up they  will  need  an

Ombudsman.  But, at the moment, quite a part  of  our

population  is  not literate and the introduction  of

the  Ombudsman  would mean that this  poor  Ombudsman

would  be flooded by complaints by people who do  not

know what are the limits of his jurisdiction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now go on to the Council

of  State.  Here  again, I think  I  must  trace  the

history of the Council of State. The earliest of  the

modern  constitutions of today to have a  Council  of

State  is  the Constitution of Eire, 1937,  where  in

Article 31, there is provision establishing a Council

of  State  to  aid and counsel the President  in  all

matters  on  which  the  President  may  consult  the

Council  in  relation to the exercise and performance

of  his  powers and the functions accorded to him  by

the  Constitution. The Council of State envisaged  by

the Constitutional Report has its origin, however, in

a  Kenyan Constitution of 1958. The Kenya Council  of

State of 1958 was created for a purpose quite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>



different from that in the Irish Constitution, though

it  was probably from that Constitution that the idea

of  such  a  Council was first inspired.  The  Kenyan

Council  of State, however, was done away  with  when

Kenya  became  independent  in  1963.  In  1962   Dr

Hastings  Banda rejected outright a proposal  by  the

Nyasaland  Constitutional  Conference  to  set  up  a

Council  of  State.  He  regarded  it  as  likely  to

perpetuate  racial discrimination and  undermine  the

responsibility   of  Ministers  to  the   Legislative

Assembly.  Dr  Banda  had  also  objected   to   the

suggestion  that  there should be  an  Ombudsman,  or

indeed  any  idea  of  a second Chamber.  The  Kenyan

Council of State of 1958 was a multi-racial body  set

up to perform functions of safeguarding the rights of

minorities.   Apart   from   Kenya   in   its    1958

Constitution,  but  not in its present  Constitution,

and   I   believe,   Southern  Rhodesia,   no   other

Commonwealth country has a Council of State.  It  may

be true to say, therefore, that if we today create  a

Council of State we would perhaps be the only country

in  the Commonwealth to have such a Council. But then

it was for reasons such as that of providing adequate

safeguards  of  minority rights that the  Council  of

State in Kenya was established, and those reasons,  I

understand,  disappeared  in  Kenya  and  hence   the

Council  was  scrapped. But the  reasons  behind  the

creation of a Council of State, in my view, exist for

us   in  Singapore,  since  the  Council  had  proved

effective in dealing with the circumstances that  had

been existing in Kenya when it was first established.

It  was  then,  as  it is perhaps  now,  a  promising

innovation  which  can make for far  more  harmonious

relations  between the Government and  the  governed,

and because it does not take the form or substance of

a  second  Chamber, it cannot impede the Government's

legislative  programme  in  any  significant  degree.

Indeed,  given a proper relationship, such a  Council

could  be  as  constructive  and  as  helpful  as  an

Ombudsman, though on a larger scale. The Council,  as

envisaged  in this Report, would be no more  than  an

advisory  council  to assist the  Government  in  the

drawing up of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>



Bills and to advise on Bills that have been drawn up,

and  further  to  safeguard the  rights  of  minority

groups  in  Singapore.  The  legislative  primacy  of

Parliament  is  not  in  any way  affected.  Yet  its

members who may not be members of the Legislature can

be  of  assistance  to  Parliament.  Their  functions

would,  of  course, be purely advisory, but,  at  the

same  time,  minority  groups can  look  to  them  to

safeguard their interests so that measures  that  may

in  any  way  derogate from their  interests  may  be

brought to the attention of those responsible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, at this stage, I must deal with the

functions of this Council. In my previous Ministerial

statement, I said that though Government accepts  the

recommendation   to  create  a  Council   of   State,

Government  differs  from  the  recommendations  with

regard  to the composition and the functions.  I  did

set  out  therein some particulars of the composition

of the Council, but I did not say much about what its

functions should be. And perhaps it would be best  if

I dealt with this matter by actually referring to the

recommendations  as they appear at  page  16  in  the

Report,  and then set out the Government's  stand  in

respect of every detailed recommendation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at page 16, paragraph 59, the

Report says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We recommend -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the creation of a small advisory body to be

called  "the  Council  of  State"  consisting  of  21

members  of  which a minimum of 15  shall  always  be

appointed;'.



<br><br>This  deals with the composition and, if I may  refer

to  my previous statement, I did say that the members

would  be of two types, permanent members and members

who  are  removable.  But, in any  case,  they  would

consist  of  men of distinction, men who  are  mature

citizens  and  who have either rendered distinguished

public   service  or  attained  eminence   in   their

respective  walks of life regardless of race,  colour

or  creed as recommended by the Commission.  On  this

subject,  I  think  the Member for Anson  wants  this

Council  to have less members and someone  else  also

shares his views. The view of the Government is  that

we should be flexible and we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>



intend to appoint a maximum of 36 and no more. We may

appoint less but not beyond 36.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Commission says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`all the members shall be appointed by the

President after consultation with the Prime  Minister

but in the President's discretion;'.



<br><br>This  is  not  acceptable. All the  members  will  be

appointed  by  the  President on the  advice  of  the

Cabinet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommendation (iii) is acceptable. I have already

referred to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommendation (iv):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`the other qualifications for membership shall be

as  set out in Article 28 (2) (a) , (c) , (d) , (e)  and

(f) ,  suitably modified, of the present  Constitution

of  Singapore  which provides for the  qualifications

for membership of Parliament;'.



<br><br>This is acceptable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(v) the disqualifications for membership shall be -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) membership of any political party at the time of

appointment;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the disqualifications set out in Article

29, suitably modified, of the present Constitution of

Singapore ...'



<br><br>(a) is not acceptable, but (b) is. The Prime Minister

has  dealt with this point and has set out  our  view

that  just because someone has been in our  Party  or

U.M.N.O. or  the  Labour  Party  or  the   People's

Progressive Party, or some other party, we  will  not

bar  him  from this Council. Parties come and  go  in

Singapore. They change names except ours. But we feel

that  political affiliation should not be  a  bar  to

membership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(vi) the circumstances under which a member shall

cease  to be a member shall be the same as in Article

30 (2) (a) , (c) , (d) and (e) , suitably modified, . . .'.



<br><br>This  part is acceptable but not the second  sentence

which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A member shall also cease to be a member if he

offers  himself for election to Parliament or becomes

a member of any political party.'



<br><br>Just  because one is a Member of Parliament does  not

mean  one cannot be a member of the Council of State.

In  my previous statement, I did indicate that it was

the Government's contention to appoint not only, say,

the  Chief  Justice and you yourself, Sir,  but  also

certain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>



Ministers   of  the  Government  and  also   ex-Chief

Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(vii) the Speaker of Parliament shall be the'

Chairman and shall preside at all its meetings.'



<br><br>I  have  great pleasure in informing you,  Sir,  that

this is acceptable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it goes on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Deputy Speaker of Parliament shall he the

Deputy  Chairman and shall preside during any absence

of the Chairman.'



<br><br>We  feel  on  this that if you are the  Chairman,  we

would  rather leave it to the Council itself to elect

someone from their midst to be your Deputy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Speaker.... shall not be a member of the

Council and shall take no part, except to preside, in

the deliberations of the Council....'.



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir, if you are on that  Council,  you

will be a member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(viii) the Council of State shall have power to

consider  all proposed legislation except all  Supply

Bills  or  a  Bill  presented  on  a  Certificate  of

Urgency;'.



<br><br>This,  I have great pleasure in saying, is acceptable

to the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Havelock yesterday pointed out that

this  is  a  Report on minority rights,  and  if  the

Council  of  State  is being set up  to  protect  the

minorities,  then he argued - and argued logically  -

that only Bills that affect the minorities in any way

should  go to the Council of State. He suggested  one

method  to ascertain whether a Bill does or does  not

affect minority rights, and he put the burden on you,

Mr Speaker, Sir. He wanted you to certify whether or

not  any  Bill affects minority rights.  This  indeed

would  be  a  difficult task, though not  impossible.

However, Sir, to save you all that trouble, we  would

prefer'  that all Bills, whether or not  they  affect

minority  rights, except, of course, Supply Bills  or

Bills  presented on a Certificate of Urgency,  should

go  to the Council of State. And at this stage I must

say  that it is our object, in creating this Council,

not  merely  to protect the rights of the  minorities

but  to protect also the rights of the majority. This

is  not a Council merely to protect minorities.  What

about  the  others? We are not afraid  that  all  our

Bills with the exceptions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>



mentioned should go to the Council of State,  and  we

would  be  happy  to receive their advice  and  might

benefit therefrom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ix), Sir, deals with proceedings:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`every Bill except all Supply Bills or an `Urgent"

Bill  shall  after its First reading  and  after  the

Minister in charge has made his opening speech during

the  Second reading hut before any debate takes place

on  the  principle  of the Bill be submitted  to  the

Council of State;'.



<br><br>Sir, this is acceptable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(x) the Council of State shall consider the Bill

in public, regulating its own procedure, ---'.



<br><br>If  I  may  pause  there,  Sir,  in  order  to  avoid

confusion.  I  have  stated  before  --   and   other

Ministers have stated it -that the Council  of  State

shall consider the Bill in private. But within thirty

clays  of  the submission of the Bill to the Council,

the  Council  may  make a report to  Parliament.  The

report, it goes on to say, shall be submitted  within

thirty  days,  and if no report is forthcoming,  then

proceedings  in  this  House  are  to  be  no  longer

delayed. This means, in effect, Sir, a delay  of  one

month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accepting the Council of State, we are, in fact,

entrenching   it   into  our  Constitution.   I   say

"entrenching it into our Constitution" - I will  deal

in  more detail with this when I come to the proposed

methods of entrenchment. But if I may shortly say so,

Sir,  at  this  stage,  there are  three  methods  of

entrenchment recommended. But, in my view, there is a

fourth  method, and that is this. Some  constitutions

provide  that  some  Bills cannot  go  through  three

stages  unless  there is a delay of  6  months  or  7

months. So there is a clause in the constitution - an

entrenched  clause -and in accepting the  Council  of

State, we are, in effect, accepting the fourth method

of entrenchment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(xi) any "Urgent" Bill notwithstanding that it has

been  assented to shall nevertheless be submitted  as

soon  as  possible to the Council who shall  consider

and report on it as in the case of other Bills.'



<br><br>Acceptable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(xii) the term of office of a member shall he nine

years ---'.



<br><br>I  have  stated  earlier that we  intend  to  appoint

permanent members and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>



members who may be removed after three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(xiii) any Minister may attend all proceedings of

the  Council  and take part in its deliberations  but

may not vote.'



<br><br>I  would  add  "unless he has been appointed  to  the

Council".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, having dealt with the detailed

recommendations   on  the  Council   of   State   and

Government's views of what we accept and what  we  do

not,  before I conclude the subject, I would like  to

make  it clear - and I think this point must be  made

and  stressed  for the particular attention  of  some

Members  who are rather unhappy about this Council  -

when  Government  views  the recommendations  of  the

Commission on the Council and, in fact, on the  whole

Report,  we are not looking at it just as members  of

the  Government. We are also looking at it  from  the

point of view of the people outside this House,  non-Members of Parliament. In 10 or maybe 15 years,  most

of  us  will not be in this House. We may be  outside

and,  if  you  are good enough, you may  be  on  this

Council  of  State.  Perhaps a younger  set  will  be

occupying  these seats here, and if we  are  on  this

Council, I think, with our experience, we can discuss

their  views  and send them advice  for  what  it  is

worth. At least when that day comes, we will still be

making some contribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, with regard to the functions of the

Council of State which I went through just now,  with

the  passage  of time we may even consider  extending

the  powers of the Council to look into petitions and

complaints  from the public. In other words,  instead

of appointing an Ombudsman in 5 or 10 years' time, we

may  invest  the  powers  of the  Ombudsman  in  this

Council  of  State,  as the Member  for  Punggol  has

pointed out -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Very true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order or clarification, Mr

Rajoo?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> Point of clarification.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Minister give way?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Gladly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> Sir, recommendation (x) for the Council

of State reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`the Council of State shall consider the Bill in

public, regulating its own procedure, and within  say

thirty  days of its submission to the Council make  a

report to Parliament. The report to Parliament  shall

be  accompanied  by a copy of the Proceedings  before

the  Council of State. After the Council of State has

submitted its report to Parliament or if it fails  to

do  so  within the specified thirty days, proceedings

in Parliament on the Bill may then continue;'.



<br><br>My  point  of clarification is this. What happens  to

that  report submitted by the Council after the  Bill

is  considered? What action is Parliament supposed to

take on that report?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, once the report is

tabled  in  this House, it will be available  to  all

Members.  Then  it  will be up to the  Government  in

power  to  accept the recommendations in  tow  or  in

part,  or  to reject all recommendations.  Does  that

satisfy the Member?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The report, once it is tabled in this

House, will, of course, be available to the Press and

to the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Once it is tabled, of course, it is

made public. I think it is only right that the public

should  know  what  the Council has  recommended  and

`what the Government accepts or rejects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may proceed, Sir,I now go on to the

entrenched  provisions.  The  Report  mentions  three

methods of entrenchment. The first is to provide  for

an  amendment  of the Constitution by  a  Bill  which

specifically sets it out as an amendment  Bill.  This

is   acknowledged   to  be  the   weakest   form   of

constitutional entrenchment. The only useful  purpose

that:  a  specific  reference in  an  amendment  Bill

ensures is that there may not be any amendment of the

Constitution   through  sheer  inadvertence   or   by

implication.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It will save the Chair and the Clerk

from  knowing  whether  a  `two-thirds  majority   is

required or not.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> That is very true, Sir,I have said in

my earlier statement that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government has given very careful

consideration   to   all  three   methods   and   the

implications  of  each  and  has  decided,   in   the

situation  now prevailing in Singapore, to adopt  the

second method of entrenchment.'



<br><br>I have also stated that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`All those recommendations accepted by the

Government and also recommended by the Commission for

entrenchment will be so entrenched.'



<br><br>But  after  listening to the views  of  some  Members

-which  is now confirmed by your view, Sir  -  it  is

considered   that  there  is  merit  in   the   views

expressed,  that Government should accept  the  first

method  as well. And I am pleased to state that  this

method  of  entrenchment,  however  weak  it  is,  is

acceptable to Government and will find a place in our

Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second method referred to is

where  the amendment Bill, through its passage  here,

has  to  secure votes of not less than two-thirds  of

all  the  elected Members of Parliament voting.  This

method varies from constitution to constitution. Some

provide specifically that the requirement of  a  two-thirds  majority must be obtained at the  Second  and

the  Third  Readings. This method would  ensure  that

only  a Government in office which commands more than

a two-thirds majority in Parliament can alter at will

the  provisions  of  the  Constitution  that  are  so

entrenched. We are inclined to forget here again that

today we are in a happy position of having 49 Members

out of a House of 51. But we must always think of the

future,  and the day may come when this provision  is

in  and we want to amend it but cannot do so. On  the

other hand, it might be the other way, if we form the

Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a third method which is

mentioned  in  the  Report, and  that  is  where  the

amendment  is brought about with the electors  taking

part. Such a provision would, in fact, provide for  a

referendum supporting a particular Bill so passed  by

the  Legislature. This is by far the strictest of all

the  three  methods suggested. Where the Constitution

is  to  be the supreme law of the land and its status

as such is to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>



protected, a procedure can be prescribed for a strict

method  of  amendment and, as a result, a more  rigid

Constitution will result. But, as has been so rightly

pointed   out   in  the  Constitutional   Report,   a

constitution that will not bend will sooner or  later

break. However, one has to consider the necessity  of

entrenching  clauses in a constitution in  accordance

with   its   importance  and  vary  such  method   of

entrenchment accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned just now the fourth method, and I

will  say  a  little more on that  now.  This  fourth

method  introduces  the imposition  of  a  period  of

delay, and this can be found in Jamaica where a Bill,

seeking  to amend the Constitution, cannot be debated

in  the  House of Representatives until three  months

have  elapsed since its introduction, and  a  further

three months must elapse before the conclusion of the

debate  and  the  final passing of the  Bill  by  the

House. Thereafter it goes to the Senate whose consent

must  be obtained except when the provisions enabling

the  dispensation of the consent of  the  Senate  are

complied  with.  Again  in  Jamaica,  Sir,  specially

entrenched  clauses cannot be altered  in  any  event

without recourse to a referendum. In Australia,  too,

a  referendum is necessary for certain constitutional

amendments and this has led to considerable delays in

the   passing  of  such  Bills,  and,  in  fact,  the

postponement  of  immediate reforms.  To  mention  an

extreme case, Sir, one may refer to Cyprus where  the

provisions safeguarding the interests of the minority

groups have been written into a constitution that, to

all intents and purposes, cannot be amended. This has

led  practically to a breakdown of the  constitution.

In  Malaysia, Nigeria, Trinidad and Uganda, the  two-thirds rule is provided in all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>



their  Constitutions.  And  this  is  the  method  we

propose to adopt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, in dealing with the third

method of entrenchment, it is Government's view  that

before   we   write  this  third  method   into   our

constitution, we should have a referendum and consult

the  people and ask them, "Do you or do you not  want

to  be  consulted on certain matters?" This  will  be

quite a referendum because so many questions have  to

be  asked  and  I  do not see how agreement  will  be

reached, but our view is that we should not impose on

our  people certain responsibilities which  they  may

not  choose to bear. They might, but we do not  know.

We  have  had  one referendum; we have had  the  1963

elections;  we  have had the Barisan  vacating  their

seats;  we  have had by-elections after by-elections.

Somehow I feel that our people are a little tired and

probably  prefer  to  be left  alone,  at  least  for

several years. So, on that note, Mr Speaker, Sir,  I

thank you for being so patient with me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House takes note of the Report of the

Constitutional  Commission, 1966, presented  to  this

House  as  Command Paper No. 29 of 1966, and endorses

the  Government's views thereon as  set  out  in  the

Statement  by  the  Minister  for  Law  and  National

Development made at the sitting of this House on 21st

December, 1966.
