<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mdm Ho

Geok Choo -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To ask the Minister for Education in light of

the  report that there has been an increase in the number

of  students seeking counselling services in our schools,

will  his  Ministry provide (i) some of the analyses  and

findings  for the students wanting to seek such  services

and  (ii)  the  number of such students  with  percentage

breakdown and their profile.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Question

No. 1.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from the counselling cases reported by

schools,  about  6%  of students have been  referred  for

counselling,  with  secondary school students  accounting

for slightly more than half of these 6%.  Of these 6%, 4%

were   seen   by  school  personnel,  including   Teacher

Counsellors,  and  2% were referred to  the  Ministry  of

Education's specialists and external professionals.   The

two  main types of problems referred for counselling were

discipline-related problems, eg, truancy and late-coming,

and  emotion  problems, eg, coping with  grief  and  loss

issues, boy-girl relationship problems.  These two  types

of  cases  accounted  for  about  three-quarters  of  the

counselling  cases  reported  by  schools.   Other  cases

involved  bullying  and  theft, motivation  and  attitude

problems.  The students who were referred for counselling

came  from  a cross-section of academic levels,  streams,

gender and ethnic groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, there has been a greater awareness

among  the  public  on emotional health  issues,  greater

acceptance of counselling as an option, and easier access

to  counselling  services in schools and  the  community,

such as the Family Services Centres.  Referrals for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>

counselling have therefore gone up.  The availability  of

these  counselling  services is  indeed  helpful  to  our

students who may need them.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, according

to  the  latest  Annual  Report of the  Public  Transport

Council, the PTC is driven by the mission to balance  the

need for public interest to be safeguarded and for public

transport  operators to remain financially viable.   With

the  fare  hikes, coming at a time when Singaporeans  are

hit by job losses and pay cuts, the feeling on the ground

is  that  the  PTC has put the interests  of  the  public

transport operators over that of the public.  The PTC has

lost  sight  of  the  larger  social  mission  of  public

transport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Singaporeans use public transport today because

cars  are priced out of their reach, with the Certificate

of  Entitlement  and  the taxes on  road  usage.   Public

transport  is the only affordable means to get  to  where

they need to go, to work, to the market, to get home.  It

gives  them access to employment and, hence, income.   As

an  MP, I sometimes hear jobless residents not wanting to

take  jobs  far  away from their homes because  it  means

taking  two buses and an MRT ride, which means waking  up

at  5.30  am  to  get  to  work on  time.   The  cost  of

travelling  itself can also be a disincentive, especially

if the take-home pay of the job offered is already low.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pricing of public transport has a major impact

on  the  lives  of disadvantaged people.   The  household

expenditure  surveys  conducted  by  the  Department   of

Statistics  consistently show that it is the lower-income

group, especially those in 1- to 2-room flats, who  spend

most  on  public road transport, compared  to  the  other

groups.  Indeed, the latest survey shows that public road

transport  takes up 6.8% of the household expenditure  of

those living in 1- to 2-room flats.  This is higher  than

the  average  4% for all households.  Any  price  changes

will  hit  the lower-income most.  And we also know  that

this  economic  downturn has hit them the  hardest.   The

Government  says  that it helps them  with  the  Economic

Downturn  Relief  Scheme, the New  Singapore  Shares  and

other  such financial schemes.  But these are often once-off  affairs, or for the EDRS, up to three  months.   But

the  psychological  blow, not to  mention  the  financial

impact,  of  a price increase for something as  basic  to

them as public transport is felt on a regular basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not drive and I do not own a car. I take

public  transport everyday.  I know the  service  of  the

public transport has improved over the years.  But I also

know  how it feels to be squeezed in a bus, with no elbow

room, and to have to wait for more than half-an-hour  for

buses  that arrive so packed, you have no choice  but  to

wait for another, which comes another half-an-hour later,

just  as packed.  The commuting masses, by and large,  do

not  want  frills.   They  want  an  affordable  but   an

efficient and convenient public transport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the Senior Minister of State Khaw Boon Wan

talking  about  buses being made more  sophisticated,  so

that they can be "mobile offices".  Frankly, I dread  the

day.   I  find  the  TV  mobile  enough  of  a  nuisance.

Commuters often use the travelling time on buses to rest,

take  a nap or just unwind, not as a place to start work.

I  urge  the  Government and the PTC not  to  forget  the

social  mission of public transport as they  tinker  with

fancy and costly ideas that the public does not want.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Transport Minister was reported as saying

that  the  commuters should expect fares to rise  because

service standards and wage expectations keep going up.  I

question  this.   In  times  of recession,  all  workers,

including  bus drivers, have been told to moderate  their

wage  expectations.  As for service standards, yes, as  I

have said, they have increased, but commuters do not want

to   be   made  to  pay  for  unnecessary  frills.    The

airconditioned bus interchange is a frill.  Why the  need

to  aircondition it when the idea of a quality service is

that  commuters  do  not have to wait  too  long  at  the

interchange  for  their  bus  to  arrive?    True,   this

interchange is not factored in the recent fare  increase,

as  the  bus operators do not have to pay for the capital

cost  of building the airconditioned interchange.  It  is

paid for by the Government.  But they have to pay for the

cost  of  maintaining the interchange.  This will  surely

add  to  their  operating cost.  Will this  lead  to  bus

operators  asking  for  more fare  increases  in  future,

especially   as   I   hear   that   more   airconditioned

interchanges are on the cards?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Transport Minister has defended the hikes

by  saying  that transport companies must be  allowed  to

make reasonable profits.  It is not clear to us or to the

public  what  are the criteria for deciding if  operators

are  making  reasonable  or  unreasonable  profits.    In

particular,  how  does  the Minister  measure  viability,

given  the  current economic conditions  and  the  social

mission of public transport?  Moreover, the operators are

operating   in  a  privileged  situation,  with   limited

competition.  The reasons given by the operators for  the

fare  increases  are not compelling.  SBS  Transit  cited

increases in statutory costs, such as ERP, as one  reason

for  the  fare increase.  I know the Government has  more

than compensated SBS for the ERP charges by lowering  the

road tax significantly.  But given the social mission  of

public transport, there is also a case for the Government

to  ease  the  cost burden by examining if the  statutory

costs,  such  as  the  ERP for buses,  can  be  reviewed.

Public  transport should be exempted from the ERP,  which

is meant to ease congestion and to encourage cars to use

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>

alternative routes.  Buses have no choice but to ply  the

routes that they have to.  Sir, there is a fear that  ERP

will  only  continue  to  push  up  the  cost  of  public

transport  further,  especially  with  night  ERP   being

discussed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for SMRT, it cited energy cost as one factor

leading to rising operating costs.  Energy cost has risen

as  a result of electricity tariff hikes.  For TIBS,  one

of  the factors cited, among others, is diesel cost.  But

why  should  these factors be cited as reasons  to  raise

fares  when  electricity  and  diesel  costs  should   be

addressed by the Fuel Equalisation Fund (FEF).  This Fund

was set up in 1992 to address volatile fuel prices and to

curb  fare increases due to fluctuations of fuel  prices.

The operators should be allowed to draw from their FEF to

cushion the impact of increases in electricity and diesel

costs,  without a fare increase.  As at 31st March  2001,

the  balances in the FEF are $39.8 million for SBS,  $8.7

million  for SMRT, and $8.4 million for TIBS.   They  can

draw from this rather than raise the prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also query the argument that restriction in the

number  of operators allows them to achieve economies  of

scale  and  to  balance the profitable  routes  with  the

unprofitable  ones.  Some MPs have repeatedly  asked  for

bus   routes   within  their  estates.   I  myself   have

represented my residents in asking for Bus Service 292 to

link two zones tucked in a far corner of my ward directly

to  the  Changkat Community Centre, but the response  has

always  been, "It is unprofitable.  Hence, we can't  give

you that service."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that competitive tendering be extended to

certain zones.  There is potential for lowering costs  by

introducing  competition  in awarding  contracts  to  run

zonal  services within a planned and coordinated network,

as   has   been  adopted  in  other  countries  such   as

Scandinavia.  On this matter, perhaps more weight  should

be  given  to  committees, like the  Estate  Coordinating

Committee of a GRC.  These committees, which can be found

in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>

Tampines   and   Pasir   Ris  GRCs,   coordinate   estate

development  and  include LTA and SBS representatives  as

well   as  grassroots  leaders  and  MPs.   Perhaps  more

authority and powers could be given to this Committee  to

push forward the agenda for competitive tendering.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some Members argued that this House should not

undermine the credibility and independence of the  Public

Transport  Council by urging it to review or reverse  its

decision on fare increases.  While I agree that we should

not  politicise the PTC and its work as far as  possible,

it  is  important  to assure the public  that  they  have

recourse  in  such matters.  This is the  case  with  the

Judiciary.  Our Judiciary is independent, and  it  guards

its  integrity jealously and fiercely.  No MP is  allowed

to ask the Judiciary to reverse its decision.  But it has

an  internal appeal mechanism which makes sure  that  the

system  works.  If one disagrees with the judgment passed

down by the courts, he can appeal to a higher court.  But

in  the case of public transport, there is no higher body

outside  of  Parliament.  Moreover, as this  case  shows,

Parliament  may  not  be able to  react  fast  enough  to

appeals  from  the public.  This sitting is taking  place

after  the  fact,  after the fare hike has  already  been

implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister to establish a public

transport  ombudsman as a mediator or  assessor  of  last

resort  for  users,  and  perhaps  for  public  transport

operators as well.  There should be a body separate  from

operators and regulators to act as an appeals  body.   It

would help ensure that the system works, that the process

is  transparent and, at the same time, assure the  public

that  they can get a fair hearing before a fare  hike  is

implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, with all these fears about price increases,

especially  in  public transport, I want to  bring  up  a

cheaper  alternative to public transport and cars  -  and

that  is cycling.  Sir, I declare my interest.  I am  the

patron of the Singapore Amateur Cycling

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>

Association.  Cycling is becoming increasingly popular in

Singapore, both on and off-road.  But our road  transport

system  gives  little  thought  to  their  use.   On-road

cyclists  find their enjoyment and safety jeopardised  by

sharing  roads with motor vehicles, and off-road  cycling

may  conflict  with  the interests of pedestrians.   Sir,

there  was a time when I cycled to work from Upper Changi

Road  to  Times House, then in Kim Seng Road,  and  back.

But  I stopped after I was knocked down by a taxi.   Sir,

there are local grassroots and environmental groups,  all

trying to promote cycling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Minister to consider providing a bicycle

lane on roads that can be used by two-wheelers, including

motorbikes, for safety and as well as an alternative mode

of  transport.  Such lanes can be found in many developed

cities,  even  those  which  experience  winter.    These

bicycle  lanes are not used in winter, but that does  not

stop the authorities from providing them.  What more  for

a country with tropical weather all year round?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, public transport must be guided

by its over-riding social mission.  The PTC, in reviewing

fare  prices, should take into account the state  of  the

economy,   the   unemployment   rate,   and   also    the

affordability   of  public  transport  to   the   masses,

especially the lower-income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, the motion

being  moved in this House is a significant one.   It  is

both  timely  and  bold in its call.  It was  unfortunate

that a slew of public service charges have increased over

the  last few months.  It could be that some have decided

that  it  is  a  politically safe time to  raise  charges

without incurring the public ire.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the public has spoken. Looking at the quality

and  the tone of the letters, comments and feedback, both

in  the  public  and  private  domains,  one  cannot  but

conclude that there is indeed a sense of frustration  and

despair among many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>

Singaporeans.   The  increase in the  garbage  collection

charges  was  the  first whip the public tolerated.  Then

came  the  carpark  fee charges and the public  transport

fare increases.  Collectively, they will make a financial

dent  in  the  lives of Singaporeans.   Many  people  are

worried how do they cope with these increases when  their

salaries are frozen and, in some cases, cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans' feedback was rebutted with the

usual statistical and textbook answers.  The increase was

a  small  percentage in relation to the overall fare  per

trip, that is what some said.  What it fails to highlight

is  the  percentage  increase, and  the  fact  that  many

Singaporeans take public transport many times a day,  and

not  once  or twice, as some people have highlighted.   I

recall   that,   during  the  last   four   years,   some

Singaporeans  had seen many MPs, in the course  of  their

meet-the-people  sessions, with  sad  stories  that  they

could  not afford to go for job interviews, because  they

did not even have money to pay for their fares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I sympathise with many Singaporeans,

particularly  our  low-wage  earners,  for  whom   public

transport can come up to 10% of their monthly expenditure

if  one  includes the total income they spend  on  public

transport.  Many have not had pay increases for the  last

few  years.  Some have their pay reduced, some have  just

been  re-employed,  and some are still  unemployed.   The

impact  of  the public transport fare increases  on  this

group of Singaporeans is tremendous.  They are angry but,

at the same time, they are helpless.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I join in the call of the people to demand an

explanation as to why public transport fare increase  was

allowed in these difficult times.  Last year, the  Public

Transport   Council  took  into  account  the  prevailing

economic  situation  and only allowed  the  alignment  of

adult  feeder fares with the minimum trunk  fares.   Even

then  a 10-cent increase, from 50 cents to 60 cents, came

up  to about 20% increase in the feeder fare increase.  I

thought   it  was  a  substantial  amount  because   many

Singaporeans use feeder services in the public

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>

housing  estates.   It was a substantial  jump  for  many

Singaporeans because they use these feeder services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this year, despite no substantial improvement in

the economic environment, the PTC has approved an across-the-board increase.  I would like to ask the Minister why

an  increase was allowed when the economy is still in the

recovery phase.  I am equally puzzled as to how the  wage

bill   for   the  public  transport  operators   can   be

increasing,  the  CPF  cut is still  in  place  and  wage

increases  are minimal.  When some companies are  in  the

red  and  many  more are without a steady  business,  was

there a real need to pamper our bus companies with a fare

increase?   For  a monopoly who enjoys a  steady  profit,

even  in  bad economic times, could they have  sacrificed

more and alleviate the financial burden of the public?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether the present

policy  for allowing route and transport monopoly is  the

best  model  to achieve a good, efficient and  reasonably

priced  public transport system.  I am sure the  Minister

will  agree  that  the public policy favours  competition

over  monopoly.  In many countries, public policy  relies

on  the  competitive market to establish  the  price  and

quality of goods and services.  Yet, in Singapore, in the

public transport domain, we have monopolies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Government to seriously consider

calling  for  public  tenders to  run  certain  transport

routes,  which was mentioned earlier by my colleague,  Ms

Irene  Ng.  This would certainly not unsettle the present

operators, as many of the infrastructure and mass  public

facilities, like MRT stations, bus stations, and  depots,

are  built  by the Government with taxpayers' money.   By

calling  for tender, say, once in five years, I think  it

will  allow  these  public  transport  operators  to   be

benchmarked  against  the market mechanism,  and  to  see

whether true efficiency can be delivered by the market.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present set-up, the only available models to

compare cost efficiency are the present two operators and

the  two  MRT  operators.   They  enjoy  a  monopoly   in

perpetuity.   Opening  up  the  market  and  testing  the

existing operators against other potential competitors, I

am  certain the public would benefit.  A good example  is

the   case  of  the  garbage  collection  companies.    I

understand  that the Ministry of the Environment  divided

Singapore  into eight sectors and called for tenders  for

each  of  these  sectors.  The cheapest was  selected  by

competitive  tendering  and  their  contract  period   is

limited to five years, after which a fresh tender will be

called.   I would urge the Minister to consider  such  an

approach   as  a  way  to  control  costs  and  introduce

competition to the public transport sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me highlight one more sector to show how

competition  in  the  public sector  helps  control  fare

increases.   Sir,  when taxi fares were liberalised,  the

taxi  companies did not increase their fares because they

knew  that  demand  was not inelastic.   They  know  that

customers  have other choices, like bus, MRT,  and  other

taxi  companies, to reach their destination.  In the case

of  public  transport operators, like bus  and  MRT,  the

public  has  no  choice.  They are fixed by  the  present

operators - use them or be doomed.  In the long run, I do

not think that this is the model that we want to have  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I was listening to the debate yesterday, I

was impressed by the arguments of the Senior Minister  of

State  for  Transport, Mr Khaw Boon Wan.  He  highlighted

there   are  many  misunderstandings  among  the  public.

However,   I  felt  that  there  are  still  a   lot   of

misunderstandings remaining, despite his brave attempt to

clear  the  misunderstandings.  Misunderstanding  No.  1,

which he highlighted, is that fare increases are not  due

to frills, and that these are paid for by the Government.

But what he fails to state is that the operators have  to

maintain  it.  As my colleague earlier highlighted,  more

airconditioned bus terminals are going to come.  A PUB

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>

officer advises any consumer who goes there and complains

about  high PUB bills that airconditioning is the biggest

culprit.   Here, again, we have to ask ourselves  whether

the  operators are going to bear the cost  of  these  new

frills.   In his speech yesterday, he did not cover  this

aspect.     The    misunderstanding   continues.     This

misunderstanding is legitimate.  Perhaps  the  Government

could  explain whether it is the Government's agenda,  or

the  public bus operators' or MRT operator's request that

such facilities be built.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, misunderstanding No. 2 is that he explained

that fare increases are not to fatten the profits of  bus

companies.   I  beg to differ because I  cannot  see  any

other  reasons.   I cannot recollect any  of  our  public

transport  operators being in deficit, or  close  to  it.

They  have  always  enjoyed good profits  and  they  have

always come back to PTC for fat profits, not to pull them

out of any deficit, or any other serious problem.  In any

event,  as listed companies, they can always go  back  to

the  equity or loan market to raise funds that  they  may

need,  instead of relying on fare increases as  the  sole

source  of raising money for their business.  Let us  not

reward them for their lack of financial creativity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misunderstanding No. 3. It was stated that bus

companies  have huge losses in other business,  and  they

have  attempted  to cover it by fare increases.   He  has

explained this misunderstanding.  I spoke to many  people

and  they are clear in their mind that there is  no  such

misunderstanding, and that this was never an issue in the

debate that has taken place over the last few days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misunderstanding No. 4. He raised the issue whether

PTC  was  uncaring.  He said that PTC indeed was  caring,

and  he highlighted some figures.  He mentioned that  the

average wage has gone up by 136% over 15 years.  CPI  has

gone  up  by  29%,  but the transport fares  have  lagged

behind.  Unfortunately, no data was provided by how  much

it has fallen behind the wage group.  A better comparison

would be to see how much is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>

transport  expenditure  in relation  to  a  Singaporean's

wage  now,  as compared to 15 years ago.  I do not  think

there  would have been a drop.  Indeed, I speculate  that

the  portion  of  transport expenditure would  be  higher

relative  to  one's  ordinary  income,  particularly  the

ordinary wage earner.  Naturally, it leaves one wondering

whether  the  Senior Minister of State has difficulty  in

producing  the  relevant  figures.   I  would  urge   the

Minister to address this issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the role of the PTC, I must say that I

have  great  sympathy  for  the  PTC,  because  they  are

handling a difficult assignment.  How can they be fair to

both  the public transport operators and to the commuters

at  the  same  time?  The parameters  of  their  job  are

defined  by  an  Act of Parliament.  My  colleagues  have

raised  many  issues in relation to the job of  the  PTC,

questions  about the conflict of interests,  whether  the

members  are  qualified to be able to be sitting  in  the

council.  And I would like to add one more issue, whether

the   PTC  has,  in  the  course  of  its  deliberations,

independent studies put up by think-tanks, or  academics,

to  advise  the  PTC, or whether they just  rely  on  the

reports furnished by the bus companies as the sole source

of   reference   and   decision-making.    Perhaps   some

clarification  could  be  given,  both  by  PTC  and  the

Minister to clarify to the public on how they arrived  at

these figures.  Because being a lawyer, I can always  say

that  there are two parts to the argument, and it depends

on  who presents the argument.  If the bus company is the

only company that is able to present the argument, I pity

the PTC because they need additional support and research

from  other  independent researchers,  or  academics,  to

support the PTC in whatever decision that it is going  to

arrive at.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to a wider question, and it is

whether  the  type of competition that we are  having  in

Singapore in the public transport market needs to be  re-looked.  I think it is something that the Minister has to

look  at  the Ministry's level and see whether  there  is

indeed  a call which can be justified to re-look  at  the

type of public transport

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>

operators that we have in Singapore, and not rely on some

consultant's  report  which was made  some  decades  ago.

That  is  the  format  that is being used  in  Singapore.

Considering  the present public transport usage  and  the

type  of market that we have, perhaps it is time  we  re-looked at the whole market itself, and see whether we can

allow for more competition so that we can achieve greater

efficiency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the second part of the

Motion  that deals with the call to ensure that essential

public  services remain affordable, and  that  any  price

increases during this difficult period should be kept  to

the absolute minimum.  In my view, this is where the real

crux  of the debate lies.  Fare increases are the  chosen

rhythm  of  the  day.  The others, like carpark  charges,

utilities,  have been let off lightly.  The wider  debate

is  how  do  we  scrutinise increases  in  the  price  of

essential  services.   While we have  some  mechanism  to

ensure  that some public services are subject  to  market

mechanism  and  competition, not all  are.   Some  public

services  are  in  the hands of the Government,  some  in

autonomous  Government bodies, some in  statutory  boards

and  some in the public sector.  In the public sector,  I

again  applaud  the Ministry of the Environment  for  its

practice  to  call for fresh tenders at the  end  of  the

tender period for refuse collection contractors.  In some

cases,  public bodies, like PTC, or CASE, have a role  to

play.   In  the  case  of some essential  services  being

provided  by the Government, I would urge the  Government

to  ensure that cost recovery should be its policy rather

than profiteering.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many of the cost structures and profit numbers

are not found in the annual budget numbers, it becomes an

impossible  task  for any researcher  to  identify  these

culprits.   I  would  urge  the Government  to  give  the

mandate  to the Auditor-General to look at the Government

agencies  that  provide essential services and  determine

whether  they are operating on a cost recovery or profit-making  basis, and to highlight these cases in its annual

report.  This will provide a good example

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>

of  our Government leading by example where its essential

services  are  scrutinised by an  independent  authority.

Perhaps  CASE,  or  a committee made up  of  the  general

public, can start a list of such essential services to be

scrutinised  by the Auditor-General (AG), and  this  list

should  be made available to the Government for  scrutiny

by  the AG.  This will certainly arrest the trend of some

essential  service providers, including  the  Government,

charging unreasonable fees and charges under the  pretext

that they are affordable to the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whenever a fare increase comes about, or some

increase in fee comes about, the usual words are that  it

is  "affordable to the public".  This argument  is  going

down  less  and less with the public, because  affordable

does  not  mean  it  is  cheap.   It  can  be  cheap  and

affordable but, in many cases, the yardstick that some of

these essential service providers equate is that if it is

affordable, the public can tolerate.  This should not  be

the way in which we price essential services.  The way we

should  price  it  is  that we must  make  it  cheap  and

affordable, not merely affordable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to say that we have

a  duty to ensure that essential services are provided at

reasonable  prices  and  even at  subsidised  rates,  eg,

health, education and sports.  One of the arguments  that

the  Government  has  stated in allowing  some  of  these

public fare increases, or essential service increases, is

that  we  provide  rebates, or we provide  some  form  of

financial  help to the poor by giving them money  in  the

form  of  Singapore bonus shares.  But having  talked  to

many  of  the  people in the poor income bracket,  it  is

basically a shot of ecstasy for a while.  They  take  the

$600, or whatever amount that is given, and spend it, and

that  is  it.  They come back to normal.  So we  have  to

think of a way whereby such amounts are directly going to

help people cope with these increases, if need be, rather

than  giving them one shot and then having them spent  by

the public in one go.  Somebody said to me

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>

that  it is basically a one shot of ecstasy.  After that,

they get high.  Then, the next day, they wake up, and  it

is back to solving the same problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must remind ourselves, at the end of this

debate,  that  the public are like a balloon.   They  can

take  a  fair amount of air pressure and expand, but  too

much  pressure and they will burst.  And burst they  will

one  day,  if  we  do not look after their  interest  and

welfare.  Let us never take the public for granted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Motion.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I rise in support of the Motion put  forth

by  Members  of the House, and I agree with the  eloquent

argument put forth by Mr Tan Soon Khoon.  I feel that the

move  to raise fare prices in this instance was ill-timed

and a misjudgment.  The rationale given for the fare hike

was  one of recovering costs - incurred in terms of wages

given  to  employees  and  in terms  of  maintenance  for

services  - to maintain the respectable profits  for  the

public transport companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, profit is not a dirty word, but when the very

profitable transport companies seek to recover costs from

a  public  that is generally going through a  bad  patch,

that  action, at this point in time, leaves behind a foul

taste  in  the  mouth and cannot be very  palatable.   On

grounds  of  this  principle, I feel that  it  is  not  a

rightly  placed motivation to push for the hikes  in  bus

and MRT fares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a perverse way, however, we also have to say

thank you to this fare hike, because it has brought  into

focus  the role of the listed public transport companies,

the  role of the PTC and the needs and, more importantly,

the  expectations of a more sophisticated commuter today.

This  incident  highlights, in my point  of  view,  these

three main points, and what is also to be appreciated  is

how   this  public  outcry  is  also  a  good  sign  that

Singaporeans do care for others, for whom the pinch hurts

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>

a   bit  more.   These  are  good  signs  of  a  maturing

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the three points: on the role of a

listed   public  transport  company,  I  seek  a  greater

clarification on what is the role for a public  transport

company.   The  issues  related  to  this  question  have

already  been  brought up by the other  speakers:  should

such  companies be just focused on profits?  Should  they

take  a  different  model  or be  restructured?   As  has

already  been suggested, should their services be  opened

up  for  tenders?   Hence this means a re-examination  of

what  is  the  role  and  function  of  public  transport

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is the role of the PTC. At least a third

of  the members in the 14-member Council are either  from

one  of  the  transport  companies or  the  shareholders.

Whether  they  like  it or not, the  perception  is  that

perhaps they could be looking after the interests of  the

organisations they represent, and it could be most unfair

to  them.  It is best then to have a range of members  in

this  Council.  I would like to suggest that some of  the

members  come from the school bus operators, private  bus

companies,  as well as officers from NParks.  NParks  has

been  trying for some time to bring families to its parks

-  and we are family oriented - and it is also trying  to

nurture  a cycling culture within Singapore. It might  be

timely to have their input too in the council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, what is going to be the role of the PTC, if

there  is perhaps no change in the current model  of  how

public  transport companies operate?  How are they  going

to  walk  this fine line between safeguarding the  public

interest  as  well  as  those  of  the  public  transport

companies?   And it is at this point that  I  do  despair

over  the  age-old  debate about providing  services  for

those   who  are  disabled,  especially  those  who   are

wheelchair-bound.  This is an age-old debate, perhaps  as

old  as the 15-year-old PTC.  How are we going to address

this?   We are an aging population.  The North East Line,

when  it  opens, will be ready for those in  wheelchairs,

and yet how seamless are we in this aspect?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>

There  are already retrofitting works going on for  other

MRT lines, but where does the bus fit into this scheme of

seamless  transportation? To outfit buses with  hydraulic

lifts  for  the  wheelchair, as a previous Straits  Times

report shows, can cost about $40 million.  When it  comes

to  providing for such facilities, what then will be  the

role  of  the PTC?  If there is any guiding principle  at

this  point  in  time on how the PTC operates,  then  its

rationalisation to raise the fares for the bus companies,

leaves  me  to fear that bringing in better  systems  for

those  in wheelchairs may take another two decades before

it comes true.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I feel that this current 3- to 5-cent hike - which some cannot understand what the whole fuss is about

-  is a good point at this time to reflect on how we  can

improve  the  role  of  the PTC,  reassess  what  is  the

structure  or  model for public transport  companies,  as

well as, at the same time, understand the Singaporean  of

today better.  To an unemployed Singaporean, 3 to 5 cents

will send shudders.  To the average Singaporean, it means

absorbing  more and more costs.  Here, I  would  like  to

relate a case that happened just last year.  A woman  and

her  daughter walked all the way from Bedok to a hospital

in  the central part of Singapore, because they could not

afford  the  bus  fares.   Thankfully,  the  mother   and

daughter  have been helped since, through the  very  same

schemes  that Minister Mah Bow Tan brought up  yesterday.

Even  as we help those who cannot afford to pay for their

transport,  let us not forget that the money  comes  from

donations   from   the  public,  and   from   MCDS-funded

programmes, which again comes from the taxpayer.  So,  it

is  not  so  easy to dismiss this concern for  those  who

cannot  afford  to  pay for public  transport  by  citing

available financial assistance schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above three main reasons, I think the Motion

is a good one.

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise in support of the Motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of the speakers before me have already

expressed the unhappiness

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>

of  the  public transport users and their  plight.   They

have  also  pointed  out correctly that  many  are  upset

because of a slew of increases that will take place  over

the next six months.  This unhappiness is exacerbated  by

the  uncertainties that workers face as retrenchments  by

companies will surely continue for the rest of  the  year

and even up to early next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Government warns us that more jobs will be

lost - and the 5% unemployment rate is hanging over us  - a  call  to be austere by the Government further  ignites

the  anger  of our people as a slew of charges  comes  on

stream.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the PTC is entrusted with the

important  and,  as  we have seen, a  difficult  task  of

striking  a balance between safeguarding public  interest

and ensuring the financial viability of operators, and we

have  heard the comment on viability by our hon.  Member,

Mr  Tan Soo Khoon, yesterday.  I join in the call  by  my

hon.  colleagues who spoke before me to urge the  PTC  to

consider  in its fare increases to tip the scale  towards

safeguarding the public interest to achieve  the  balance

it  first  set  out to do.  Whether in  reality  or  not,

people  are  not  convinced that the PTC has  represented

their  interest.  Together with the stream  of  increases

from other bodies, the unhappiness is understandable.  We

hope  that  the  PTC will communicate the plight  of  the

commuters to the transport companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague, Mr Ravindran, pointed out just

now  that affordability may not be cheap.  If we look  at

affordability  - this is my perspective - at  any  single

increase,  we  can say whether it is affordable  or  not.

But  when  we put a slew of increases, affordability  for

each  in totality means I cannot afford for most of these

essential services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the points raised that the

Government is uncaring and not listening to the people, I

do not think so.  What I think the Government did not do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>

well  enough  is  perhaps that it might  have  painted  a

clearer  enough picture of why the increases have  to  be

made  now.  If this had been done, there might  not  have

been  so  much nitpicking, irritation and anger over  the

increases.   Yes, I do feel that some of these increases,

especially the bus fare increase, are ill timed.  With  a

little  less  profit, I am sure the company can  make  it

through another year or so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport companies have to realise that revenue

gains  will  probably  not increase  at  the  rates  like

before.   Commuters  will have to  realise  that  capital

equipment,  such  as  buses  and  systems,  needs  to  be

replaced, and these investments cost money.  Without such

replacements  and upgrades, the benchmark service  levels

that   Singaporeans  think  nothing  of,  will   not   be

maintained, let alone improve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why this unhappiness? I think the PTC, the

transport companies and the Government bodies did a  poor

job  in  enlisting  our  people in seeing  the  rationale

behind the slew of increases and the timing of it.   Only

when  an  uproar occurred did "justifications" come  out.

Yes, let me tell you that a Member doing explanations  of

justifications at block visits and grassroots  events  is

quite  a sight.  How else could we have explained to  the

commuters?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I sat here looking at these wonderful plasma

screens, probably the first in the world, I remember  the

times going to a movie at Lido Cinema where a seat  at  a

stall cost us $2.50, and a circle seat $4.  When the  new

generation  cinemas began operating, the price  of  movie

tickets  was  double  what people were  used  to  paying.

Cinema-goers were crying foul.  Double the price?  I will

stay  home  and watch the videos.  Today, with  DVDs  and

VCDs in most homes, going to the movies is still a treat.

People  have  come  to  enjoy the state-of-the-art  sound

system,  the  comfortable  seats,  the  screens  and  the

picture  quality  that the extra  $4  get  them.   Making

movies today is also much more expensive.  I do not think

the  people will go to the cinema for $4 now for a  movie

in  the  old cinemas, even if one can be found today.   A

trip to a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>

movie  now  will  cost  us $8, and that  is  without  the

popcorn and soft drinks.  Let us learn to explain  things

so that people can make sense of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bus companies have set a benchmark that

Singaporeans have become used to.  Service standards  can

and should get better.  It does not make sense to say now

that  we  can  wait  and we do not mind  waiting  for  30

minutes instead of 15 minutes, like we used to, because I

cannot take the 3-cent increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Parliament opened with a

cautionary  Address  from the President  and,  since  the

Budget, Singaporeans have been advised to be austere with

an  uncertain economic backdrop.  As the economy seems to

be headed for some recovery, the longer term outlook will

still see companies making less revenues and not at rates

of  increases as before.  This is a global phenomenon for

most  companies,  whether or not it  is  in  a  regulated

transport environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are seeing many companies buttoning down

their  hatches and booking their profits early, employing

their  profits  to secure cheaper capital,  restructuring

their  balance  sheets, and making  changes  to  position

themselves,  so that they can operate profitably  in  the

face  of  lower  revenues down the  road.   I  think  the

transport companies are no different here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP Government's idea of seamless transportation

goes  beyond what the transport companies tell us, and  I

have some additional comments to add to the point made by

Ms  Braema.   What  do I mean?  Let  me  relate  this  to

Members.  When I was going to school in a university town

at  Eugene, Oregon, I signed out a wheelchair for half  a

day.   With a clipboard in hand, I went to various  parts

of  the  university and to the town, and one of them  was

the   local  library.   Although  the  objective  of  the

exercise was to understand how a wheelchair-bound  person

would  feel accessing buildings, I was amazed by the  bus

ride  that I took.  The bus platform lowered for  me  for

the wheelchair to be on, a single bus driver

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>

de-bused,  helped me strap in and went on its  way.   So,

going  down the road, this seamless transport would  come

into play.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP Government has led the HDB upgrading

programme  and, as we can see, there is a ramping  up  of

the  construction of access ramps from bus stops  to  HDB

precincts,  and from carparks to linkways to HDB  blocks.

The  objective  of  Barrier Free  Access  (BFA)  for  HDB

dwellers  is a long-range idea.  It is a long-range  plan

to  give  our  aging population BFA all the  way  to  the

buses.   This is the PAP Government's idea of  long-range

planning of caring.  Not caring for the people?  I do not

think so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, in the future, I am sure that the reasons

for increases in the bus fares, as Ms Braema pointed out,

would  even include the cost of providing buses that  can

accommodate the increasing number of people going  around

in  wheelchairs.  The Government is not caring?   Clearly

not!   Perhaps  a poor way of showing it  -  that  it  is

listening.  But not caring and not listening?  I  do  not

think so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the PAP Government had garnered

support  from  our  people, and we  have  together  built

Singapore to what it is today.  Our people face difficult

times, and the decisions made by the Government then  had

great implications on whether we survived as a nation  or

not.  This will not change.  The PAP Government had never

succumbed to pressures and never went the way of populist

policies,  however  difficult politically  it  was.   The

resolve  to  carry the nation and to implement  unpopular

policies  in  order  that we make it,  despite  political

costs,   shows   what   kind  of  Government   this   is.

Globalisation  has  set in motion a  shake-out  not  only

global  businesses have to deal with, but governments  of

the  day  would have to address.  What we do during  this

shake-out, and the kind of resolve we have to change  and

put  on  new  armour for a different kind of  fight,  has

bearings for our social and economic structures down  the

road.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am comforted by Minister Mah's and Minister Khaw's

acknowledgement that the Government needs to  respond  to

the  calls by the people and to see their plight. I  hope

that  the Government will do a better job of showing that

it has listened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope not just the PTC but the

respective Government bodies responsible for the slew  of

charges in fee increases will explain the rationale in  a

way  that  people  can understand and, most  importantly,

explain  the timing for such increases, and consider  the

economic  plight of its users.  I hope that  Singaporeans

can unite during these difficult times and to move on and

brace  themselves  for  the  greater  challenges  on  the

horizon.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Ser Miang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I wish to

declare   my   interest  as  a  Director  of   the   SMRT

Corporation.  I also add that I no longer own any  shares

in any of the public transport companies since the merger

of MRT and TIBS in December 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I join this debate not to defend the public

transport  operators, but with a hope to give a different

perspective to the issue, so that a more balanced view on

both sides of the coin would be considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I empathise with the commuting

public,  who  are affected by the recent  round  of  fare

increases.  Fare adjustment not merely has its  financial

implications,  but it is also an emotive  issue.   In  an

article  in  Shin Min Daily, a writer angrily  complained

that his "chwee kueh" has increased from $1 to $1.20. And

the owner told this writer that the increase was a result

of  the  recent fare increase.  So we can see how emotive

things can get.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the other hand, I also empathise with the

Public Transport Council which, as some Members have also

pointed  out,  has the unenviable task of  balancing  the

interests  of the commuting public with the need  of  the

public  transport operators to remain financially  viable

in order to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>

provide the required standard of service.  The nature  of

public transport service is such that it is characterised

by   huge   capital   investments,  high   manpower   and

substantial  energy or fuel cost.  For  example,  in  the

case  of  SMRT,  it  has fixed assets of  $1.38  billion,

including   those   of  TIBS.   On  high   manpower   and

substantial  energy  or  fuel  costs,  in  the  case   of

Singapore,  wage bill for bus operators is about  50%  of

total  operating  cost,  and  40%  for  train  operators.

Transport  workers, who provide 365 days of service,  and

almost round-the-clock service on a daily basis, have  to

be  appropriately remunerated and motivated in  order  to

provide  good  service  to commuters.   They  too  expect

yearly  adjustment and incentives, so that they  will  be

within  range of their fellow workers.  Some have  argued

that, in difficult times such as this, probably transport

workers  should  also moderate their  expectations.   But

this  is  very much more of the condition in  the  labour

market.    Not  many  realise,  for  example,  that   bus

companies  face perennial difficulties in recruiting  and

retaining  bus  crews.  Singaporeans shun  this  kind  of

work, finding it tough and the working hours unearthly  - waking  up at 4 o'clock to do the first shift, and  going

home  at  3  o'clock in the morning when they finish  the

last  shift.  They find the pay not attractive, as it  is

not  commensurate with the type of hardship they have  to

endure.  Their work is seldom appreciated by others,  and

they have to face complaints of commuters who have higher

demands,  and higher and higher expectations. Whether  in

good  times  or bad, bus companies have to pay attractive

salaries to attract and retain workers, so that they  can

continue with their operation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Transport Council, the body responsible

for regulating public transport service and approving bus

fares,  has  a thankless job to do.  It has to  face  the

wrath  of  public  opinion  whenever  there  is  a   fare

adjustment, and also the unhappiness of public  transport

operators, who usually do not find the approved increases

meet  the needs of what they have justified.  Whether  in

good  times or bad, there are always complaints  on  fare

adjustments.  And we can all understand

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>

that it is more so during difficult times, such as now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to add that the record does show,

for  example,  that during the last 10-year  period  from

1992-2001,  PTC approved a total of 11.7% for train  fare

increase  and 13.7% for bus fare increase.  The  consumer

price  index went up 13.3%, while real wage increased  by

53%  and nominal wage increased by 68% over the same  10-year period. The fare increase approved by PTC could  not

cover wage and other operating cost increases.  Operators

had  to  find  other  means  to increase  revenue,  adopt

vigorous productivity improvements to make ends meet, and

to   have   reasonable  profits  to   keep   shareholders

satisfied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think there was very much argument on

reasonable  returns  to  transport  operators  and  their

shareholders. The nature of these companies is also  such

that  investors  find  that they are  really  similar  to

utilities  stock.   In  the case of  SMRT,  they  gave  a

dividend  yield of 4.12%, and for SBS, 4.24%,  which  are

very  much in line with market expectations.  So, we  can

see from the last round of fare increases that there were

no big movements in their share prices, a reflection that

it  is  very  much  in  line  with  market  expectations.

Shareholders who invest in these companies  also  do  not

expect  exciting share price movements like those in  the

technology industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only fair to say that PTC has done a good job

in keeping public transport fares within the range of the

CPI, and substantially below that of real wage increases,

making it affordable to commuters.  At the same time,  it

did  not allow automatic fare increases and ensured  that

operators  earned their keep through better productivity.

Sir,  I  believe  that  the work of  the  PTC  should  be

recognised by this House and that they should be  allowed

to continue with their work without interference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some have suggested that having representatives

of  public transport operators on the Council  is  not  a

good

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>

idea,  as  it  may give a wrong perception,  even  though

these   representatives  do  not   take   part   in   the

deliberations on fare increases and they have  absolutely

no say in approving fare increases.  On the other hand, I

am  not  sure whether it is a good idea to exclude  them,

because  the  Public  Transport Council  does  more  than

approving  fare  increases.  I do not know  whether  this

Council should become an authority, or whether it  should

be  a  partnership  between the Council  and  the  public

transport  operators,  so that it  could  look  into  the

various aspects of public transport, so that services can

be improved and costs can be contained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really a thankless job to do. There are

suggestions  to include other representatives,  and  even

Members of this House.  I am not sure whether there would

be many volunteers rushing for this job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the Public Transport Council

must  continue  to  be stringent when dealing  with  fare

adjustments.  Public transport operators must continue to

improve productivity and contain costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How best do we then deal with fare adjustments when

they become necessary?  Sir, there were suggestions that,

if public transport service is not provided by commercial

enterprise,  then perhaps there could be  lower  cost  to

them.   But, Sir, if the cost of capital is not  provided

by shareholders and, therefore, the required profit and a

reasonable return, then it has to be provided  by  loans,

which also have interest cost.  So, either way, the  cost

factor would always be there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not a practical solution to allow only

fare  increases when the economy is doing  well,  as  the

need  to  adjust fares may not coincide with the economic

cycle.   Looking for such windows could lead to irregular

and  hefty fare increases that are more painful.  Second-guessing the economic cycle could also catch PTC  on  the

wrong  foot  and  force  PTC to approve  hefty  increases

during  a downturn, which is hardly acceptable.  It  also

means   that   the  profitability  of  public   transport

operators

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>

would deteriorate over time and surge or spike when there

is  a fare increase, a situation that is not satisfactory

to  their shareholders, and transport operators will find

it   difficult  to  do  good  financial  management   and

planning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance, the recommendation of the Cost Review

Committee in 1997 for a small increase on a regular basis

is  a  better solution.  The advantage is that it is less

painful  and disruptive to the commuters.  Using the  10-year  period of 1992-2001 again as an illustration, train

fares  went  up 11.7% before fare adjustment during  this

period, ranging from 0.22% to 6.42%; 2.19% in 1994; 6.42%

in 1995; 0.22% in 1997 and 2.23% in the year 2000.  If we

do  regular small increases on a yearly basis, it amounts

to  a  small fare adjustment of 1.17%, which, I  believe,

would  be  more acceptable, and it avoids  the  need  for

deferring  fare adjustments until such time that  it  may

not be acceptable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For public transport operators, it means more

certainty  in financial planning, the ability  to  better

plan  for  capital expenditure and investment.  It  would

also  smoothen the earnings of public transport operators

and  avoid  spikes  in  earnings,  which,  if  taken   in

isolation,  may be misinterpreted as obscene  profits  or

unacceptable windfalls.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is never easy to find simple solutions to

complex public transport issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about 4 million passenger trips are made on

buses  and  trains each day.  The commuters using  public

transport   range  from  workers  to  senior  executives,

students,   housewives,   to  senior   citizens.    Their

preference   and  requirements  range  from  very   basic

transport  service, and some would say they do  not  want

airconditioning in buses, to the high end  business-class

type  of  service.  Their tolerance to fares also differs

substantially.  To make each and every commuter satisfied

is  really a daunting task.  It is unlike airlines  where

they  can  have  differentiation in type  of  services  - having first

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>

class,  business  class, economy class  -  and  therefore

charging  different  fares  for  them.   In  our   public

transport service, we can only have one class  fare.   So

whatever changes will affect everyone, across the board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members spoke about no-frill service. Over the

years,  in  tandem with the progress of our economy,  and

with  a  higher  standard of living, expectations  for  a

better  public transport service have also become higher.

For   better   comfort  of  passengers,   we   introduced

airconditioned  service.  For safety and  convenience  of

commuters, we introduced low floorboard buses.  For clean

environment,  we  introduced Euro  1,  and  now  Euro  2,

engines.   These add up to cost.  For those who will  not

want  to wait longer for bus services, they demand higher

frequency.   For  those  who  wish  to  have  convenience

service,   they  ask  for  more  services,  more   direct

services, and higher frequencies.  And some of these  new

services  may not be economical to run.  And if they  are

not happy with it, they go to the MPs, and MPs will write

to  the  public  transport operators.   If  MPs  are  not

satisfied, they will complain to the Minister.  So,  Sir,

these  uneconomical services and higher frequencies  that

people  expect  also add to cost.  Can we  not  say  that

these are frills?  Would people accept non-airconditioned

service?  Would we want to go back to the days where - we

would  not  talk about rickety buses - buses with  higher

steps  so  that it is a bit more dangerous to our  senior

citizens and ladies going to work in high heels  find  it

very inconvenient?  I do not think that that is accepted.

And,  even  if we want to do it now, the cost  of  public

transport  service  cannot be  changed  overnight.   From

1980,  when  the  cost of the bus ranged around  $70,000-$80,000,  it  is now $270,000.  So, even if  we  want  to

change these buses, it cannot be done overnight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I suggest that for issues like this, we should

really  be  looking at it on a more balanced  basis,  and

perhaps  seek  a  long-term  view.   Close  collaboration

between  LTA,  PTC  and  public  transport  operators  is

definitely  required  to contain cost.   I  believe  that

commuters must also be brought into this and make them a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>

partner  of  this  scheme, to decide on the  standard  of

service required and therefore the related cost, so  that

when   adjustments  are  to  be  made,  they  can  better

understand  why these changes are needed  and  why  these

adjustments  are  made.  In difficult  times  like  this,

sometimes it is really difficult to explain to those  who

are  affected financially.  But I think it is  gratifying

to learn in this House that Government has made sure that

those  who are badly hit are being provided for.   So,  I

think  it is now up to us really to have a good reasoning

on this round of fare increases and try to explain to our

constituents  so  that they can also understand,  perhaps

not fully accept, why it has to be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch upon one other issue,

that of cycling, as brought up by Ms Irene Ng.  I declare

my  interest as Chairman of the Singapore Sports Council.

Sir, I think it is a good idea, and I think cycling is  a

good  sport  that  we  should promote.   But  creating  a

cycling  lane  is not a good solution, as it  would  also

take up road space.  One example is China.  China has 700

million  cyclists and now the authorities  are  having  a

hard time trying to do away with cycling lanes, and I  do

not think we should really be going in that direction.  I

would suggest that more park connectors be built so  that

cycling can be promoted as a healthy exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I oppose the Motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, thank you for

allowing  me  to  join  in this debate.   We  are  amidst

difficult  times.   And, like my fellow  Members  of  the

House,  I understand and feel the distress of the  people

over price increases that raise the cost of living.  I am

glad for this Motion, for it provides an opportunity  for

many  of  us to reflect the concerns of our constituents.

As  we saw yesterday, and no doubt, we will see today  as

well,  my colleagues do quickly seize the opportunity  to

express their views and to reflect the sentiments on  the

ground.   My  residents have also expressed to  me  their

concerns and unhappiness over various increases,  and  in

particular,  the  recent transport  fare  increase.   The

sentiment of the people is clear.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I appreciate the Motion before the House for

providing  the opportunity to discuss the  issue  of  the

recent  transport fare increases, I do not agree with  it

in  its entirety.  First, the Motion reflected the  Prime

Minister's appreciation of 17th June that this is not the

best time to increase fares.  However, the Prime Minister

at  the  same  occasion also said that the  principle  of

small increases is right.  This was left out.  This is an

important  omission and I felt ought to be corrected,  so

that  the first statement by the Prime Minister is placed

in its proper and complete context.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, as noted by several colleagues who spoke

earlier,  the  PTC  is  a  body  set  up  by  Parliament,

specifically   to   make   decisions   regarding   public

transport.   It has performed its duties, and  unless  we

are  convinced  that it is derelict in carrying  out  its

duties,  I wonder if it is wise for the House to  require

it  to review a specific decision that it made, with  the

purpose  of  getting  it  to  change  its  mind  on  this

decision.   Sir,  with  this in  mind,  I  am  moving  an

amendment  to the Motion before the House.  I have  taken

the liberty to ask the Clerk of Parliament to make copies

of  this  amendment,  which I  would  like  to  ask  your

permission to be distributed to the Members of the House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right. The Clerk will distribute

the   notice   of   amendment.   [Copies   of   amendment

distributed  to  hon.  Members.]   Could  you  move  your

amendment, Dr Tan?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, I beg to move the amendment

as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In line 3, to leave out the word "and";

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In line 5, after the word "fares", to insert

the  words, "and noting his support for the principle  of

Public Transport Council granting small increases"; and

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In lines 5 and 6, to leave out the words, "to

review  its decision on the increase in public  transport

fares",  and  there to insert the words, "when  reviewing

requests  for  fare increases, to take into consideration

relevant  factors  such  as  the  affordability  of   the

commuters  and  the  viability of  the  public  transport

operators.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is really no good time to increase fares.

Nobody likes to pay more,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>

even  if  one  can  afford it.  It is in  the  nature  of

things.   However, I agree with PM and my fellow Members,

who  have spoken earlier, that this is not the best  time

to  increase fares.  The economy is down, many are out of

job  and  the  future is still uncertain,  though  it  is

beginning to brighten up.  If my income were reduced  and

uncertain, I would certainly wish that the cost of living

would  not rise, and even hope that it would be  reduced.

Hence,  where  expenditure can be deferred to  keep  cost

and,  hence, fares down, it should be done.   But,  alas,

life  does not stop just because the economy is bad.   It

continues.   So some costs continue to rise - maintenance

must  be  carried out, old equipment need to be replaced,

and  new  equipment need to be purchased, if we  want  to

continue  to have a good public transport system.   Fares

may  thus need to rise for all these necessary activities

to  be carried out.  So, even in difficult times, as now,

we  have  also to think of the future.  For  what  we  do

today  affect  the lives of our children  tomorrow.   The

decisions  that  bus  companies make  to-day  affect  the

services  they can deliver tomorrow.  What  sort  of  bus

services  do our children deserve?  And what do we  leave

them with?  So, while the Prime Minister agreed that this

is   not  the  best  time  to  increase  fares,  he  also

recognised the need to increase fares to enable  critical

activities that must be carried out if we are to maintain

the  viability of the public transport system.   He  thus

supports increases in small steps that are affordable and

less painful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall past instances, other than transport fares,

when  delay and reluctance deferred price increases until

the  inevitable.   When the prices  were  increased,  the

increases were large, and were very painful.  There  were

then  calls  for increases in small steps, to occur  more

frequently, so as to spread out the pain.  This  is  what

is  being  done  now - a small increase in  fares.   But,

alas, our memory is short.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of fare increase is inherently a

situation  of  conflict.  The public  dislikes  fares  to

increase, but public

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>

transport   operators   need   it   to   remain   viable.

Parliament,  in its wisdom has delegated this  unenviable

task  of approving fare increases to the Public Transport

Council.   In  the debate on the PTC Bill  in  1987,  the

House  made  it clear to the PTC that they must  consider

both  the welfare of the people and the viability of  the

bus  companies,  to  ensure the availability  of  a  good

public transport system in the long term interest of  the

people.   As I said earlier, this situation is inherently

conflicting.  To carry out the difficult task of the PTC,

able,  capable,  fair-minded and honourable  people  were

appointed  to  the  Council.   Hence,  since  1987,  fare

increases have come before the PTC.  But, today, there is

a  Motion before this House asking the PTC to review  its

decision  on the recent fare increases.  We are  treading

on  uncomfortable, if not dangerous, water.  We formed  a

body and delegated to it responsibilities.  The body  has

discharged  its responsibilities, and we are  questioning

its decision in public, with the intention of getting  it

to  change its mind.  The public and the world will  look

at this House and wonder if we made good, well-considered

decisions,  and  abide by them.  The  question  would  be

asked, is this House to be trusted?  People who are asked

to  assume  positions in our institutions will wonder  if

their decisions would be appreciated and supported.  They

will  ask whether they will be abandoned when the  goings

get  tough.   We  must  be  very wary  of  demeaning  our

institutions.  We must not sacrifice our institutions for

expediency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should carefully study the explanation given

by  the  PTC  for  approving the fare  increase.   If  we

believe  that they had done the work fairly and properly,

we  should courageously support its decision and take  on

the  more difficult and unpleasant task of explaining and

convincing our people of the correctness of the decision.

It is easier to support popular decisions than to support

decisions that are right, but painful.  But for the long-term  interest of the country and people, we must do what

is right and good.  I personally believe that with regard

to  the  fare increases, including the current one,  that

have come before the PTC, it has dutifully performed  the

task delegated

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>

to  it by Parliament, within the framework and guidelines

established.   I would like to quote what Mr  Eric  Gwee,

Chairman  of  PTC,  said in regard  to  the  decision  to

approve the recent fare increases:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In reviewing the application by SBS, TIBS and SMRT,

PTC  tried to balance the need of public interest  to  be

safeguarded and for public transport operators to  remain

financially viable.  This year, the PTC has improved  the

process  of  scrutinising the bus  and  train  operators'

accounts  and  financial performance.  PTC  is  satisfied

that  the operators have been prudent in containing costs

and  that they have not been profiteering at the  expense

of our commuters."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the sentiment of the other Boon Wan in the

House,  when  he said yesterday that, "There  is  nothing

wrong in criticising the decision of the PTC.  They  have

a  difficult job of balancing the long-term interests  of

commuters   and   the   short-term   effects   on   them.

Inevitably,  judgment has to be made.  We  can  certainly

disagree  with  PTC's judgment, as honest  people  would.

But we cannot fault them for not being diligent."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge the PTC to always remember that its role

is  both  important and sensitive and that it must  carry

out    its    duties   conscientiously,   properly    and

professionally, within the terms and reference that  have

been set for it, so that the public will continue to have

confidence in its decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I also urge the Government to take

heed  of  the feedback provided by Members of this  House

during this debate and from the people.  Please listen to

us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I seek the support of the House on the

amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you  for  allowing me to join in this debate.  I rise  in

support  of  the motion that has just been moved  by  the

Member for Ang Mo Kio GRC, Dr Tan Boon Wan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It injects a note of balance, a note of

circumspection, to this debate which is warranted,  given

the  heat  that has been generated in this House  in  the

course  of the last day-and-a-half of debates.  Allow  me

to elaborate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, I was moved significantly by Mr Tan and

Dr  Tan's impassioned plea on behalf of Singaporeans  and

commuters  on  why  these fare increases  are  ill-timed,

unwelcome  and inconvenient.  But, having  said  that,  I

also  want  to say that my personal experience with  this

has  been  the same.  I have received a lot  of  feedback

from constituents and others on this increase and why  it

is  not  welcomed.   The  timing is  part  of  an  unholy

confluence   of   factors   -   economic   downturn   and

retrenchments.  At this time, a fare increase for  buses,

no matter how small, is, in a sense, the proverbial straw

that breaks the camel's back.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, even as this House has the responsibility

to  voice the concerns of Singaporeans and address  those

issues  in  a  comprehensive way,  we  equally  have  the

obligation  to  ensure  that the debate  encompasses  the

total  perspective  of the issue.  I think  the  wave  of

public   opinion   is   great  in  this   debate.    Many

Singaporeans are agitated about this.  But it would be  a

disservice  to  the quality of the debate and  the  final

policy or conclusion we draw if we were to only focus  on

that aspect of this issue.  In the course of this debate,

the  terms  "fair  and reasonable" have cropped  up  many

times.  And, indeed, I think all of us would like  to  be

fair   and  reasonable  and  be  seen  to  be  fair   and

reasonable.  But the question, I suppose, is "fair"  from

whose   point   of  view  and  "reasonable"   from   what

perspective?   Let  me try to broaden the  perspective  a

little to show what I mean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am looking at it from the perspective of the

company, and here I would like to make a declaration.   I

am  an  employee of Temasek Holdings, which  is  a  major

shareholder of SMRT, but I have no direct interest in any

of  the  public  transport operators.   Is  SMRT  such  a

laggard in comparison to similar companies, ie, transport

operators, in other parts of the world?  Yesterday, there

was  a very sharp contrast drawn between SMRT and MTR  in

Hong Kong.  Mr Tan Soo Khoon gave us many examples of why

MTR  in  Hong  Kong  was  such  an  innovative  transport

operator, introducing many interesting dimensions to  its

service.   If I recall correctly, some examples were:  if

one  takes 10 rides, then he gets a free lunch or a  free

dinner.  And, also, when a new line was introduced, there

was  no  fare increase.  In fact, it was a fare decrease.

So  why  can  the SMRT not be like that?  Indeed,  I  was

quite  troubled and puzzled by that, and I  thought  this

warrants a little bit more investigation.  So, I dug up a

little more data on this.  It is interesting.  As always,

there  is no such thing as a free lunch, and let me  tell

Members why.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTR is actually better described as a property

company than a transport

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>

company.  It owns the land above its stations and  around

its  stations.   70-80% of MTR's profits  come  from  its

property  business,  not related to  its  rail  business.

What does that mean?  MTR has to promote ridership on its

lines.   Why?   Because that is what  will  increase  the

value  of  its  main  business,  which  is  the  property

business.   And  MTR will therefore cross-subsidise  from

its  property business to the rail business.  Indeed,  we

could infer that this is what is happening here.  Is that

a  right business strategy?  Probably from MTR's point of

view,  yes,  because, overall, it is able to continue  to

improve  its  profitability.  But the analogy  with  SMRT

then is perhaps unfair, because SMRT, by comparison, is a

pure  transport  operator.  90% of SMRT's  revenue  comes

from the train, bus and taxi type services, and 70-80% of

its  profits comes from the same business.  So the  exact

reverse,  if  you like, of what MTR has.  SMRT  has  very

little  scope  to cross-subsidise.  There is  nothing  to

cross-subsidise  from.  Really, at the end  of  day,  the

only  return it gets is from its fares, and  just  to  be

complete,  with  a little bit of rental  and  advertising

income of about 10%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next question, from a broader perspective,

is:  Is  SMRT profiteering?  It is a listed company.   Is

the  company rewarding its shareholders unfairly?  Again,

I  think  it  was the Non-Constituency Member,  Mr  Steve

Chia,  who  raised this question rather rhetorically,  if

not  theatrically: "Isn't making more  than  $50  million

profit enough?"  That is a good question.  Let us look at

the issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of investment product or share is SMRT

share?   Think  about it.  The growth prospects  of  this

company   are  very  constrained.   Ridership  and   fare

increases are the only real factors that would drive  its

top  line growth.  I do not want to talk like an analyst,

but  since  we  have  totted up  a  lot  of  figures  and

financial  data,  I think we need to  look  at  these  in

totality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best proxy for growth in this company is really

population growth, which means, at best, it is going to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>

achieve  2-3%.   In  fact, last year,  SMRT  achieved,  I

think,  0.6% growth, in fact, lower than you would  think

to be the average.  So this is not a company whose stocks

you  buy  because you expect this wild run in  its  share

price,  because it is going to become very  valuable  and

you get capital appreciation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another dimension to this. SMRT is like

any transport company whose fare structures are regulated

and  have  a regulatory risk because, at the end  of  the

day,  the  revenue  is affected fundamentally  by  policy

decisions.  I do not think I need to belabour  the  point

about  the  regulatory risk because the  debate  in  this

House on the fare increase is ample evidence of what that

risk is all about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, why invest in SMRT shares? What is the benefit?

If you ask fund managers or financial analysts, they will

tell  you  that  it  is what you call a  counter-cyclical

defensive stock.  What does it mean?  Basically, it is  a

nice  stock to have in your portfolio, so that when  your

tech  stocks  are  bombing out,  all  those  high  growth

stories are now fizzling out, you still have some  stocks

in  your  portfolio that continue to offer you a low  but

steady  growth  rate and a decent rate of return,  either

through  dividend  pay-outs or from  very  small  capital

appreciation.   It  is  a kind of stock  where  when  the

economy goes up, it will not go up as fast.  But when the

economy  goes  down, it will not go down as fast  either.

That  is  the value of stocks like this, low beta stocks.

So, it is not a stock you hold for capital appreciation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to look at SMRT shares, in July 2000

when it was listed, its price was 61 cents, and yesterday

when I checked, it was about 68-68.5 cents.  It is not  a

fantastic growth.  At the end of day, it is the  dividend

yield  that  it will pay.  So, are they profiteering  and

rewarding  the  shareholders  unfairly?   What   is   the

dividend  yield of SMRT?  The current dividend  yield  is

4.1%, and this 4.1% is gross of tax.  It is gross, before

you take into account tax.  So, if you are on the top tax

bracket,  you  have to knock off another  20-odd  percent

after  tax  under the new tax regime, or  lower  for  the

lower tiers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us compare that 4.1% dividend yield with some

less  risky products.  For 10-year Government bonds,  the

yield  is 3.5%.  If you look at the LTA bonds, the  yield

is 3.7%.  So, when you compare that with what SMRT shares

give as a dividend yield, is it that unreasonable for the

risk  that  the shareholders have to bear?  We  can  also

compare  this  dividend  yield with  utilities  companies

around  the world - US, Japan, UK, etc.  Because, let  us

face  it, it is an international market, you do  not  put

money  in SMRT, you can put it in the same kind of  stock

elsewhere in the world.  The interesting result  is  that

the  range for dividend yields for utilities counters  is

between 3.5-6.5%.  That means SMRT's dividend yield  rate

is  not  exorbitant.  It is within the  industry's  norms

and, if anything, at the lower end of the industry range.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there were a lot of other points that can be

raised on the financial front.  I do not want to go  into

that  and  a  lot of details now.  But why  go  into  all

these?   Why  this  financial  comparison?   What  is  so

important  about it?  SMRT is a listed company.   We  can

debate  the  merits of whether it is good to have  public

transport operators as listed companies or not, but  that

is  a  separate  issue.  We should not  vilify  a  listed

company  which is basically competing in the  market  not

just  with  other  operators and  so  on,  but  also  for

investor  funds.  If you want to continue  to  invest  in

improvements  to  rolling stock  and  other  innovations,

there  are only two sources of funding, either the profit

you  make in your internal financing, or you get it  from

outside,  equity or debt.  And if they do not  achieve  a

reasonable  rate of return and offer a reasonable  yield,

who  is  going to put money in SMRT?  Mr Ravindran  says,

"Well, if they do not get it, they can go and raise money

outside  by  issuing shares."  But the question  is,  who

will  subscribe to those shares?  Because, at the end  of

the  day, the comparison will be made on an international

basis.  So, we have to be realistic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not defending the fare increase per se. But in

the heat of the discussion and argument, let us not throw

the baby out with the bath-water and start vilifying

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>

institutions and companies unfairly.  I was reflecting on

this last night.  If SMRT's profitability goes down, then

we  will  have another debate in this House saying,  "You

see,  this is the GLC that is under performing."   And  I

know many Members of this House would champion that line.

If  SMRT's  profitability goes up, there will be  another

line, precisely along what we are talking about, that  it

is making money at the expense of Singaporeans.  So it is

a no-win situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ultimately, if we pursue this kind of logic, it

is  not  going  to be helpful for Singapore, Singaporeans

or,  for  that  matter, our transport companies  and  our

transport system.  So, I was trying to inject that  sense

of  reality,  just to create a balance in  the  thinking.

Let  us  not get carried away without some reflection  on

the broader issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would say that the amendment to the Motion

that  has  been  moved is a fair one.   It  balances  the

issues, and the Member has pointed out clearly why he  is

doing  so.  I have been thinking about whether we  should

really be asking PTC to review its decision.  Let me tell

Members that the best thing that can happen now is,  yes,

for  the fares to be reduced, or restored to the original

position.   I  think all of us would be very happy  about

that.  It is an easy decision.  The question is: is  that

the  right  decision?  Dr Tan Boon Wan has elaborated  on

the  point, and I would just reinforce it.  The first  is

the  issue  of  the integrity of the  PTC.   We  need  to

distinguish between the process and the outcome.  We  may

not like the outcome, fine.  But you do not undermine the

process  unnecessarily.   Let us  go  back,  revisit  the

process  that led to this outcome and see how it  can  be

improved.  But once we start tinkering with everything at

the same time, we create uncertainty in people's minds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would any self-respecting individual want to

serve  on  the PTC, if the concerted view of the  PTC  is

subject to parliamentary review, Executive review,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>

public  opinion  review, and so on,  and  then  they  are

forced to recant?  Where is the credibility when the next

time  they  make an announcement, whether it  is  a  fare

reduction or fare increase?  How would they defend  their

position?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other part is the message we would send if we do

compel  this fare reduction after it has been  announced.

It  goes  to  the heart of the issue of how we  would  be

perceived as a country, and a system within which  to  do

business.   If we have capricious changes in  policy,  or

specific policy decision, because of this sort of  public

opinion, then I think the regulatory risk premium, that I

talked  about  earlier,  would  go  up  significantly  in

Singapore.  But does that mean we do nothing?  I  am  not

saying that.  And I do not want to be misinterpreted.   I

think  there is a lot we can do.  But the amendment  that

has  been moved by the Member which says, first, it drops

the   need   for   the   PTC  to  review   its   specific

recommendation, and instead focuses on the process where,

in making its decision, it takes into account all factors

and,  in  particular, viability of the operators and  the

affordability  of  the  commuters.   That   is   a   more

productive, long-term solution that this House should  be

endorsing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that score, in terms of the process, a lot has

been said about what we can do to improve and change, and

I  offer  a  few suggestions.  On the composition,  I  do

believe  that  the  PTC's composition  can  be  improved.

Whilst  having public transport operators as  members  of

the PTC may not necessarily, in any way, have a conflict,

because  they  excuse themselves from  critical  decision

points.  There is still the issue of perception.  And for

that reason alone, we should leave them out of it and let

them  come in as experts, or as presenters of their point

of view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been another suggestion in some quarters,

where  maybe  we bring in commuters themselves  into  the

PTC.   I  have  trouble with that, as  it  is  the  exact

analogue  of the public transport operators, but  on  the

other side.  If we cannot have a transport operator who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>

stands  to  benefit from a fare increase on the  Council,

then can we justify having commuters who stand to benefit

from  a  fare reduction on the Council as well?  I  think

there is a contradiction here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we ought to have is a Public Transport Council

made  up of experts from different areas, whether  it  is

financial  experts, transport industry experts and  maybe

those with prior experience in the industry, so that when

the   deliberations  occur,  it  is  a  considered  final

opinion,  drawing  on a wide range of  expertise.   I  do

believe   the  PTC's  deliberations  can  also  be   more

transparent.  Because, at the end of the day,  people  do

want  to know why and, by this, I mean both commuters  as

well  as  transport operators, how they arrive  at  their

decision,  and  that  will  help  raise  the   level   of

understanding and debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of formula, CPI + X, I would like to

know  how productivity factors are encapsulated  in  this

formula.  The Senior Minister of State yesterday  alluded

to this, but some clarification is necessary.  Because on

the  face  of  it,  it looks like you have  got  a  total

insulation  from  cost increases and you  get  the  clear

increase  in  nominal prices without any  adjustment,  or

requirement  to improve your productivity.  And,  yet,  I

think this is not the case.  This needs to be brought out

in  the open so that people understand this clearly  that

there is already, if there is not then there should be, a

productivity discount to this formula.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, ultimately, Sir, we can talk about all this

tinkering with the process.  I feel the best solution  is

still  to  introduce greater competition  in  our  public

transport  system, particularly perhaps in the bus  area,

if we cannot do it in the train system.  Because then, we

will  avoid issues of how do you fix the price,  are  you

profiteering, and so on.  Because the market will lead to

straight  competition, and there should be an element  of

internal correction within the market.  Many Members have

drawn the analogy with the telecommunications sector  and

others.    I   know   there   are   differences   between

transportation and telecommunications, and so on.  But at

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>

end  of  the  day,  we  do not realise  the  benefits  of

competition until we have it.  And then, it becomes  very

obvious.   Why did we not do this before?    I  think  we

ought  to  try  it, if not in a total way, then  in  some

measured manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on the issue of broader Government

charges, the Government should make an effort not to over

burden Singaporeans at this time.  I fully endorse  that.

There  is  an element of cynicism out there.  They  think

that  the  Government  charges  go  through  a  kind   of

political   Circadian  rhythm.   You  start   after   the

elections and rates go up, and then around the middle  of

the period, it stays steady, and then towards the end  of

the  five-year  term,  there is an  inverse  performance,

either rates go down, or they may not go down, but  other

forms of compensation kick in.  This might be because  we

have a range of various Government bodies who are all run

by  people  who are thinking ahead and trying  to  ensure

that the Ministers do not have a tough time.  But perhaps

we ought to take a "more hands" approach on this and say,

"Let's  look  at how we can actually space this  out  and

manage this as a total impact."  Because that is the crux

of  the  issue  here  today.  The public  transport  fare

increases and the Public Transport Council, as Mr Tan put

it  yesterday, have become lightning rods, but  they  are

not  the  problem.  The issue is broader and it has  just

become  a  convenient point of reference, or  scapegoats.

And  I  think we should ensure that we do not  fall  into

that trap again by addressing this issue comprehensively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest one other point that we could

consider  - whether some of the schemes which we  already

have,  like the Economic Downturn Relief Scheme and there

is  a  scheme through the CCCs for those who are affected

by  the  GST, perhaps we should give more flexibility  to

the  grassroots organisations on the ground, so that  for

those  who  are  unduly affected by these transport  fare

increases, they too should be eligible for some  form  of

assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the amendment moved by

the Member.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  support  the hon. Member,  Dr  Tan  Boon  Wan's

proposed  amendments  and his call  for  the  PTC  to  be

transparent  in  its review for fare  increases,  and  to

specifically take into consideration the affordability of

the  commuters  for  the review of the  affordable  fare,

which is one of the PTC's objectives of safeguarding  our

public  interest.   Such  an amendment  would  serve  the

public interest better, a concrete step towards a longer-term  view,  as it takes a harder look at the fundamental

considerations of the measurement of the affordable fare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, the affordable fare is indirectly

measured using a formula that was recommended seven years

ago,  consisting of cost data, ie, the CPI  +  X  factor.

Both  are cost factors of the transport network operators

from  which  the fare is computed and levied  on  to  the

general  public.  Quoting Senior Minister  of  State,  Mr

Khaw Boon Wan's explanation, within this framework of the

formula,  the  PTC decides what is a reasonable  rate  of

increase  which  is  commensurate with the  affordability

level of the population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affordability is a relative term. The cost increase

should  be  measured  in relation  to  the  income.   The

present  formula  does not consider  the  income  of  the

commuters  directly,  especially  during  this   economic

downturn  period.   When the economy is reasonably  good,

one  can  argue that the annual increase in income  would

have  been taken into account relative to the  CPI.   For

example, the public service sector has always taken  into

account  the  CPI  to  consider  their  salary  increases

yearly.  When the increases in income are higher than the

cost, it would probably have taken into account that  the

commuters are able to afford the additional cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PTC has argued that this increase is only a very

small  increase, and has then allowed it.  But it is  the

relative increase in cost and income that should  be  the

issue.   The  lowering of the income bar and the  overall

increase  to  the  cost of transportation  result  in  an

increase  in  the cost to income ratio of the  commuters.

But in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>

present state of the economy, most commuters have  either

no  increase in the income for the past years or suffered

a  pay cut, or are even out of job.  Some are even living

day  by  day in fear of losing their job because  of  the

closing  down  of  the companies.  These small  increases

would have reached the threshold of pain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To understand the commuters' threshold of pain is to

determine  the  composition of cost in  relation  to  the

income.   Although, again, Senior Minister of  State,  Mr

Khaw  Boon  Wan,  has  stated that transport  fares  have

lagged  behind wage growth by a big margin over a  period

of  15  years, we are looking at the present scenario  in

this economic downturn where income has been lowered, the

transport  fare relative to the income would indeed  have

been increased even with a small increase in the fares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the hon. Member Mr Ravindran's call

for  the amount of transport expenses in relation to  the

average  income of the commuters to be made  known.   The

threshold  of pain of the commuters is further compounded

by  the string of increases of the other economic factors

adding to the cost of the commuters, ie, the increase  in

refuse  collection fees in May, the simultaneous increase

in   utilities  rates  and  transport  fare,  the  coming

September  increases  in  carpark  charges  and   factors

affecting  the  income of the commuters, eg,  the  coming

review  of  the  CPF  rates.  In addition,  the  Economic

Restructuring  Shares, which are to help  our  people  in

overcoming  the poor economic situation,  have  not  been

received yet, as they are only scheduled for next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is timely for the PTC to be transparent with the

public  on  the factors that are used as their  bases  to

determine  this  affordable  fare.   Listening   to   the

Minister's   reply,   none   had   explained   how    the

affordability  fare was determined and the  list  of  the

factors  that  were taken into consideration.   Dr  Tan's

timely amendment has highlighted the need for the PTC  to

be transparent in the evaluation of this affordable fare,

in view of the transport companies

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>

being  in  a  privileged position - a ready pool  of  no-choice  commuters,  free  infrastructure  costs,  minimum

competition and good surpluses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, I would like to urge the PTC to readily

take  into consideration the call of the Members in  this

House  in  the  amended Motion to take into  account  the

affordability  of  the  commuters  and  the  unemployment

situation  in relation to the current economic  situation

in  reviewing  the  affordable  fare.   In  view  of  the

transport   companies'   privileged   position   of    no

competition and the no-choice situation of the commuters,

we  would  like  to  urge the PTC to make  known  and  be

transparent on the factors considered when evaluating the

affordable fare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendments to the Motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir,  thank you for allowing me to take part  in

this  debate.   I  must declare that I am  the  Executive

Secretary of the Singapore Transport Workers' Union.   We

have some 12,000 workers working in the transport sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, we have heard from the PAP and Opposition

MPs  the sentiments and feelings of the middle and  lower

income group people in Singapore.  If we go to the market-place and coffee shops, we will find that what these  MPs

said  in this House is true and correct.  What amazes  me

is  that  our  PAP Members seem to be more energetic  and

incisive than the Opposition members when they made these

points.  If we send people like Mr Tan Soo Khoon  and  Dr

Tan  Cheng Bock to contest in the opposition wards in the

next  General  Election, I am afraid the incumbents  will

not  find  their  way back to this Chamber  at  the  next

Parliament.  Our PAP Members are more mature.  They  will

be able to contest and win all the single-member wards in

future elections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that price increases are never welcomed by

the  people.   As I live in a HDB flat,  I  have  a  deep

understanding of how the people there are feeling about

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>

the  daily  matters.  As I am living among them,  I  meet

them  when  I go to work and come back from work.   These

lower    income   people   are   unhappy,    and    their

dissatisfaction is not just confined to this round of bus

fare   increase.   In  the  coffee  shops,  many   people

commented,  "The Government allows the officials  to  set

fire, but ordinary citizens are not even allowed to light

a lantern."  Increase in refuse collection fees, increase

in car park charges, increase in GST, and what else do we

have?   Yet,  when  the hawkers were  to  increase  their

prices,  the Government sends the Chan Soo Sen  Committee

to go after their blood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must look at the Singapore political situation in

a calm and objective manner.  We must apply our political

EQ  or  emotional  quotient.  Our PAP leadership  is  not

stupid.   They are aware of the feelings of  the  people.

Many of our grassroots leaders are well educated.  In the

wards  of  the  Ministers, many  grassroots  leaders  are

professionals.  They  understand  what  is  going  on  at

grassroots  level.   But, we know  that  in  many  Latin-American  countries,  during the election  campaign,  the

politicians would make a lot of promises to their  people

to  win  votes.  Then, after the election,  if  they  are

fortunate  enough to be returned to power,  in  order  to

keep  faith with the people and to fulfil their promises,

they would hand out all sorts of goodies. In the process,

they  clear  out the nation's coffers.  When  their  term

expires, the country is bankrupt and heavily in debt.  Is

this the kind of country we want?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that every five years, the PAP must face the

people  in  a  General Election and seek a fresh  mandate

from them.  "Who would do things so that the people would

not  elect them in the next five years' time?"  I  talked

to the people in the coffee shops.  A lot of them are not

happy  with the Government's decision to allow  the  fare

hike.  I asked them if we were to hold a General Election

now  would  the PAP win. They replied, "Oh, the PAP  will

still  win  the elections."  Why?  This is  because  they

know  that the PAP Government is the only one that  ticks

in Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, people are not happy. These price increases

had led to emotional upsets.  It is a question of timing.

We  have  to  exercise  our political  wisdom  to  decide

whether  what we are doing will be good for  our  nation.

If  we promise people that there will be no price and fee

increases,  what will happen?  Will our public  transport

system be as good as it is today?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member of Parliament for Hougang advocated for a

state-owned bus company.  When I was young, I had to take

the  Singapore  Traction Company (STC) buses  to  school.

This  was  a bus company operated by the Government.   In

the  end,  the company went bust and had to  close  down.

Why should the Government run a losing business and waste

our  surpluses and reserves?  We should leave it  to  the

experts  and  professionals to run it  at  a  profit  and

benefit the people - and the Government.  As such, I feel

that we should adopt a calm and balanced attitude on this

issue of public transport fare increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our population is small, and the

market  for  public  transport  is  very  limited.    Two

transport operators are facing the possibility of losses.

If we allow five or six companies to compete, can we make

sure  that they will reduce fares?  Our commuter base  is

small.  We have to maintain our buses.  If we allow  more

companies to operate, can the companies have the  economy

of  scale  to operate at a profit and remain  viable?   I

have  read in the papers that in Ang Mo Kio, Mr Wee  Siew

Kim  provided  buses for his constituents to  go  to  the

market.  Every week, he incurs a cost of $500.  I applaud

his  effort  and hope that he can sustain till  the  next

election in 2007.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bus workers are like you and me. They would also

want to enjoy pay increases.  They are lowly educated and

elderly.   They  have to support their families.   Should

they  not also enjoy bonuses and pay increases so  as  to

cover  their family expenses?  Every day, they  work  for

more than 12 hours and every now and then

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>

they  have  to face complaints from the commuters.   They

have  to  learn new skills, especially those drivers  who

are  50  and  60, they have to continue to upgrade  their

skills as public transport system goes IT.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to avoid fare increases? Yes, we can do that.

Today,  the  average waiting period for a  bus  is  three

minutes during peak hours.  In order to meet this target,

we  have to operate 20 buses on one route during the peak

period.  If the commuters are willing to wait six minutes

instead  of  three,  we can reduce the  number  of  buses

operating on the route from 20 to 10. This will translate

into  savings  in capital investment and  the  subsequent

depreciation  charges  on  10 buses.   With  two  drivers

taking  turns  to operate each bus, this will  also  mean

that  we  will reduce the cost of employing  20  drivers.

The  question is, "Are the commuters prepared to wait for

6  minutes  for  a bus during the peak periods?"   It  is

already the case that sometimes when the buses are caught

in  traffic jam and arrive one or two minutes  late,  the

commuters  would complain and even abuse  the  driver  by

asking, "Why so late!"  And you want them to wait for six

minutes instead of three?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the statutory life-span of a bus is 15

years.  Why do we not extend it to 20 years?  If we allow

a  bus  to operate for 20 years, then bus companies  will

save  on  depreciation, and asset replacement  cost.   If

Singaporeans  feel  that we want to enjoy  a  world-class

transport system, they must be prepared to pay.   In  the

60s and 70s, it was not uncommon to wait for half an hour

for  a  bus.  I had to get up before dawn to make sure  I

catch  a  bus before 6.30 am in order to reach school  on

time.  The bus stop was just a post with a plate attached

displaying the bus number.  There is no shelter or seats.

Sometimes,  while I was standing at the bus stop  waiting

for  the bus to arrive, it suddenly rained. I had to  run

back  home to change my drenched school uniform and  come

out  again  with a rain-coat or an umbrella.   The  buses

were  usually packed.  If you board the bus just a couple

of stops from the depot, you would be lucky to be able to

board the bus, let alone getting a seat.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>

If  Singaporeans are prepared to go back to the standards

and conditions of public buses in the 1960s and 70s, then

I  think  it  is possible for us to wait for another  3-4

years before it would be necessary to raise the bus fares

again.   We  know what Singaporeans want.   Any  fare  or

price increase is surely not welcomed.  But we have to be

realistic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One constituent of mine thought he struck a bargain

when  he bought three pairs of socks for only $1  at  the

pasar  malam organised by the Residents' Committee.   But

these  socks  shrank and tore when they were  washed  two

days later. He came to me and complained, "Why you people

sell  this  type  of lousy things at your  pasar  malam?"

Yes,  they were cheap and affordable.  But are  they  the

sort of things you want?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government says the bus can be used for 20

years  and  that  people are prepared to wait  for  10-20

minutes,  as  the  Executive Secretary of  the  Transport

Workers'  Union, I can assure you that in the next  three

or  four  years,  there would not be any  need  for  fare

increase.   However,  there will be complaints  from  the

commuters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituency is near to the Yishun Interchange.

One   night,   at   the  meet-the-people   session,   one

constituent told me there was a thunderstorm a  few  days

ago.   His  son  was drenched by the heavy downpour.   He

remarked, "How could you say that our transport system is

world-class  when  our  bus  interchange  is   so   badly

designed?  Why can we not offer better shelter  from  the

weather at the bus interchange?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the issue on the airconditioned buses or non-airconditioned buses, it is a matter of choice and

opinion.   Today, there are many people who would  prefer

and  do  not  mind  paying a bit more to  travel  in  the

comfort of an airconditioned bus.  They absolutely detest

travelling  in  a  non-airconditioned bus.   We  have  to

exercise our political wisdom when dealing with the issue

on fare increase.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time round, the issue on fare increase has been

brought  up  and  debated vigorously in  Parliament.   If

Parliament  has  to  convene  for  every  proposed  price

increase, then our MPs will have to become full-time  MPs

and  come  to  Parliament  every  day  to  discuss  these

matters, just like those in Taiwan.  I know that all  our

Members  are either professionals or successful  business

people.  It is not easy to get 84 people to become  part-time  parliamentarians.   If  we  are  going  to  get  84

professionals  and successful entrepreneurs  to  give  up

their  career and business to serve as full-time MPs,  it

will  be  almost  impossible.  Then, are we  prepared  to

accept lesser people to come in here?  I do not think so.

I hope that everyone of us would look at this matter in a

calm  manner.  Much as we want to please the  people,  we

cannot  please  all the people all the time.   There  are

bound  to  be some policies which are unpopular with  the

people

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night, when I was talking to my residents at

the  coffee  shop,  I told them that we  should  be  more

concerned with Malaysia's intention to increase the price

of water they supply to us rather than the fare increase.

They all agreed. They said, "Yes, this is more important.

Parliament  should use their time to discuss how  we  are

going  to fight the Malaysians."  However, today, we  are

spending a long time talking about the three-cent to ten-cent fare hike.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Mr Ng Ser Miang, our NMP, explained the

problems  faced  by  the  bus operators.   Mr  Ng  is  an

honourable man.  I respect him, although sometimes, I had

heated  arguments with him because I represent the  union

and  he  was on the management side.  Under the  law,  so

long as we have enough votes, we can stage a strike.  So,

I  used  to  tell him that if the management persists  in

treating  us  badly,  and  our  workers  cannot  live   a

comfortable  life, we would go on a strike.   But  do  we

want   to   see  such  a  situation  in  Singapore?    My

counterparts in Taiwan told me that even the taxi drivers

can  go  on  strike.  Every time they go on strike,  they

want  us  to  give  them  some moral  support  for  their

industrial action.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our workers cannot earn a decent living, then

nobody   would  want  to  be  bus  drivers.    Currently,

approximately   30%   of  our   bus   drivers   are   not

Singaporeans.   In  total, the  two  bus  companies  have

vacancies  for at least 200 drivers.  Despite  the  grave

unemployment situation in Singapore, there are  some  200

vacancies for bus drivers that remain unfilled.   I  have

been  telling people, "If you are unemployed and want  to

become a bus driver, just come to me. I will get you  the

job.   No  need  to  write  letters.   No  need  to   get

referrals."  It is a big difference from the situation 10-20  years  ago.  Nowadays, nobody wants to become  a  bus

driver  because the pay is not attractive. We have  about

30% non-Singaporeans driving our buses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look into this matter squarely. Now, if all

our people do not want to drive buses, if we have 80% bus

drivers  who  are foreigners and if they do not  maintain

the  bus properly, if the tyres are not properly secured,

the  lives  of 50-odd passengers on the bus would  be  in

jeopardy.  If they are not Singaporeans, why should  they

work  so hard to maintain the buses for you?  Why  should

they  be  concerned  with the lives  and  safety  of  the

Singaporean commuters?  By then, you would have to  start

worrying.   Who  would not want to feel secure  and  safe

while  travelling on public transportation?  Our accident

rate  is  the  lowest in the whole of Asia.   During  the

seventh  month, the month of the hungry ghosts,  our  bus

drivers  would pray very hard at every bus  depot  hoping

that  there  would not be any accident.  They  work  very

hard.   If we want them to have a decent living, we  have

to give them decent wages.  I think that is only fair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this small increase in bus fares can contribute

to better standard of living for our bus drivers, I think

it  is  worth  it because we want to have  a  world-class

transport  system in Singapore.  So, I  hope  that  every

Singaporean  could clearly understand the situation.   No

government  would like to go against the  wishes  of  the

people.   Every government would wish to help its people,

if not at least the people

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>

of  the  next  generation.  Of course,  the  bus  drivers

nowadays  do  not  want  their  children  to  become  bus

drivers.   Our  Government has been forward-looking.   We

have  to  make sure that Singaporeans have a good  future

ahead.   We  cannot  be so calculative and  feel  unhappy

because of a slight fare increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the media, we can see and read about the

discontent of our people.  Some people have written  very

sincerely and earnestly in the newspapers on the issue of

fare   increase.     Like   many  older   generation   of

Singaporeans  have  said:  "Although  life  is  difficult

every  day, we nevertheless manage to get by."  The basic

problem  is that increase in bus fares, for that  matter,

any price increase, is always painful and unbearable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, we must have enough water supply

to  stay  alive.  We  want  our Government  to  pool  its

resources to make sure we have the water supply we  need.

This  is much more important and crucial than the  debate

on the 3-cent fare hike.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this amended motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, thank you for

allowing me to speak on the Motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of unhappiness and unease among the

populace  on  the bus fare increase.  But,  surprisingly,

while many may think that the grouse is about the quantum

of  increase, this is not merely the case.  I agree  with

Dr  Wang when he said that the majority of the people are

not as upset about the 3-cent unit fare increase.  To the

embattled members of the PTC, within the constraints that

they  work under, this speaks well of the diligence  that

the PTC members had put into the exercise.  I believe  we

should applaud their resolution in maintaining the  long-term view through the principle of small step increases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, despite what the hon. Member, Mr Ong Ah

Heng, said about not raising small issues in this Chamber

-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>

whether  it is dirty toilets or bus services  -  we  feel

that  we  must address and bring up the unease.   Let  me

just categorise the unease into two key areas, which  are

that of timing and process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of timing, there are two aspects. One is

that  of  the macro, which is injecting an increase  when

most  in the economic milieu are still smarting from  the

impact  of the downturn, and have yet to taste the fruits

of  any  improvements.  Yes, as all may say, this is  not

the  first  time that there has been an increase  in  bus

fares.  And, yes, we would all agree that this would  not

be  the last time either.  But everyone knows the cry is,

why do it now?  Can it not wait another half a year?  The

general perception is that the rush in the increase seems

to  smell  of  more to come in other areas.  Hence,  more

worrying is, what else is next?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the second part of the timing

issue, ie, that this issue comes on the heels of all  the

other  announcements of escalations.   As  such,  we  are

often  confronted with the question - one come, all come,

how come?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the process. There is a perceived

insensitivity  on the part of the regulators,  manifested

in  the  outcry  at the lack of time for feedback  to  be

properly   obtained.   Secondly,  there  is  a  perceived

opaqueness under which the decisions were arrived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all said and done, we must however realise that

we  do  have an approach that worked before. The PTC  and

its  independence must be preserved.  While we look  into

the  timing and the process, let us not destroy the  very

foundation that gives us the public transportation system

that we have today, which we are extremely proud of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, to be constructive, rather than a review, I

support Dr Tan's amendments which highlighted key factors

that  have to be taken into consideration.  I would  like

to take this opportunity to make several suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the deliberations of the PTC should be on

public record.  In this way,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>

people  who are interested can satisfy themselves of  the

substance  of  the deliberations as well as  the  thought

process.   They  are  not uncaring.  In  this  particular

instance, what appears to be hiding behind the  CPI  +  X

formula  for substantiating increases just would not  do,

especially  where  for  most of  the  seven  out  of  ten

Singaporeans that are affected, they do not see  any  CPI

increase  in  their incomes and their  X  could  well  be

negative.  While one can understand fully Senior Minister

of State, Khaw Boon Wan's explanation, that the CPI +X is

a   strong   motivator  to  the  operator  to  push   for

productivity  in the face of such an escalation  ceiling,

it  would  not be entirely out of place if we exact  some

concessions  this  time  round.   So,  can  we  push  the

boundary?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of service quality and the attendant cost

should  also  be  based on what the bus commuting  public

want.   Whether  it  is frills or no frills,  let  it  be

determined  empirically.  I know we have a  system  where

people  go  to bus interchanges and from there,  they  go

outwards.  And my point about the Sengkang bus service is

why  stick to that?  Why not offer point to point,  which

people  want.  Even in the airline industry, there  is  a

struggle between hub and spoke, and point to point.   You

need  not  do point to point all day round.   As  for  my

market,  I do not have a market, offer point to point  at

the  time when people want to go to the market.  So,  you

do not run it all day round.  So, ask the commuters.  Let

it  be determined empirically.  It would seem that in the

present  economic  context, the commuters  may  want  our

public   transportation  system  just  to  be   reliable.

Regular  intervals, good coverage and be safe.   TVs  and

airconditioning on buses and interchanges,  whoever  pays

for  it,  just would not get the thumbs up.  It  is  very

hard  to accept that with airconditioning, operating cost

would  not go up.  Just compare food court versus natural

air kopi tiam prices, this would show up.  Why not have a

forum  where the needs can be determined.  While  it  may

not  satisfy every one all the time, at least there is  a

gauge  of  what the consumers want as determined  by  the

travelling public for themselves,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>

whether  it is 8 minutes interval or 12 minutes interval.

Let  us  not sweep all these under the banner of  "rising

expectations", because these can be managed.   I  believe

people  can accept that shorter intervals will mean  more

buses, more drivers and hence higher costs, especially in

instances  when  increased frequency does  not  stimulate

higher ridership.  Just go to Shenton Way and ask some of

the  people in the high-rise buildings during lunch-time.

They  probably wait 8-10 minutes for the lift to get from

the  top floor to the bottom floor, and to get on a lift.

Is that high expectation?  Do we put in more elevators?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I re-read the public statements put up by the PTC

last  year  when there was no direct price increase.   At

that time, it too had the dilemma of balancing operators'

viability  and  commuters' interest.   The  increase  was

turned down.  Yet, the operators made money.  I think the

argument  is not whether the operators should be  viable.

There  is  no  disagreement here.  They must  be  viable.

Rather,  the question is whether enough has been done  to

eliminate  wastage  and drive productivity  in  order  to

reduce  cost.  And it will go a long way if Dr Amy Khor's

request  to see the compelling evidence of imminent  non-viability is produced.  That would silence many critics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be some means of injecting competition,

thereby  subjecting the operators to  even  sharper  cost

discipline.  And to echo Mr Ravindran's point, there must

be   in   place   alternative  means  of  assurance   and

independent verification, if market forces are not  fully

in play.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the call is for more transparency in the

process  and better communications.  In addition, service

levels  should  be  based on some  market-based  consumer

derived  benchmarks, and let them decide for  themselves.

And  further, for more competition that would  blunt  the

inexorable  increase in cost.  We need  to  tackle  these

issues  as enhancement but, in the meantime, we  must  be

reminded that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>

we  have a world-class public transportation system  that

we  all  ought to be proud of.  Let us work  together  to

enhance  the  pillars and the foundations on  which  they

hang  on,  rather than undermine the very basis  for  the

PTC's authority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendments to the Motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise in support of the amendments proposed by  the

hon. Member for Ang Mo Kio GRC, Dr Tan Boon Wan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to admit that after yesterday's animated

debate  that we saw in the House, it is not going  to  be

easy  to up the tempo but, nevertheless, Dr Tan Boon  Wan

has risen to give a reasonable and realistic touch to the

original  Motion.  I would like to give my  take  on  the

proposed  amendments  and overall  issue  of  the  public

transport fare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the proposed amendments, he has rightly

taken  into  consideration  PM  Goh's  support  for   the

principle of PTC granting small increases.  Similarly, he

has  put into context the concerns of the people  in  the

present  environment of uncertainty and economic slowdown

by urging the Government to ensure public services remain

affordable.  These amendments are laudable and I think it

should be supported.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have heard over and over again

in   this   House  about  the  difficulties  facing   all

Singaporeans at this moment.  The depth of the impact  of

economic  recession  on  the lives  of  our  citizens  is

further emphasised by the recent announcement of more job

losses   and  increases  in  the  request  for  financial

assistance.   Sir,  we  cannot, and  should  not,  under-estimate the effect of the slowdown in the global economy

on  their livelihood.  Many of my constituents that I met

during  grassroots functions and block  visits  expressed

the  concerns  and  worry.  With the perceived  spate  of

increases  in  the charges for basic services,  they  are

just waiting for the last straw that would break

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>

the  camel's  back.   They are  at  a  loss  of  what  is

happening.   They  view the recent increase  in  the  bus

fares  as  contradictory to the overall effort  to  lower

cost and tighten their belts during these hard times.   I

believe  that  many Members have already  expressed  this

eloquently,  and  I  am  just  echoing  their  sentiments

further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Sir, we also have to admit that

the job of the PTC is not an easy one.  They have to find

a balance between the public interest without undermining

the  viability of the transport provider.  The  framework

of  regulations that we have in place has worked well for

us.  But in our usual continuous quest to improve and  to

do   things   better,  I  think  we  should   widen   the

representations  in the PTC to include members  from  the

unions, political leaders, grassroots leaders, and dare I

suggest,  student leaders too.  Let us be fair  and  give

credit  where it is due.  Several Members openly admitted

that the PTC has done reasonably well.  We all understood

that  PTC  has  been  given the  responsibility  and  the

unenviable  task to do, we should have the confidence  on

the  members and not undermine their role and  integrity.

Furthermore,  we  should  not  judge  them  on  a  single

unpopular decision, but rather look at their track record

over  the period of their existence.  Let us improve  the

processes  and make it more transparent, but not  destroy

PTC's position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me tell you an experience that

marked me for a long time.  This happened in 1986 when  I

was  studying  in Paris, France.  It was my first  winter

and  it was very, very cold.  I was taking my usual train

ride  back  to my hostel.  I was about 3 kilometres  away

from  the  destination  when the  train  stopped  at  the

station.   I  noticed that it was longer than usual,  but

thought  nothing of it.  To my surprise and shock,  after

about  ten  minutes, there was an announcement that  said

that  the train was not going to move because the  driver

had  gone on an abrupt strike.  Little did I realise that

I  was  given  a shock introduction to a common  thing  - things that happen in Paris, ie, public transport strike.

Needless to say, I had to walk back to my hostel.  Let us

not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>

take  things  for granted.  We do have a  good  transport

system.   It  may not be the best, but it  works,  albeit

with some minor hiccups now and then.  But it works.   It

is  the envy of many people around the world.  Does  this

happen  by  chance?   No.  Apart from the  infrastructure

that  we  have,  there are thousands of public  transport

workers  that  run  it  and make it  all  happen  for  us

everyday.  Like Mdm Halimah, I would also like  to  thank

them  for  their effort and good work.  Let me also  take

this  opportunity, Sir, to remind the transport providers

that  they  have to continue to improve and not  let  the

commuters down.  This fare increase, though small it  may

be,  is  done  during difficult times.   Thus,  transport

providers  must, in good faith, provide  their  best  and

reward  their  loyal commuters by some  other  innovative

means.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, let me reiterate my support to the

amendments to the Motion proposed by Dr Tan Boon Wan.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank  you for allowing me to join in the debate.  Today,

I am going to tell a story about a song I heard in my car

a  few nights ago.  In fact, this is a song, not a story.

A  lady  had  made a request for an old song entitled  "A

Couple's  Duet" to be broadcast over the radio programme.

This is a pretty old song, one that was recorded some 50-60  years  ago.  The song started with the wife  singing,

"Prices going up day by day, trouble and worries  for  us

who have to pay and pay."  She then went on to lament  on

how  the  prices  of everything had been  going  up,  how

difficult  it  was  for her to run  the  household.   She

complained  that her husband was useless  and  unable  to

earn  enough  money to support her and the  family.   The

husband then replied that he had his grievances too.   He

said the market was bad, his job was insecure and he  had

to  bear with the whims and fancies of his employer.   No

pay rise, and his job could be lost anytime!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a very old song, some 50

years  old,  and  it was about the chaotic  situation  in

China at that time.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>

I  really do not know whether this lady had requested for

this  song  that night by coincidence or by  design.   Of

course,  Singapore's  economy  is  in  a  recession   and

unemployment rate is rising.  But it is still not as  bad

as  it was in China during those chaotic days.  Yet,  the

lyrics  of this song seem to reflect some of the  worries

of our people today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard speeches by many of our Members in the

last   two  days.   They  are  actually  reflecting   the

sentiments of the people and this is something  that  we,

as Members of Parliament, ought to do.  Some Members have

raised  some  suggestions.  Here, I would thank  Minister

Mah  and  SMS Khaw for their clarifications.   They  have

clarified some of the misunderstandings of our people and

to  let  the people realise that the Government  actually

cares  for  them.  And these policies are farsighted  and

the  intention  is good.  Mr Ong Ah Heng  has  also  very

eloquently and emotionally analysed the various  acts  of

the  Government which were done with the interest of  the

people  at  heart.   But why is it that  this  issue  has

aroused such a vigorous reaction by the people?  I  think

it   is   because  we  have  not  done  enough   in   our

communication  with  our people, and  we  have  not  been

thorough  enough  in explaining to our people.   This  is

what Mr Arthur Fong had mentioned just now.  In order  to

improve communication with our people, I think we have to

look  into  various  matters.  Let  me  give  Members  an

analysis in my capacity as a psychiatrist.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually if we want to treat our patient

effectively, there are three steps to follow.  First,  we

must   build   up  a  good  doctor-patient  relationship.

Secondly,  we have to understand his problems by  talking

to  him  and listening to him. Thirdly, we must  set  the

treatment  target  and then give specific,  feasible  and

well-paced treatment to the patient.  How do we build  up

the  relationship  between the doctor  and  the  patient?

There  are  three important elements.  First, the  doctor

must  accept  the patient.  Second, he must  support  the

patient  and, thirdly, the doctor must assure the patient

and build up his faith

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>

in  the  doctor.  For example, many of my patients suffer

from  anxiety disorder.  They have a lot of  worries  and

bodily  symptoms.  They say, "Oh, I am going  to  have  a

heart  attack  now."  "I have breathing  difficulties,  I

cannot breathe," etc.  More often than not, I would  find

nothing physiologically wrong with them. I know it  is  a

matter  of  psychology. In fact, there is  nothing  wrong

with them.   They just worry themselves sick.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way, these patients are somewhat like the

people  in Singapore nowadays.   They all understand  the

reason for this round of fare hike.  To the people,  this

3-cent or 5-cent increase is a potential worry.  This  is

a  signal  of  something more serious to come.   We  must

learn  to  accept their concerns, give them the necessary

support  and  reassurance, and then  gradually  build  up

their confidence.  Only then can we change their mindset.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have to listen to their problems and

understand  their concerns, just like a  doctor  who  has

first to understand the problems of his patient before he

would make a diagnosis.  So, similarly, in this issue, we

have  to  understand what are the things that the  people

are most concerned with.  Their concern is not just the 3

cents or 5 cents.  I disagree with Mr Ong Ah Heng when he

said  that  this  was a small matter. This  is  not  just

trivial  as  they may appear to be. In the minds  of  the

people, there is this anxiety that an avalanche of  price

increases is forthcoming. On the one hand, the Government

is  asking them to exercise wage restraint; yet,  on  the

other  hand, there is a whole series of price  increases.

They  feel  that  the burden is getting very  heavy,  too

heavy for them to bear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we must set up our treatment plan. This

plan must be specific and feasible, and it must be a long-term plan to treat the disease. While we are dealing with

this  issue of fare adjustment, we want to see an all-win

situation  - a situation where everyone is a winner.   We

have to consider the interest of the people, the interest

of the companies and the interest of the Government.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>

people's  interest is that as mentioned  by  many  of  my

parliamentary  colleagues who spoke before  me,   quality

service  at  reasonable prices.  I shall not repeat  this

point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the companies' interests. Of course, the

companies  want  to make profits.  We cannot  deny  that.

They   must  make  profits,  failing  which  they  cannot

survive.  The  only thing is that they  must  make  their

profits in a reasonable manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Government's interest. That is our

long-term  target.   We  want to  set  up  a  world-class

transport system.  This is a long-term plan which must be

a  major premise in our consideration.  At the same time,

we    should   also   maintain   the   independence   and

professionalism of the PTC, so that this element of check

and  balance  in  the operation of our  public  transport

system will not be eroded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully agree with the amended

motion  by  Dr Tan Boon Wan requesting that  PTC  take  a

comprehensive,  overall  view of the  situation  whenever

they  consider  any application for fare increase.   Now,

what  the people want to know is whether or not  the  PTC

has   considered  the  present  economic   downturn   and

unemployment  situation in Singapore. They want  to  know

whether  PTC has thoroughly examined the operation of the

two  companies, and whether they have made every  attempt

to improve productivity rather than pushing the burden to

the commuters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this occasion, this round of fare increase, they

have given labour cost as a factor for the increase.  The

public is not yet convinced of this.  My colleagues  have

already  spoken on this.  I am not going  to  repeat  it.

Over  the last 10 years or so, the PTC has done very much

and,  I  am  sure, they must have given this matter  very

full deliberation before they made this decision.  Why is

it  that  people  still have so much  worries  about  its

decision?   I  feel that on this occasion,  when  dealing

with  this  issue, perhaps the PTC has not perfected  its

communication skills with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>

the  people.  I think if there is more consultation  with

the interested parties and with more thorough studies and

better communication, I am sure we will not hear so  much

voices of discontent among the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the Ministry of Transport consider

improving  the way in which PTC operates and the  way  it

communicates  with the people, so that  people  can  see,

hear  and  feel  that  the PTC is also  protecting  their

interests.  In addition, I also suggest that the Ministry

of   Transport  consider  appointing  some  bus  or   MRT

commuters  to  the  PTC  to  enhance  the  scope  of  its

representation.  This will increase  the  voices  of  the

people in PTC.  At the same time, whenever they make  any

major   policy  decision,  they  should  adopt   a   more

consultative  approach  to  collect  feedback  from   the

people, so that they can increase its transparency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having spoken on the communication part of PTC, I

would  like  to  talk  about the competitiveness  in  the

public  transport  market.   In  our  process  to  remake

Singapore, we keep hearing this expression of "leaving no

stone  unturned".   So  in our public  transport  system,

should  we also take this opportunity to turn the stones?

The  present  method  of operation  of  public  transport

system has been used in Singapore for many years.  It has

raised  the  standard  of  our  public  transport  to  an

enviable  situation.   We  have a  world-class  transport

system  now.  But now these two companies are each having

a  comfortable share of the pie.  There is no competition

between  them.   How  are  we  going  to  improve   their

productivity?   I, therefore, suggest that  the  Minister

for  Transport should give consideration to open up  this

market  so  as  to  improve the  competitiveness  of  the

operators.   I hope that the Minister will not  give  the

usual routine answer to this question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the methods proposed in the past are not

feasible,  it does not mean that there is no solution  to

it.   I  think if there is a will, there is  a  way.   We

should jump out of the old framework and think out of the

box, and be more creative in the way we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>

operate  our public transport.  There are so many talents

in the Ministry of Transport.  If we add this up with the

feedback from the people, I am sure we could come up with

a  solution to effectively open up this market.  I  think

this  is very relevant to our situation, particularly  to

Singapore  which  embraces a free  market  economy.   For

example, the opening up of the communications market  has

led  to  a greater variety of services being provided  by

the operators and a higher quality of service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister is worried that by opening up the

public  transport market, we will revert to  the  chaotic

situation some 30 years ago, I do not think this would be

the  case.   The environment nowadays is quite different.

The  quality  and expectations of the people  are  higher

now.  I am sure that the Ministry of Transport is able to

properly  plan and arrange in such a way that the  market

can  be  opened up smoothly and successfully.  I am  sure

there  will be more pros than cons in the opening  up  of

the  public transport market.  This will generate a check

and balance over the operational cost of the players.  In

addition,  it will also cause the companies  to  be  more

sensitive towards the feelings of the commuters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I started my speech with the lyrics of a song,

I  would also end with the ending line of this song.   It

says, "With the cold winter coming to an end, there  will

come  a gorgeous spring."  So long as the people and  the

Government  are  willing to put  in  a  concerted  effort

together,  I  am  sure we will have  a  better  and  more

beautiful spring ahead of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the amended motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

fare  hike  has  been hotly debated as it touches  a  raw

nerve  among  the more than 62% of Singapore's  commuting

public  that relies on public transport.  What was  found

most  unpalatable  was  the  manner  in  which  the  fare

adjustment was decided upon and its timing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Public Transport Council (PTC) rejected

the  applications  for  an across-the-board  increase  in

fares  last  year,  it  has approved  some  of  the  fare

adjustments proposed by the operators this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fare increases of between three cents and 10 cents

would  bring the operators extra revenue of 2.2% to 2.5%.

This figure is lower than what the PTC formula would have

allowed  for.  Annual fare revisions are subjected  to  a

cap  based on the formula of change in the Consumer Price

Index  (CPI)  + X.  The X has been set at 1.5%  for  five

years  from 2001 to 2005.  If fares had been raised every

year,  based on the formula, the quantum of fare  revenue

increase would be approximately 13%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PTC has exercised its role well in the past and

must  be  complimented for that.  These fare adjustments,

implemented recently, will help to defray what  operators

said were higher running costs, including manpower costs.

Understandably, there will be costs involved in providing

and  maintaining an efficient transport  system  and  fee

adjustments may be inevitable, as so humorously explained

and   illustrated  by  my  colleague,  Mr  Ong  Ah  Heng.

However,  it  may  be  time for us to  re-evaluate  PTC's

formula  for  approving fare hikes, as  proposed  in  the

amendment to consider factors like

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>

viability of public transport operators and affordability

of commuters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to analysts' estimates, the increased fare

revenue  for  the operators could add up to $11  million.

Even  without  the  fare hike, the  companies  are  still

making  profits.  Last year, the SMRT made  a  profit  of

$56.8 million and, this year, the company is expected  to

ring in higher profits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A profit is still a profit, regardless of the

margin.   Operators may not enjoy healthier  bottom  line

without   the  hike,  but  under  the  current   economic

conditions,  companies  who manage  to  turn  in  profits

should  count  themselves  very  fortunate  indeed.   The

criterion for fare adjustment is too narrowly focused  on

the  bottom  line of operators; other pertinent  factors,

like  prevailing  economic conditions  and  unemployment,

should be given more weight in this equation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, PTC is better advised to put in place

mechanisms  for  soliciting  public  views  and  feedback

before  implementing any fare adjustments in the  future.

Instead  of  being forced to make frequent clarifications

and  justifications after the fact, they could  introduce

the  public  earlier  into  the decision-making  process.

This  would  also  give commuters  ample  notice  of  the

impending change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timing of the fare adjustments raises some

concerns  as  well.   In the face of  unemployment,  high

retrenchment  rate and a slow economy, the  timing  could

not  be  more ill planned.  Lower-income households  have

seen  their disposable income shrinking on the one  hand,

and the cost of living increasing on the other.  A double

"whammy"  you could say.  The hike is coming  six  months

before  the  GST increase by 2-percentage point,  another

burden  for  the lower income.  The quick  succession  of

cost  increments  is  overwhelming for  the  lower-income

group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pockets of the poor, especially the retrenched,

will  be  hit  hard by these incremental  increases.   To

some, these amounts are trivial; to many others, they add

up.  Nonetheless, the full impact

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>

should  not  be blamed on the transport hike alone.   The

timing of the hike reinforces the public perception  that

the  Government is upping cost of basic items now, before

the new GST is due.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some believe that PTC should only decide on fare

changes after the ez-link card system completely replaces

the  magnetic fare card.  By then, it would  be  able  to

ascertain if the new and fairer system, where cheating is

eliminated,  has any real impact on the  bottom  line  of

operators.   The fare hike would be an easier sell to the

commuting  public then.  After all, they are  the  paying

customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these comments carry the sentiments from the

ground.   The ordinary folks whose means of commuting  is

by public transportation will face the brunt of the hike.

As  Advisers  to  the  GROs and  MPs  of  our  respective

communities, we will explain the rationale for the  hike,

but  we  must also be able to represent the views of  the

ordinary folks on policies impacting their finances  with

a  view  to  influence  and shape improvement  in  future

policy making.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dilemma that this House is faced with today on

the   transportation  hike,  provides  one  of  the  most

unavoidable lessons of having to deal with disapproval of

others  and,  in this instance, whether  we  are  for  or

against the Motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That praise and blame are all the same; it reminds

us of an old cliche, that we will never be able to please

all  the  people  all  the time.   Even  in  a  landslide

election  victory in which a candidate wins  70%  of  the

vote,  he or she is left with 30% of the population  that

wishes  someone else were the winner.  Indeed a  humbling

truth!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth shows up all the warts and wrinkles on our

face.  How do we respond?  Pretend we do not see them, or

accept  them,  and still stand head and  shoulders  above

others.  Sir, the truth is that everyone has his own  set

of  ideas  with  which to evaluate a situation,  and  our

ideas  do  not  always match those of others.   For  some

reason, most of us struggle against this inevitable fact.

We

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>

get  angry,  hurt, or otherwise frustrated,  when  people

reject  our ideas, tell us no or give us other  forms  of

disapproval.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I find myself yo-yo-ing between praise

and  blame.  One of my children is happy with my  action,

the other struggles against it.  Someone says I am a nice

MP   because   I   understand  business   and   strategic

considerations in this fare hike incident.  Someone  else

thinks  I  am  not, because I have not been effective  in

reversing  the hike.  This back and forth,  approval  and

disapproval,  happens all the time.  In truth,  we  would

always  prefer  approval over disapproval because  it  is

easier to deal with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do we go from here as responsible Members of

Parliament?   How  do we deal with the challenge  of  the

unhappy  lot?   We have to find a balanced  approach  and

take  a  longer  term  perspective  towards  resolving  a

national  issue  that understandably  embraces  a  bigger

agenda.   Sounds  like  a  pie in  the  sky  because,  in

reality, we have to face the daily grumblings and woes of

those  affected who will unceasingly question the  timing

of  such  an action and the high handed approach  of  the

PTC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All said, I am encouraged by the amended Motion that

will,  at  least, demonstrate to the ordinary folks  that

Parliament is a responsible and caring one, and will  not

hesitate to temper pains with necessary actions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amended Motion will signify to the public that,

indeed,  Parliament is not hearing impaired.   That  much

more  credibility this amended Motion would give  to  the

MPs  in  the  eyes  of the ordinary  folks.   Instead  of

walking  out  of this House with drooping  shoulders  and

hanging down heads after two days of intense debate,  the

MPs  would  be able to walk out of this House with  their

shoulders  thrown  backwards  and  heads  held  high  and

straight.   I  would urge that the PTC take heed  of  the

proposed amendment for a more relevant set of criteria to

be  put  in  place.  The MPs and the Government,  on  our

part, will take

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>

the  role  of clarifying and explaining to the ground  to

get their buy-in through better communication.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the amendments to the

Motion.

amongst  many Singaporeans over the recent fare revision.

I  fully  understand  and empathise with  the  sentiments

expressed  by  the Members and by the general  public  as

well.   Like  the other Members here, I too had  to  face

unhappy constituents and community leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is good to have the chance to thoroughly

discuss  this  issue in the House.  For  Members  to  not

voice  the sentiments of the ground, especially when  the

unhappiness appears to be so widespread, would  undermine

our  credibility as representatives of the  people.   The

Members have raised many valid points and questions.  But

there  were also many misconceptions.  Some MPs, like  Mr

Ong  Ah  Heng and Mr Iswaran, have eloquently  helped  to

enlighten the House, and I commend them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to present some of the

pertinent  facts and further clarify the various  issues.

By having the full facts and picture, we can then discuss

the  public transport policies in a rational and  logical

manner and arrive at the right conclusion.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I got the Motion, I thought I had better

prepare myself and asked PTC for the full details on  how

they  came  to  the  decision.  I shall  start  with  the

question  on  the  need  for the fare  revision.   Is  it

justified, and why now, and not six months' time, or even

a year later, as some MPs have suggested?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first inform Members that what I have

ascertained  is  that  PTC does  closely  scrutinise  the

financial performance and the increase in operating costs

of  the public transport operators in the preceding year,

when considering the fare increases for the current year.

They  also  do take into consideration the state  of  the

economy,  how  is it impacting on the people,  especially

the  commuters  who form the lower level  of  the  social

economic  group,  and  they try to  make  sure  that  the

interests of both are safeguarded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By looking at the actual facts, the PTC is then able

to  make  a  decision  based on the  performance  of  the

previous  year,  and not on projections for  the  current

year.  Because, if the PTC were to base the fare increase

for this year on what the public transport operators have

projected  as the increase in cost for this  year,  their

figures  will be very hard to answer for or justify.   So

PTC has taken the right approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us scrutinise the cost increase of the previous

year  in  order to consider whether or not  to  allow  an

increase  this year.  Sir, the PTC found that,  in  2001,

the  operating  costs of the operators had  increased  by

6.9%  on  average.  The recent fare revision, as  Members

know, will increase the revenues of the bus companies  by

2.3%.   The  revision  will,  therefore,  only  partially

offset the increase in operating costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also inform Members that costs had also gone

up  significantly in year 2000 by 8.5%.  But  because  we

were in recession last year, PTC decided not to allow  an

across-the-board  increase  to  cater  for   that   large

increase  in costs.  It only allowed feeder bus  services

to  increase  the  feeder fares by 10  cents.   And  this

resulted  in  a  general  increase  of  1%  in  the   bus

companies' revenues.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this means that over the past two years,

despite  the  economic downturn, costs for the  transport

operators had gone up by over 15%.  But with this  year's

increase  of 2.3%, total fares for the two years together

would  have gone up a total of only 3.3%.  The  PTC  has,

therefore,  looked after the interests of  the  commuters

very well by not allowing the PTOs to pass through to the

commuters much of the impact of the cost increases.

<br><br><i>Wage Costs</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members have asked - surely wage costs would

have gone down?  Based on the figures I have quoted, what

has  led  to  the  increase in the costs?   The  PTC  has

explained  that the main cost factors were, indeed,  wage

costs and service improvements.  Public transport is very

labour  intensive, with manpower costs  making  up  about

half  of  the PTOs' total operating costs.  In  the  year

2000, average wage costs for transport workers went up by

8.3%,  partly because of the 2% CPF restoration.  Mr  Tan

Soo  Khoon  had  asked  whether the PTOs  exercised  wage

restraint last year, just like SIA.  I am very  happy  to

inform   the   House  that,  last  year,  the   transport

companies,  workers  and executives did  indeed  exercise

wage restraint. As a result, wages last year went down by

3.4%.    But   because   of  the  4%   CPF   contribution

restoration, this pushed the wage costs up  by  0.6%  for

the  bus  companies.  That meant that over  the  two-year

period,  wage costs for the PTOs went up about 9%.   This

is despite the downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some Members may be surprised by this. Let me

now  quote  to Members the figures from the  Ministry  of

Manpower.   MOM's  data  shows  that  wage  increases  in

Singapore  averaged  6.6% in 2000, and  1.1%  last  year.

Total  increase for the two years was 7.7%.   And  if  we

include  the  6%  CPF restoration, total  wages  for  the

employers  would have gone up by about 13.7%.  Therefore,

the  PTOs, transport workers and executives have actually

exercised wage restraint by holding the increase in  wage

costs to only 9%, well below the national average.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have heard from Mr Ong Ah Heng. We have

also  heard from Mr Ng Ser Miang.  But I think Mr Ong  Ah

Heng's  views  should  be well listened  to,  because  he

represents the workers and he knows what life is like for

them.   We  must be fair to the transport workers.   They

have  taken  a  wage restraint last year, but  we  cannot

continue  to  deprive  them of  what  other  workers  are

enjoying.  Otherwise, good workers will not want to  work

for  the  transport companies and, in the end,  commuters

will be worse off.  And, as we have heard from Mr Ong  Ah

Heng  and Mr Ng Ser Miang, the bus companies already have

huge difficulties recruiting bus drivers.  Today, even in

the  midst of the recovery, when we hear many people  are

looking  for jobs, there are still 200 bus driver's  jobs

going a-begging.

<br><br><i>Service Improvements</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another key component of the cost increase is

service  improvements.  The key service improvements  are

those  that are made to meet requests from commuters  for

more frequent services, and new bus services to serve new

HDB  towns.  Unfortunately, service improvements  do  not

come cheap.  As a guide, it costs the operators $500  per

day  to  run  an  additional bus,  and  this  amounts  to

$200,000  a year.  So, each time we ask for the frequency

to be increased, to add in more buses, each bus will cost

the  company  $200,000 a year.  If  that  additional  bus

leads  to  a  higher ridership, that is all right.   But,

unfortunately, it is usually the same pool of people  who

take that service.  So, the additional frequency may  not

lead to a comparable increase in revenue.  What about the

introduction of a new bus service?  Sir, the PTC tells me

that  it  costs $3.5 million a year for the bus companies

to introduce a new service.  Over the last two years, the

PTOs had a net increase of seven new services.

<br><br><i>Productivity Improvements</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some Members have also pointed out that the

PTOs should try to improve

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>

productivity  rather than rely on fare revisions.   After

all,  that  is the common thing that every company  does.

When it is faced with a downturn, it will look for better

ways  to  improve productivity.  As Minister Mah and  SMS

Khaw  had explained, we do expect the PTOs to do more  to

improve productivity, but we must also be realistic.  The

easy  improvements have all been made: one-man  operation

in  the earlier years; next, the bus companies went on to

larger  capacity  buses.   That  helped  to  improve  the

productivity of the bus drivers.  But there is a limit to

how  much  bigger the buses can go.  We have got  double-decker; we cannot go triple-decker.  So, there is a limit

now  to the easy increases in productivity.  And the  bus

has  only  one  driver.  We cannot cut it down  to  half.

Maybe  one of these days, in the far future, we may  have

driverless  buses,  just like we have driverless  trains.

But that day is going to be very far in the future for us

to  even think about.  So productivity is going to  be  a

difficult challenge, but we will nonetheless push the bus

companies to strive for it.

<br><br><i>Profitability</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another hot topic inside and outside the House,

in  fact, a very hot topic, is the profitability  of  the

operators.  Mr Iswaran had given us a good lecture, and I

hope  Members have heard clearly what he had said.   Yes,

the  operators  are  profitable.  Yes,  they  are  making

millions  of dollars.  Should the simple conclusion  then

be  that  since  they are making plenty  of  money,  they

should  not  be allowed to increase fares?  Some  Members

even go further, and argue that the PTOs are providing  a

public service and, therefore, they should not be profit-making.   The  question  we  need  to  ask  is:  are  the

companies indeed profiteering?  Are the profits excessive

or are they reasonable?  And should we squeeze them until

they  are  losing  money and are on the  verge  of  being

commercially not viable before we allow them an increase?

How  would  this  enable them to provide  a  satisfactory

level  of service to the commuters?  How would this serve

the long-term interests of the commuters?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me again give Members some facts. Members

will recall that the operating costs of the PTOs went  up

by  6.9%  in  2001, while fares only went up by  1%  last

year.   Consequently, the profit margins of the operators

dropped  significantly last year.  The after tax  profits

of  SBS Transit dropped from $51 million in 2000, to  $40

million  in 2001.  TIBS fared badly, dropping  from  $8.4

million  in  2000,  to  only  $2.7  million  last   year.

Similarly, SMRT, which did not enjoy a fare increase last

year,  saw  its  profits drop by almost half,  from  $111

million  to $67 million last year.  Yes, they  are  still

profitable and are still making millions.

<br><br><i>ROTA</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But profits must be measured relative to the level

of the investments needed. The figures are huge.  SBS has

total  assets  of over $500 million; TIBS has  over  $270

million; and SMRT, $1.4 billion, ie, $1,400 million worth

of assets.  Yesterday, we had a long lecture also from Mr

Tan  Soo Khoon on the return on equity (ROE) of SBS.  ROE

is really not a good measure of how effectively a company

is  using its assets.  The better measurement is ROTA, or

Return  on Total Assets.  ROTA is calculated by  dividing

the  earnings  before interest payments  by  their  total

assets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the three operators, SBS had the best ROTA, of

8.6  % last year.  In comparison, TIBS had 2.9% ROTA, and

SMRT, 4.8%.  I think the financial analysts will tell  us

that  the  rate  of  return for SBS  in  2001  is  fairly

healthy,   but  the  rate  of  return  for  the  combined

SMRT/TIBS  is  on  the low to very low side.   In  actual

fact, the performance of the two bus companies would have

been  even lower, if not for two Government measures that

we  implemented  in  1998.  Let  me  go  into  these  two

measures.

<br><br><i>Road Tax Reduction</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the vehicle tax rationalisation

exercise.  This was part of the Government's cost-cutting

exercise.   But it was also to offset the impact  of  the

ERP on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>

public  buses.  The road tax for buses was  reduced  from

$5,500  to  $1,600 for the single-decked  buses,  and  to

$2,000  for the double-decker buses.  Arising from  this,

the  two bus companies enjoyed a combined savings of some

$13  million a year.  SBS alone accounted for  about  $10

million of the savings.

<br><br><i>Extension of Bus Lifespan</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second important measure was the extension

of  the  statutory lifespan of buses from 12 to 15 years.

This  was  again done in mid-1998.  This means  that  for

three years, from 1998 to mid-2001, the bus companies had

a double benefit.  First, they could continue using buses

which  would  otherwise have to be  disposed  of.   These

buses  are  fully depreciated, ie, they could use  assets

which,  in effect, were already free.  Second, they  were

able to save the money which they would otherwise have to

use  to  buy the new replacement buses.  This means  that

they  saved on the depreciation, plus they were  able  to

earn  interest on the money which they did  not  have  to

spend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show Members the large amount of money involved,

SBS  spends about $80 million a year to replace its fleet

of  buses.  In terms of savings on depreciation, and  the

interest earned on the money which they did not  have  to

spend, it comes up to $10 million or thereabouts a  year.

And  because  this  is additive, ie, every  year  another

batch is saved, and they have the additional benefit from

that  batch saved.  The savings alone for the third year,

ie, in 2001, is about $25 million.  So, just for the year

2001, they could save $25 million just on this measure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these two policy changes have helped enhance

the  profitability of the bus companies, not  because  of

fare  increases or productivity improvements.  These  two

measures alone would have saved them a lot of money.   In

fact, one only has to look at their financial performance

in 1997 to get a sense of how well the bus companies were

doing  without this assistance.  In 1997, SBS only earned

$21 million and had a ROTA of only 4.4%.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>

Without the Government coming in, they were earning  only

4.4% ROTA in 1997.  TIBS made only $1.7 million, and  had

a  ROTA of 2.3%.  And that was after they had a big  fare

increase of 8.5% that year.  If we look at those figures,

I  do  not  think, fundamentally, that the companies  are

really doing that well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is more important for the public is that

because  of these two Government measures, we had  helped

to  prevent  a price hike in 1998. And in 1999,  the  bus

companies were even able to pass to commuters the savings

from  the 10% CPF cut, which they did through a  5%  fare

rebate.  Mr Tan Soo Khoon and Dr Tan Cheng Bock had asked

about this. Yes, they did do their part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, however, the impact of the lifespan extension

began  to  diminish from mid-2001. That means, from  then

on,  they  would  have  to start replacing  their  buses,

because the extended buses would have reached 15 years of

age  already.   This means that this year, which  is  the

full  first  year  of  impact,  cost  must  go  up  quite

significantly.   As I mentioned just now, the  impact  of

the lifespan extension is $10 million a year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the more fundamental question would be whether

the  transport  operators, who  are  providing  a  public

service,  should even be making money.  Sir, it is  wrong

to  think  that just because they are providing a  public

service,  they  should  not  be profit-oriented,  because

profit-oriented  is not profiteering-oriented.   We  must

remember  that any operating entity, whether  it  is  for

profit  or not-for-profit, must earn a reasonable  return

if  it  is  to  provide  a satisfactory  service  to  its

customers.   This  is  even more  so  for  the  transport

industry,  which  is  a very asset and  capital-intensive

industry.   It  needs to have enough  revenues  to  cover

operating costs, and to generate enough reserves to renew

its  operating  assets.  Luckily, the  present  PTOs  are

profit-making, so they have reserves.  If they  are  not-for-profit  operations today, the full  impact  of  their

cost increases over the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>

last two years would have to be passed through in full to

our commuters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some Members questioned why the PTC has to

ensure  the  financial viability of the PTOs. After  all,

other  companies are not guaranteed of viability.  As  Dr

Wang  Kai  Yuen has rightly pointed out, this is  because

the public transport sector is a regulated sector, and we

have to regulate it because there are only two operators.

We, therefore, have to regulate them to prevent them from

making  excessive profits.  Sir, these two are definitely

not  normal  companies, in the sense of what Mr  Inderjit

Singh  had talked about yesterday.  Normal companies  are

able to set their own rates based on what the market  can

bear.   When  times are good, they can up  their  product

price  by 10%, 15% or 20%, whatever the market can  bear.

I am sure that if the PTOs have this freedom, fares today

would  be much higher, at least 50%, if not double.   But

because  we regulate them from having excessive  profits,

the regulator also has the obligation to look after their

commercial  viability.   Otherwise,  who  would  want  to

invest  in  such  a sector, or even lend money  to  them?

Parliament recognised this in 1987, and that  is  why  we

charged  the  PTC with the responsibility to also  ensure

the viability of the operators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there seems to be some misunderstanding about

the  CPI  +  X  formula  which is used  to  regulate  the

operators.   Some Members seem to be under the impression

that   because  we  have  the  formula,  the  fares   are

automatically   given.  The  fare   increases   are   not

automatically  given, and the PTC has been  very  careful

about  that.   This  is  the formula  that  PTC  uses  to

determine  what is the maximum that they can approve  for

the  fare  revision, should the PTC decide  that  a  fare

revision is warranted.  Some Members have asked  what  is

"X". It seems to be a magic figure. Why is it 1.5%?  Sir,

"X"  takes into consideration the manpower cost increases

and  productivity  improvements.  In  deriving  the  wage

increases,  PTC took a look at the historical levels  and

tried  to  project  forward  in  terms  of  what  is  the

expectation   for  the  future.  PTC   also   took   into

consideration the point that the bus

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>

companies must achieve productivity improvements.  So PTC

discounted the amount of the salary increase factor  that

should be provided in the "X".  That is how it arrived at

a  level of 1.5%.  If you look at it, other than the last

two  years  where,  because of the  recession,  the  wage

increases  have gone down, I think 1.5% is,  in  fact,  a

very  conservative estimate of the impact of labour  cost

increases,   taking   into   consideration   productivity

improvements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point is whether the operators should

even  be  profit-driven, ie, make profits but do  not  be

profit-driven.  Sir, as SMS Khaw Boon Wan had pointed out

yesterday,  it  is  good that the operators  are  profit-driven.  This motivates them to innovate and to look  for

ways  to improve productivity and, hopefully, that  would

flow down to the profits.  Otherwise, if they are paid on

a  cost-recovery basis, there is really no need for  them

to  crack their heads and do better.  But while their job

is  to  be  profit-driven,  the  key  that  Members  must

remember  is  that  we still have the  PTC  guarding  the

goalpost on behalf of the commuters.

<br><br><i>Timing of Fare Increase</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the issue of timing.

Questions have been asked why now, why not later?   After

all,  we are just recovering from the recession.  Members

have admitted that there is never really a good time  for

a  fare increase, let alone finding the best time.   Even

when  the  economic  growth  is  strong,  fare  increases

invariably  attract tremendous amount of criticisms.   We

have  established  the  PTC, and we  have  given  it  the

responsibility   to  safeguard  the  interests   of   the

commuters.   In  this,  it has  done  very  well.   As  I

mentioned,  it  also  has to be  fair  to  the  transport

operators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot have a situation of "heads I win, tails

you lose".  The key is to ensure that the PTC is able  to

study  what  has led to the cost increases faced  by  the

operators,  and  whether these are valid  factors.   Have

they  made  good  efforts to improve  productivity?   And

after satisfying

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>

itself that an increase is warranted, to proceed to allow

an  appropriate  fare revision.  And if  the  economy  is

weak,  as the PTC has realised, to keep the fare increase

to  the  bare minimum - again, in this case, it has  done

so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of Mr Tan Soo Khoon's arguments against an

increase now was that our economic recovery is still very

shaky, and may not even hold.  I think the economic  data

released  by  MTI this morning does give us something  to

cheer  about -- not very much, but it is still  something

to cheer about.  Our real GDP grew by 10.3% in the second

quarter,  and this compares very well against  the  first

quarter  growth  of  8.4%. So 8.4% growth  in  the  first

quarter,  10.3%  in the second quarter.   Of  course,  we

cannot  guarantee that the rest of the year will be  even

better  but, at least, at the present moment,  the  trend

line is certainly looking good.  And even if it holds  at

this level, we would have done well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some have argued that the timing is bad because

of  the  high unemployment.  I agree with that  argument.

Yes,  many Singaporeans are unemployed and many have been

retrenched, and others are fearing for their jobs  today.

Like  all  Members, I am concerned.  But  whilst  we  are

concerned,  we  should look to see how  we  can  actually

focus  our  help  towards those  who  really  need  help.

Trying to help them with a blunt instrument, like holding

the  fare increase, is not going to help them very  much.

Let us look for real ways.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, indeed, is what the Government has been doing,

together  with  the unions and the employers.  There  are

many  schemes  available  at  the  various  levels.   For

example,  the unions have been playing a very  big  part.

They  have been actively helping their retrenched workers

to  go for retraining and skills upgrading, so that  they

can  get  a new job. Hopefully with higher level  skills,

they can even get better paying jobs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are having financial difficulties, the

unions  have  also chipped in to provide  some  financial

assistance.   At  the  Government and  community  levels,

there are also multiple schemes available.  Some examples

are  the  recently  introduced Economic  Downturn  Relief

Scheme  (EDRS)  and some old schemes like  the  Rent  and

Utilities  Assistance Scheme (RUAS) and, of  course,  the

good  old  Public  Assistance  (PA)  for  those  who  are

genuinely unable to work.  At the community level,  there

is  a  network  of "Many Helping Hands".  Many  CCCs  are

providing financial help through their welfare funds.   I

know,  because I monitor what we do in our  GRC  and  the

five  MPs in our GRC do give up quite a fair bit  of  aid

through our welfare fund.  Even our PCF kindergartens are

chipping  in  to  waive,  either in  full  or  partially,

kindergarten  fees.  And starting from 1st  January  next

year, those facing financial hardship can also tap on the

Economic  Restructuring Shares  (ERS).   I  think  for  a

family of four, it would provide quite substantial  help.

So,  it is better that we look at ways to help those  who

are  directly  in  need, and do it in  a  meaningful  and

substantial way, so that they do not have to worry  about

the  one  or two cents that they have to pay for the  bus

fare increases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while we have a lot of schemes to help the

unemployed, how would this affect those who are employed?

Would  it  be a big impact on them?  Sir, to do that,  we

have  to look in terms of how the fares have gone up  for

the  last few years.  As I mentioned just now, the  fares

have actually lagged behind salary increases.  But if  we

look over the past 15 years, the increase in the cost  of

travel  has lagged even further behind the national  wage

growth.   Just now, Mr Ravindran asked for actual figures

on how much the fares have actually gone up by.  Salaries

have  gone  up by 136% over the last 15 years.   But  how

much  have  the fares actually gone up by?  Sir,  I  will

quote him the average bus ride of 8 kilometres.  In 1987,

an  8-kilometre bus ride cost 90 cents.  Today, that same

ride,  with  the  recent increase, would cost  $1.03,  an

increase of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>

14%  over  the  past 15 years.  If we look at  the  train

ride,  the  train ride has gone up a little bit  further,

because 1987 was the start of the MRT system.  The  train

ride  has  gone up 30%, from 80 cents to $1.04 today.   I

think  Members  would agree that these figures  are  very

reasonable and well below the salary increases enjoyed by

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which Mr Iswaran brought up is that

affordability  is  not  just about percentage  increases.

Affordability is how much the families are paying as part

of their family expenditure. And has it gone up today, or

has  it gone down?  Sir, I have only two sets of figures,

1998 and 1988.  In 1988, public transport formed 5.1%  of

household expenditures.  In 1998, ten years later, it has

not  gone  up.   It  has gone down  to  4%  of  household

expenditures.  So the impact of public transport  on  the

family  pocket has actually diminished over the  last  10

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Amy Khor stated that there is now a

perception that the PTC has tilted fully in favour of the

transport operators.  Sir, she is totally wrong, and  the

ground  perception is also totally wrong.  The  data  has

shown otherwise.  On the contrary, Members and the public

should  be  thanking  the PTC for  having  protected  the

commuters so well.  And I think we also should thank  the

transport  operators for being productive  and  efficient

and  making the low fares possible.  But some Members may

ask,  "How can we be sure that the fares are reasonable?"

They  may  be  affordable, but are they high compared  to

elsewhere?   Are  they reasonable?  Sir, we  can  compare

against, say, Hong Kong, which has a similar standard  of

living.  The population is similar, except that they  are

double  ours,  and  we all know in the  public  transport

sector, economy of scale is important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Tan Soo Khoon also brought up the

example  of  the  Kowloon Motor Bus  Company  (KMB).   He

quoted some figures and all that.  Sir, let me go  on  to

the  Kowloon Motor Bus Company.  KMB is bigger than  SBS.

KMB has a total of 3,700 buses compared to about 2,800-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>

2,900  in  SBS.  But, despite the advantages of a  bigger

population, a bigger bus fleet, I am glad to  inform  the

House that our bus fares are still cheaper.  Let me  give

Members some comparison.  The fare for a 3 kilometre ride

for  KMB is 80 cents.  This is in Singapore dollars,  not

Hong  Kong dollars.  This is almost 30% higher  than  our

new  starting  fare of 63 cents.  And this  is  the  good

part.  For a 35 kilometre trip, which is our maximum, KMB

charges S$3.05 cents per ride.  Those of you who ride the

bus  will know that in Singapore, for that distance,  our

commuters only pay $1.53 cents, half the price of KMB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Tan also touted the competitiveness of the

PTOs  in  Hong  Kong.  He  said that  when  the  new  MTR

extension was opened, the MTR reduced prices to  undercut

the  bus  fares.  And then KMB countered attack  by  also

reducing  prices,  and  offering free  meals.   I  cannot

remember.  Is it KMB or is it MTR?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> MTR.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> MTR. And he said that our PTOs

should  therefore not hide behind the skirts of the  PTC,

and  only  know how to increase fares.  Sir, if only  SBS

and  TIBS were able to charge the same high fares as Hong

Kong, I am sure that when they heard that yesterday, they

must have been groaning away about how lucky they are  in

Hong  Kong.  I am sure that if they can charge  the  same

fares  as  in  Hong Kong, they will also have  plenty  of

scope  to  offer special discounts too.  If I am charging

50%  more,  I will be very happy to offer a 20% discount,

and end up looking good all the way to the bank.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Tan also mentioned that in Hong Kong, the

bus  operators give value for money.  If charging  up  to

double  what the Singapore bus companies are charging  is

giving  value  for  money, then I think Singaporeans  are

going  to  be  in trouble.  The fact is that Singaporeans

are already getting the best value for money from our bus

operators.  First, minimal price increases over the  last

15  years.   I  quoted 14% increase for the  average  bus

ride.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>

When  I think of my hawker food prices, the bus companies

have  been even more competitive than my hawker  who  has

charged me a lot more over the last 10 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, second, we have a quality of service that other

bus  companies envy.  Comfortable air-conditioned  buses,

with  few breakdowns.  Yes, there are breakdowns,  but  I

can  assure you, in Singapore, the breakdowns are far and

few  in between.  Of course, the commuters would like the

bus  companies  to  do  better.   And  I  think  the  bus

companies  should continually endeavour to  do  so.   But

there  is always the cost implication.  And I would  urge

commuters to exercise caution and prudence.  The more you

want, unfortunately, must end up in you paying more.  So,

let  us  have  a  better  balance between  wanting  more,

wanting better services, and being prepared to pay.

<br><br><i>Conclusion on Fare Increases</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now sum up on why it was necessary to

increase the transport fares.  First, costs have gone  up

by  15%  over  the  last two years, and  because  of  the

recession last year, PTC rejected the request of the PTOs

for a general fare increase, and only increased fares  to

allow  a  1% increase in revenue.  This year,  PTC  again

moderated the increase to 2.3%.  And while the  PTOs  are

still profitable, the rate of return is only moderate, to

very  low.  But the indicators are that this increase  of

2.3% will only allow them to partially cover the expected

cost  increases this year.  It is therefore unlikely that

the   bus   companies  would  be  able  to  achieve   the

spectacular  results of the last three  years.   Sir,  as

such, the PTC has decided to increase the fares by 3 to 5

cents  per ride for those who are using ez-link  card  or

the  magnetic card, and 10 cents for cash.  The  PTC  has

made  the  decision.  The Ministry agrees  with  the  PTC

because we also feel that, whilst the timing may  not  be

the best, the increase is certainly not excessive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, PTC has also adopted the principle of granting

small fare increases rather

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>

than  having a big and very painful increase  once  every

few  years.  All price increases inflict some  pain.   We

all know that.  The PTC's approach is a less painful one.

I  would  therefore  urge Members to  support  the  PTC's

principle of small fare increases on a regular basis  and

avoid  having to impose a larger one later on.   The  PTC

has  taken its decision after taking in all the  relevant

factors.  The Government accepts the PTC's decision,  and

I hope Members will also give their support.

<br><br><i>ERP Exemption for Buses</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to some of the other points

brought  up  by Members.  ERP exemption for buses.   Some

Members have asked that we exempt the buses from the  ERP

system to encourage more people to switch from private to

public transport.  The objective of the ERP system is  to

manage  congestion  through road  pricing.   Buses,  like

other vehicles, also contribute to our congestion.   They

therefore must be subject to the ERP charges.  Otherwise,

to  exempt  them  will  only help to  distort  the  usage

pattern.  Let me give Members an example.  When going  to

Orchard Road, one can either use the train or he can take

a  bus.   The train does not cause any traffic  jam.   It

just   goes  underground.   But  buses  do.   We   should

encourage  more people to ride trains instead  of  buses,

and  encourage  the operators to run more  trains  rather

than more buses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ERP which buses pay, and which trains do

not,  is  the  way to do that - through the price  signal

that it sends.  In any case, the ERP charge per passenger

is  very  small,  compared to  the  ERP  charge  per  car

passenger.  So, imposing the ERP on the public  buses,  I

think,  will  not discourage people from  switching  from

their own cars to public transport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Tan Cheng Bock had also mentioned that the

ERP  charges  would not result in higher  cost.   He  had

asked me whether it is true.  Sir, he is correct.  It is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>

true.  As I mentioned just now, we have reduced the  road

tax  significantly to more than cover the cost of the ERP

charges.   The  bus operators would only incur  about  $4

million  a year in ERP charges.  We had reduced the  road

taxes by $13 million a year.  So it more than covers  the

ERP,  and  the bus companies have no grounds  at  all  to

complain about having to pay for the ERP.

<br><br><i>Competition</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to another hot topic, which is

competition.   Many people, both outside and  inside  the

House, take the view that public transport costs are high

today  due to the lack of competition.  Minister Mah  had

already  explained  yesterday  why  competition  in   the

transport  sector  would  not work,  and  so  had  Senior

Minister of State Khaw Boon Wan who also compared the bus

industry to the telecoms industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need not go any further than to look at SBS

and  TIBS.  Yes, they are not directly competing with one

another,  but  they  are running a  similar  system  with

similar cost structure.  SBS enjoys greater economies  of

scale.  SBS fleet is about 2,800.  I think the TIBS fleet

is about 800.  So, SBS is about slightly over three times

the  size  of TIBS.  And because SBS enjoys economies  of

scale, they have lower operating costs.  As a result, SBS

made  after tax profits of $39 million in 2001,  compared

to   TIBS'  profits  of  $2.7  million  the  same   year.

Therefore if we introduce full competition, yes,  it  may

look exciting, but what would be the actual impact?   You

are  going  to get fragmentation, you are going  to  have

small companies - companies that may be even smaller than

TIBS.   Are  they  going  to have lower  cost  than  SBS,

especially with SBS' sunk cost?  A lot of the assets they

occupy  are assets which they bought many years ago  when

prices  were  much lower.  I think not.   I  think  those

small  operators are going to end up with operating costs

even  higher  than TIBS.  And if we have competition,  we

must  not regulate the way we are doing today.   We  must

regulate with a very light touch and allow flexibility in

pricing.  If we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>

do  that,  I  think the smaller operators must eventually

end  up  charging  more because their costs  are  higher.

Therefore,  I  do  not  think  that  this  will  end   up

benefiting the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, and although our current bus

industry  framework  has served  us  well,  Members  will

remember  that in the last Budget debate, I informed  the

House   that  my  Ministry  is  open  to  the   idea   of

competition.   We  are, for a start,  prepared  to  allow

additional players to operate feeder services in the  HDB

estates,  and  we  will do that on a  pilot  basis.   Why

feeder  services?  It is because the area is defined.  It

is  easier  to  monitor. It is easier for  the  users  to

actually  compare between the two.  Sir, any new operator

who wants to do so will have the chance to compete on  an

equal  footing  with the incumbent,  and  they  need  not

implement  the new ez-link system in order  to  interface

with  the system.  They can save the expenses of the  ez-link  system if they wish to do so.  But as  there  is  a

measure  of uncertainty in the outcome of the pilot,  any

new  operator  who wishes to participate in  this  scheme

must first seek the support of the community in which  it

is  to operate in.  And I think the community must be led

by  the  MPs.  So if the MPs agree, they can talk to  the

operators  and they can then come to the PTC and  present

their  proposal to the PTC.  And I am sure the PTC  would

be very happy to give due consideration.

<br><br><i>Role of PTC</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the big topic of the role and

the  composition of the PTC.  As Dr Wang Kai Yuen and  Dr

Amy  Khor  have noted, the PTC has to operate within  the

parameters  set by the House.  One of the key  duties  of

the PTC is to review applications for fare revisions.  In

carrying out this role, it must safeguard the interest of

commuters.   But it also has to ensure the  viability  of

the  PTOs.   Because  fare revisions are  always  unhappy

events,  Parliament  set up the  PTC  as  an  independent

regulator.   This  way, the Council  is  not  subject  to

lobbying or pressure from either the public, the PTOs, or

politicians.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, this is what the PTC has done every year,

since it was formed 15 years ago.  It has taken its  role

very seriously.  The Council subjected every request  for

fare  revision  to  rigorous and thorough  analysis.   Mr

Ravindran  asked  whether they have think-tanks  and  all

that.   Sir, PTC has people from industry with  expertise

to  analyse  company reports and company operations,  who

are  able to sift through a whole ream of details to  get

to  the  real picture.  And after having done  all  these

analyses,  its decisions have always been more than  fair

to commuters.  I have mentioned all the figures just now,

so I shall not repeat them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can assure Members that the PTC's job is a

very difficult one.  I know, because each time I meet the

Chairman, after PTC has finalised its decision, I can see

the  worry  lines  on his forehead.   He  and  the  other

Council   members   certainly  do  agonise   over   their

deliberations  and  final  decisions.   They  take  their

responsibilities seriously, as they should.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the PTC is an important institution, one that

has served the people very well.  We should take care not

to  undermine  it,  as this would be tantamount  to  also

undermining the interest of the general public.  That  is

why  I  support the amendment by Dr Tan Boon Wan.  Having

said that, I must say I also agree with the views of  the

Members  here  that PTC's communication  process  can  be

improved  upon.  I will certainly ask my  staff  to  work

with PTC on how to achieve this.

<br><br><i>Composition of PTC</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members also spoke about the composition of the

PTC.   Some  asked  if  the Council members  took  public

transport.  Membership in the Council cannot be based  on

whether  one  uses public transport.  Having  said  that,

again,  I understand that several of the members  do  use

public  transport regularly.  In fact, one of  them  does

not  even  own  a  car.   Because the  PTC  has  a  heavy

responsibility,  we  have always chosen  Council  members

very  carefully.  They are usually people of high  repute

in the different sectors and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>

different   professions,  and  include  senior  managers,

accountants, professionals, social workers  and  a  union

representative.   They  bring to  the  Council  expertise

needed   for   the  deliberations  to  be   carried   out

professionally and properly.  These are people  who  have

busy  schedules.  And I can assure you this is not a very

popular  job.   I cannot remember who mentioned  it  just

now.   But we do have a tough time looking for the  right

people to serve on the Council.  Yet, they have agreed to

take the time and effort to serve on the Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have noted the suggestions of Members to

review  the  Council's membership and to see  if  we  can

strengthen   it   further,  eg,  with  additional   union

representatives  and grassroots leaders.   We  will  also

look into whether we should continue having the transport

operators  as Council members.  I will ask  my  staff  to

look into the various suggestions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Yeo, you have just about 5 minutes

before your hour is up.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> I am finishing, Sir. Just a few

more minutes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Members have spoken about the unhappiness

of  the public over what they perceive as price increases

for  a whole slew of public services.  The Government  is

indeed   aware  of  the  need  to  keep  public  services

affordable, and not to increase prices unless  absolutely

necessary.   Some  of the items mentioned,  like  utility

prices,  are really out of our control.  Oil is the  main

determinant  of the cost of generating electricity.   So,

when  oil prices go up, the price of power goes up.   But

when oil prices go down, I am sure Members have also seen

that power prices do go down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members may like to know that despite all these

increases  that we have talked about, MTI estimates  that

inflation  rate  this year will still be  close  to  "0".

Although the items may be many, in actual fact the impact

per  item  is  not  very  large.  Whilst  this  hike  may

increase it a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>

little   bit,   there  will  be  other  cost   reductions

elsewhere, and we will end up with about "0" inflation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, let me now move to some of

the points raised by Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start with Mr Tan Soo Khoon. I have replied

to  most  of  his points.  He has also talked  about  the

willingness of the school bus operators to forgo  a  fare

increase   now,  despite  the  increases   in   insurance

premiums,  and that they will only look into  it  in  the

future.   I checked into the fares charged by the  school

buses.   They range from about $30 to $120, depending  on

the  distance travelled.  These are much higher than what

the public bus services charge.  For example,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>

a primary school student can enjoy unlimited rides on our

public  buses any time of the day for a cost  of  $22.50.

As  such, if I were a private bus operator, I would  also

be   very  worried  if  I  have  to  increase  my  fares,

especially  if the fare increase is likely to  be  large.

The  speculation  in  the newspapers  is  that  the  fare

increase is likely to be between $10 and $40.  Sir,  this

is  not a 2.3% increase.  The fare increase is likely  to

be  in  the  region  of 30%.  If I  am  the  private  bus

operator,  I  will  also shelve the 30%  increase  today,

especially  after  all  the  complaints  about  the  2.3%

increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Tan Soo Khoon has also given some

suggestions  for the public transport operators  to  look

into.   And so has Mr Zainudin. They have asked the  PTOs

to  look  for  innovative ways to reward the  loyalty  of

commuters.   Sir, the PTOs are all here upstairs.   I  am

sure  they have heard and taken note of Mr Tan's  and  Mr

Zainudin's suggestions, and I will leave it to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong gave some feedback about the ez-link card. He said that the feedback given to him is

that the card is giving a lot of trouble, and there is  a

20%  failure  rate.   Sir, with  20%  failure  rate,  the

transport system will break down!

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> From one particular complainant.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> May be one particular

complainant.   Sir,  the fact is that  the  failure  rate

today  is about 1.5%.  But 1.5% is still high.  I am  not

happy, and I have asked TransitLink and the operators  to

look  into  it as quickly as they can, and to  bring  the

figure  down  rapidly.  But when I look at  the  magnetic

card  when  it was first introduced in 1990, I  was  told

then  that the failure rate, when it was introduced,  was

one  in ten or 10%, even higher.  In comparison, the  ez-link card is not doing badly, but there is plenty of room

for  improvement.  So we will pressure them to bring  the

quality of the system up.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang suggested that we nationalise and

subsidise public transport.  A lot of Members have joined

in to disagree with him.  I shall not belabour the point.

Sir,  to nationalise the two operators - SMRT and  SBS  - today  would  be  sending a very, very  wrong  signal  to

investors all over the world.  We will be one of the  few

countries in this day and age to go out to nationalise  a

company.   And  we  should  also  not  subsidise   public

transport  operations,  because public  transport  has  a

consumption factor in it.  If we subsidise, we are  going

to distort usage, and we are going to encourage even more

usage.  With our roads already being clogged up, I  think

we  should  do  our  best to minimise usage  rather  than

encourage usage by distorting the usage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah Yacob urged that we treat feeder

services differently from the trunk services because many

people  in  the heartland use it.  Sir, yes, I sympathise

with them.  But we have to look in terms of what are  the

resources needed to provide the feeder service.   Is  the

feeder   service  requiring  resources  which  are   very

different from the trunk services?  The answer is no.  In

actual  fact,  the feeder services are still  charging  a

flat  rate  of  63  cents today, despite  the  length  of

travel.   In that sense, the feeder bus riders are  being

treated specially compared to those who are on the  trunk

services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to Mr Yeo Guat Kwang. He

urged  the  LTA to allow the bus operators to keep  their

rental  income  to  offset the cost  of  maintaining  the

interchange,  ie,  to  give the bus  companies  the  same

treatment as SMRT.  The two sets of assets - the land and

the investment - come under two different treatments. And

that  is  why  for SMRT, we are able to give  the  entire

premises to SMRT and let them operate it as if they  have

leased  the  entire asset.  Unfortunately,  for  the  bus

operators,  we are not able to, but we are  looking  into

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay said that the 3 cents increase

for a rider who pays 60 cents is not a small increase, it

is a 5% increase.  Sir, I agree with him, but we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>

have  decided  to do it as an across-the-board  increase,

with equal pain for everybody, ie, no matter how far  you

ride,  the same increase applies.  We could do  it  on  a

percentage basis, but I think that would be a little  bit

messier.  In any case, for those who are taking the trunk

rides for 60 cents, I would like to inform the House that

the  60  cents charge for air-con services has  not  been

changed  since 1984.  So, those people who have  had  the

privilege of riding short distances have enjoyed the same

fare  for  over 17 years.  The 3 cents increase  in  this

present fare revision is a very fair one for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng mentioned about the Fuel Equalisation

Fund.  Sir, the Fuel Equalisation Fund was set up to help

the   operators  in  times  of  violent  and   short-term

fluctuations of the fuel price.  So, in this way,  if  it

goes   up   very  quickly  and  it  impinges   on   their

profitability,  they  can tap  into  the  Fund  for  some

relief.  This is because we do not want the bus companies

to  be  changing their bus fares every few  months,  just

like we do for the utilities.  It will be very confusing.

So,  this  is  meant to be a stabilisation fund,  and  it

should  not  be used to subsidise the fuel cost,  because

the  fuel  prices are going to remain high, I think,  for

quite some time to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Ng also tried to promote cycling as a cheaper

alternative.   Sir, I also like to cycle  as  a  form  of

exercise, but only when I want to have a good sweat  out.

In  Singapore, there are two reasons why cycling  is  not

really  feasible as a normal means of transport.   First,

our  weather  is  very, very punishing.   Even  with  the

breeze  blowing in your face, by the time you  arrive  in

the   office,  you  are  already  all  hot  and   sweaty.

Secondly,  to  promote  safe cycling,  we  need  to  have

cycling  lanes, specifically set aside for the  cyclists,

which is what Ms Irene Ng had also mentioned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unfortunately, in Singapore, we are already

scrambling to look for space for an additional car  lane,

let alone an additional cycling lane.  So this is an idea

that is not really feasible in the context

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>

of  our  local  environment.  But as a weekend  activity,

yes,  and I would urge MND to provide more riding  lanes,

to  link up the different parks so that those people  who

do  it  as a recreational activity, like me on a weekend,

can  cycle from one park to another.  I think this  is  a

very good idea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several Members have asked why do we not defer

the  fare  revision  until the ez-link  system  has  been

implemented because of the speculation that it  is  going

to  cut  down  on people cheating the bus companies,  and

therefore  is  going to lead to an increase in  revenues.

If this is true, it would impact on this year's operating

cost,  and  that  would be good news for  commuters  next

year.   So, let us implement the ez-link system  and  see

whether  there are actual savings coming from the system.

If so, next year's fares may not have to increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me go on to some other points. Ms Braema

and  Mr  Arthur  Fong asked that we look  into  providing

buses that are friendly to the disabled, buses that  will

kneel  down in order for those who are in wheelchairs  to

board  the  buses. This is a concept which is  applicable

only  if  that  bus service is not meant  to  be  a  high

capacity  service.  In Singapore, we  need  to  move  the

buses  along as rapidly as we can. In fact, the  PTC  and

the  bus companies are always looking for ways to see how

we  can  speed up the time taken for people to board  the

bus  and to come down from the bus.  That is why we  have

the ez-link card, and why we have the bigger doors in the

public buses.  I think this system will not be applicable

for Singapore, as it stands today, because for the bus to

tilt and for the bus driver to come down and all that, it

will lead to tremendous delays.  I think it is better for

NCSS  to  work  with MCDS to come up with an  appropriate

system  for transporting the disabled.  But, nonetheless,

I  will  request  the bus operators to  continue  to  see

whether they have another solution.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have finished with the replies. Let

me now conclude.  We have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>

heard  from  many MPs reflecting the unhappiness  at  the

ground  level.  The accusations are very wide  ranging  - from  the  Government not listening  to  the  people,  an

uncaring  PTC,  an  uncaring  Government,  as   well   as

profiteering by the bus companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can assure Singaporeans that the Government

does  listen carefully.  The Government also  has  a  big

caring heart about the welfare of Singaporeans.  That  is

why  when  the  Asian economic crisis hit  in  1997,  the

Government  quickly moved to put together  a  package  of

measures to help relieve the pain.  It also put in  place

a  wide-ranging package of measures to help  upgrade  the

skills  of  workers  and help them  remain  relevant  and

employable in the years ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, when it comes to public transport, the

Government has also devoted a lot of resources and energy

to  make  sure that we have an excellent land and  public

transport  system.  Those who have travelled abroad  will

know  that  our public transport is one that is  hard  to

find  elsewhere, in terms of quality and price.  We  have

heard  the  unhappiness, and we can  certainly  empathise

with  the  sentiments.   But it is important  for  public

policy to be made on the proper basis, based on the long-term interests of the people and the nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must state the facts clearly and accurately. And

where  the perceptions are wrong, we must be prepared  to

explain  and clarify.  This debate has certainly provided

plenty of opportunities for all of us to do so.  This  is

not  the first time that a fare revision has taken place,

and  it will definitely not be the last.  The PTC and the

bus  companies  must therefore improve the  communication

process  so  that the rationale for the fare revision  is

clearly  understood, and the people know, in no uncertain

terms,  that  the  PTC has once again  safeguarded  their

interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a good regulatory and physical public

transport  system in place.  It may not be the  best,  as

some Members

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>

have pointed out, and therefore there is always room  for

improvement.   This  we shall do.  But  we  must  proceed

carefully, as our public transport system would not  have

developed so well, in terms of both quality and  pricing,

if the fundamentals were wrong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Tan Boon Wan's amendment will reassure the

public  about  the role of the PTC, while preserving  the

Council's  independence.   I  am  happy  to  support  his

amendment.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  speak  on  Dr Tan Boon Wan's  amendment.   When

speaking  on  this  motion, I asked myself  whether  this

debate  moved  by  Mr  Tan  Soo Khoon  has  achieved  the

objectives  that he and a group of us have set  out.   We

have  listened to the Minister.  He has given  a  lot  of

explanations.  It is not only by him, but by  the  former

Minister  for Communications and the Senior  Minister  of

State  for  Transport on the need for the price increase.

A lot of explanations have been given and we do hope that

the public will receive these explanations well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am not so sure whether people understand

the  CPI + X factor.  I know the Senior Minister of State

for  Transport has said that if we really understand  the

formula,  all things will be solved.  I think there  will

be another session for this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have set out three objectives. The first

objective  is to let the Government know of the sentiment

and  the  feel of the ground.  We have achieved  this  in

this debate.  I guess we have done very well hearing from

all my parliamentary colleagues.  We could feel that they

have  expressed the true feelings of the ground  and,  to

sum  it  up,  do  not  take them for  granted.   And  the

Minister  has  already given us his assurance  that  they

will listen, and we do hope that the message has been put

across to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have another objective, which is to let the

transport   operators  show  to  the  ground   that   the

efficiency is not at the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>

expense of the general commuter.  Again, judging from the

numerous  suggestions and requests  made  by  Members  of

Parliament  in this House, I think the message  has  also

been  put  across to them.  We also want to let PTC  know

that we want more transparency.  And, again, judging from

all  the  various  suggestions, I think the  message  has

already  been given to them. They will know that this  is

an important request, coupled with a better communication

process,  as suggested by the Minister, would put  things

right in future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two limbs to this original motion and Dr

Tan  Boon  Wan amended the first limb.  He also included,

in  his  amendment,  PM's call for his  support  for  the

principle  of PTC granting small increases.  I  think  we

have no objection to that.  As for his other amendment in

lines 5 and 6, we also have no objection, except that  we

would  like to see the order of the two factors  that  he

put  to  this House reversed. Can I refer Members to  his

amendment?   Item 3, the third and the fourth  lines,  it

says,  "to take into consideration relevant factors  such

as  the  viability of the public transport operators  and

affordability of the commuters."  I think the reverse  is

more  correct.   Because  if  we  were  to  look  at  his

amendment,  it  would  seem that  we  are  favouring  the

transport operators.  For us, our concern, as Members  of

this House, is that the commuters should come first.   So

we  will  reverse  the  order  -  "affordability  of  the

commuters"  should come first, followed by "viability  of

the public transport operators.".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment, however, fails to address two

important issues which have been dealt with at length  by

Members  of this House.  One is the state of the economy.

I  do  not want to discuss this at length because so much

has been spoken and so many figures have been given.   We

all  know the state of the economy.  The other one is the

unemployment situation.  Figures have been thrown  out  - 88,000  from  the  Deputy Prime Minister  in  the  Budget

debate, and my colleague,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>

Mr  Tan  Soo  Khoon  gave a figure of 100,000.   So,  the

unemployment  situation is an important consideration  in

any future fare increase by the bus operators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make an amendment to Dr Tan

Boon Wan's amendment, to take into consideration all  the

three points that I have brought up.  Can I refer Members

to  lines 5 and 6 again?  With my amendment, item (3)  of

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan's amendment would read as follows:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In lines 5 and 6, to leave out the words, "to

review  its decision on the increase in public  transport

fares",  and  there to insert the words, "when  reviewing

requests  for  fare increases, to take into consideration

relevant  factors such as the state of the  economy,  the

employment situation, the affordability of the  commuters

and the viability of the public transport operators;".

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Tan, before you proceed, can I ask

Dr  Tan  Boon Wan whether he accepts the reversal of  the

words "affordability" and "viability"?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Could you now move your amendment, Dr

Tan?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, I beg to move an amendment

to item (3) of the amendment moved by Dr Tan Boon Wan, as

follows:   In Item (3), line 3, after the word  "as",  to

insert  the  words,  "the  state  of  the  economy,   the

employment situation,".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope Members will support this amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It has been proposed by Dr Tan Cheng

Bock,  as an amendment to the original amendments,  after

the  word  "as", to insert the words, "the state  of  the

economy, the employment situation,".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that the debate on the original amendments

and the amendment to the original amendments be proceeded

with  simultaneously.  Therefore, Members  can  speak  on

both these amendments at this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when Dr Tan Boon

Wan  moved  his  amendment, Dr  Tan  Cheng  Bock  and  I,

together  with a few others who had supported my original

Motion,  had  a  quick discussion.  I promise  Members  I

would  not  take too long, but I think Dr Tan Cheng  Bock

could  not  have put forward the reasons for  moving  his

amendment more eloquently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not repeat what he has said, but I would like

to say, after listening to the Members who have spoken on

Dr  Tan Boon Wan's amendment, that it is important for us

to  focus  on the process of decision making by the  PTC.

After  listening to the response of Mr Yeo Cheow Tong,  I

think  that  the  concern has been addressed,  especially

with  regard  to the question of timing.  The  sentiments

expressed  in this House in the last two days  have  been

that the timing was perhaps a bit off.  And when we spoke

of  timing,  we  were  referring to  the  very  difficult

economic  situation that confronts the  country  and  our

people.   We were also very concerned with the fact  that

there  were so many people who were out of job.  I  think

the  addition  of the words put in by Dr Tan  Cheng  Bock

does address the concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will, therefore, go along with the amendment moved

by  Dr Tan.  I hope the House will agree, and we can then

proceed with the debate on the amended Motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wish  to  speak on the amended Motion.  Sir,  I  rise  to

oppose both amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, when I spoke on the Motion in the House,

I pointed out that the crux of the issue on the increases

in  public transport fares and other increases in  public

services is the result of the attitude and policy of  the

PAP  Government  in providing public services.   Although

the Minister for Transport has explained the rationale, I

am still not convinced that this is the best model.  With

a   nationalised  organisation  to  run   the   transport

services,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>

I believe that it may be more efficient with economies of

scale, and we remove the profit factor, which I think  is

the  reason  why a lot of people feel uncomfortable  that

the  operators of public transportation should be  making

profits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unfortunately, the Public Transport Council has

become a lightning rod in this debate.  Although I do not

entirely agree with the original Motion moved by  Mr  Tan

Soo  Khoon,  I am prepared to be counted to  support  the

Motion in its original form, to urge the Public Transport

Council  to  review its decision on the increases.   With

the  PAP Backbenchers moving the Motion, helping to  play

the  role of the Opposition, I suppose they are qualified

to  join  the  Opposition, as the  Member  for  Nee  Soon

Central  said.  I hope that it would help to provide  the

Motion,   with  more  muscle  and  bite,  to  force   the

Government  to  do something, and to lower  the  cost  of

living for Singaporeans at this difficult time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now it seems that my expectation is a bit too

high.   Dr  Tan  Boon  Wan's proposed  amendment  to  the

original  Motion  not  only  watered  down  the  original

amendment,  but  has the effect of asking  the  House  to

support the current increases of public transport  fares,

by  noting the Prime Minister's support for the principle

of the Public Transport Council granting small increases.

So he has, in fact, changed the intention of the original

Motion.   Although  Dr Tan Cheng Bock has  moved  another

amendment   to   the   amended  Motion   to   take   into

consideration the economic and employment situation,  the

fact  remains that the amended Motion would  endorse  the

PTC's approval for the increases.  This would endorse the

increases in public transportation fares, which  was  not

the original intention of the Motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would not support the amended Motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, when I saw the glass of water appearing

on  the table for the Minister, I realised that he  would

have a lot to speak.  So, after he had

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>

spoken, I thought many people would leave the Chamber and

go  to the toilet, but my guess was wrong.  Minister  Yeo

has  given us a lot of explanations and figures, and  has

also   solved   many  of  our  puzzles.   Actually,   the

atmosphere is now more relaxed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak immediately after the Minister has spoken

is  a  real  challenge.  I have thrown away  my  original

script.   Honestly speaking, I do not know what to  speak

about now.  So, I will take this opportunity to convey  a

message to the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, the people's perception of the Government

is  very  important.  The people should not misunderstand

the  concept  and intent of Government's policy.   As  we

know, the generation gap between parents and children  is

a  result  of  misconception and, recently, there  was  a

documentary  on  the  famous  celebrity  Disc  Jockey  in

Taiwan,  Billy.   His father was a military  officer  and

from young, he was frequently punished by his parents. As

a  form  of  protest, he did a lot of mischievous  things

against  the  family.  The gap was very wide between  him

and  his parents.  It was only when he was suddenly taken

ill  and  his parents took great pains to look after  him

that he realised how much his parents had loved and cared

for  him.  He began to realise that his perceived feeling

that his parents did not love him was wrong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we should not allow such misconception between

the people and the Government to exist.  I do not wish to

see our people do something just to spite the Government.

Like  what Minister Yeo and the Senior Minister of  State

Mr  Khaw Boon Wan have said, in this round of fare hikes,

there  is a lot of misconception among the people.   Have

there been some shortcomings in the form of communication

between  the  Government and the people?  Just  now,  the

Minister  has said that the PTC needs to do something  to

improve its communications with the people, and he  urged

the  Council to work harder.  I am very glad by  what  he

said.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP Government's rule of Singapore has brought

prosperity   to   Singapore.   Its   farsightedness   and

efficiency  are  well  known  to  everybody.    But   the

Government's style of "more work, less talk", "more deed,

less speech" has created some misunderstanding among  the

people, and people have some grouses against it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to commend Minister Yeo and SMS Khaw for

taking  great pains to explain the policies.  I think  it

is  very good.  I suggest that all the public departments

and  institutions should increase their transparency, and

the   Government  should  also  review   its   style   of

communication and connection with the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, I wanted to reflect the sentiments of the

people  but,  at  this point of time, I think  it  is  no

longer necessary, and I do not want to waste the time  of

everybody here in this House.  But allow me to raise just

two points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Member of the Tanjong Pagar GRC. As we know,

there are quite a lot of senior citizens in Tanjong Pagar

GRC.   In my recent visits to the residents, many of them

complained  to  me that the bus and MRT fare  hikes  were

making  life difficult for them. Why do we not give  some

special  consideration  to these  people,  some  form  of

concessions   for  these  senior  citizens?    They   had

contributed much to our nation  in their younger days.  I

think  the  Government  should  let  all  the  people  in

Singapore know that in making improvements to our  public

transport system, we should also look into the welfare of

our  people.   In  this  way,  we  can  make  the  people

appreciate  that the Government and the people are on the

same side.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hope that, in future, the Government will

make  more efforts to explain its policies to the people,

to  show  its  care and concern for the people.   A  good

government  would not only lead our country to  a  higher

level  in  its economic development, it should also  have

greater care and concern for the people.  I think this is

what Singapore would want in the future.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the Hon. Minister for Transport's  speech

and  the facts and figures stated therein are appreciated

and   noted.    I   can  only  hope  that,   in   future,

parliamentarians will have all or most of these facts and

figures  in  advance.   Perhaps, the relevant  Ministries

could  give parliamentarians summaries of what are  given

to  Ministers  or  Ministers  of  State  for  better  and

informed  debates in Parliament, and for parliamentarians

to  reflect  on  what  is given  to  them,  so  that  the

understanding  within Parliament would  be  of  a  higher

standard, and misunderstanding or misinformation would be

minimal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, what is the issue before this House?

For  that, I would like to state that the primary purpose

of  the  Government  providing public transportation  for

citizens  and  people residing in Singapore  is  for  the

commuters  to  have easy access from one  destination  to

another, with speed and as cheaply as possible. All other

perks are not mandatory, and are discretionary in nature.

To  make  this  possible, ie, relatively  an  inexpensive

means  of  transport, there must be emphasis on avoidance

of  luxuries,  and to provide just the basic necessities.

In  adopting  this  method,  there  will  be  a  relative

reduction of the cost of running buses and the MRT.   The

issue  is not whether bus and MRT fares should or  should

not  be increased.  As costs increase, bus and MRT  fares

would  inevitably increase.  The issue in this  House  is

whether  fares  should  be increased  now,  in  times  of

hardship and recession.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chandra Mohan, as a point of order,

I  hope your speech is leading to the amendments that  we

are dealing with now, and not a general speech about fare

increases,  because we are dealing with  amendments  now.

Could you confine your speech to the amendments, or  your

speech leading to the amendments?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan Nair:</b> I would support the

amendments, but with these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>

observations in mind.  Can these transportation companies

and  entities  hold on until next year  when,  hopefully,

there  will be better times?  If my speech would lead  to

something that is not relevant to the amended motion,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  will stop here.  But  as  far  as  the

amendments are concerned, I would support what  has  been

proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, we read in the newspapers how  our  people

have been queuing up for the National Day Parade tickets.

This  is a sign of patriotism.  We read also about people

queuing  up  for an HDB flat, and this is  to  get  their

money's worth. Now, we have Members of Parliament queuing

up  to  speak  on this motion concerning fare  increases.

This  is  to reflect the feelings and sentiments  of  the

people.  I believe, on this occasion, we have the highest

number of MPs speaking in this House on one single issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Dr Tan Cheng Bock that this round of

fare  increase  has  a  great impact  on  the  unemployed

people.  Many  MPs have elaborated on why fare  increases

should  not be implemented now. The Minister's  reply  is

that if we want to have a better public transport system,

we  must  be  prepared  to pay more.  We  know  that  the

rationale for the fare increase, but there are more  than

5.5%  of the workforce or 120,000 people who are  out  of

job  now. Taking four persons to a family, we are looking

at  500,000 people who are not having any income and  are

probably  making  every effort to  look  for  jobs.  They

cannot  walk  all  the way, and surely cannot  afford  to

travel  by  taxi.  So,  the  most  appropriate  mode   of

transport would be by bus or MRT.  Although the  increase

is  only 3 to 10 cents per trip, it adds up when you have

made several trips in a day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, whether we like it or not, the price hike

is   already   implemented.  It  is  a   fait   accompli.

Nevertheless, I hope that the relevant authority would do

something  for these people who are affected.  Could  PTC

implement some sort of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>

rebates  to  these people? The bus operators  can  surely

afford  them as they are making huge profits. The  launch

of  the ez-link card system has enabled the bus companies

to  collect  huge  sums of money as pre-payment  for  the

fares, and these would generate huge cash flows for  them

to  run  their  business. They would not need  to  borrow

money from the banks. Furthermore, with the reduction  in

corporate  tax rate, they should pass on this benefit  to

the commuters.  Perhaps, the bus companies would consider

giving a rebate of, say, 3% for those who purchase an ez-link card worth $50, and 5% for a $100 card.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that in this round of fare increase,

those  who  are paying by cash have to face  higher  fare

increase. This is not fair. The poorer senior citizens do

not  buy the ez-link cards simply because they could  not

afford to make the up-front payment.  Some do not use  it

because they are old and do not know how to use  it.   We

should educate them and help them to get used to it. They

should not be penalised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the amended motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, thank you for giving

me  this  opportunity  to speak on the  amendment  to  my

amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Dr Tan Cheng Bock's amendment. I think

it  strengthens  my  amendment with  the  additional  two

factors.   I  would also like to reply  to  Mr  Low  Thia

Khiang's  observation  that I have diluted  the  original

Motion.   The  purpose  is  not to  dilute  the  original

Motion.   I  see  the  purpose  of  this  Motion  as   an

opportunity for MPs to reflect the feedback they get from

the  ground, their concern about the increase  in  fares,

the economy, and so forth. In the discussion that we have

heard  these  two days, this purpose has  been  achieved.

MPs  have  very  frankly expressed the concern  of  their

residents  and  how they feel. Therefore, my  purpose  of

moving the amendment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>

is  to  protect  our  institutions because  we  must  not

inadvertently,  in  asking for  a  review,  question  the

integrity  of the PTC, and inadvertently also dilute  all

other  institutions that Parliament has set up.  And,  in

the   process,   it  also  questions  the  integrity   of

Parliament.   As  Mr  Iswaran  has  said,  if  we   start

questioning our ability to make good decisions and  start

reversing   the  decisions  that  we  make,  what   would

international investors, who come to Singapore think, ie,

the decisions we make in Parliament will not stand up  to

scrutiny.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, I just want to seek a point

of   clarification  from  the  Minister.   The   Minister

mentioned  that  the 2.3% fare increase only  allows  the

PTOs  to offset part of the projected cost increases.   I

would like the Minister to clarify what are the key areas

of  the  cost increases because I would like to find  out

whether  it is true that these cost increases are  mainly

from  statutory  costs,  as  stated  in  the  SBS'  reply

published in the newspapers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I do not foresee any
