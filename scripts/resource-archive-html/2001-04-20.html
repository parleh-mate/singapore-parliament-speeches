<div align="center"><b>MEDISAVE FUNDS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Use for health screening)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Goh Chong Chia</b> asked the Minister for Health if

he will allow Central Provident Fund members above the age of

40  to use their Medisave funds, annually or bi-annually, for

certain  types of health screening such as pap smear,  breast

cancer,  heart,  blood  and diabetes check-ups  and,  if  so,

whether  this entitlement can be extended to the  non-working

spouse of the Medisave member.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Chan Soo Sen) (for the Minister for Health):</b> Sir, to

answer  Mr  Goh's question, firstly, we have got to  remember

what  the  Medisave scheme is about.  The Medisave scheme  is

primarily designed to help individuals meet their personal or

immediate   family's  hospitalisation  expenses,   especially

during old age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has, in fact, over the years received many

requests  to allow Medisave to be used for medical  screening

and  has consistently decided against it.  As the Member  has

pointed  out in the Question, there are many types of  health

screening,  and  many of these are really not cost-effective.

For  certain health screenings that are cost-effective,  such

as  mammography  and pap smear, my Ministry  does  make  them

affordable  by providing heavy subsidies at the  polyclinics,

in fact, 50% subsidy.  Also, we have introduced the Community

Health   Screening  Programme  for  the  elderly  to   detect

diabetes, hypertension and high blood pressure.  The cost for

this  screening is very minimal as the elderly pays  only  $5

for  the  screening  which ordinarily would  have  cost  $20.

Therefore, Singaporeans need not rely on Medisave to pay  for

cost-effective health screening.  In any case,  if  we  allow

Medisave to be used too liberally, it would result in  higher

rates of contribution into the Medisave account.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1549</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On extending Medisave to non-working spouse,

Singaporeans  can  actually  top up  their  immediate  family

members' Medisave if they do not have enough Medisave savings

to  pay  for their medical bills.  This is in line  with  our

objective of promoting family support and resource pooling.

<div align="center"><b>FUND RAISING PROJECTS INVOLVING PUBLIC</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Review of laws and control)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Noris Ong

Chin Guan -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry, in view

of  the recent adverse publicity involving proprietary  clubs

and   the   raising  of  funds  through  the  sale  of   club

memberships,  whether  his Ministry  intends  to  review  the

adequacy  of current laws and control in respect  of  similar

fund raising projects involving the public.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia (Nominated Member):</b> Question No. 2,

Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Tang Guan Seng) (for the Minster for Trade and Industry):</b> Sir, the current dispute over the

ownership  of  the Raffles Town Club (RTC) has  drawn  public

attention to proprietary clubs, like the RTC.  Unlike members-only  clubs,  proprietary clubs are  wholly  owned  by  their

shareholders.  Members of proprietary clubs do  not  own  the

clubs' assets; they purchase memberships in the clubs and pay

monthly  subscriptions, in return for access  to  the  clubs'

services.  The membership fees and monthly subscriptions  are

revenue  for  the clubs, out of which the clubs pay  for  the

facilities and their upkeep, and any surplus belongs  to  the

shareholders of the clubs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of RTC, some members have alleged that they

were   misled  into  believing  that  only  5,000   exclusive

memberships   would   be  offered,  when  eventually   19,000

memberships were

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>

accepted.   I  understand from media reports  that  they  are

considering  filing  a  civil suit  against  the  proprietary

owners of the Club on grounds of misrepresentation.  Our laws

do  provide  for aggrieved parties to initiate  civil  action

against misrepresentation.  Since this may be the subject  of

court   proceedings   between   private   parties,   it    is

inappropriate for me to comment on it at this stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a registered company, RTC is governed by the

Companies Act, which sets out the duties of the directors  of

the  club,  and  specifies that they shall at all  times  act

honestly  and  use reasonable diligence in the  discharge  of

their  duties.   The Commercial Affairs Department  (CAD)  is

currently  investigating the case to  ascertain  whether  any

offence  under the Companies Act or any other laws  has  been

committed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI will wait for the outcome of CAD's investigations

before deciding whether any preventive action is necessary to

regulate similar future fund-raising projects, especially the

sale of club memberships to the public.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask the Senior

Parliamentary Secretary whether the Ministry in the  meantime

can set up a hotline to answer queries from aggrieved members

or complaints from members and to provide more information to

the Ministry or to facilitate CAD's investigations?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> The aggrieved parties may report to

CAD  or,  alternatively, I would suggest that  the  aggrieved

parties also report to CASE because CASE can help CAD in  its

investigation, if necessary.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Yes, CASE has received quite a number of

complaints.  That is the reason why we are trying to help  by

collecting  information and passing it to the Ministry.   But

we  need to have a hotline because there are quite a  lot  of

enquiries  and  there  must  be  officers  to  answer   these

enquiries.  So can CAD set up a hotline for these members  to

make their enquiries?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> I will pass it to CAD. Whether CAD

wants  to  set  up a hotline, it is for CAD  to  decide.   In

Singapore,  a telephone line is readily available.   You  can

just pick up the phone and call.

<div align="center"><b>MANAGERS AND EXECUTIVES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Mistreatment by employers)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

(a)  how many cases did his Ministry receive of managers  and

executives being mistreated by their employers, for  each  of

the  years  from 1998 to 2000; (b) what is the  procedure  to

resolve   their  complaints;  and  (c)  whether  the  present

legislation is adequate in protecting their interests.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  number of executives  and  managers  who

approached  my  Ministry for assistance  in  connection  with

their employment disputes with their employers is as follows:

In 1998, 354; in 1999, 282; and in the year 2000, 157.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of these disputes were related to claims for

compensation  arising from the termination  of  services  for

reasons  such  as redundancy, work performance  or  on  other

grounds.   Executives and managers are  not  covered  by  the

Employment  Act.  Nevertheless, the Ministry  took  up  their

claims with employers and provided conciliation service  with

the view to resolving such disputes amicably.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, 157 cases involving executives and managers,

together  with  14  cases carried forward from  the  previous

year,  were  dealt  with.   Of these  cases,  some  35%  were

resolved amicably through conciliation.  14% of the claimants

withdrew their claims before conciliation meetings were  held

as  they  had  either  resolved  their  disputes  with  their

employer  directly, or they had found a new job  and  decided

not to pursue their claims.  Some 12% of the claimants failed

to  attend the conciliation meetings arranged by the Ministry

and hence their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1552</b></font><br><br>

cases  were  closed.  The remaining 39% decided  to  withdraw

their claims after conciliation for various reasons, such  as

their  companies were in a state of insolvency, their  claims

were  weak or invalid, or the offers by their employers  were

not acceptable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in general, employers are reasonable in dealing with

their  executives on employment issues and would  accept  the

Ministry's  recommendations for an amicable  settlement.   In

situations where the executives' claims could not be resolved

amicably  through  conciliation, they  would  be  advised  to

pursue their claims further through legal action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the conciliation service provided by the

Ministry  of  Manpower,  the Tripartite  Committee  on  Union

Representation  of  Executives  set  up  in  1999  has   also

recommended  that junior and middle level executives  without

substantial  managerial responsibilities be allowed  to  join

and  be  represented by rank-and-file unions on an individual

basis  for retrenchment, dismissal and other related  issues.

The  recommendation has been accepted by the  Government  and

the Industrial Relations Act will be amended accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its study, the Tripartite Committee also examined

whether the scope of coverage of the Employment Act should be

expanded  to  cover  executives.  The  Committee  noted  that

executives, by and large, are able to negotiate for their own

terms  of employment and hence do not need the protection  of

the  law.   Their employment problems arose from retrenchment

and dismissal.  Allowing executives limited representation by

rank-and-file unions on issues of retrenchment and  dismissal

would provide executives with an additional avenue to address

their employment problems without giving rise to conflict  of

interest   or  undermining  management  effectiveness.    The

Committee  therefore felt that the scope of coverage  of  the

Employment  Act  need not be expanded at this  juncture,  and

that my Ministry should monitor developments and carry out  a

review at a later stage.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1553</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there are mechanisms available for executives to

address   their   employment   problems,   including    their

representation  by the rank-and-file unions  on  retrenchment

and  dismissal issues on an individual basis, their interests

are already adequately served.

wage  system  and  what  the  Government  intends  to  do  to

accelerate the pace of implementation by more companies.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1999, the

National Wages Council recommended the adoption of a  monthly

variable component to further enhance the flexibility of  our

wage structure.  Since then the Singapore National Employers'

Federation,  National Trades Union Congress and  my  Ministry

have  jointly  formulated a set of tripartite guidelines  and

also  conducted  briefings, workshops and  seminars  to  help

promote the implementation of the monthly variable component.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its 2000-2001 wage guidelines, the National Wages

Council   specifically  recommended   that,   with   economic

recovery, companies granting wage increases of more  than  3%

should  set  aside at least 3% of the wage  increase  as  the

monthly  variable  component; while companies  granting  wage

increase  of  up  to  3%  should set aside  the  entire  wage

increase as the monthly variable component.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have achieved positive results in the unionised

sector.   A  recent  survey  by my Ministry  on  the  monthly

variable component implementation in the private sector shows

that  29%  of  the  unionised companies have implemented  the

monthly variable component as at end of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1554</b></font><br><br>

2000.   On  average,  these companies  set  aside  some  2.69

percentage  points  of  their wage  increases  as  a  monthly

variable  component.  However, the non-unionised  sector  has

yet  to  adopt  this  measure.  Only  2.4%  of  non-unionised

companies have implemented the monthly variable component  as

at end of 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given the usefulness of the monthly variable

component    in    helping   companies   to   enhance    cost

competitiveness in a business downturn and in preserving jobs

for  the  workers, my Ministry will continue to work  closely

with   the  employers  and  trade  unions  to  step  up   the

implementation of the monthly variable component.

<div align="center"><b>(Use by unemployed and retirees)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Hawazi Daipi</b> asked the Minister for Manpower if

he  will consider allowing the unemployed and retirees to use

the  Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund in order to be relevant

for re-employment.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the aim of the

Lifelong  Learning Endowment Fund (LLEF) is  to  support  the

acquisition  of  skills by Singaporeans  so  that  they  will

become more employable.  In rolling out our Lifelong Learning

Endowment Fund programme, we will try to reach out to as many

Singaporeans  as  possible, especially the lower  skilled  or

lower  income Singaporeans who face the greatest difficulties

adapting  to changes in the economy and labour market.   This

would  include the unemployed and retirees who wish to rejoin

the workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will adopt a targeted approach in helping these

groups  of Singaporeans.  We will work with employers,  trade

unions,  community organisations and individuals to determine

the   areas  of  greatest  priorities  and  design   specific

programmes  to  address  these  needs.   The  unemployed  and

retirees can apply to participate in these programmes.   Over

the past few years, we have intro-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1555</b></font><br><br>

duced programmes under the Skills Re-development Programme to

help  these  Singaporeans.   We  plan  to  use  the  Lifelong

Learning   Endowment  Fund  to  expand  on   these   existing

programmes or to introduce new programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example is the National IT Literacy Programme, which

is  currently  under  development.  IT is  fast  becoming  an

essential  basic employability skill needed at the workplace.

We  will  be  adopting both the employer-based and community-based  approaches  for  the National IT  Literacy  Programme.

This  means  that aside from workers who are co-sponsored  by

their    employers,   individual   Singaporeans,    including

unemployed   or  self-employed  Singaporeans,  retirees   and

housewives  will  also benefit from the  training  incentives

given under the programme.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat</b> asked the Minister for

Communications   and  Information  Technology   whether   the

Government  has any plans to (a) help small and  medium-sized

enterprises implement e-Commerce; and (b) provide funding for

the   people   sector  to  increase  access  to   information

technology and Singapore ONE.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Communications and Information Technology):</b> Sir, PSB and IDA work closely to

help SMEs adopt e-commerce in three steps under the Jumpstart

Programme and e-Business Industry Development Scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step to e-commerce is to help SMEs which have

limited  resources and in-house expertise in  IT  to  get  an

initial   taste   of  e-commerce.   Under   PSB's   Jumpstart

Programme,  we  help  SMEs  to take advantage  of  ready-made

solutions offered by the Application Service

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>

Providers, and join one of the e-market-places.  So far,  PSB

estimates  that about 19,000 SMEs have taken this first  step

towards e-commerce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, to help initiated SMEs conduct more of their

business   transactions  on  the  Net,   we   encourage   the

development of industry specific e-market-places under the e-Business   Industry  Development  Scheme   (e-BIDS)   jointly

promoted  by  PSB  and  IDA.   These  vertical  portals   are

customised  to meet the needs of the suppliers and  customers

in  the respective sectors.  Recent examples of these special

purpose  e-market places are Kafe 123 (an e-market place  for

the  coffee shop trade) and Asia Furniture Hub (a  portal  to

enable  Singapore  based  furniture  businesses  to  transact

globally).   So  far,  close to 2,000 SMEs  have  taken  this

second step.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third step to e-commerce is to help some of the SMEs

to  re-invent their business with e-commerce.  One example is

Far East Flora.  Even though the flower trade is very much  a

brick-and-mortar  business,  the  company  has  developed  an

online   flower  wholesale  business  and  is  beginning   to

transform  itself  into a click-and-mortar operation.   About

<br><br>165&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMEs  have taken this third step.  We hope to  see  more

SMEs gearing themselves up for the fast emerging New Economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to funding of the people sector to

increase  access  to  IT and Singapore  ONE.   I  can  assure

Members   that   there  is  adequate  funding   support   for

initiatives to bridge the digital divide.  IDA has  committed

to  spend  up  to $25 million for e-lifestyle  programmes  by

2003.   We  have  received another $5  million  in  corporate

sponsorships  for  this purpose.  Many community  groups  and

private organisations have also stepped forward to contribute

towards   the  movement  to  transform  Singapore   into   an

Information Society.

<div align="center"><b>DEPOSITS BY EMPLOYERS FOR EMPLOYING FOREIGN MAIDS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Forfeiture)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower whether he

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>

will  review  the law on forfeiting of deposits by  employers

when  their maids run away, as it is physically not  possible

for employers to prevent their maids from doing so.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe) (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> Sir,

currently,  all  employers of Non-Traditional Source  foreign

workers,  including  foreign  domestic  workers  (FDWs),  are

required  to  post a $5,000 security bond with  my  Ministry.

The  security  bond  is to ensure that employers  upkeep  and

maintain  their foreign workers while they are working  here,

and  repatriate  their  workers when their  services  are  no

longer needed.  The $5,000 security bond will be forfeited if

the  worker is not repatriated after the cancellation of  his

or her work permit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand employers' concern that it is not always

possible for them to stop their FDWs from absconding, as they

are  not  in  a  position to monitor their  foreign  domestic

workers'   activities  at  all  times.    Nevertheless,   the

repatriation of the FDW is one of the responsibilities  which

the  employer accepted in bringing her here to work.  Without

this  obligation,  we will run the risk  of  having  a  large

number of NTS foreign workers, including the foreign domestic

workers,  abandoned  by  their employers  for  a  variety  of

reasons.   The security bond has served us well.  The  number

of such runaways and missing foreign workers has been kept to

a minimum over the years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my Ministry is sympathetic to employers whose

FDWs had run away.  The employer is given one month after the

FDW's  work permit is cancelled to locate and repatriate  the

worker, failing which his security deposit of $5,000 will  be

forfeited.  We are also prepared to consider an appeal for  a

refund  of  the  security deposit if the FDW is  subsequently

located  and  repatriated  within  three  months  after   the

forfeiture of the security deposit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the foreign domestic workers who run away do so for

a variety of reasons.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1558</b></font><br><br>

However, our experience shows that the FDW is more likely  to

run away if she is ill-treated while working here.  Employers

should therefore ensure that their FDWs are well treated  and

not  over-worked and abused.  The FDWs should also be paid  a

reasonable  salary and given sufficient rest and food.   This

will help to reduce the likelihood of their FDWs absconding.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, no employer

would  willingly want his or her maid to run  away,  although

there are many instances quoted by the Minister of State ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chen, no speeches. Ask your question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> All right, Sir. I would like

to  ask  the Minister of State, in view of the fact that  the

employer has no control over the runaway maid - and when  the

maid  runs  away they suffer both inconvenience and financial

loss  -  can the Ministry consider, in genuine cases, whether

they can lower the amount of the forfeiture?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, the foreign

domestic worker is the responsibility of the employer.  He or

she  has to take control of her and should manage her.   This

security  bond  is a safeguard that the employers  will  take

full   responsibility  of  their  foreign  domestic  workers.

Without  the  security bond, the employers may  not  exercise

proper  management and supervision on their  foreign  workers

and  this will result in more of them missing.  Sir, we  take

into account the problems which the employers have and we are

very flexible in the way we administer this requirement.   We

give them sufficient time to look for the missing worker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we allow them to cancel their maid's work permit

so  that,  in the interim, they do not have to pay  the  levy

and,  if they can locate their maid within one month, we will

not  forfeit  their deposit.  And even after  forfeiting  the

deposit  and  they manage to help locate the  maid  within  a

period  of three months, we will refund the deposit.   So  we

are very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1559</b></font><br><br>

flexible.   We understand that they have problems,  but  they

must  take full responsibility and, if they look after  their

maid's  welfare and safety properly, I am sure that the  maid

will  enjoy  her  work with the employer  and  will  be  most

unlikely to abscond.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> I would like to ask the

Minister  of  State  how  realistic is  it  for  an  ordinary

Singapore citizen to be given one month to look for a runaway

maid  in  Singapore.  It is like looking for a  needle  in  a

haystack.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> One month is quite a

fair  period of time.  In fact, they are given another  three

months  thereafter to locate and they will have a  chance  to

get  their security bond refunded.  So, basically, it is  not

one  month  but  four months.  It is a long period  of  time.

They  can help locate their missing maid by either going back

to  the  employment agents for assistance, or to the embassy,

because  sometimes  maids who have complaints  or  grievances

against  their employers report to their embassies.  So  they

can go to the embassy and try to get some help.  But the most

important  thing  is  that  they  should  really  manage  and

supervise  their maids carefully.  If they are good employers

of  their maids, it is most unlikely that the maids will  run

away.  That is our experience.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, firstly, why is the

flexibility given for locating the maid and the refund of the

deposit  restricted to only four months?  Why is it not  that

as  and  when  the  lost maid is found and  repatriated,  the

security deposit will be refunded?  Why restrict it  to  four

months?  Secondly, I would like to know what assistance would

the  Ministry  of Manpower provide to employers  whose  maids

have absconded, ie, help the employers to locate the maids.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, can I repeat that

four  months  is a reasonably long time.  We want  to  ensure

that  employers  take genuine steps to try and  locate  their

lost or runaway maid.  So we give them a sufficient period of

time

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>

for them to do so.  Beyond that, if there are instances which

warrant  us  to  reconsider, we will  reconsider.   But  four

months  is  a  fairly  reasonable  period.   As  I  mentioned

earlier, ie, how we can help, we have advised employers. They

should try and get their employment agents, who probably know

other  maids who know the maid who has run away, and  try  to

contact her or find out more particulars about the maid,  her

friends, and also work with the embassy because sometimes the

maids  report to the embassy when they are not fairly treated

or  when they have complaints against their employers.  These

are the types of assistance that we can give to employers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I do not think the Minister of

State  has  answered  my  question.   My  question  is   what

assistance specifically, besides advice, is there to help the

employers  to  locate  their maids?   Employers  pay  foreign

domestic workers' levy to the Ministry.  Does the Minister of

State  not  think that it should provide certain services  to

the  employers in the event that the maid runs away  and  the

likelihood  that  the deposit would be forfeited?   Secondly,

regarding the period of time, to the Ministry four months  is

sufficient.   I understand that the purpose of  the  security

deposit  is  to  make  sure  that  the  employer  takes  full

responsibility  for repatriating the maid.   So  as  long  as

whichever month ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, can you ask your question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> All right, Sir. As long as the

employer eventually repatriates the maid - whether it is  six

months  later  or  one year later, he locates  the  maid  and

repatriates her - can the Ministry not consider refunding the

full  security deposit to the employer?  It serves  the  same

purpose.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, as I have replied,

usually  if  they repatriate the maid within four months,  we

will  refund the security bond.  But, if they take a bit more

time,  we will look at the circumstances of the case and,  if

they have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1561</b></font><br><br>

actually shown evidence that they have helped locate the maid

and  repatriate  her, then we will examine the  circumstances

and will help them as far as we can.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia (Nominated Member):</b> While we hold the

employer responsible, why not we hold the maid responsible as

well?   If the maid is eventually found, would she be charged

as an illegal immigrant?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Yes, if her work permit

is  cancelled and she does not go back, and she does not have

a  visa  or  a  visit pass to stay here,  then  she  will  be

accordingly charged as an overstayer or illegal immigrant.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia:</b> What is the number of maids who have

been charged?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, I do not have the

figures  at  this particular juncture, but if the Member  can

file  a  question,  the Ministry will give  him  the  answer.

Illegal immigrants have been charged from time to time.  Some

of  them  may  be  maids.  There may be  some  other  foreign

workers  who  are also illegal immigrants or overstayers  for

that matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would like to

seek  a clarification on whether runaway maids are considered

as  fugitives and therefore targets to be searched for by the

authorities,  and  what  are  the  track  records  that   any

authority has found them within four months.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, I do not have any

figures  of  runaway maids who have been  found  within  four

months.   But  they are basically persons who have  run  away

from  the  employers.  If they do not have a work permit,  in

the  event that the employer has already cancelled  the  work

permit, they are illegal stayers in that sense.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> Sir, the point I am trying to make is

that if the authorities are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1562</b></font><br><br>

looking  for  her and cannot locate her in four months,  what

hope  does an employer have of finding a missing maid in four

months?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> The employers know the

maids  if they have been working for them for a while.   They

probably know the friends of their maids because they stay in

the  same neighbourhood.  Sometimes, they can check with  the

friends of the maids who are in the neighbourhood, and may be

able  to  contact  them.  I think the employer  must  make  a

serious  attempt  to locate the maid who is  missing,  rather

than  just leave it to the authorities.  Because if they have

managed  the  maids  properly, and have  looked  after  their

welfare,  I  do not think their maids will run  away  in  the

first place.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Minister of State has not

answered  my  question.   Besides  providing  advice  to  the

employers, what other services does the Ministry of  Manpower

provide  to the employers who have paid the foreign  workers'

levy every month to help locate the maid?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> The levy has many other

purposes.  Firstly,  it is to put a  cap  on  the  number  of

foreign  workers in Singapore.  That is one of the  functions

of the levy.  The levy is not just for the purpose of looking

after  maids  who are missing.  We, in fact, give  a  lot  of

services  to foreign domestic workers and the employers.   We

provide  a  video on how they should treat their workers,  we

give  them advice on what they should do and should  not  do,

and  we  also  provide them educational pamphlets.   I  think

there  are a lot of services that we offer the employers  and

foreign  workers.   This  is to help  them  to  manage  their

foreign  workers  in a proper way and also to  take  care  of

their security and welfare.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, on this specific issue of

runaway  maids, how does the Ministry help the  employers  to

locate the maids, besides giving advice?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> We would advise them in

a way that they are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1563</b></font><br><br>

properly prepared.  Prevention is better than cure.   So,  if

they  treat  their maids properly, I do not think they  would

have a missing maid.  It is very simple.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, in view of

what  the  Minister  of State said about the  fact  that  the

employer  can  do  best efforts to look for  this  maid,  and

considering  the fact that individual employers do  not  have

the  resources at their command as the State would, would the

Ministry consider situations where the employer has done  all

that  she  could  and still cannot find the  maid,  that  the

deposit will be refunded at least in part or even in whole?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, when the employer

applies   for   a  maid,  she/he  understands  that   certain

conditions are given before the application to employ a  maid

is approved, and this includes the fact that she has to pay a

security  deposit which will be forfeited in  the  event  the

maid  is  not sent back or repatriated on the expiry  of  the

work   permit.   These  are  conditions  which  are  put   up

beforehand.  They know what are the conditions and  therefore

they  should  abide by the conditions.  We  have  given  them

other  advice, such as how they should manage their maid  and

how  to build a proper relationship with the maid.  These are

some  of  the  services which we give.  When  the  maid  goes

missing,  they should look at the reasons why  the  maid  has

left  their house and also look at ways to get back the  maid

and send her back.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> May I ask the Minister of

State:  can he really believe that all maids who run away are

being  mistreated?  Are there no other reasons for the  maids

to  run  away?  If the employer treats the maid well,  is  he

saying that all the maids will not run away?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, the number of maids

in  Singapore is about 140,000.  The number of maids who have

run  away  or  absconded is very few.  It  is  only  a  small

minority  and  there  are  various  reasons.  Based  on   our

experience, one of the reasons is that the maid is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1564</b></font><br><br>

unhappy  with  the  way that the employer  has  treated  her.

This is one of the major reasons.  If you look at the size of

the  problem, a small number of maids have run away, compared

with  the  total  population of foreign domestic  workers  in

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Does the Minister of State

not  know  of  cases where maids have absconded because  they

themselves  are  running away from the law or  they  want  to

leave  Singapore to get to another place, perhaps for  better

pay?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> As I have said, our

experience  has shown that most of the maids  have  run  away

because  of the bad experience at their workplace.   I  think

the  Member  is just raising a hypothetical question.   There

may  be  other reasons.  But the key reason is that they  are

not happy with the employer for one reason or another.

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN MAIDS FALLING FROM HIGHRISE FLATS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Hawazi Daipi</b> asked the Minister for Manpower if

he will inform the House about new measures that his Ministry

will  take  to overcome the problem of foreign maids  falling

from highrise flats.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> Sir, my Ministry will take firm action against

employers who subject their foreign domestic workers   (FDWs)

to  safety hazards at work, such as cleaning the exterior  of

highrise windows.  Every case of an FDW who falls from height

will  be  investigated  by  the Police.   Employers  who  are

criminally negligent can be prosecuted under the Penal  Code.

The  Work Permit Department (WPD) will also conduct  its  own

investigations and the employer involved will not be  allowed

to   recruit  another  foreign  domestic  worker  until   all

investigations  are completed or, if the fall  leads  to  the

FDW's   death,  until  the  Coroner's  report  is  concluded.

Employers who are suspected of exposing their FDWs to  safety

hazards  will  be  asked to show cause  why  they  should  be

allowed to employ foreign

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1565</b></font><br><br>

domestic workers in the future.  All employers involved  will

also  be issued with a stern warning to pay special attention

to the safety of their FDWs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will continue to provide information and

advisories  to FDWs and their employers so as to ensure  that

their work is carried out safely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the number of FDWs who fall from heights while

performing  household chores is very small, compared  to  the

stock  of more than 140,000 FDWs, every case of a fall  is  a

matter  of  grave  concern  to  my  Ministry  as  it  can  be

potentially  fatal.  I believe that such  accidents  can  and

should  be  avoided if employers make the special  effort  to

ensure that their FDWs work safely at home.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I have two

supplementary  questions.  First, how does  the  Minister  of

State  define  criminal negligence in this case and,  second,

whether  he has figures of such accidents over the  past  few

years.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> In so far as criminal

negligence is concerned, the Police will investigate the case

to  determine whether the employer has subjected the maid  to

hazards  when she was at work. They would look into the  case

carefully.   As for numbers, so far this year,  we  have  one

case.   For  the previous years, the number of falls  is:   8

cases  in  1999 and 9 cases in 2000.  But for cases of  maids

who  are  considered  to  have  fallen  because  of  criminal

negligence,  we  do  not  have the numbers.   In  fact,  this

depends on Police investigations.  Although some of the cases

are still under investigations, they have not established the

fact yet.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, maids falling

from  highrise buildings is not a new issue.  We have debated

this  issue,  I believe, in the Budget session of  2000.   At

that time ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Chiam, no speeches. Ask your

question, please.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1566</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Why is it that the Ministry is so

reluctant  to legislate that every maid washing  the  windows

must wear a harness?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, firstly, it is not

practical  for maids to wear safety harness.   They  must  be

trained to use safety harness.  Even workers who are asked to

use  safety  harness sometimes have problems when  they  work

from  heights.   Essentially, employers must make  sure  that

their  maids work in a safe way.  Actually, cleaning highrise

exterior  windows  is  not  a job for  the  maids.  Will  the

employers do such a job?  I do not think they will do it.  If

they  do not want to do such a job, they should not ask their

maids to do it.  Cleaning the exterior of windows of highrise

buildings  is  very hazardous and employers  should  not  get

their maids to do that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I think the Ministry should not

take the lives of maids very lightly.  Since this problem  is

recurring, there must be something done and the best solution

is to legislate, to make it compulsory for maids to wear some

kind  of  a  safety belt or something, whilst doing  highrise

dangerous work as I believe ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, what is your question? Ask your

question.   You  are  repeating  what  you  have  just  asked

earlier.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Will the Ministry reconsider

legislating  some  kind of safety belt for maids  working  in

highrise places?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, the answer is no.

As  I  mentioned earlier, cleaning highrise windows  is  very

dangerous and is not a job expected of maids.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask

the  Minister of State:  to his knowledge, how many cases  of

prosecutions  have  there  been for criminal  negligence  for

maids falling off highrise buildings?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1567</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> At this stage, to my

knowledge,  there are no such cases.  But I think the  Police

are still investigating some of the cases.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> May I ask the Minister of

State  whether it would not be right to say that if there  is

no  legislation  preventing maids from  cleaning  windows  in

highrise  apartments,  they would be  compelled,  I  suppose,

under employers' pressure, to do the same and therefore it is

very  unreasonable to think that maids can resist  employers'

demand for such actions, and should the Ministry not consider

making  some regulations for employers to prevent  them  from

telling maids to clean windows in highrise buildings?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> As mentioned in an

earlier  reply,  maids sometimes have grievances  when  their

employers  ask them to do things which are not reasonable  or

hazardous.  Some of them, as I mentioned earlier, complain to

the embassy. They can also complain to our Ministry.  We will

look  into the complaint to see whether it is valid  or  not.

And  if  employers ask maids to do hazardous duties  such  as

cleaning highrise windows, then we will advise the employers,

"Please do not do so.  This is not expected of the maids."  I

do not think the employers themselves would have done that in

the  first  place.  The maids have a recourse.  In  fact,  we

have a hotline where maids can contact the Ministry when they

feel that their employers are giving them jobs which are  not

safe or their security is being compromised.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, two supplementary

questions  for the Minister of State.  First,  would  he  not

agree  that  if  the Ministry legislates on  the  use  of   a

harness  for  domestic  workers,  this  would,  in  fact,  be

encouraging  employers to ask domestic maids to do  something

that they should not be doing?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is: instead of waiting for the

police  to  prosecute  under criminal  negligence,  which  is

difficult to prove, would it be more effective for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1568</b></font><br><br>

Ministry  to  consider  taking away the  permission  for  the

employer  to employ a maid if the maid is found to  be  in  a

situation of cleaning the exterior of a window?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, on the use of a

harness,  I  have answered it earlier.   It is not  something

that we will want to encourage or legislate.  In fact, it  is

not  the  duty  of  the  maid to clean  windows  of  highrise

buildings.   And  it might just give them a  false  sense  of

security if they use it because, in the first place, they may

have problems with the use of the harness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can the Member repeat his second question?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Instead of legislating on

the  use  of  a harness, would it be more effective  for  the

Ministry  to   consider  provisions  like  taking  away   the

permission for the employer to employ a maid or finding  some

other  method,  instead  of  waiting  for  prosecution  under

criminal negligence, which is very difficult?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Thank you for the

question which I will clarify.  Yes, we do that.  If we  find

that maids have not been properly treated, abused or asked to

do  things  which are dangerous, we will cancel  the  permit.

And  we  will  not allow that particular employer  to  employ

maids in the future.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, would the Ministry

of  Manpower  consider including households as workplaces  so

that the safety laws on workplaces can be applied to domestic

workers as well?  If not, why not?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, the Minister has

answered  that  question yesterday.   We  are  reviewing  the

Factories  Act, but we will have to prioritise  which  places

are  more  prone  to accidents and are more  dangerous.   For

households,  it is not easy.  To designate a household  as  a

workplace, I think there are lots of things that we  need  to

look at.  Again, as I have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1569</b></font><br><br>

mentioned,  the number of accidents is small.  Basically,  if

the  employers look after the welfare and security  of  their

maids  carefully, develop a good working relationship, a  lot

of these problems can be avoided.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia:</b> The exterior of a window is part of

common  property.   Why  do  we  not  compel  the  management

corporation to clean those windows, instead of getting  maids

to do it?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, the duties of a

management corporation are not related to this question.   He

may want to ask the relevant Ministry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia:</b> Sir, if somebody else cleans the

window, then the maid does not have to clean it.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> For some of the big

buildings,  the management corporations employ  professionals

to  do it.  They are properly equipped and have the expertise

to clean windows.  It is up to the management corporations to

consider it.  There is nothing to stop them from doing  this.

And  if it is a requirement for management corporations  that

they  should do this, as I said, it is outside the  scope  of

this question.  And the Member may want to raise it with  the

relevant Ministry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  why  it  is necessary to bar  vehicles  carrying

second-hand  goods  from  entering Jurong  Fishing  Port  and

whether  the  authority has considered the  effects  of  such

measure on the livelihood of second-hand goods dealers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1570</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr John Chen Seow Phun) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Jurong Fishing Port (JFP) is for fishing vessels to land

their  fish.  It is not designed as a port to handle  general

cargo,  including  second-hand goods. The steep  increase  in

second-hand  goods trading activities at JFP in recent  years

has  also  resulted  in congestion at the  fishing  port  and

affected   the  efficient  operation  of  the  fish   landing

activities  for which the port was built. For these  reasons,

the  Agri-food and Veterinary Authority (AVA), which operates

the  Jurong  Fishing Port (JFP), has decided to bar  vehicles

carrying  second-hand goods from entering  the  fishing  port

with effect from 1st May 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second-hand goods dealers can continue their business

using  the  nearby  Jurong Port or the Pasir  Panjang  Multi-purpose  Terminal,  which  are properly  equipped  to  handle

general cargo. AVA has given the dealers three months' notice

to allow them to make alternative arrangements.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, when did the AVA decide that

the  Jurong Fishing Port is not the proper place for  trading

in second-hand goods?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, the decision not to allow

this  trade was made early this year, and a notice was  given

in  February giving the traders three months' notice.  But it

is  a  known fact that the port is not designed to cater  for

general cargo.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Is the Minister of State aware that

on  1st  February,  a letter sent by AVA to  the  second-hand

goods  traders  stated that the reason for  barring  vehicles

carrying second-hand goods was because of traffic congestion?

The  reason is not because the port is not suitable  for  the

trading of second-hand goods.  In January 1992, the then  PPD

wrote  to the second-hand goods traders to say that  if  they

wished  to  deliver their goods, they could do so,  and  they

were  given the procedures.  How did the Government  suddenly

find out that the Jurong Fishing Port is not the proper place

for carrying on this trade?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1571</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, in the early days when the

fish  landing activities were not very active, the  then  PPD

gave  special consideration for the second-hand goods dealers

to use the port.  But since then, the fish trading activities

have  increased. In fact, it is not just for fishing vessels.

We  also have trucks from Malaysia and Thailand bringing fish

to  the  port.   So  the  port is pretty  congested  now  and

therefore  by  allowing these second-hand  goods  dealers  to

continue buying and selling second-hand goods there, it  does

contribute to unacceptable congestion and therefore affecting

the efficient operation of the port.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does the Ministry consider that

since the second-hand goods traders are allowed to trade, and

they  have  been  trading there since  the  early  days,  the

decision suddenly to bar them from entry, effectively, it  is

to  say that they have to get out of the trade?  That is  the

first question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is that I understand that the port

still allows vehicles to deliver goods like rice, etc, to the

fishing boats.  Is this an attempt by the Government to phase

out the second-hand goods traders?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I understand that no alternative arrangement

has  been made.  You just tell them to go to Jurong  Port  or

whatever.  How do you expect these second-hand goods  traders

to  make  their own arrangements?  Their livelihood is  being

affected,  and  quite a number of them are  facing  financial

difficulties because of that.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member has

not  listened to my earlier reply.  It is not that they  will

have  to terminate their activities and have no place  to  go

to.   The  Jurong  Port  and the Pasir Panjang  Multi-purpose

Terminal  are  not  far away.  Yes, they  will  have  to  pay

higher charges, but it is not exorbitant.  But to stay behind

would cause difficulty to the fishing port, and therefore  it

is  best that we regularise the activities and ask them to go

to the port which is designed for such activities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1572</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the question is that you

suddenly decided to bar these second-hand goods traders  from

entry.   AVA has not made any alternative arrangements either

with Jurong Port or whatever port to show them that they have

an alternative.  Is that fair to the traders?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, it is not difficult to go

to  another port and to fill up the forms and to say that you

want  to load and unload your cargo.  I do not think that  is

a  difficult thing to do.  Businessmen have been  doing  this

all the time.  So it is not true that AVA is coming down hard

on  the second-hand goods dealers.  The fact of the matter is

that  there  is  a  steep increase in the  second-hand  goods

trading activities in recent years, and this cannot continue.

Because  if  it  continues, it will affect the  fishing  port

operations.   So they must be asked to go to  a  place  where

such activities can be properly carried out.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister  of  State  whether this  issue  is  the  result  of

Indonesian fishermen wanting to fill their boats with second-hand goods after they have delivered fish, and the result  of

barter trade that they conducted in the past.  If so,  is  it

not  unhygienic  for food to be mixed with second-hand  goods

and,   therefore,  yet  another  reason  for  stopping   this

practice?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, I guess there is a role

for barter trade, but the important thing is that it must  be

conducted  at the proper place.  That is the reason.   Should

we  convert  the  fishing port to do such  a  thing  when  we

already have such facilities at Jurong Port and Pasir Panjang

Multi-purpose  Terminal?  It does not make sense.   It  costs

money  to  equip the port with proper CIQ, lifting facilities

and  so  on and so forth.  It is wise to make sure that  they

are channelled to the proper place.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, unless you have fresh points to

make, I propose to move on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I wonder whether the

Government has the moral

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1573</b></font><br><br>

obligation to help these second-hand goods traders, since the

measure  has  now affected their livelihood.  Secondly,  will

the  Minister  of  State  consider  making  some  alternative

arrangements  within  the  port to  allow  second-hand  goods

traders  to  continue to trade and deliver second-hand  goods

into  the  fishing  vessels.  I think  it  not  only  affects

Singapore's second-hand goods traders but also the Indonesian

fishermen as well.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, as I said, their

livelihood is not threatened because they have an alternative

arrangement.   For instance, if they go to the  Jurong  Port,

they  probably have to pay a few hundred dollars a  month  in

fees  to  enter.  So I do not think it is a case  where  they

would  not be able to survive if they are asked to go to  the

proper  place.  As for the Indonesian vessels, they are  here

to  land their fish.  And let me inform the Member that every

vessel  that they land, it can fetch up to $14,000  of  fish,

and this is a lot of money.  The incentive is good enough for

them to land their fishing vessels in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek Bin Saniff (Senior Minister of State for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for the Environment (Encik Sidek bin Saniff) (for the Minister for the Environment):</b> Sir, ENV is responsible for keeping public roads and walkways

clean.  As a norm, roads and walkways are cleaned once  every

two  days.   However,  areas that  are  busy  and  have  high

vehicular and pedestrian traffic are swept daily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to using its own workforce of cleaners, ENV

has, since 1999, also contracted cleaning companies in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>

private  sector to do the cleaning.  Many of these areas  are

now  swept by these contractors with modernised equipment and

machines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further improve the productivity of cleaning,

footpaths and walkways in new towns are designed to  make  it

more  accessible to cleaning machines.  In the  older  areas,

ENV  is  working closely with LTA to make these  places  more

machine-friendly, as much as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though we have contracted the cleaning jobs to the

private sector, ENV officers are deployed on the ground daily

to monitor and ensure that public places are properly cleaned

and  maintained.   ENV  also acts on feedback  received  from

members of the public.

Minister  of State how close a control does the ENV  officers

have over their sub-contractors, and whether he does not know

that  in  Woodlands Neighbourhood 8, for example, debris  and

clogged drains have been in existence for several months  and

up till now, I think no action has really been taken to clean

them properly.

maintained  by HDB, as the roads and walkways  in  these  two

neighbourhoods  have not been taken over  by  LTA  as  public

thoroughfares.  Notwithstanding this, my Ministry  has  moved

in and taken over the cleaning of the roads and walkways from

certain  older neighbourhoods, and I am sure I  am  not  just

speaking in relation to Woodlands but to other areas as well,

there  are  no such modern walkways and so on, to  facilitate

April, 2001],

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br>1.34 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, my

main  problem  on  this Amendment Bill is on  the  electronic

voting system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, I heard my parliamentary colleagues

expressing  their misgivings and skepticism on  the  proposed

electronic  voting system.  Personally, I do  not  think  the

electronic voting system is really that awe-inspiring.  Three

days ago I attended a briefing on electronic voting conducted

by  the  Elections  Department, and I feel  that,  basically,

there  is  no great difference between electronic voting  and

the  traditional paper voting system.  With regard to secrecy

of vote, reliability of software and hardware, as well as the

accuracy of counting, so long as the civil servants in charge

can  abide  by  the  principles  of  the  Bill,  and  conduct

themselves fairly and honestly, the electronic voting  system

is technically feasible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we cannot view this issue purely from the

technical  point  of view.  No doubt, electronic  voting  has

already been used in a number of advanced countries, but  our

Government  frequently reminds us that Singapore's conditions

are  quite  different  from  the  other  countries.   So   in

implementing  electronic voting, we must not forget  that  we

are indeed different from the other countries in a number  of

aspects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the voters do have doubts on their rights to

vote.   Some voters are still harbouring the belief  that  if

they vote for the Opposition, they may have to face

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1577</b></font><br><br>

some  dire  consequences.  That being  the  case,  electronic

voting will inevitably add on more psychological pressure  on

them.   If  the  Government genuinely respects  the  people's

right  to vote, then it should work harder in convincing  the

people that secrecy of the votes can indeed be maintained  by

the  electronic  voting system and ensuring the  voters  that

they  have  the  right  to vote for the candidates  of  their

choice  -  whether  they are from the  ruling  party  or  the

opposition  parties.  In  other words,  the  voters  must  be

convinced  that it is perfectly legitimate for them  to  vote

for  the  Opposition as their representatives in  Parliament.

This is their basic right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, when they cast their sacred vote, there must

be  some means to indicate that their votes are recorded  and

accepted  as  valid  votes that count  towards  the  ultimate

results of the poll.  In the traditional way of paper voting,

when  a  voter goes into the polling booth, he  puts  a  mark

against  the  name and party symbol of the candidate  of  his

choice,  and that gives him a sense of reality, an indication

that his sacred vote will be counted as one more vote for his

preferred  candidate and be added to the final count  of  the

votes.   In  the case of electronic voting, the voter  merely

touches  the  screen and the voting process is done,  leaving

the  computer to do the recording, filing, and counting.  The

voter does not know, as a fact, whether his one vote has been

properly recorded and counted as one more vote cast  for  his

choice  candidate.  He may ask what would happen if there  is

an  error in the process of recording, filing and counting by

the  electronic system. There are always doubts in the  minds

of the voters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that during the initial stage of electronic

voting  to  be  experimented in some selected constituencies,

the computer system will print out an acknowledgement slip as

a  kind of safeguard, and in the case of a recount it can  be

used  as  a  basis for recounting.  The voters  can  see  for

themselves that their votes have been acknowledged, and  they

will  have greater confidence in electronic voting.   I  feel

that this procedure of acknowledgement

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1578</b></font><br><br>

should  be  included in the Amendment Bill so  that  it  will

become a permanent feature of the electronic voting system in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on the display appearing on three screens, I

feel  that  it is very confusing, particularly for those  who

are  not  used to new technology and the senior citizens  who

may be illiterate. The Government should consider simplifying

the system with display on only two screens instead of three.

In addition, symbols rather than words should be used.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the electronic voting system only allows

voters  to vote for any of the candidates.  The voters cannot

express their discontent by casting a "spoilt" vote.   If the

Government  recognises that the casting of  spoilt  votes  is

also a way of voting for the voters to show their disapproval

of  all the available candidates, then it should be explained

clearly how spoilt votes can be cast and considered under the

electronic voting system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the one-man-one-vote system, which

returns our Government and representatives to Parliament,  is

very  important for the Government and the country.  It  will

show  the legitimacy of the Government. If we want the people

to be convinced that the Member of Parliament returned at the

General  Election for that constituency is the one  whom  the

majority  of  the  voters have actually voted  for  as  their

representative in Parliament, we must ensure that voters have

the  confidence of the election system when they  cast  their

votes.   Otherwise,  the people may think the  Government  is

playing foul.  This kind of mentality is not conducive to our

national  cohesiveness,  nor does  it  do  any  good  to  the

Government  or  the people.  To alleviate and eliminate  this

kind  of  negative mentality, the Government should  convince

the  people  that  they  have  the  right  to  vote  for  the

Opposition. Civil servants should also be fair and  impartial

in the execution of their duties.  They should not favour the

ruling party.  All citizens must know that voting is a  basic

right of the people.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1579</b></font><br><br>

people  can  exercise  their  choice  without  any  fear   of

repercussion.  All Singapore citizens should value the  right

and opportunity that under the one-man-one-vote system, every

voter has equal power to vote for the candidate of his choice

as his representative in Parliament.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the introduction of

the  Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill  comprises  two

important features:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This Bill acknowledges that Singaporeans have

responded  to the Government policy to form an external  wing

to our economy and that while they are not in Singapore, they

should not be disenfranchised.  Voting is a fundamental right

and  privilege of an adult citizen.  This Bill, in making  it

possible for citizens abroad to exercise their right to vote,

shows  the  maturity  of our political  system  to  give  due

consideration to the minority groups within our  society.   I

remember  when I first voted in an election - it was  not  in

Singapore,  it  was  in the United Kingdom  -  the  right  of

Commonwealth  citizens to vote while in  the  United  Kingdom

initially surprised me, but it really felt good to be part of

the democratic process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In a world that is IT-based, there is a necessity

to  make provisions to allow electronic or DRE voting.  I  am

glad this Bill makes it possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while I support the Bill, I have a few

comments to make and wish to seek some clarifications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Bill allows a recount to be carried out if

there  is  a  difference of 2% or less.  In  the  past  three

general  elections, there were only two cases  below  2%.   I

believe  that we are setting the allowance for recounting  at

too  low  a level.  If we adopt a 5% difference, there  would

have  been recounting in five constituencies in the 1991  and

two  in  the 1997 general elections.  Surely, in the interest

of accuracy, a recounting based on 5% is not too much to ask.

After  all,  recounting under this Bill is  not  a  mandatory

requirement.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) There is a requirement to test the DRE voting

equipment  before  polling  and during  polling.  Surely  the

equipment should also be tested at the end of the polling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) What are the provisions in the system to ensure

that  progressive voting patterns cannot be  revealed  during

the period of polling?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Overseas electors on registration will be allocated an

overseas  polling  station, but it  is  not  clear  to  which

electoral division will his or her vote be assigned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) While there are requirements for inspections of

machines for tampering, malfunction and damage, what are  the

safeguards  in  the procedures to ensure that  the  inspector

does not tamper with the equipment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) While overseas centres may be set up, we presume,

and  I think it was said yesterday, in areas and cities where

there  are  large numbers of Singaporeans, those living  some

distance  away from this major city may find it difficult  to

journey  down  to vote.  Will the Government consider  postal

voting in the interim before a final electronic system is put

in place?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) If a citizen, after spending some time overseas, returns

to  Singapore before the General Election, will he be subject

to the two out of five years' rule on his voting eligibility?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, some Members of Parliament had already

highlighted  yesterday  that the  Bill  is  treating  private

sector   citizens   overseas  differently   from   Government

employees overseas.  I find this differentiation disturbing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  yesterday, Mr Jeyaretnam made a statement which I  will

quote  him  today.  He said, "I had not thought  of  speaking

until  I  heard the Minister speak", and he was referring  to

our  discussions  on  the  Singapore  Broadcasting  Authority

(Amendment)  Bill.   I will quote him.  I actually  have  not

planned to speak, Sir, until I heard him.  But more so,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>

until  I  read  in  the  press this morning  how  nonsensical

statements had been given sense in the press today.  That  is

a  writing  skill  which I must applaud  the  Straits  Times'

journalist.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I speak? Because I thought that there is some

message  which, if not checked, would have spread  and  would

have  done  harm  to our image as a country.   Do  we  really

believe that we would go our way to fiddle or to play  around

with  the election results?  I do not think so.  I am not  so

concerned   about   Singaporeans  but  I   do   not   believe

Singaporeans  will  be  so  easily  persuaded.   I  am   more

concerned  with the international readers, the  tourists  who

come  to Singapore, pick up a copy of the Straits Times, read

and  go  back  and  say, "Hey, in Singapore,  they  do  silly

things."  I think that is not right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me use one anecdote which I hope will be able to

make  my point.  In 1979, I stood in a by-election.   When  I

was  presented  as a candidate, at a press conference  I  was

there  with four or five, maybe six, others of my colleagues,

and  then the press asked me, "What have you got to say as  a

candidate?"  I said, "I have nothing to say."  And  then  the

next  day, the press came out and said, "Nothing to say, what

an MP!  What can he do for his constituents?"  So a couple of

my  colleagues  got  a bit concerned that  I  might  lose  my

elections.   Anyhow,  I pushed on.  I  had  a  couple  of  my

colleagues come to help me.  We fought.  What was the result?

I won decisively.  Not only were my colleagues surprised, but

the candidate who fought me from the United Front (I think he

was the Secretary General) was also surprised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the interesting thing was I had a summons to go to

Istana.  I use the word "summons" in a pleasant sense - it is

not the punishment that we all expect, but a nice little meal

with  the Prime Minister.  Of course, today, he is the Senior

Minister, and he asked me, "You won decisively.  You won with

good results.  What did you

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>

do?   Did  you  give them vain promises?"  I  said,  "No.   I

didn't do such things."  As you know, SM does not speak  very

much.   But  at certain times, you could see, you could  feel

this silent nod of approval for my results.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If SM is so careful with his young little candidate

going  out  there  winning results and  winning  properly,  I

cannot  imagine he would endorse anyone of us, let alone  the

Minister for Home Affairs, trying to fiddle with the  results

of  the elections.  So when I read the press this morning,  I

said,  "Ah,  this looks as though there is this very  strange

message  going through that the Opposition feels there  is  a

possibility  of  us fixing the election results  through  the

computers."  Then I thought I better say something, if not, I

would not be doing my country a favour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have kept this for over 20 years. Nobody knew about

it,  except SM and myself, not even my wife.  So when I  told

her  this  morning,  she  said,  "Oh,  you  really  had  that

experience."   Yes, I did.  So before it fades away  from  my

memory, I thought I would quote this little incident  to  try

to  do  justice to a truth, and not allow constant repetition

of untruths become the truths.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my colleagues told me this morning that Mr

Jeyaretnam probably could have come from St. Andrew's School.

I  expressed a bit of shock because, in St. Andrew's School - I  came from St. Andrew's School, Sir, and I was one of those

who  was a very keen sportsman, I was Captain of Rugby  15  - one  of the lessons we learnt is sportsmanship.  When we win,

we  win  happily.  When we lose, we lose sportingly.   And  I

would  say  to  Mr  Jeyaretnam  and  my  colleagues  in   the

Opposition,  let  us fight healthily, let us  play  the  game

properly, let us win, and win properly.  If we lose, we  lose

properly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One incident I had was with Sarawak Rangers. When they

played  the game with me, I had the ball with me.  They  came

for  me  and  they punched me under the belt.   My  principal

said, "Play on.  Don't scold, don't shout.  Push on."  And  I

suggest that we all do the same.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I rise to speak in support of the Bill.  I applaud  the

Government for its willingness to recognise how globalisation

affects the democratic process as Singapore citizens continue

to  become  global citizens.  The Government should  also  be

commended  for  its  willingness to  leverage  on  technology

through  the introduction of electronic voting.  The proposed

amendment to minimise the need for unnecessary recounting  is

also a step forward in the right direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having proposed all these changes, Sir, I feel that the

Government should go one step further.  In the same  vein  as

the  previous  speakers, I would like to urge the  Government

not  to deny any Singapore citizens, regardless of where they

are  residing  in and for whatever the period  of  time,  the

fundamental right to vote, so long as they remain citizens of

Singapore.  I would also like to appeal to the Government  to

go slow in its introduction of electronic voting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in earlier elections, overseas voting may be

inconceivable due to the logistics and timing involved.   But

advancements in communication, technology and IT have blurred

geographic  boundaries and shrunk the world.  Meanwhile,  our

global  participation had led some Singaporeans  to  take  up

residence  abroad.   In this regard, the Government  must  be

given  credit for its willingness to keep up with the  times.

Hence,  I  am  very pleased that the Government  has  allowed

overseas voting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, voting is a fundamental right for citizenship. All

Singapore  citizens should have the right to vote  regardless

of  whether  they are ordinarily resident in Singapore.   The

two  years  out  of  the  five years rule  is  an  artificial

criterion.   The  basis  for it is  seemingly  to  sieve  out

Singaporeans  who  are  more genuine  Singapore  citizens  by

virtue  of  their tenure as residents in the period preceding

the  election.  But the proof of longer residency  is  not  a

foolproof  argument  that  such  Singapore  citizens  have  a

greater stake in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>

the  well-being of Singapore and that they would  cast  their

votes with the best interest of the nation at heart and  with

open eyes on the impact of their votes.  If this is the case,

does  it  mean that the poverty stricken and the bankrupt  in

the  country  should not be given the right to  vote  because

there  is  very  little, if at all, any  stake  left  in  it?

Certainly  not.  Because the right to vote is the fundamental

right of every Singapore citizen.  Conversely, a short period

of  residency is not a foolproof argument to assume that such

Singapore citizens no longer have the interest of the  nation

at  heart,  that they are no longer patriotic and,  as  such,

their right to vote ought to be forfeited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans work and live abroad for a varied host of

reasons which could be the subject of a separate debate.  Due

to  the  education  and  the environment,  Singaporeans  have

become  global  citizens and it is a credit to the  Singapore

Government  that our Singaporeans have become so  mobile  and

acceptable elsewhere.  But this should not be the  reason  to

disenfranchise  them as, in their own way, they  have  become

ambassadors   for  our  island  state  and,  sometimes,   our

strongest  supporters in the face of foreign sceptics.   This

would not be fair to those who have been working abroad for a

long  time and are still sending their money back home.  This

would  not be fair to those who are married out of Singapore,

but  still  maintain close contacts with  their  families  in

Singapore  and make regular visits back home.  This  is  also

not  fair judgement on those who still follow the local  news

via our local newspapers' websites or avidly watch Singapore-produced programmes broadcast in the new country of residence

which may be temporary in nature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the right to vote should simply be a fundamental

right  of  being a Singapore citizen.  As long  as  Singapore

citizens  do  not  denounce  their citizenship,  they  should

continue  to  maintain  their stake  in  Singapore  Inc.   In

effect, they should continue to be a shareholder of Singapore

Inc.  with the right to vote irrespective of where  they  are

and  how  long they have been there.  If I am a  top  doctor,

scientist, or academic, who has taken up overseas

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>

residence for many years but I am still a Singapore  citizen,

I  would  probably  go to the Embassy  to  cast  my  vote  on

election  day,  if  I still have the right  to  vote  for  my

country.   I  also  value  the Singapore  Government's  tacit

understanding  of  my  contribution as a Singaporean  outside

Singapore.  I may even consider an appropriate time to return

to  Singapore  and  make  my  contribution  in  my  field  of

expertise  for  the  best  interest of  Singaporeans  as  the

linkage has not been severed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every time local dishes, such as Hainanese chicken

rice,  char  kuay  teow,  mee  rebus,  and  mee  goreng,  are

mentioned,  the knees of Singaporeans who take  up  residence

abroad  will grow feeble.   Even if they have been  away  for

five or 10 years, they still crave for their authentic Katong

laksa,  the Malay satay and Jalan Kayu roti prata.  Time  has

no effect in diminishing their taste of what is good and what

is  Singaporean.  Similarly, time should have  no  effect  in

diminishing  the worth of overseas Singaporeans to  vote  and

the  worth  of their votes.  We should not presume that  they

would not have the interest of Singapore at heart.  We should

not  presume that, in future, they do not intend to  take  up

their  stake in Singapore and take up residence in  Singapore

again.  In fairness, our Government has done an excellent job

in getting some of our top brains back home again.  For this,

I  salute the Government for what it has achieved.  But I  am

asking the Government to go one step further by allowing  all

Singapore citizens the right to vote regardless of the length

of  residency  in  Singapore in  the  run-up  period  to  the

election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now urge the Government to go slow in its

introduction of electronic voting.  I wish to state,  at  the

onset,  that  I  am  not  averse to changes  or  the  use  of

technology to keep up with the time.  But my concern is  that

some  Singaporeans, especially the older generation, may  not

be  adequately  exposed to the IT revolution.   Some  of  our

older  Singaporeans  still  stash  their  money  under  their

mattresses,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>

rather  than put it into  the bank.  They may harbour  doubts

as  to  whether the use of electronic voting is  a  foolproof

system,  the results of which cannot be tampered  with.   The

electronic  voting  system may be user-friendly.   But  there

will still be some who do not trust it completely.  This  may

be due to newspapers' reports of glitches in using electronic

system,  for example, the ATM banking machines.  Despite  all

the  safeguards that banks have put into  place,  there  will

still be the odd  situation of system malfunction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the election, how can we ensure that the

electronic  voting system will not fail?  Should we  not  put

the electronic system on trial and ensure that the safeguards

are adequate before implementing it on a broader basis at the

next  general election?  In past elections, the manual voting

and  counting  system gave Singaporean voters a semblance  of

assurance in the system.  It is not a foolproof system as  it

can  still be subject to human error and hence the  need  for

recounting.   But  it  is  a  system  with  human  faces,  an

intervention   that  the  older  generation  of   voters   is

accustomed   to.    For  them,  manual   counting   is   more

transparent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's population is a red dot compared to the

United  States  and  the time that we take  for  counting  is

within  acceptable, accustomed time limits.  It is  something

that  we  can  still  tolerate at the next general  election.

Meanwhile, we can try out the electronic voting system  on  a

trial  basis in a few constituencies, with a parallel  manual

run  to  give  voters the confidence that  electronic  voting

really works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the Bill aims to

introduce serious changes to our election laws.  For a start,

it  will  introduce overseas voting by Singaporeans  who  are

working  or  studying overseas.  It is certainly welcomed  by

many  Singaporeans and is in line with Singapore 21  to  make

every Singaporean count.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, I would like to reiterate that in

Singapore, many Singaporeans trust the voting system that  we

have  in  Singapore.   Yesterday, as  I  sat  in  this  House

listening to the speech made by the hon. NCMP, Mr Jeyaretnam,

I  was indeed not only embarrassed by the statements that  he

made  -  and I, in fact, endorse the statement of the  Deputy

Speaker earlier that he made nonsensical statements - because

for  a start he cited the examples of the 1980 election,  the

1993  presidential election, and the 1997 Cheng  San  general

election  results  to  highlight that the  results  were  not

favourable  to  him and, as such, he has lost  faith  in  the

election  system  and  in the voting process.   But  what  he

failed  to  highlight - and I think perhaps due to  selective

amnesia  - was that in 1981, he was elected as the Member  of

Parliament  for Anson and he did not explain how he  won  and

whether  he  won  at  the behest of the Government.   And  he

further did injustice to the other two Opposition Members  in

this House, namely the Member for Potong Pasir and the Member

for  Hougang,  because by hinting that the  process  was  not

something proper, he again hints that the election  of  these

two  Opposition Members to Parliament itself was not a proper

process.   This  again does injustice both to  the  two  hon.

Members  of the Opposition and to Singaporeans at  large  who

voted for them and for the other MPs of this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let me say, Sir, that many Singaporeans were indeed

surprised.   Some  of the friends that I  met  today  in  the

course  of  my  work were also surprised by the statement  he

made  because  many Singaporeans, when they  go  to  vote  to

exercise  their  selection of the Member  of  Parliament  for

their constituency, do it with confidence and do it with free

choice.   As  such, Sir, I would like to reiterate  that  not

only  myself  but many Singaporeans have great trust  in  the

integrity of the election process in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the specific clauses, and

highlight matters which are of concern.  First of all, on the

overseas voting (clauses 3 and 9).  Sir, the amendment  seeks

to impose a requirement of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>

residence in Singapore of two years out of the preceding five

years.   I  would like to ask the Minister the rationale  for

the  imposition  of this 2-year residential requirement.   If

the  object  is  to  enable  all  Singaporeans  overseas   to

participate  in  the  elections and to determine  the  future

government of this country, I find the requirement  a  little

onerous.  Some could be employed overseas, and the only  time

they come back to Singapore would be during their short leave

period.   I  would request the Minister to consider  lowering

the  residency  requirement to about  two  months,  with  the

provision  that the period not be one that runs consecutively

but the aggregate number of the total number of days spent in

Singapore during the 5-year period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister as to why the

exemption  provisions  do not provide for  students  who  are

studying overseas, either on a private company scholarship or

at their own cost.  Sir, I notice that scholars on Government

or  statutory  board  bonds  are  excluded  from  the  2-year

residency   requirement.   As  a  good  number  of  Singapore

students are studying overseas due to their inability to  get

into  the  local universities, it will be a pity if they  are

excluded  from  being eligible to vote due  to  the  proposed

provision.  This is particularly so if they are pursuing post-graduate education.  Sir, it is essential that we get as many

Singaporeans  as possible to participate in the  election  of

the  future government, as it will certainly create a greater

sense  of  participation in determining  the  future  of  the

Singapore Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, secondly, let me move on to electronic voting or

new  section 50A.  Sir, I commend the Minister for taking the

bold  initiative to introduce electronic voting in Singapore.

It  is the way to go for the future.  It will certainly speed

up the counting of votes and the announcement of the election

results  in  future.  We have seen the speed and accuracy  of

electronic voting in this House when votes are taken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new section 33A proposes that the DRE voting

system cannot be used

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>

unless  the  voting system is approved by the Auditor-General

or any other person appointed by the Minister in consultation

with  the  Auditor-General.  I would like to ask the Minister

to  explain who this other person will be.  I would urge  the

Minister,  if  possible,  to define this  other  person,  for

example,  a  High  Court judge or any other person,  whom  he

wants  to  appoint precisely in this Bill so  that  everybody

knows that this person who is going to audit this system is a

person who is impartial and above board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to suggest that in view of the high

respect and independence enjoyed by the office of the Auditor-General,  whether  the Minister could consider  changing  the

consultation  process into a concurrence or  consent  of  the

Auditor-General.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to note that the Minister, in introducing

the  Bill, referred to the touch-screen method to be used for

the DRE system of voting.  From my experience in dealing with

senior  citizens, I think the best way to get senior citizens

to  use  IT services is through the provision of touch-screen

solutions which are very easy to use.  Sir, this is something

that  many  elderly citizens will find easy to use  and  will

certainly catch on very fast.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask the Minister as to whether

electronic voting will give voters the same choices  as  they

have now, which is (1) to vote for any one of the candidates,

or  (2)  to spoil the vote or abstain from voting.   Perhaps,

some  clarification of the actual process  involved  will  go

towards  removing some nagging suspicion on the part of  some

individuals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move finally to the question of recounting

of  votes.  New section 49B seeks to introduce some  finality

to  the recounting of votes.  It imposes the requirement that

the  recounting  of  votes  can  only  be  allowed  when  the

difference in votes exceeds 2% between the winning and losing

candidates.   Even  then, only one recount will  be  allowed.

Sir, I believe that this margin is reasonable, and a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>

sound  margin for any possible error in counting.  This  will

certainly  put  some  finality  to  frivolous  requests   for

recounting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir,

I thank the Members for speaking on this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me clarify that election matters are

not  under the Ministry of Home Affairs.  The fact that I  am

doing  it is because the Prime Minister has asked me to  lead

the  study  group  to  go overseas and  find  out  how  other

countries  do  electronic voting.  I have  been  helping  the

Prime   Minister   also  in  other  matters  concerning   the

Parliamentary Elections Act, and that is why I am tasked with

this  responsibility  to bring up this  Bill  in  Parliament.

There  is  no  secret about this.  I do not know whether  the

Prime   Minister  will  decide  to  transfer  his   Elections

Department  to  the  Ministry of Home  Affairs.   That  is  a

decision for him to take.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have talked about the criteria other

than  citizenship  to  be eligible for overseas  voting,  and

asked  why  not  we include employees of local  companies  or

multinational  companies with offices here.  Some  have  also

made  the point that voting is a right, not just a privilege,

and Mr Simon Tay has mentioned Article 12 of the Constitution

which  ensures equality for all citizens.  In  fact,  I  have

covered  some  of  these  points in my  speech,  but  let  me

reiterate them here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 5-year period for the qualifying criterion was

chosen as it corresponds with a parliamentary election  term,

which  is  five  years.  For an overseas  Singaporean  to  be

deemed  to be "ordinarily resident", in our view, is that  he

must  have an aggregate of two years' residence out of  five.

This  is reasonable.  In New Zealand and Canada, a voter must

not  be  out  of the country for three years and  five  years

respectively  before  he  is eligible  to  vote.   Setting  a

qualifying  criterion based on residence is not an  invention

by us.  Others have also done it.  In fact, by expanding

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1591</b></font><br><br>

this  definition of "ordinarily resident", we  have  made  it

possible for certain groups of residents, ie, those who  have

lived in Singapore two years out of five years, to be able to

vote  overseas.   Otherwise,  by  the  strict  definition  of

"ordinarily  resident", if Singaporeans have  actually  moved

away  from Singapore, they have gone overseas to work,  study

or  whatever,  then  they  are not "ordinarily  resident"  in

Singapore and, therefore, they are not eligible to vote under

the  Parliamentary Elections Act, unless they come back.  And

provided,  of  course, if their names  still  remain  in  the

electoral register, then they can vote.  So we have  actually

expanded  this  definition and made  it  possible  for  these

citizens  who  have lived in Singapore for two years  out  of

five  years  to  be able to vote overseas.  I  hope  that  is

simple enough for people to understand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are suggestions on including other criteria, such

as  whether they have some assets in Singapore, whether  they

have  properties  in  Singapore, whether they  have  economic

interests in Singapore or their loyalties to Singapore, their

ties to Singapore, their stakes in Singapore, and so on.   We

can  choose a lot of criteria, but we must find one  that  is

easy to understand, easy to implement and is convenient.   It

is  difficult  for  us  to define what is  "stake",  what  is

"emotional  ties" and so on.  All these are  matters  of  the

heart, not matters that one can measure.  But when we come to

residence,  we can all measure residence - how long  has  one

lived  here  during this period when one wants to qualify  to

vote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not doubting the loyalties or emotional links of

Singaporeans  to Singapore just because they  live  overseas.

We  believe  that many of them will come back  to  Singapore,

they  feel  strongly attached to Singapore, they will  defend

Singapore's interests whenever Singapore is criticised.   But

if  we  were  to  find any other criteria  to  determine  the

eligibility  to  vote,  we  will  end  up  with  a   lot   of

difficulties  in  implementation.  So since  other  countries

have  also adopted a similar, simple, residential requirement

as  a criterion to vote overseas, I think that is a safe  and

simple way to do.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically on Mr Simon Tay's point on Article 12

versus  the choice of overseas station, the Bill itself  does

not designate the particular overseas polling stations.  That

is  left  to  the administrative discretion of the  Returning

Officer.   Article 12 of the Constitution is  not  really  an

issue.   Article  12 is infringed only if  a  person  who  is

similarly  situated in that place is treated differently  for

no  rational basis.  We have a rational basis for designating

certain  missions  in  one country  as  an  overseas  polling

station  and not another, ie, we have to regard the  size  of

the  voting population and the adequacy of the mission  staff

to  conduct  the  poll  and  the security  of  the  mission's

premises.   These  are  rational  bases  for  deciding  which

overseas  missions  will  be polling  stations.   These  same

criteria  are also used in Singapore when we decide on  where

to put a polling station.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be emphasised that no registered overseas voter

resident in a country that does not have an overseas  polling

station  is  in  any  way disadvantaged or  deprived  of  his

entitlement  to  vote.  He can be allocated  to  the  nearest

overseas polling station or, if he is already in the register

of  electors, he can always vote in Singapore when he  is  in

Singapore.   If  he  stays in a country that  is  nearby  the

mission  where we have an overseas polling station, there  is

nothing  stopping him from registering himself as an overseas

voter and vote in that particular mission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an example. If a Singaporean who is

eligible  to  vote  stays in Paris, the nearest  mission  for

voting is London.  He can actually register and then vote  in

London.   We  have not decided to open a polling  station  in

Paris, not at this time, but when there is a reason to do so,

we  will  do  so.   But, for now, we have grouped  all  those

living in Europe so that they can vote in London.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not every overseas citizen can be qualified to vote, so

long  as  parliamentary elections continue to  be  run  on  a

constituency  representation  basis.   And  there  remains  a

threat of plural voting.  The Parliamentary

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>

Elections Act already differentiates between resident and non-resident citizens, as I explained earlier.  Only citizens who

are  resident here are qualified to be registered  as  voters

and  to vote.  The residency requirement is necessary so that

we  can  allocate  him a particular constituency.   One  hon.

Member  has  asked,  for an overseas voter,  where  will  his

constituency  be.   His constituency must  be  the  Singapore

address  for  which he has registered himself as a  resident.

It  cannot  be an address in London because we  do  not  have

constituencies  in  London.  It is a simple  matter  which  I

explained yesterday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment therefore would not remove this

distinction  that he must have a Singapore address.  What  it

does is to extend the requirement of residency to include the

groups  of  citizens  who are away from  Singapore  for  non-permanent  reasons,  and hence have  sufficient  ties  to  be

allocated  to  vote in respect of a particular  constituency.

They are on overseas assignments or training at the behest of

the Government, that is, the Government sent them there, they

are  made non-resident by reason of the Government's decision

or  action.  The Government asked them to go.  As for  others

working  in  international agencies, for example, the  United

Nations, it is not just any international agency, it must  be

an  international agency of which Singapore is a member.   If

he  says  that he works in a particular international agency,

but  Singapore  is  not  a member, then  that  person  cannot

register himself as an overseas voter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some MPs have also asked about the distinction between

those  sent  by the Government to study or work overseas  and

other  overseas Singaporeans.  I have just said that for  the

officials,  they  are sent overseas by the  Government,  they

perform an official duty.  For the students, they are sent by

the  Government and they are bonded to serve the  Government.

Therein lies the distinction between them and those who go on

their  own  or work for other companies.  They  go  there  on

their own choice, are sent by their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>

companies,  or they go there on their own choice  with  their

parents'  money to study whereas, for those who are  sent  by

the   Government,  we  have  asked  them  to  do  so.    This

distinction  is  made  also in the  election  laws  of  other

countries  when  they provide for overseas  voting.   I  have

cited  a  few  examples - such as Canada and New Zealand  are

doing the same thing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin and Mr Simon Tay have also suggested that

those  who  hold dual citizenship or who have become  PRs  of

another  country should not be allowed to register  to  vote.

Firstly, in order to qualify as a voter, the voter must be  a

Singapore citizen.  So when registering as an overseas voter,

that  person would have to declare that he is still a citizen

and that he is not disqualified to register as a voter before

he  can  vote overseas.  Under section 6 of the Parliamentary

Elections  Act, those citizens who have sworn  allegiance  to

other  countries,  or those whose names are  entered  on  the

Register of Electors in another country, would not qualify to

vote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of dual citizenship does not arise because we

do  not  recognise dual citizenship.  If a  person  has  dual

citizenship, then we can take action to deprive  him  of  his

Singapore citizenship when we find out.  At the time when the

citizen declares that he is a citizen, we do not know  if  he

is  not already a citizen of another country.  But when he is

subsequently found out, then we can take action  against  him

for  false declaration, or to deprive him of his citizenship.

And  if he were to return, we can actually prosecute him  for

making a false declaration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards permanent residents, a Singapore citizen who

is a permanent resident of another country is still a citizen

of  Singapore, so we cannot say that just because a person is

a  permanent resident of Australia, Britain or United States,

we  should  deprive him of his vote.  Until he has  taken  up

citizenship of another country and sworn allegiance  to  that

country,  he  is  still  a citizen and  therefore  should  be

eligible to vote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin also asked whether overseas voting is

compulsory.  Voting itself is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>

compulsory  in  Singapore.   Regardless  of  whether  he   is

overseas or in Singapore, voting is compulsory.  We have made

it  available for overseas Singaporeans, those who  have  two

years out of five years residency, to register as a voter and

they should and could register to vote.  If they do not vote,

then  their  names  will be taken off the Register  as  would

happen  to them if they were in Singapore.   The practice  is

no different for overseas voting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some MPs also suggested that to facilitate overseas

Singapore citizens to vote, why do we not have postal voting.

Postal  voting  has  its  own set of  problems.   For  postal

voting,  we  need  to send the ballot paper  to  that  voter.

Then, he needs to send the ballot paper back to the Returning

Officer.  In the process, the vote can be lost, either in the

postal  stage when the department sends the ballot paper,  or

when  the  voter  sends the ballot paper back  to  Singapore.

There  will  be  a  lot  of arguments about  whether  it  was

actually  done or not.  Besides, our election  period  is  so

short.   From the writ of election to nomination and  to  the

day  of  poll, the time taken for postal voting would not  be

enough  because  of  our election period.   Also,  votes  are

secret.   When ballot papers are sent overseas, who mark  the

ballot papers, who send them back, it is again very difficult

to  verify  that.   So, the secrecy of  the  votes  would  be

compromised, particularly when we do not even know who  marks

that ballot paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay also suggested early voting for those who

happen  to  leave Singapore.  They are actually in Singapore,

registered  as  a Singapore voter, but they happen  to  leave

Singapore on polling day.  We have considered this.  In other

countries, they call this absentee voting.  We again  do  not

have  time  to register the absentee voter.  To do  so  means

that  we  have to give them the ballot papers beforehand  and

the  ballot  papers  cannot  be given  beforehand  until  the

polling day.  Then, no canvassing is allowed during the  time

when a voter is supposed to vote.  Yet, when he sends in  his

vote,  for example, somebody may have canvassed him, and  the

secrecy of the vote again

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>

cannot  be  ensured.  It is better that he turns  up  at  the

polling station to vote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked whether the Elections Department

can  let the candidates know where their overseas voters  are

residing  so that the candidates can send whatever  materials

that  are  necessary  to keep the voters  informed  of  their

platform,  promises, and whatever.  That overseas  voter  has

registered  a  Singapore  address.   The  best  way  for  the

candidate is actually to send the material to that particular

address which the candidate could get by buying the Register,

and  then  let voter's relatives send him those communication

materials  rather than for the candidate to do  so,  as  that

would involve other operational difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On electronic voting, there are a few questions about

allowing  the  voter a choice between electronic  voting  and

paper  voting.  Mr Chiam and Mr Noris Ong asked that  we  try

out both the paper ballot as well as the electronic ballot on

a pilot basis.  Mr Chiam himself also said that we should not

have more than one system operating in an election.   He also

said  that  we  should not implement electronic voting  until

everything  is  ready and able to be universally  implemented

for  all  the  constituencies.  Some also asked  why  we  are

rushing  into  this  and  that  we  should  not  choose   the

Opposition wards for trying out electronic voting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Chiam contradicted himself in some of his

comments.   On  one  hand, he said that both  the  electronic

voting  system and the paper ballot system be made  available

for  voters  to  choose  should we decide  to  implement  the

electronic voting.  On the other hand, he said that we should

not have more than one type of voting system.  We cannot have

both  situations.  In the way he argued it, it does not  make

sense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing voters to have different systems in the same

polling station would actually complicate the voting process.

I  cannot  imagine  a situation where we have,  say,  in  one

constituency where e-voting and paper ballot are carried out

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>

at  the  same  time, and the voters can do both at  the  same

time.   When  that happens, who would ensure that that  voter

votes  for the same party, both on the paper ballot  and  the

electronic  ballot?  He could press "PAP" on the screen,  but

on the ballot paper, he marks, say, "SPP" (for the sake of Mr

Chiam).  When the officials do the count, they will find that

the  results are totally different and Mr Chiam will then say

that  the system cannot be trusted.  It is a very silly idea.

It  is  totally impracticable.  It is impossible to implement

unless  we  have the Presiding Officer standing next  to  the

voter and say, "Let me make sure that you mark "PAP" on  both

the  electronic  screen as well as on the paper  ballot,  and

after that you drop the paper ballot into the box".  But does

the  voter want the election officials to do that - to  watch

what  he  votes?  After all, voting is secret.   I  think  we

should not try this idea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why we are only trying this out on a limited

scale, as some have also noted that this is the first time we

are  having  electronic voting, I think it  is  not  wise  to

implement  electronic voting for all the constituencies  that

are  being contested.  It is better to start on a small scale

and  make it easily understood and educate the voters of that

particular constituency, make sure people understand  how  it

works  and  have confidence in the system before we implement

it  in  other constituencies.  It has nothing to do with  the

confidence  of  the  system.  I am quite sure  that  when  we

implement  this  system,  we  will  be  able  to  ensure  the

integrity  of voting system.  The votes will be secret.   The

voter  could not be traced unless it is ordered by the court.

And  the election official would not know who that voter  has

voted  for, even looking at his screen.  I can assure Members

that in the verification, certification, testing of the whole

system,   the  Auditor-General,  who  is  tasked  with   that

responsibility, would make very sure of that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trying this system out on a small scale is not something

that  is  really  new.  Other countries,  like  Belgium,  for

example, tried

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>

out  electronic voting in 1991 in two electoral cantons.  The

Dutch  tried  out the touch-screen system in  1998  in  eight

municipalities.  I am told that they would be expanding  this

to  other municipalities and cantons.  It is not uncommon  to

have  different voting systems in the same country.  Look  at

the  United  States.  They have different voting  systems  in

different  states, and even within the same state, they  have

different voting systems in different counties.  We can  have

different voting systems, provided people are educated  about

them  and  officials are trained to do the  job,  and  people

understand the system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam is afraid that we will implement e-voting in

Potong  Pasir.  I can assure him that since he does not  like

it, we will not implement it there.  I do not know whether Mr

Low Thia Khiang would volunteer or not.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Mr Low does not mind. He has great

confidence in the system.  Our Elections Department would  be

quite  careful to determine where to implement e-voting.   In

Mr  Chiam's case, for example, he is afraid that if he loses,

then  what  happens?  Could he put the blame on the  e-voting

system?  For that reason, I think we will definitely not have

e-voting  in  Potong Pasir.  Otherwise, if Mr Chiam  were  to

lose,  he  will  blame it on the system,  and  we  will  have

endless trouble. For Hougang, maybe we will consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam and Mr Jeyaretnam have also asked why are we

rushing  into this.  They said that the time is so short  and

this  is such a great secret.  There is no secret about this.

The  fact is that it was made known and we start to tell  the

public.  Eventually, we educate the public about it,  and  we

cannot do this in secret.  If we want this to have widespread

acceptance  and  easy  to understand,  we  must  tell  people

beforehand.   But before the system can even be  implemented,

it  has  to  be tested and certified before we can implement.

And unless the system is ready  -  in other words, tested and

certified before the writ

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1599</b></font><br><br>

is  issued   -   we will not implement the electronic  voting

system.   We  can  only  do so when the system  is  certified

before the writ is issued.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question of secrecy of votes seems to trouble

people.  Let me assure Members that the secrecy of votes will

be  maintained, just as in the paper ballot system.  It is no

different.   In  the  writing of  the  software  and  in  the

designing of the system, in the machines, in the connections,

the  Auditor-General will make sure that  this  will  be  the

case.   I cannot get into the technical details of the system

right  now, but, definitely, voter secrecy is the key feature

in the e-voting system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the testing process, at the end of it, before it is

sealed, Opposition parties can send their representatives  to

see to it that the system works in the way it is intended  to

work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an audit trail in the paper ballot. There will

also  be  an audit trail in the e-voting system.   The  audit

trail  is  not to check who voted for whom after the election

by  the  Government.  The audit trail is to  make  sure  that

indeed a vote was registered by such and such a voter bearing

that particular serial number. And, eventually, when there is

to  be  a check arising from an election petition, then there

is  a  record  of that vote, voter and so on.   That  is  the

purpose  of the audit trail.  Nobody will know who voted  for

whom  until  there  is an election petition  ordered  by  the

court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The election official will not know how a voter voted

during the voting process.  Unless, of course, the voter  who

needs   assistance,  say,  a  person  who  is  blind,   needs

assistance  and says to the election official,  "Please  mark

this for me."  And this is nothing new.  This is also done in

the  paper ballot system.  So only in that instance will  the

vote  be  known to the Presiding Officer.  But that Presiding

Officer,  the election official, has been sworn  to  secrecy.

So Members can be assured that it will be kept that way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of senior citizens and their fear of

machines, let me assure

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>

Members there will be an extensive public education programme

to educate the public about the electronic voting system.  We

will involve the various community organisations in this.  We

will also put this in some of the shopping malls where people

go  to.  During the election campaign when a constituency  is

selected,  we  will  also make extra effort  to  educate  the

voters   of  that  particular  constituency,  so   that   the

constituents  can go to the community centre, community  club

or other community buildings and premises to learn how to use

the system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On polling day itself, we will also set up demonstration

machines.  But the demonstration machines will not  bear  the

same  kind of ballot paper symbols as in the actual  contest.

It  will be just a mock-up showing different symbols, and the

voter will be taught how to use the machines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There could also be a video screening during the time

that  the  voters line up to vote, for them to  see  how  the

voting  is to be done, just to refresh the memory.   If  they

still need assistance, the election officials will be on hand

to  show them how to vote at the demonstration set.  So there

will be a lot of education.  In the process of educating  the

public  before  the writ is issued and before the  system  is

certified, we will try to get feedback from them.   If  there

are  good  ideas to incorporate in the system, they  will  be

incorporated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang and some MPs have asked what happens if the

system breaks down half way.  If the system breaks down  half

way,  there will be technical staff on standby to try to  fix

the  problem.   There  will be power generators  on  standby.

There will be extra machines on standby, so that these can be

used  to  supplement either the power outages or the machines

that  cannot  work.  But in the event that everything  cannot

work,  we  can still use the paper ballot.  What  happens  to

those  voters who have already voted electronically?  Are  we

going  to  call  them  back?  There is no  need  to,  because

whatever  votes  that  are recorded in the  machine  will  be

stored there, and they can be read and counted, and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>

system  will know who have voted.  So we can be rest  assured

that  we  will  try to find all possible ways  and  means  to

overcome this problem of machine breakdown.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam is not here. His usual practice is to

raise  points and then he absents himself and does not bother

to  listen to the answers.  Then, at subsequent sittings,  he

will raise the same points again because he did not hear  the

answers.   It  is not for his sake, but for the  reason  that

because  he  raised some of these points  -  and I  think  he

made  serious  allegations which are totally baseless   -   I

must counter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the points he made was that this Bill be referred

to  a Select Committee.  There is no need to do so because we

are  not  doing  something which is  totally  new.   This  is

something that has been tried by many other countries, and we

are  learning and adapting it for our use.  So I do not think

there is a need to refer this Bill to a Select Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cited a long list of complaints about fairness and

unfairness in elections and the confidence of the  people  in

the  electoral process.  He tried to discredit our  electoral

process  by  giving  examples of the 1980 election  in  Telok

Blangah  or  the  1997 election in Cheng San where  he  lost.

Then  out  of  nowhere, he talked about the 1993 Presidential

election,  which  he said people had told him  that  Mr  Chua

should  have won.  These are totally baseless and  groundless

allegations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam is a lawyer. He knows the law. I presume

he  does.   If he believes that there is electoral  fraud,  I

think  given half a chance, he will make a big song and dance

out  of it.  He will make a big issue of it, and he will  not

hesitate to take the matter to court.  He has sued the  Prime

Minister  but he lost.  That is an example of how he  decided

that  he  should  use the court as a process  to  settle  his

problem.    He is now suing his party leaders.  He knows  how

to  make  full use of the law.  So if there is  any  sign  or

evidence that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>1980&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telok  Blangah election or the 1997 Cheng San  election

was  fraudulent, he would have gone straight  to  the  court.

Indeed,  he did.  He asked somebody.  Maybe he did  not  ask,

but  somebody  complained about the 1980  election  in  Telok

Blangah  and he went to court to petition but it  was  thrown

out.    I  do not know why Mr Jeyaretnam keeps on harking  on

these issues, as if it is such a big thing to him when he has

got  no basis in his allegation.  The only conclusion that  I

can  come  to is that when he raised the point,  he  did  not

bother  to  listen  to  the  answers.   Then  he  comes  back

subsequently  rehashing  the same  old  points  like  an  old

record.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam also seems to have a perverse

understanding  of what is a free and fair election.   A  free

and  fair  election, to him, means that when he wins,  it  is

free and fair.  When he loses, it is not free and fair.  Like

Mr Ravindran said, he won in the 1981 by-election.  He won in

1984.  He did not complain that these were not won freely and

fairly.   We had four Opposition MPs in 1991  -  Mr  Low,  Mr

Chiam,  Mr  Ling How Doong and Mr Cheo Chai Chen.  They  won.

They  have not made allegations that the elections which they

won  were  not  free  and  fair.  So it  is  Mr  Jeyaretnam's

understanding  of what is "free and fair" election.   To  me,

his definition is quite perverse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have any doubt that our Elections Department,

the  Returning  Officers and all those who assist  them  will

carry  out  their duties fairly and impartially.   He  talked

about  other countries having election commissions.  He  also

cited  the  example of the Philippines where  they  have  NGO

election  watchers.  We know what happens in the Philippines.

Do  they  have free and fair elections?  I do  not  know.   I

think only Mr Jeyaretnam thinks so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, it is not a question of whether or not we

have  an  independent election commission,  or  an  Elections

Department under the Prime Minister's Office.  Ultimately, in

every system or every commission or mission, it is the people

behind it.  The people who run and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>

manage the system must have the honesty and integrity to make

sure  that  they do their job properly.  That is  the  litmus

test,  not  the number of commissions that we have,  not  the

type of systems that we have.  It is ultimately the integrity

of the people who run it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran asked me who is this other person, apart

from  the  Auditor-General who may be appointed to audit  the

system.   Right now, we do not have any particular person  in

mind.   But like many of the other statutes that we have,  we

either get the Auditor-General or somebody else appointed  in

consultation  with the Auditor-General to  do  the  auditing.

That person must be someone with the skills, the expertise to

do  the  job of testing and certifying the electronic  voting

system.   For  example, it could well be one  of  the  public

accounting firms that has the expertise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have answered most of the points, if

not all of them, raised by Members.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, I just like to ask the

Minister a clarification.  He mentioned just now that  voting

is compulsory, and that one of the consequences of not voting

will be that your name will be expunged from the register  of

electors.  If a person were to be overseas and qualifies  but

he  happens, for example, to be working in Germany or Norway,

he would have difficulty going to London to vote.  Is there a

duty  on him to register?  And if he registers, must he  also

travel physically to London to vote?  What happens if he does

not?   Will  his name then be expunged from the  register  of

electors and will there be a chance for him to reinstate  his

name with minimum inconvenience?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I think this situation is no

different  from  a person who is working overseas  but  whose

name  appears on the Electoral Register.  So if,  because  of

work,  he  cannot come back to vote right now, then his  name

will be taken off the register.  But if he has a reason to be

away - he shows his

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>

passport and says he was away in Germany and therefore cannot

come  back  to vote - then his name will be restored  in  the

register.  Similarly, in the case of an overseas register, it

is  the  same  thing.   We  open the  register  for  overseas

Singaporeans to register, they check and they register.   And

if  they  do not go and vote, their names will be taken  out.

If  they happen to stay in Germany but the polling station is

in  London,  he has a good reason not being able to  turn  up

physically  to vote in London, then again his name  would  be

restored.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Minister has not responded

to  some of the issues I raised in my speech.  One is that  I

believe  that the receipt system should become  part  of  the

electronic  voting system in the future.  I  am  also  asking

whether it is possible to actually simplify the process of e-voting.   Right  now, you have three panels - languages,  the

vote, and then "Yes" and "No".  Can we do away with the first

panel,  and just have two panels, and also instead  of  "Yes"

and  "No" or in other languages, can we not use some symbols,

which would be easier for people who may be illiterate?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I think, for background purposes,

there  are  others who do not know what is  actually  on  the

screen,  let  me explain.  There was a demonstration  by  the

Elections Department for the MPs a few days ago to  show  how

the  screen looks like.  That is only an example of  how  the

screen will look like.  Ultimately, how the screen will  look

like depends on the submissions made by the tenderers of  the

system.   They  may come back with a different screen.   They

may  come back with a different image and we have to  decide.

But  I take the point that we should make it simple and  easy

for people to understand, and for them to just simply perform

the  task without great difficulty.  That is a point that  we

will take into account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the paper vote, actually it is a paper receipt, I

said that during this trial we will have a touch screen,  and

then to assure the voters that what they touch on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>

screen  actually  gets recorded, we have a paper  receipt  to

show  them  that it is indeed the candidate they have  voted.

Just  like  in  the supermarket, you have a receipt.   But  a

voter  cannot  take that paper receipt with  him  because  he

cannot take the ballot paper out of the polling station.   So

that  paper  receipt is cut and stored in a  box  which  will

eventually  be  sealed together with the other  vote  storage

cards in the vault of the Supreme Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a trial feature. Whether we will extend this

feature in future or not, I think we will have to study this.

Maybe  in  five or six years' time, after the next  election,

there will be a totally different technology altogether  that

will  obviate the need for this particular paper trail.   But

whatever it is, with or without the paper trail, there is  an

audit trail, that is, an electronic trail, that can show  the

voter,  serial number and his vote, and that is the  ultimate

test.   The paper is just to assure the voter.  That  is  it.

When  we want to do a recount, there can be a recount.  There

is  a paper receipt to do the recount.  But from the examples

that  I  have seen in Belgium and the Netherlands,  in  their

electronic voting, the touch screen and the card, there is no

paper.   It is completely electronic.  A recount is all  done

electronically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have forgotten to answer one question on the vote

margin  -  why  2%?  Two percent is actually a very  generous

figure.   We  can  have 5%; we can have 10%.  But  ultimately

what is it that we want to see?  We want to see that there is

a  fair amount of a margin to take care of a margin of manual

counting  error.  Looking at the elections of the  last  many

years, actually 2% is already very generous.  In the examples

that  I  have quoted, in the United States, some states  have

only  0.1%; in Canada's Federal Election, 0.1%; and  in  some

other  states,  1%.  Of course, there are also  other  states

which have 5%.  There is a variation in the US.  In Malaysia,

it is 2%.  So if you look at 2%, it is a reasonable margin.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, does the Minister agree that

there are important

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1606</b></font><br><br>

issues  in  this  electronic voting?  One  is  the  issue  of

secrecy  of  vote, and the other is how the  votes  cast  are

recorded electronically and counted correctly.  I think it is

not  enough for the Minister to just say that, "I assure  you

that  the  vote  will be secret."  Does he agree  that,  most

importantly,  we  must  convince the public  how  the  system

works, no matter how technical it is, and how the program  is

written  in  such  a  way that it cannot  be  tampered  with?

Because, for instance, someone has asked me, "How do you know

that  the program will not be written in such a way that  for

every   two   votes   cast  for  an  Opposition,   one   will

automatically  be converted to vote for the  PAP?"   I  think

these  are  issues which require more than  just  saying,  "I

assure you".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point which the Minister made about the job

being done by civil servants and that their integrity and the

human  factor  are  important, does  he  agree  that  besides

trusting  the  civil servants' integrity in implementing  the

system, it is also important that it has to be transparent so

that  the public know what they are doing are done correctly?

And  is  there  any safeguard that the civil servants  cannot

follow the rules for the PAP?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I think it is right to say that we

just  cannot say the vote  is secret, do not worry  about  it

and  that is it.  We have to assure the public.  I take  that

point.   Therefore, in the process of testing and certifying,

there is an authority, that is, the Auditor-General.  But  he

is  not  alone, he is there to do the job, he  will  have  to

demonstrate to whoever that are present during the  test  and

certification  that this is indeed so.  And we  can  actually

get  experts to check that.  But where do we end?   Supposing

we  get another expert to check on the Auditor-General, maybe

another person to check on the expert, and so on and  so  on.

Here  we  have  the  Elections  Department  working  out  the

software,  the system and the program.  There is  a  checking

body - the Auditor-General - to make sure that it is designed

to do what it is supposed to do and no more, whether it is to

track  the vote, whether it is to add votes or convert  votes

of Opposition into PAP.  And how

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>

more  transparent  can it be when that is  being  tested  and

checked by a third party?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This checking by a third party is not something that we

invented.   It is something that is also being done  in  some

countries.   In Belgium, for example, they have a smart  card

system,  which  is  also electronic.  It is  checked  by  the

Ministry  of  the  Interior, and the Ministry  in  charge  of

elections is the Ministry of the Interior, the equivalent  of

Home Affairs Ministry.  There has been no suggestion that the

Ministry of the Interior is trying to fix the results for the

government  party.  In the Netherlands, the system  is  being

worked  out by the election commission officials  and  it  is

checked by a team from the university, and they accept  that.

In  the United States, there are various systems and they are

checked  by a private company.  Again, they accept that,  and

there has been no allegation that these systems could produce

the fraud that Mr Low just suggested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, ultimately, it must therefore depend on, firstly,

the  people who design the software, who work out the system,

and  then  the  Auditor-General.  The  Auditor-General  is  a

scheduled   post  and  that  person  is  trusted   with   the

responsibility to ensure that the design would do what it  is

supposed to do.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Yes, there are checks. But is the

Minister aware of the public perception that all these checks

are  done by the Government?  There does not seem to  be  any

third  party  or  independent party to  witness  or  actually

conduct the check.  So would he actually consider inviting an

outsider, not within the Government, for instance, an auditor

from outside the Government, to check the system?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> That is why we have it in the

provision that this certification and testing will be done by

"the Auditor-General; or any person appointed by the Minister

in   consultation   with  the  Auditor-General",   and   that

particular  phrase  "any  person"  could  well  be  a  public

accounting firm.  But this is a trial

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1608</b></font><br><br>

project,  we are doing it for the first time, and we  do  not

know the scale of it.  Eventually the Auditor-General may not

have  enough people to do the job and we may have to  find  a

third  party, those in the private sector, to help to do  the

job.  So that possibility is not ruled out.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will allow one last clarification.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, the Minister has

explained  the  different treatment  of  the  public  sector,

either   scholars   or  those  who  are  sent   overseas   on

assignments, as opposed to those in the private  sector,  and

those  who  go and study on their own.  I think he has  cited

the   examples   of  the  fact  that  those   on   Government

scholarships are bonded to come back and serve and  those  in

the  civil  service  will return.  But,  nevertheless,  while

there  is  merit in this argument and also the precedents  in

other countries, there will be those who feel aggrieved that,

in  essence,  really  two  students in  the  same  university

overseas  pursuing  the same course,  one  sponsored  by  the

Government and the other on his own funding, would be treated

differently.   So I would urge the Minister  to  assure  this

House  whether  there  would be  scope  to  treat  these  two

categories  equally since, I think, we can  be  assured  that

chances are there would be commitment to the country on  both

counts.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, wherever we draw the line, there

will  be others who fall outside the line and who would  feel

aggrieved.  So whether we draw a line and say public  sector,

private sector, scholars, Government officials, or whether we

say it is one out of five, two out of five, three out of five

years,  those  who  do  not  meet  those  criteria  would  be

aggrieved.  But no law is cast in stone and concrete.  So  as

we progress, as we learn, as we eventually try to improve the

system, modifications can be made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Community Development and Sports (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Children and Young Persons Act was last amended in

1993  to  give the State more powers to protect  children  at

risk  and  to  initiate a more balanced approach towards  the

protection and rehabilitation of children and young people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to ensure that the Act remains relevant and forward

looking,  my  Ministry  has consulted  extensively  with  the

Subordinate  Courts,  and relevant Government  agencies.   We

also  sought  the  views  of the relevant  civic  groups  and

considered   the  recommendations  made  by  several   inter-Government Committees looking into issues related to juvenile

delinquency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments that we are now proposing are the outcome

of  these  consultations.   Let  me  now  go  into  the  main

amendments of this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, among the sentencing options that the courts

currently have for young offenders, include probation,  fine,

approved school orders, bonding of parents or guardians, etc.

Clauses 19 and 20 of the Amendment Bill will allow the courts

greater  flexibility when meting out sentences by introducing

new sentencing options which include:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1610</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Family conferencing. This allows the court to bring

together  people  who are directly affected by  a  juvenile's

offending  behaviour to reach a consensus on  an  appropriate

course  of  action.   It  provides  an  opportunity  for  the

juvenile  to  make reparations or tender an  apology  to  the

victim(s) of his offending behaviour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The community service order. This allows the court

to  require  a  juvenile  to  perform  community  service  as

reparation  for  his  offence, either as  a  condition  of  a

Probation Order or as a Stand-alone Order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Weekend or periodic detention order. This allows a

juvenile who has committed a fairly serious offence, but  has

a  supportive family environment, to remain with  the  family

and  continue his education without disruption.  The juvenile

can  be  detained  during  weekends  in  an  institution  for

structured programmes as punishment or for rehabilitation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Probation with detention. Where juvenile offenders

can be institutionalised over a period of not exceeding three

months,  this  is targeted at juveniles who are suitable  for

probation  but  would  benefit  from  exposure  to   a   more

structured and disciplined programme.  It is also  meant  for

probationers who breach their probation orders and need to be

disciplined  without a revocation of their probation  orders.

It  is  hoped  that the tougher programme in the  institution

would  have a salutary effect on the offender and reduce  the

likelihood of his/her re-offending.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 17 and 20 of the Amendment Bill will also

address  the problem of parents who relinquish their parental

responsibilities  once their child has been  brought  to  the

attention  of  the  court.  To sustain the  positive  changes

during  the  rehabilitation process, the  family  has  to  be

active in supporting the child.  The Juvenile Court will have

the  discretionary power to order the involvement of  parents

or guardians in the rehabilitation of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1611</b></font><br><br>

child  or  young  person.  Parents or guardians  who  do  not

comply with any order can be fined up to $2,000 or have their

bond forfeited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court will also be able to order the parents or

guardians   to   appear   before  a   medical   practitioner,

psychologist or a welfare officer for assessment.  This  will

enable  a  professional to assess the parent's or  guardian's

physical,  psychological, emotional and social well-being  to

determine   the  appropriate  intervention   for   care   and

protection cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 16, 26 and 45 of the Bill will enhance the

welfare  and protection of children and young persons.   Sir,

there  is  no  existing provision to protect the identity  of

children and young persons who are subjects or respondents in

an  investigation into an offence under the Act or the  Penal

Code from the broadcast media.  Protecting their identity  is

crucial in order not to hamper the investigation process  and

to  minimise  the trauma that may occur with any  disclosure.

The  Bill,  therefore, will restrict all media reporting  the

proceedings  in any Court from disclosing the identity  of  a

juvenile, unless the Court or the Minister dispenses with the

requirement in the interest of justice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments are also being made to protect those who are

required  to  make  a  professional assessment  in  the  best

interest  of the child or young person, especially  in  child

abuse  cases,  where  professional judgement  should  not  be

hindered  or  clouded  by  fear of legal  implications.   The

provision  will  safeguard the interest of medical  officers,

welfare  officers and the police who are often  subjected  to

abuse  and  threat  of legal suits by parents  and  guardians

during  the  investigation of child abuse, child  neglect  or

delinquent behaviour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children who are emotionally and psychologically abused

usually  suffer long-term effects, if not helped.   There  is

currently no provision in the Act to require suspected  cases

of  emotional  or psychological abuse to receive professional

assessment to ascertain abuse.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1612</b></font><br><br>

The amendments, Sir, will empower the Protector to require  a

child  or  young person, who is suspected to be a  victim  of

emotional or psychological abuse, to be assessed.   Should  a

parent or guardian ignore the instruction, the Protector  may

remove   the  child  or  young  person  for  assessment   and

treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 19 and 44 of the Bill concern the transfer of

young  offenders  to the Reformative Training  Centre  (RTC).

Currently,  the Centre, which is under the Prisons Department

of the Ministry of Home Affairs, only takes in offenders aged

16-21  years.  The proposed amendments will allow those  aged

14-16  years who have committed a very serious offence to  be

transferred  to  the RTC.  Sir, I would like to  stress  that

there  are  strict conditions attached to this new provision,

to ensure that the young person is given ample opportunity to

reform within the juvenile justice system.  For example,  the

young  person must have gone through an MCDS Approved  School

before he can be directly admitted to RTC.  Furthermore,  the

offender  must be such an unruly character that he is  beyond

the rehabilitative ability of the juvenile justice system and

that  his  presence  in  the MCDS Approved  School  would  be

disruptive for the rehabilitation of other juveniles there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 31, 32, 38, 39 and 40 of the Bill concern the

security    and    management   of   juvenile    correctional

institutions.   The amendments will allow  staff  working  in

these  institutions to use reasonable restraint on residents.

However,  Sir,  there are strict guidelines  to  ensure  that

staff do not overstep the boundaries of their authority.  For

example,  reasonable restraint or force is  only  allowed  in

emergency situations, such as when residents riot in the Home

or where residents attack staff.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 39 specifically states that every person detained

under  the  Act in an approved school or approved  home  will

serve  the full period of detention and will be deemed to  be

in  lawful custody until he or she is discharged.  Should the

person escape, he or she may be apprehended

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>

without warrant and be brought back to the approved school or

approved home in which he or she was detained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 40, Sir, will also address the problem of

parents,   family   members  or  ex-residents   who   smuggle

contraband  articles  such as cigarettes,  lighters,  blades,

glue  and  Chinese tobacco, or what they call "Ang Hoon",  to

residents  in  approved schools.  Each year, Sir,  there  are

about  10  such incidents in the Government-run homes.   With

the   amendment,  it  will  be  an  offence  now  to  smuggle

unauthorised or forbidden articles to residents  in  approved

schools,  approved homes, institutions or places of detention

or remand homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry currently administers three approved

schools,  homes and institutions for juvenile  offenders  and

children  and young persons.  Another three institutions  are

run  by  voluntary welfare organisations.  The new  provision

will  allow the Minister to appoint Governing Boards for  the

management  of  approved homes, schools and institutions  for

children and young persons established under section 62.  The

Boards will ensure good standards of management and practices

in these institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Amendment Bill aims to improve the

care,  protection  and rehabilitation of children  and  young

persons.  These amendments make the legislation more flexible

and  ensure parental responsibility and participation in  the

rehabilitation    process.    Parental   responsibility    is

especially  important,  as parents  must  ultimately  be  the

carers,  nurturers and protectors of our children  and  young

people.  So they must take this responsibility seriously  and

the state should step in only as a last resort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have

had  two days of long debate.  I am sure you would appreciate

Members to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>

be  short  and  precise.  I hope that my other Members  would

also get to the point as I will be doing so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments in the Children and Young Persons

(Amendment)  Bill will make the Act more comprehensive.   The

provisions to deal with psychological abuse and to  prescribe

other forms of rehabilitation measures for the protection  of

children and young persons are indeed useful.  This brings it

in  line with the provisions in many developed countries.  It

also  meets  the  UN conventions on the rights  of  children.

With  these amendments, we have indeed moved to a  very  good

milestone  of  development  in terms  of  the  protection  of

children and young persons in the context of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever the rehabilitation measures, I think it is

very  important to ensure that families and individuals  take

responsibility for their behaviour.  Unless we  ensure  this,

then  all  these rehabilitation measures which the  Bill  has

provided for will come to nought.  I think that objective  is

indeed  very  critical  and  very  important  in  the   whole

rehabilitation procedures that we are going to implement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the protection of children against psychological

abuse  is indeed important.  This is also timely in  view  of

the  increase  in  marital discords and divorces.   Sir,  the

divorce rate has increased from 4.5% per thousand in 1989  to

7.1% per thousand in 1999.  There is an increase, though  not

significant.   But what is most important  is  that  many  of

these children are caught between disputes of parents.   Many

of  these children are innocent and they are in the  line  of

crossfires of discords between parents, and they might suffer

psychological abuse in these cases.  It is very crucial, Sir,

that  at times of marital discord between parents we are able

to  ensure  that  services  to protect  their  interests  are

available  too.  So what I would like to ask the Ministry  is

whether  there  are services that are going to  be  developed

further to ensure that the needs of these children are  being

looked into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unlike physical abuse, psychological abuse is an

area which is very contentious

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1615</b></font><br><br>

and  very  difficult to establish.  Therefore, I think  there

are  likely  to  be  disputes between the  Ministry  and  the

parents   in   terms   of  what  and  how   one   establishes

psychological abuse.  This issue has to be looked  into  very

carefully, and I want to ask the Ministry what steps it would

take  to  ensure  that  a  case  of  psychological  abuse  is

appropriately  established, and what rehabilitation  measures

will be taken to deal with psychologically abusing parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the rehabilitation of delinquent children and

young  persons,  it  is  important to ensure  that  the  less

hardcore juvenile delinquents and young persons are separated

from  the hardcore in institutional care and treatment.  This

is  necessary  because we want to ensure that there  will  be

less social contamination of those who are affected.  I would

like  to  ask the Ministry what steps it has taken to  ensure

that  delinquents  who are less hardcore  are  being  treated

differently and in different institution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the area of mobilisation of community support

and implementation of community rehabilitation programmes for

juvenile delinquents and young persons, I would like to  find

out  from the Ministry whether there are new initiatives that

are  being undertaken, because institutional care, as we  all

know,  is  very  costly,  and it is very  disruptive  to  the

juveniles and young persons.  It would be the last resort, as

the Minister has put it, to institutionalise persons because,

by  institutionalising  them, one breaks  them  up  from  the

family, and family dynamics are disrupted.  Therefore, it  is

very  important  to  ensure  that  we  have  other  means  of

rehabilitating young persons and juveniles within a community

setting.   So  what I want to ask the Minister  is  what  new

steps and initiatives are being undertaken to ensure that  we

have  in  place  more community rehabilitation programmes  to

assist   delinquent  juveniles  and  young  persons  in   the

community.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you  for  allowing me to join in this debate.   Before  going

into my

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>

speech,  I  would  like to assure the hon. Member  who  spoke

before me that I intend to heed his advice and keep my speech

very much shorter than his.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Children and Young Persons

(Amendment)  Bill moved by the Minister.  The  objectives  of

the  Bill  are  quite evident and worthy of  support.   Among

other  things,  the Bill seeks to enhance the  protection  of

children  and  young persons from possible ill treatment  and

neglect, expand the definition of cruelty, and engage parents

in  the  rehabilitation of juveniles.  As  mentioned  by  the

Minister,  the  Bill  also introduces alternative  sentencing

options  for juvenile offenders, such as a formal caution,  a

reprimand  and community service, whilst remaining  with  the

family.  Sir, I support this approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while I support the Bill, I would like

to  sound  a  note of caution and perhaps express some  minor

reservations on certain clauses in the Bill which I hope  the

Minister  and  his  officers would  address.   However  well-intentioned  the provisions of the Bill may be,  I  think  we

should  be cautious in handling issues related to the  family

and   guard  against  the  state  inadvertently  taking  over

responsibilities in the upbringing of children  that  rightly

should  be  left  with  the family.  Intervention  in  family

matters should be done only as a measure of last resort,  and

I am delighted to hear the Minister share this view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 4 of the Bill expands the definition of

ill  treatment to include any emotional injury.  However, the

Bill  is  not  quite specific in the definition of  emotional

injury, and I share Dr Vasoo's concern for this lack of clear

definition.   There  have been cases overseas  where  parents

have  been  arrested and hauled to court for  smacking  their

unruly  children  in  public.  In some  countries,  there  is

really  no  shortage of child experts who advocate  that  any

form of corporal punishment on the child or a young person is

an  infliction of lasting emotional injury.  It  is  my  hope

that  the  implementation of this Bill will  not  lead  to  a

situation where parents can no

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>

longer decide on how they should discipline their children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill amends section 10 and permits a

magistrate's   court,  upon  receiving  any  information   or

complaint  that  a  relevant offence has  been  or  is  being

committed  against  a child or a young  person,  to  issue  a

warrant  to  remove the victim to a place of  safety  and  to

undergo medical and social assessment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not uncommon in child custody cases for

contending parties to make allegations of cruelty and neglect

of  the  child  against  each other.   But  sometimes,  these

allegations may be quite unfounded.  More harm may be done to

the child if he or she is forcibly removed from a stable home

environment while investigations are being conducted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 8 of the Bill also permits the Director,

a  protector  or  a  police officer not  below  the  rank  of

sergeant to remove a child or young person and commit him  to

a  place of safety, if there are reasonable grounds to do so.

The  relevant authority can do this by entering any  premises

without  warrant and with such assistance, and by such  force

as  necessary, by night or by day, in order to remove a child

and commit him to a place of safety.  It is not difficult  to

foresee  situations where such measures are indeed  necessary

in  order  to  prevent possible harm or further  injury  from

occurring to the child.  However, it is also not difficult to

imagine how much more emotional damage could be inflicted  on

the  child  if  the complaints were eventually proven  to  be

false.  There should be safeguards implemented to avoid  such

situations from arising.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the new section 3 of the Bill which

clearly defines when a child or a young person is in need  of

care and protection, for example, when he is abandoned or  he

has no parent or guardian to look after him, or when he is at

risk of being ill-treated.  However, I am

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1618</b></font><br><br>

not really comfortable with the inclusion of illegal hawking,

gambling and other undesirable activities as situations where

a  child  is in need of protection under the law.  I am  sure

that  the  Minister  would  agree  that  the  definition   of

"undesirable activities" is rather subjective and varies from

individual  to  individual.  I hope his  officials  would  be

judicious  in  the interpretation of this  term  and  I  look

forward  to  a  clearer definition of the  term  "undesirable

activities" in future amendments to the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, while I agree with Dr

Vasoo and Mr Chong that brevity and succinctness are a virtue

in  this House, I am sure they would also agree with me  that

in a piece of legislation this important, at least one Member

can be allowed to make a longer speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise to speak in strong support of this Bill. It

is  a  major piece of social legislation designed  to  extend

protection  to the most vulnerable in society, possibly  from

the  people that they most trust and love.  At the same time,

some  of  our young people unfortunately behave in ways  that

are  damaging  both  to them and to society.   It  is  timely

therefore  that this House should address these issues  in  a

thorough  manner.   With the advancement of medical  science,

particularly  in the field of psychiatry, we  are  made  more

aware that the emotional injuries inflicted on a child can be

more  serious  and long-lasting than even physical  injuries.

The  emotional  scars  can  even  be  transferred  to  future

generations.  We  must  be  bold  therefore  in  setting   up

institutions to identify those

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1619</b></font><br><br>

who  have been subjected to abuse or mistreatment and to take

a  holistic  view in prescribing the remedy,  whether  it  be

through  medical  or  psychiatric treatment,  counselling  or

social  censure, rather than relying solely on  the  criminal

sanction.   We  must also understand the causes of  deviance,

and   look   for  solutions  that  will  rehabilitate   young

offenders, rather than to ostracise and maroon them from  the

rest of society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the legislation we are considering today embodies

novel  objectives and practical solutions.  I am all for  it.

The  point  that I made concerning the details  of  the  Bill

therefore  should  be  seen  as supporting  the  aim  of  the

legislation and to ensuring that when it comes into force, it

is effective and implemented with fairness and objectivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new Bill extends a level of protection for

children and young persons significantly.  Under the  present

provision, cruelty to children and young persons must  cause,

and  I quote, "unnecessary suffering or injury to his health,

including injury through a loss of sight or hearing  or  limb

or  organ of the body and any mental derangement".   This  is

the  present  section  4.   This is  far  too  restrictive  a

provision  and  really  contemplates an  awful  situation  of

continuing  abuse  resulting in serious  physical  or  mental

injury.   I therefore welcome particularly the new provisions

contained  in  clause 4 which are much wider  in  scope.   It

speaks  of parents or guardians neglecting to exercise proper

supervision  and  control, resulting in a child  or  a  young

person  falling  into  bad association or  exposed  to  moral

danger,  or  is  otherwise  beyond  control.   It  speaks  of

children  being at risk of being ill-treated by their  parent

or  guardian.   Ill-treatment is widely  defined  to  include

emotional   injury  or  injury  to  the  child's  health   or

development.   Development itself is widely defined  to  mean

physical,  intellectual,  emotional,  social  or  behavourial

development.   Sir, these new terms vastly extend  the  scope

of  the  legislation and will give rise to several  problems,

quite apart from the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1620</b></font><br><br>

open  textured  nature  of  the words  used.   For  instance,

reasonable people may disagree as to when a child may be said

to  be  in  need of protection.  What does being  exposed  to

moral  danger  mean, or what is the degree of  risk  of  ill-treatment  that must be present before it would be  right  to

say that the child is in need of protection?  All these terms

would have to be interpreted and applied by those involved in

enforcing  the  Act, namely, the Director of Social  Welfare,

protectors  and even police officers.  I note  especially  in

clause  5,  a  police  officer of the rank  of  sergeant  can

actually  take a decision to enter a home without  a  warrant

and  remove  a child alleged to be at risk.  My question  is:

are  police  officers  trained for this sort  of  assessment?

Indeed, are any of the persons involved trained to assess the

wider criteria that are now stipulated?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that matter, if I were to ask Members present in

this House today to give their views as to what is the degree

of  risk  that would be necessary before it is legitimate  to

intervene,  I believe we would not find a general  consensus.

Some  may  say  that  there needs to be a clear  and  present

danger  of  ill-treatment, others may put it  less  strongly.

The point is there is likely to be as many interpretations of

the degree of risk as there are people asked to interpret it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe therefore that much needs to be done,

even if this Bill were to pass through today.  There must  be

a serious attempt to set out clear guidelines as to how these

new  provisions  are to be interpreted and applied.   Without

such  guidelines, I worry that parents and guardians  may  be

wrongly subjected to investigations which may, in turn,  give

rise to undeserved social ostracism or misunderstanding.   In

our  society, where family values are so enshrined, it  would

be  particularly reprehensible for a parent or guardian to be

wrongly accused of ill-treating his child.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must therefore ask the Minister what are the steps

that  his Ministry would take to ensure that in no case would

there be precipitous action by some over-zealous

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1621</b></font><br><br>

officials  and that each case would carefully and quickly  be

reviewed before action is taken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the concern is even stronger when we realise that

those  who  provide the information on alleged  ill-treatment

are  specially protected under the proposed legislation.  The

identity of these informers cannot be revealed even in court.

Those who inform cannot through their actions be regarded  as

having breached any code of ethics or professional etiquette.

If  he or she acted in good faith, there will be no civil  or

criminal  liability.  These are pretty strong  provisions  to

protect  informers.  While I can see justification, in  terms

of  public policy, for protecting identity so given, I am not

convinced  that  such protection should  be  given  when  the

informer  was found to be malicious or acting in his  or  her

own self-interest, or for some other undesirable motive.   As

the  provision now stands, no witness who knows the  identity

of the informer, can be compelled to disclose the identity of

the informer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like the Minister to confirm that this

provision  in  the  new section 84A(4) would  not  prevent  a

willing  witness,  who  knows the informer's  identity,  from

disclosing  the  identity of the informer.  This  measure  is

necessary  to ensure that there should be some accountability

on  the  part  of informers.  Good public policy  requires  a

balance  between  protecting the  young  and  protecting  the

innocent.  In other words, we should ensure at all times that

there  should  be  as  small a number as  possible  of  false

accusations of ill-treatment.  There should be no  protection

for  those  who  falsely  accuse  another,  particularly   in

relation to ill-treatment of their own children.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>3.57 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I turn now to treatment for juvenile offenders. It

is a sad fact that in today's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1622</b></font><br><br>

world, crimes, including serious crimes, are no longer solely

in  the  domain of the adult. Therefore, the Bill is  clearly

right in focusing on the reformation or rehabilitation of the

youthful  offender, rather than on straightforward punishment

in  the form of deterrent sentences or incarceration.  It  is

also  in  the  right  direction when it seeks  to  involve  a

greater  number of orders that the Juvenile Court  can  make,

including  requiring the young person and parent  to  undergo

psychotherapy or other counselling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, in clause 20, the Bill introduces a new

institution  in relation to the treatment of young  offenders

and  child  offenders.   This is the convening  of  a  family

conference and provides in the new section 44A, a  series  of

measures  that  a  family conference may take  to  deal  with

offenders.    These  include  a simple  reprimand  or  formal

caution to requiring the offender to pay compensation  or  to

perform  community service.  It can also require the offender

to  apologise  to the victim.  I think now we all  understand

that  the  word  "apologise" means that saying "sorry"  would

definitely not be enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is this. There is no description of what a

family conference is, let alone a definition.  One can deduce

from the provision that family members of the offender may be

included, even though there is no requirement that they  must

attend. There is no indication as to who else might be in the

conference or who should chair it or whether it should have a

chairman  at  all.   Sir,  given that the  family  conference

appears  to be acting in a quasi judicial capacity,  I  would

like  to  know  why  its  nature  and  composition  are   not

specifically  provided for in the Bill.  It is  strange  that

its powers are set out in such detail, but not its nature  or

composition.   Neither is it clear how it would  conduct  its

proceedings,  or  whether it is possible to  have  a  further

appeal   against  the  decision  of  the  family  conference,

assuming  that  it  does  not need to  be  unanimous  in  its

decision-making.   May  I  ask the Minister  to  clarify  the

issues relating to the family conference that I have raised?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is ambitious in scope and intent.

However, it seems to require also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1623</b></font><br><br>

a serious commitment of additional resources to implement it.

I  would  like to ask the Minister what additional  resources

are available to implement all these new measures. Will there

be  more child psychiatrists?  How many are available now and

how  many more will be needed?  Are Juvenile Court judges  or

social workers equipped to handle such cases?  The Bill seems

to  place  great reliance on doctors who may, of  course,  be

equipped  very well to deal with physical injuries,  but  are

they    equally   knowledgeable   about   child   psychiatry?

Essentially,  are we ready to implement the Bill's  extensive

provisions?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we consider the Bill today, I am reminded to

call  it  the Children and Young Persons Charter in  that  it

seeks extensively to protect children and young persons  from

all  sorts of abuse.  It reminds me of the other charter, the

Women's  Charter, and I wonder whether it is really not  time

to  bring  the two charters together into one family charter.

That  should be what we should be driving at.  The  value  of

the family is central, it is fundamental to Singapore, it  is

recognised  in the S21 report.  We should try  to  make  sure

that we have a family charter providing for the protection of

children  or  rehabilitation of young offenders and  also  of

course of women.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I reiterate again my support for this Bill and hope

that its coming into force will ensure that more children and

young people will sleep better at night.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

against  the backdrop of enhanced powers being given  to  the

state,  institutions  and officers in passing  judgement  and

directly impacting the lives of family members, I would  like

to  raise  my concerns and seek the Minister's clarification.

Like  what  Prof.  Chin said, on matters as  important  as  a

legislation related to the children and their families  which

the  Ministry  and  AG's Chambers had  taken  four  years  to

deliberate on, it is not discharging my due diligence not  to

raise  my concerns, even though it would take longer than  my

previous colleagues.  Sir, I seek your indulgence.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1624</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on some jurisdictional points in clause 33.

Under the current Act, a "child" is defined as below 14 years

of  age.  A "young person" is between the ages of 14 and  16.

Any  young person 16 or older will be tried at the High Court

or  District  Court, except in those cases where  the  public

prosecutor decides to try the offence in the Juvenile  Court.

My  question is:  is the age of the offender when the offence

is  committed the determining one to decide which  court  the

offender  should be judged in, or is his age during the  time

of  the hearing a determining one?  The Bill is unclear,  and

therefore may be unfair,  given the differences in sentencing

options  in  both courts.  For example, if a child  or  young

person committed an offence when he/she was 15 but turned  16

by  the  time  the child was brought before the court,  would

this  child  go before the Juvenile Court or the District  or

High Court?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the age of the offender at the point of the

commission  of  the  alleged offence must  be  a  determining

factor in directing which court the offender should be  tried

in, and this must not be left to the discretion of the public

prosecutor  who  has  the difficult  task  of  balancing  the

interests  of the State against the interests of  the  child.

In  the event that a child is brought before the District  or

High  Court,  perhaps  it  should  be  the  offender's  legal

representative, instead of the public prosecutor, who  should

apply  for the case to be tried in the Juvenile Court, as  he

would  know  the  offender better and would be  in  a  better

position to act in the interest of the child.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, my concern is on what constitutes an "emotional

injury".   While emotional abuse is a common  form  of  abuse

which  must  be  stopped  to prevent it  from  escalating  to

physical  battery and from causing more damage to  the  self-esteem of the  child, I wonder how, in the complexity of  the

diverse parenting styles which different families adopt,  our

enforcement  officers  would be able to  determine  cases  of

emotional abuse.  My concern is that the application  of  the

standards  in  determining "emotional injury"  is  a  largely

subjective exercise.  Are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1625</b></font><br><br>

parents who push their children very hard during examinations

by  locking  them up to study and depriving them of  leisure,

food and drinks, emotionally abusing them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, if caning is accepted by some parents and

school   teachers  who  believe  it  is  a   positive   child

disciplinary measure, is it consistent that we now  introduce

a  "softer"  standard  of "emotional abuse",  stating  verbal

abuse  as an offence under the Act, whilst the affliction  of

physical  punishment by the cane on the body of  a  child  is

not?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seek the Minister's views on how he reconciles the use

of the cane against the sanction of a foul or harsh word that

upsets  the  child.   How  then can we convincingly  persuade

parents to accept the judgment made by the Director or his or

her  officer that they have committed an offence of emotional

abuse  when  all around them there is more violent  behaviour

that is being sanctioned?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could we consider substituting the words "emotional

injury"  with  "psychological abuse  or  injury"?   Dr  Vasoo

earlier on had not made a distinction between the two  words.

I  feel  that  "psychological abuse" is  a  more  appropriate

standard  to  be  applied,  as it  can  be  substantiated  by

professional medical opinion regarding the impact of parental

abuses on the mental health of the child.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third concern is on insufficient checks and balances

on the powers of the Director.   The police officer above the

rank  of  sergeant,  the  approved welfare  officer  and  the

Director  would now be empowered to effectively pass judgment

on  parents  whom  they feel are "unlikely or  unwilling"  in

clause  3(d)(ii), or "unable or unwilling" in clause  3(f)(i)

to  protect the child from ill-treatment, or are "believed to

have  committed  the offence".  Such broad powers  being  now

given  to  officers to intervene and make moral judgments  on

the  competence of parents are both a welcome  initiative  as

well as a disconcerting one.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1626</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The welcome part is that the designated officers have

broader  scope to quickly make decisions on how the child  or

young  person  is  to be taken care of, whether  this  be  by

removal to an approved home, provided in Part VIA, clause 66,

or to undergo a medical examination, in new section 71A, etc.

All this is done without the paralysing fear of their actions

inviting legal repercussions against themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disconcerting part arises from the fact that these

are  serious  decisions, because they  involve  the  physical

removal  of  children from homes which, no  doubt,  would  be

upsetting  to family units.  Even though I believe  that  the

Director and his/her officers would be carefully selected and

would  most  likely carry out their official duties  in  good

faith,  an  inescapable  query  is  who  then  "directs"  the

Director  and  scrutinizes  his  or  her  decisions  and  the

decisions of his or her officers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have to accept that someone has to be given the

authority to pass judgment on our parenting methods, must  we

also  accept  that  no  body  of  governance  is  set  up  to

scrutinize  his or her decisions?  What if the judgment  call

is erroneous?  The Bill is silent on providing some mechanism

of  accountability on the powers of the Director and  his  or

her officers in exercising the discretion afforded them under

this Bill.  Instead, the Bill protects them from any personal

liability  and no suit or other legal proceedings  shall  lie

personally   against  the  Director  and   other   protection

officers, as provided in Part VIII, clause 84.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realise that this is a difficult balance that the law

is  being  asked to take here in empowering the Director  and

his or her officers on the one hand, and preventing abuse  by

these  same  empowered people on the other.   Either  extreme

would  be  unacceptable, as it would mean  either  injury  or

inaction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I hope the Minister can assure me that

these  officers  are  qualified  by  training  to  carry  out

professional assessment work and that their judgment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1627</b></font><br><br>

will  be  subjected  to experts in the  medical  and  service

delivery, including community advocates like informed parents

and  teachers.  I will be even more confident if a  board  of

governance  can  be  set  up  eventually  to  maintain   high

standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth point is regarding placing children at a place

of safety.  The Bill in new section 8 provides broader powers

for  designated  officers to take a  victim  to  a  place  of

safety,  but it does not provide indicators to determine  the

maximum  duration and when the offender may be released  from

the   approved  home  or  school.   I  acknowledge  that  the

probation officers probably know better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to explore a new school of thought which

argues  that  incarceration of children away  from  home  and

family  constitutes a form of institutional abuse,  and  does

not  contribute to the recovery or rehabilitation of children

and  their  families.  I hope the Ministry will examine  this

perspective and propose as part of sentencing options a live-in  therapy period, whereby expert facilitators explore  with

family members new ways of relating to one another in  a  new

and  more  loving  way.   This model is  already  adopted  in

several countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to emphasise that I appreciate that child

protection  management  is a complex and  difficult  call  of

duty.   Officers have to contend with the wishes  of  parents

who  feel it is their right to deal with their children their

way.  How we balance this inalienable duty with the rights of

the  parents against the interest of a defenceless  child  is

understandably   the   most   heart-rending   and   difficult

challenges  which  our  child  protection  officers  have  to

delicately  deal  with, and very often  under  conditions  of

tremendous  duress and humiliating assaults  from  angry  and

aggressive  guardians.  The job of child protection  officers

is  admirable,  but unenviable.  I hope more recognition  and

training  opportunities  can  be  given  to  motivate   these

officers to undertake this difficult challenge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to one more disturbing point. Sir, for

those parents who have no

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1628</b></font><br><br>

money  to find help for their physically or mentally disabled

children  and yet have to work, sometimes two shifts  a  day,

are  they  committing  an offence when  they  lock  up  their

children  in  rooms  and  let them  defecate  and  scream  in

private?   As  there are insufficient public institutions  to

take in severely mentally handicapped children who are forced

to  be  tied down at home and languish their time away  while

the adults are at work, is this a form of child abuse and who

is responsible for this crime?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are tough issues but in the context of

arguing  for  care  and  protection  of  children  and  young

persons,  the  disabled community and their concerns  form  a

critical  focus.  Parental neglect in these cases  is  beyond

the  parents'  control, because they do not have  the  money,

time  and energy to cope with these difficult cases.  I  hope

when  the Director exercises his or her judgment, the  socio-economic   status   of  the  parents  can   be   taken   into

consideration  before judgment is passed.  I hope  there  are

financial  schemes  being  set  up  to  support  services  to

children  who have to be committed to the homes when  parents

cannot afford to pay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the more moderate cases of mentally challenged adults

who are chronologically 16 or 18 years old, but have an IQ of

a child of 6, how do we handle their public offences, such as

shoplifting  and touching the opposite sex?   As  they  acted

without understanding and an intention to hurt, which of  the

legal   instruments  relating  to  young   persons   can   be

judiciously  applied to these offenders with  special  needs?

With  this Bill, the parents are held responsible and  become

the  offender  for not supervising their child in  the  first

place.  Is this an appropriate judicial response?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry will review the portfolio of legal

sanctions relating to offences committed by the disabled  and

assess if they are adequate in exercising care and protection

over this community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me shift the focus to parents who neglect their

children.   There  are  two wonderful words  in  the  Chinese

language

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1629</b></font><br><br>

which, in my view, summarise a perspective on parenting.  The

words  are guan jiao (??), meaning to supervise and to teach;

and  jiao dao (??), meaning to teach and to guide or lead  by

example.   Parents are not supervising nor are they  teaching

and guiding their children, because they do not have the time

or  they conveniently think it is the job of the schools;  or

they may be disciplining their children with the cane without

teaching and guiding them, so that children do not understand

the mistakes they have made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More often than not, parents just simply do not know how

to  parent,  and as inadequate parents and poor role  models,

they  simply  are  too  afraid  of  losing  their  children's

affection.  So they fail to discipline, reprimand, guide  and

teach.  "Neglect",  which is an offence  in  this  Bill,  can

simply mean being unable or disable in the role of parenting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where the new sections of the Bill, sections

44A,  44B  as  well  as 49A, appear the most  refreshing  and

innovative.   By providing additional sentencing options  for

juvenile offenders, such as family conferencing and community

services,  and by ordering mandatory counselling for  parents

who  have  to  pay for assessment and treatment  services  of

offenders  under  their  charge, the State  is  signalling  a

fundamental   judicial  perspective  in  upholding   parental

cooperation   and  responsibility  in  the   protection   and

treatment  of  their  children.   This  initiative  I   fully

support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final query is why is there no mandatory reporting by

doctors, neighbours or other persons to report CYPA offences?

The lack of service delivery infrastructure arising from high

level reporting and a sense of invasion of family privacy  by

irresponsible  gossip  mongers  are  two  frequently   raised

objections to legislating mandatory reporting.  These are not

good  enough  reasons,  Sir, because  we  are  talking  about

protection of lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent speech made by the Minister, he reported a

high incidence of reporting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1630</b></font><br><br>

and  consultation by professionals who did  not  hesitate  to

report  suspected child abuse cases to relevant  authorities.

If   this   is  so,  will  it  not  augur  well  for   social

responsibility in Singapore to fix a legislation on mandatory

reporting  among  institutional professionals  like  doctors,

nurses,  medical social workers, to signal a  zero  tolerance

threshold on violence against children?  Especially since  in

the  amendments,  the  Minister has also  made  provision  to

protect  socially responsible citizens from  civil  suits  if

they act in good faith to report suspected child abuse.  Like

the Minister himself said, it is better to err on the side of

caution  than  to let a child suffer.  I seek the  Minister's

response on why this legislation leans against imposing  such

a duty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the whole, the legal framework, as proposed in

this  Bill,  is  comprehensive  enough  to  allow  front-line

officers the discretion to intervene early to prevent further

injury to the child and young person.  In order that the  law

be  properly enforced on the ground, it is critical that  the

responsible Ministries, critically MCDS, MHA, MOE, MOH,  have

sufficiently comprehensive and coherent guidelines with which

to follow through on orders made by the courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to learn that following the formation of the

Inter-Ministry Committee on the Management of Child Abuse  in

January 1997, numerous initiatives were undertaken by MCDS in

this direction: the launches of the manual for management  of

child  abuse  in  July 1999 by MCDS, an abridged  manual  for

Professionals and Service Providers Working with Children and

a public education booklet "Love Our Children - Prevent Child

Abuse" in February 2001 - the booklets are here [indicating],

very  colourful  and child-friendly; as well as  this  manual

which  has  been told to me that it has been very helpful  to

service  providers - and the recent Child Protection Link  in

March  this  year  which  is a networking  platform  for  key

Ministries' officials involved in child protection work.  All

these  are  positive  initiatives.  The Ministry  has  indeed

worked very hard in the last four years.  Thank you, Minister

and your dedicated

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1631</b></font><br><br>

officers.    We   need   to  continue   now   to   strengthen

collaborative  training and public education  programmes  for

all  involved  in  child protection work  to  enhance  skills

levels and greater communication between agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a broader level, what we need is a positive child-friendly environment at home, in school and within the

community.   What we need to do more is to help  families  in

trouble.   This  Bill  has kick-started a  central  focus  on

safeguarding  the  welfare of children and responsibility  of

the family, which in a resource-scarce Singapore state and in

view  of  our  declining  fertility rate  matched  against  a

rapidly ageing population, are significant social pillars  in

shaping our sustainability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that basis, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support

the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, at least family members are now drawn in the

process.   With  this amendment, a parent or  guardian  of  a

child  can be made to undergo counselling, psychotherapy  and

other  programmes  or activities.  Also, the  Bill  seeks  to

widen  the  scope  of  punishment where more  meaningful  and

appropriate  punishment can be meted out.   I  see  that  the

court  can prescribe shorter detention, such as over weekends

or  even  to  require  supervision  of  the  offenders  under

probation.    New  section  44,  which  will  allow   younger

offenders  to  be  sent to the reformative  training  centre,

takes  cognisance  that  there are unfortunately  very  young

offenders who have the capacity for extreme violence and  are

recalcitrant in their acts of violence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there are many good points in the Bill. Like

earlier speakers have pointed out, we need to refine and work

out  some  definitions.  But while it is going on,  I  recall

horror stories that are published in the press of child being

abused,  and  I am glad that new section 8 will allow  prompt

action  to be taken where there is reasonable ground  that  a

child or young person

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1632</b></font><br><br>

is in need of care and protection.  Prompt action is the only

thing  that will prevent further damage being done, whilst  I

acknowledge   earlier  speakers'  concern  that   there   are

definitions to be worked out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also happy to see that new sections 84 and 84A will

provide  protection from suit or other legal  proceedings  to

the  enforcer  and  witness.  Without such  protection  being

offered, I can envisage that people will be reluctant to be a

notifier  and pretend not to notice what is going on.   Also,

enforcers will be hesitant to take prompt action if they  are

being  constantly  bombarded with harassment  and  stress  of

suits and other legal proceedings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like the amendments to the Bill but I have one major

reservation, and this has to do with new section  35  on  the

restriction  of  publication of information relating  to  the

proceedings  involving  children  and  young  persons.   This

section  is  there to protect the identity of a  child  or  a

young  person.   I  am surprised that the  punishment  for  a

breach  of  this section is a mere fine not exceeding  $2,000

for  a  first offence and a fine not exceeding $10,000 for  a

second  or subsequent offence.  Such sums are pocket expenses

for  the  media.   Besides,  we  should  expect  the  highest

standard of governance on the part of the media and a  breach

of  section  35 must not be tolerated.  In my  mind,  such  a

breach  could  not be accidental.  It must be deliberate  and

the fines should be at least $100,000 for a first offence and

even  more  for  subsequent offences with  a  possibility  of

imprisonment.  How does one value the damage done to a child?

Could the article be used in the future against the child who

has made good and is successful in society?  Could it destroy

the  prospect of a child succeeding in life?  Could it  be  a

future  source  of blackmail?  The offender would  have  been

fined  $2,000  or $10,000 which will probably be  covered  by

increased subscription and advertising revenues for  being  a

sensational press.  I urge the Minister to increase the fines

proposed  under  this section to one that is truly  punishing

and not offsettable by any commercial gains from the act.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1633</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I would like to thank Members

for their contributions and strong support for the Bill which

is  very  timely.  We need these amendments  to  improve  the

protection of our children and young persons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, first, address the general concern about

definitions and assessments, and whether or not we are trying

to  judge or take over the parents' role of how they ought to

look  after their children.  Sir, we at the Ministry are very

concerned  about these too.  We have thought  long  and  hard

about how we define things, how do we ascertain that whatever

we  are  doing is correct, what do we know about what  people

think of their children and how they ought to be dealing with

their children.  So we are very aware of the difficulties  of

definitions,   coverage,   assessment   and   abuse.     But,

unfortunately,  it  is inherent in the  issues  that  we  are

talking  about.  We are talking about relationships,  we  are

talking about the psychological condition of a person.  These

are  things which are difficult to really put your finger  on

and truly measure them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So where do you draw the line? Where do you draw the

line  between  abuse and discipline?  Where do you  draw  the

line between what is accidental and what is wilful?  Where do

you  draw the line between what is private good and  what  is

public good?  And where do you draw the line whether it is in

the  interest of the child or in the interest of  the  family

that  we  are  talking about?  These are questions  which  we

agonise over and, indeed, it took us long and hard to  really

find  the answers.  But, nevertheless, Sir, the line must  be

drawn.   We  cannot  not  draw the line  simply  because  our

failure  to do so will mean that there would be children  out

there  who  are damaged by the actions of either  parents  or

relatives   who   abuse   them  either   psychologically   or

physically.  So the line must be drawn.  But what we can  do,

Sir,  is to minimise the subjectivity and sharpen the ability

for  us  to assess correctly what ought to be done  and  what

should be done for the child.  Therefore, we tilt towards the

interest of the child.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1634</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how do we go about trying to minimise the

subjectivity, if at all, in the issues?  One is to make  sure

that  we approach the problem holistically.  In other  words,

we  look  at  each  issue in context,  from  all  angles  and

perspectives  - individual differences, cultural differences,

norms.  We take all these into consideration and we make sure

that we cover all angles, as it were, by making sure that  we

include   all   professions,  all  expertise,   all   experts

(psychologists,   psychiatrists,  doctors,  social   workers,

teachers,  community leaders).  We have an inter-disciplinary

and  inter-agency approach towards assessment so that we  get

as  wide  a variety of minds to bear on the problems  and  as

many experts to bear on the problems that we have in mind and

at  issue.   And  we  also  have  protocols,  guidelines  and

procedures  which my officers follow stringently  because  we

know  that  if  we make a wrong decision, our decision  would

mean  that  a  child may bear the scars of  what  he  or  she

suffers during childhood right up to adulthood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we are very well aware of the problems that Members

have   raised  in  terms  of  subjectivity,  sharpening   our

assessment, and in terms of whether we are doing  it  in  the

interest of the child, the family or the community.  So  that

is, in general, Sir, what I would like to respond in terms of

the  fears and concerns about subjectivity of the issues that

are involved in child abuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now go to specific questions and comments from

Members.   For  example, Prof. Chin asked  what  we  mean  by

family conferencing.  The word "family", I think, here  is  a

bit  of  a misnomer because it really does not mean only  the

family  is involved, but it includes significant others  too.

It involves relatives, it involves those who are victims of a

child's  offending  behaviour.  This family  conferencing  is

part  of  the  judicial process.  In other words,  it  is  an

option  during  the  case discussion, before  the  magistrate

passes sentence, and it brings together those people who  are

affected by the juvenile's offending behaviour and this  will

include  the  offender, his or her parent  or  guardian,  the

victim, victim's family, and we have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1635</b></font><br><br>

a  family conferencing facilitator, an expert at facilitating

and mediating such meetings.  Through this mediation process,

a  family conference attempts to reach a consensus on what is

the most appropriate way an offender can make reparations for

his or her offending actions.  The goal of the conference  is

for  the  juvenile  to  realise the  impact  of  his  or  her

offending  behaviour or to express contrition to  the  victim

and  his  or her family.  The facilitators of this conference

are selected based on their broad abilities to understand the

processes   of   the   juvenile  court   and   the   juvenile

rehabilitation   process  as  well   as   their   skills   in

facilitating such meetings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the question of jurisdiction of those below 16

years  old.   Mdm Claire Chiang asked about the  jurisdiction

for  hearings of cases involving those who are below  16  and

whether the system is fair in hearing the child and in meting

out  sentence.   Sir,  the system that  we  have  now  is  an

efficient  and restorative one and it ensures that the  young

person  who is about to turn 16 or who is below 16  is  given

the  priority to be heard in the juvenile system.   In  other

words,  we  try  as much as possible and, indeed,  given  the

efficiency of our courts, such children will be heard in  the

juvenile system.  The Act provides for such cases to continue

to  be heard in the juvenile court even after the child turns

over  16.   All efforts will be made to expedite his  or  her

hearing  so  that  the principle which governs  the  juvenile

court is extended to young persons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang also asked how do we know that the

child  is  to  be released and who is going to determine  the

child is to be released.  Sir, this depends very much on  the

progress that the youths make during their rehabilitation and

also the circumstances of their families.  Our policy is  not

to  keep  youths in institutional setting.  That is the  last

thing  we  want to do.  In my speech just now,  I  reiterated

that institutionalisation is the last resort.  But while  the

policy  is not to keep these youths in institutional  setting

longer  than  necessary, we need to strike a balance  between

what is public safety and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>

whether  or  not the young person is ready to return  to  the

community and to his or her family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a multi-disciplinary team, comprising

psychologists, social workers and vocational instructors,  to

look  into  the different needs of each resident.  Therefore,

there  is a committee, there is a group of people.  In  fact,

as  a  principle, we have groups of experts rather  than  one

individual  person  trying to determine whether  or  not  the

juvenile  ought  to be released or what kind  of  punishment,

penalty or option which has to be imposed on a child.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked whether we have enough professionals to

accommodate  the  changes that we  have  made.   Indeed,  the

changes  are very comprehensive, and this is in fact  one  of

the  biggest changes that we have made to the CYPA.   We  too

are  very  concerned whether we have enough people.   We  are

still  trying to produce enough psychologists, social workers

and psychiatrists.  Right now, we use both the expertise that

we  have  in  Government and also in the private sector.   In

other  words, we also marshal the expertise - doctors, social

workers  - in the private sector to assess and also  help  us

understand the cases that we have.  But, certainly, we  would

continue  to  train  people.  We have, for  example,  engaged

trainers  from  the  National Society for the  Prevention  of

Cruelty  to  Children,  which is  based  in  UK,  to  provide

professional  training to our child protection officers.   We

also have joint training conducted with the agencies, such as

the  police  and medical social workers, to ensure  that  the

inter-agency system is sufficient and work in the interest of

children.   We are also working with the various agencies  to

secure   the  additional  manpower  and  resources   to   run

additional programmes.  And we are also tapping the  manpower

and  resources  in  the voluntary welfare  organisations,  in

terms  of  psychiatrists and psychologists, to provide  these

specialised services for the programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked whether we ought not to merge the CYPA

and also the Women's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1637</b></font><br><br>

Charter.   Sir,  the  purpose of the  CYPA  and  the  Women's

Charter is different in the sense that the CYPA is to protect

vulnerable and dependent children, the young persons who  are

at  risk  of  abuse or have been abused and they cover  young

persons  between the ages of 14 and 16.  Whereas the  Women's

Charter provides for the protection of women and girls  below

21  years who are in moral danger.  So they are two different

pieces  of legislation which cover two different sections  of

the  population.   But I do concede that, at  some  point  in

time,  perhaps we could consider merging these two pieces  of

legislation and also other legislation on family  issues  and

family matters.  We have not abandoned that idea.  This is an

idea which we could pursue later when the time is ripe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of safeguards against malicious

complaints, indeed, Sir, we are very well aware of this  too,

given  the fact that it is easy for people to complain  about

their  neighbour's  children being abused,  not  knowing  the

reality  or  the  full story.  There may be instances  where,

just because you have a rather lower threshold of discipline,

you  also  want  to  complain.  We are  aware  of  this.   My

officers  will  certainly sieve through  the  complaints  and

applications  to ensure that only those which  are  fair  and

bona  fide  will  be  pursued and those which  arise  out  of

malicious  complaints or very spurious  complaints  would  be

dropped even before we proceed further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of mandatory reporting, this is

something  which has actually been debated a long  time  ago.

In countries where mandatory reporting is applied, especially

among  professionals,  we  found  that  the  level  of   non-compliance even by the professionals themselves is as high as

60%.   We  have consulted the professionals here in Singapore

and, by and large, they feel that such laws are not necessary

here.    In  particular,  there  is  concern  that  mandatory

reporting  may  in  fact  deter  parents,  who  are   abusers

themselves,  from seeking help, in particular,  medical  help

for themselves, their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1638</b></font><br><br>

children  or their victims.  And they may also be tempted  to

keep  their  children at home rather than send them  to  pre-school programme or to the doctor, thereby in fact insulating

their children from the very people who could help them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, on balance, we feel that the education of

professionals  who have regular contacts with children,  such

as  doctors and teachers, is a much better approach  so  that

they know how to detect and report child abuse.  We have been

conducting public education programmes for professionals  and

service  providers.  Mdm Claire Chiang mentioned it.  Earlier

this  year,  I launched an abridged version of  a  manual  on

"Marriage  and  Child  Abuse" and,  certainly,  it  has  been

helpful  in  educating the people on how  to  identify  child

abuse and also how to go about reporting child abuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of discipline and abuse is high in our minds

too.   Maybe,  we  must also be sure that, in some  cultures,

what  is abuse is really discipline.  In other cultures, what

is  discipline  is really abuse.  We are very well  aware  of

that.  Whenever we do come across cases whereby there may  be

a   very  thin  line  between  what  is  abuse  and  what  is

discipline,  we will bring in, as I said, all  the  expertise

and  various views to ascertain whether whatever is  reported

is really abuse or discipline.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of parents who are unable to take care of

their  children, either because the child is disabled or  has

got  some mental problems, we will not straightaway say  that

the parent is abusing the child just by chaining the child to

the  wall.  We will look back much further, and not just look

at  the picture which is presented to us.  In other words, we

will  go further and deeper.  Parents who are unable to  pay,

because of low income or no income, we have other avenues  to

help  them.  So we are very open in that sense.  We are  very

flexible.  We understand that, ultimately, the child must  go

back  to  the family or, hopefully, the child can go back  to

the  family.  Because we too would not want to put all abused

children and all victims into institutions.  We would rather

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1639</b></font><br><br>

that they be rehabilitated.  We would rather that they become

stable  and,  hopefully, they could go back to  their  family

because  that  is  essentially where the  children  ought  to

belong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang also touched about the fate of

intellectually disabled (ID) offenders.  This  is  important.

There  are  provisions  to first ascertain  the  intellectual

level  of  these  children,  either  by  speaking  to  family

members,  interviewing  them about their  background,  mental

capacity  and  medical conditions and even  interviewing  the

complainant  about the offender's behaviour.  This  screening

and  identification  process will help  us  manage  the  case

appropriately so as to reduce unnecessary trauma  experienced

by   the  ID  offenders  and  their  families.   During   the

sentencing  stage,  the courts exercise  their  discretionary

powers  and take note of the special characteristics  of  the

offenders, such as their mental or medical condition, in  the

courts' decisions.  If an offender is intellectually disabled

indeed,  the  courts can request for a social report  on  the

offender with a view to granting probation, for example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, when a probation is granted or recommended for

an  ID offender, the probation officer will work closely with

the  probationer  to  attend specialised  programmes  run  by

community   agencies,  such  as  the  Association   for   the

Educationally Subnormal or Bizlink Centre, and upon placement

on  the  probation,  the  ID  offender  will  be  assigned  a

psychologically   trained  officer  for   supervision   where

possible.   In MCDS-run homes where there is an ID  offender,

we  have  our own psychological services unit to  assess  the

intellectual  functioning of the offender and  recommend  the

appropriate rehabilitation programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee asked whether we ought not to impose

heavier penalties on the media who disclose the identities of

victims who are under 16.  Sir, I cannot agree more with  the

Member that the penalties which we are imposing do not impose

any  financial  hardship on the media.   For  sure,  it  will

definitely not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1640</b></font><br><br>

compensate the child, the young person and their families for

any  distress  that they may have caused resulting  from  the

disclosure.  But although the fine seems very nominal, it has

to be commensurate with the other proposed fines provided for

in the Act.  So that is something we have to follow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we would like to assure the NMP that my

Ministry has worked and will continue to work with the  media

to  ensure  that they are mindful of the social  implications

and  ramifications of reporting or disclosing what they ought

not  to  disclose, through continuous education and dialogue.

But,  actually, the media here are generally very responsible

in  their coverage on matters relating to children and  young

persons.   Of  course, there are rare incidents whereby  they

have  the identities of the juveniles revealed to the  public

and  when we investigated further, we found that these  could

have been genuine mistakes, and not through wilful disclosure

of the facts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo asked about contamination. He feared that

putting the new juvenile offenders together with the hardcore

residents  of rehabilitation homes would somehow  contaminate

the  former.   We  are aware of this, Sir, and  we  are  very

concerned  about contamination too.  What really  happens  is

that  before  residents are put into the homes,  we  classify

them, ie, they go through a classification system.  We have a

system called CLASS, which is a classification and assessment

system.   This tool helps the Ministry to identify the  needs

of   each  juvenile  offender  in  a  very  professional  and

objective  manner.   All newly committed  juveniles  will  be

assessed  by  a multi-disciplinary team for their  character,

behaviour and also their rehabilitation needs.  And from  the

outcome  of these assessments, we will consider an individual

care  plan  for  each juvenile.  That is one  strategy.   The

other  strategy is to separate the two groups and,  based  on

the  results  from CLASS, the homes make a  decision  on  the

physical  placement  of  the boys and  girls  into  different

residential blocks within the homes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1641</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo also asked whether institutionalisation is

always  the  last  resort.  As I said,  we  believe  in  that

philosophy.   And,  since  1999, we  have  been  getting  the

community  very  much involved in the rehabilitation  of  the

young  person  and child.  Since 1999, for example,  we  have

been  very  active  in  forging ties with  the  community  to

initiate  numerous  community-based services  and  programmes

that  are  closely linked with wholesome youth  developments.

Our  results  have shown that community-based  rehabilitation

indeed,  when  used appropriately, provides  the  most  cost-effective  and  least  disruptive means to  rehabilitate  the

juvenile offender.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also, in a way, a response to Mr Charles Chong

who is very concerned that we do not really go into the realm

of  the  family, to intervene in what ought to  be  a  family

matter.  Again, as I said, ultimately, our objective  is  for

the  family to take charge of the child and we make it  such.

The rehabilitative process that we go through is not only  to

rehabilitate  the child but also to ensure that  the  parents

would be able to take care of the child and, therefore, bring

the  child  back  into  the family later  on.   That  is  our

ultimate objective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong also raised the question about the

interpretation  of  the term "undesirable  activities".   The

term

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1642</b></font><br><br>

really  is  meant to protect any child who  may  be  used  by

adults  for  activities, especially illegal ones,  which  are

detrimental  to  the  well-being of the  child,  eg,  illegal

lotteries,  illegal hawking, gambling or activities  of  such

magnitude  or  like.   The  context referred  is  to  illegal

activities.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Could the Minister

elaborate  on one query?  How do we check the powers  of  the

Director?  Is there a mechanism of accountability already set

up?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> As I have said, in most, if not

all  cases, we have a multi-disciplinary team to assess.   In

other words, even the protector himself or herself is subject

to the assessment of this team.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
