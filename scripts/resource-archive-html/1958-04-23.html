<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members will be aware of the growing

public concern at the increase in gangsterism  and

secret society activities of recent months, and as

indicated  in the Governor's speech on 9th  April,

the   Government   considers  it   imperative   to

strengthen the laws by which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>



these   activities   can   be   more   effectively

countered.  The  majority  of  these  crimes   are

committed by individual gangsters or by  gangs  of

thugs,  who  expect to retain all the proceeds  or

nearly  all the proceeds of their crimes and  look

only to their parent secret societies - if I may put

it  that  way - for protection from prosecution  and

for  protection against rival gangs.  These  gangs

hold  sway  in  their own particular areas,  where

they   organise  gambling,  smuggling,  vice   and

extortion rackets of different kinds. They provoke

gang  fights  and they intimidate the  law-abiding

public into the payment of protection money. Their

hold, Sir, is such as to frighten the public  from

giving evidence against them, and their efforts to

control each other's activities very often lead to

violent clashes between different gangs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is regrettably true, Sir, that in 1957, the

number  of  gang fights, which was 150,  was  more

than in all the three previous years put together,

and  that  figure  has  not - regrettably - decreased

this year since there have been 68 such fights  in

the first three months of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the members of these gangs are

under  30  years of age and mostly, as far  as  we

know,  are born in Singapore. It directly reflects

the serious social and economic problems presented

by  the  great increase in Singapore's  population

since  the  War, problems which are receiving  the

earnest attention of the Government but which  are

not  easy or susceptible to an early solution. The

causes of this delinquency can be eradicated  over

a  period of years only by improvement of economic

and  social conditions and by active youth welfare

and educational work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is doing all in its power to

further  these  aims  but  in  the  meantime   the

immediate  need is to preserve the  peace  of  the

Colony and to protect the law-abiding public  from

the  criminal  activities of these  gangsters.  In

this,  Sir, the police, the public and the  Courts

all  have  a part to play. The police require  the

support and the confidence of the public not  only

in  providing  information of  actual  crimes  and

projected crimes, but also in willingness



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



to come forward and to give evidence against those

responsible. The Courts, for their part, can  only

administer the laws enacted by the Legislature and

it  is  for this Assembly to ensure that they  are

armed  with the laws and the sanctions  which  the

present situation requires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the existing provisions in the Criminal

Justice (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance whereby a

sentence  of  corrective  training  or  preventive

detention  can  only  be  imposed  on   proof   of

membership  of,  or connection with,  an  unlawful

society,  has not proved as effective as had  been

hoped,  even though special provision is  made  in

section   6   to  facilitate  evidence   of   such

membership.  In  a number of such cases  in  which

charges   are  brought  of  offences  particularly

associated   with   the   activities   of   secret

societies,  there has not been the proof  required

in  relation  to membership of the secret  society

and it has not therefore proved possible to invoke

the  provisions of this Ordinance. The purpose  of

clause  2 of this amending Bill is to remedy  that

position  and to provide the Courts with  a  wider

discretion  than they at present have in  applying

the  provisions of this Ordinance, by removing the

condition   precedent  that  membership   of,   or

connection  with,  an  unlawful  society  must  be

proved in addition to the conviction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important amendment, Sir, to the

principal  Ordinance is in clause 3  of  the  Bill

which  empowers the arrest of any person found  in

the  immediate vicinity of, or escaping from,  any

place  in which a disturbance is occurring or  has

recently   occurred,  or   any   place   where   a

disturbance, according to information received  by

the  police,  is  likely to take  place,  and  any

person  who  is  reasonably  suspected  of   being

connected with a secret society. Such a person can

be  required, under this provision, by a Court  to

show cause why he should not be ordered to sign  a

bond to keep the peace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power is also given to the Courts to impose a

curfew  order on such a person. For breach of  the

bond or the order, such a person will be liable to

imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



months, or to a fine not exceeding $1,000,  or  to

both such imprisonment and fine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, Sir, it often happens that the

police, arriving at the scene of a planned  clash,

in  time to prevent it, or arriving shortly  after

one  has occurred, find persons present whom  they

have  good reason to know are the fighter elements

of  the  secret societies concerned, but short  of

catching  them in actual possession  of  offensive

weapons,  the police are powerless since witnesses

from  the neighbourhood are not prepared  to  come

forward to give evidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like, Sir, to emphasise on this

particular  clause  that it is not  intended  that

this power should be used in any arbitrary manner.

Moreover, the clause provides that the police must

take  the  individual before the Court and  it  is

provided   in  the  following  clause   that   the

provisions of section 80 of the Criminal Procedure

Code  shall apply to an enquiry by the Court under

this  clause.  And  section  80  of  the  Criminal

Procedure Code provides that where such  an  order

has  been made and a person appears or is  brought

before  a Court in compliance with or in execution

of  a  summons or warrant, the Court shall proceed

to  enquire into the truth of the information upon

which  it  is  acting, and to  take  such  further

evidence as appears necessary. Such enquiry  shall

be  made as nearly as is practicable in the manner

hereof prescribed for conducting trials in summary

cases, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I suggest to hon. Members that although this

is  an  exceptional power of arrest,  a  safeguard

against  injustice  to innocent  people  is  amply

provided  for by the provisions which ensure  that

there  shall  be a proper enquiry before  a  Court

before  anyone is required to execute  a  bond  as

provided in this clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final amendment to the principal

Ordinance  is in clause 4 of the Bill  which  adds

the  offences  of  carrying  knives  or  offensive

weapons in public, loitering with intent to commit

a   seizable  offence  and  offences   under   the

Corrosive Substances Ordinance, 1956, to the  list

of scheduled offences under the principal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance. The reason for this, Sir, is that these

are  the  types  of offences which are  frequently

committed by persons associated with gang warfare.

Hon.  Members will be aware of the ingenuity shown

by  these  gangsters  in devising  and  concealing

weapons which are capable of killing their victims

or  maiming  them for life, and of the  increasing

use  in  recent months of the particularly vicious

weapon of acid bombs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe it will be the wish of all hon.

Members  of  this Assembly to see the  scourge  of

gang  warfare  wiped  out  from  our  midst.   The

legislation  now proposed is designed  to  further

that  purpose and no more. I have every hope that,

with  the co-operation of the public, which  I  am

glad  to say is increasing daily, this legislation

will  strengthen the organs of law  and  order  in

removing this menace from our midst.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.19 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am  happy  that the Government  has  now  given

consideration to an amending Bill to  tighten  the

activities of secret societies, first, in amending

this   Criminal  Justice  (Temporary   Provisions)

(Amendment) Ordinance and following on, the  Penal

Code  Ordinance. I believe that this is the result

of the question filed by me, which was answered by

the   Chief  Secretary  yesterday.  Without   that

question  I  doubt that the Government would  ever

have considered amending these two Ordinances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day we hear of gang clashes, gang fights

and  secret  society activities, and  of  innocent

people  or innocent citizens being victimised  and

assaulted.  Unless  these gang clashes  by  secret

societies  are stopped immediately,  I  am  afraid

that  the  Government machinery will cease  to  be

effective and is bound to collapse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, Sir, the Bill is a good one and I

should  say  that it merits the support  of  every

sane  and sensible Member of this House. But, Sir,

however much I would like to support it,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



I  am  more anxious about its application when  it

becomes law. It would appear that there are  cases

when  the police can be very fair, but also  other

cases  when  the police can abuse  the  powers  of

investigation given to them. We need not  go  very

far  for an example, Sir. Even the application  of

the  Preservation of Public Security Ordinance  is

subject  to abuse. Just look at the complaints  of

torture received by Members of this Assembly which

have  prompted me to table a motion that  will  be

debated   at  a  later  hour  today  or   sometime

tomorrow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is there, Sir, to prevent an innocent person

being  dragged  in  for nothing under  this  Bill?

Clause  3  is  very delicate and I  am  sure  that

everyone,  including  the  Chief  Secretary,  will

agree  that  there are loopholes in it for  abuse.

Clause 3 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The principal Ordinance is hereby amended by inserting immediately after section 3 thereof, the following new section:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3A.-(l) Where a police officer not below the rank of Inspector-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) on receipt of information which he

considers  to be reliable that a disturbance

is  likely to occur in any place proceeds to

such   place  and  finds  in  the  immediate

vicinity thereof or departing therefrom, or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) finds in the immediate vicinity of, or

departing  from,  any  place  in   which   a

disturbance  is  occurring or  has  recently

taken place.....



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Secretary said just now that if a

person  is  present somewhere near  a  disturbance

that has taken place, then a police inspector,  or

anybody  above  the  rank of  inspector,  who  has

reason to believe that any person found there have

connections with such disturbance, have got powers

of  arrest. But much as I would like to say I have

confidence in the police force, may I mention that

most  of  the junior police officers or detectives

were themselves members of secret societies before

they  joined  the  force?  I  think  they  form  a

majority,   although  I  see  the   Minister   for

Education  shaking his head; he  himself  must  be

fully aware of that. That being the case, Sir,  it

may  be that if there is an old grudge, this  Bill

will  come  in  very  handy to them.  An  innocent

person may be going across



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



a  road  or  walking along one where a disturbance

has  just  occurred. What is there to prevent  him

from  being arrested or at least being subject  to

interrogation, thus wasting his time and also  the

good and valuable time of the police themselves?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unless there are safeguards against such

possible victimisations, and the police force  has

gone through a thorough cleaning, I am afraid that

there  will  be  loopholes for  abuse.  The  Chief

Secretary said just now that there are safeguards,

under  section 80 of the Ordinance, I think - I  did

not  catch him properly. That may be so, but  such

arbitrary  powers  given to the police  cannot  in

fact  be  well safeguarded under a section  of  an

Ordinance; there should be fuller provisions about

using the discretion to make arrests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government can assure me that such

safeguards exist and that the powers will  not  be

abused by police officers who may at times have no

discretion about arrest, I am prepared to  support

the Bill.



<br><br>10.25 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  are  all  aware  that  gangsterism  has  taken

control in Singapore in many aspects of life.  The

enquiry  into corrupt practices has  given  us  an

insight into the secret societies' influence  over

the  public. We must eradicate this and substitute

it  by  better  law and order; we  must  give  the

police  a greater measure of power to enable  them

to protect innocent people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a question is put forward to me, `Would you

like to have the powers in the hands of the secret

societies,  or  in the hands of  the  police?',  I

would definitely say: `We want the powers to be in

the hands of the police - but just sufficient powers

to  enable them to protect us and no more, so that

they will not be in a position to misuse them'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, Sir, this Bill goes a long way to

helping  the  people get rid of secret  societies.

But whilst we want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



get  rid of the secret societies, we also want  to

protect innocent people. They have every right  to

be  protected. We do not want to see  an  innocent

man  hauled into a police station, kept there  for

24  hours  or  made  to appear before  the  police

court,  and after that released. The inconvenience

he  has to undergo would be sufficient to make him

feel that the police is not his friend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt there has been a great deal of

explanation  as to how this Bill will be  operated

when it becomes law; no doubt there are safeguards

in  section 80 of the Criminal Procedure Code. But

I would like the Press, especially, to put it over

to  the  people  how  this law will  operate - that

unless   they  are  criminals  or  secret  society

gangsters,  they  will not be  hauled  in  by  the

police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I think the Chief Secretary

should  give detailed instructions as to how  this

law should be enforced. Every known secret society

member  should  be hauled in, but anybody  who  is

reasonably regarded as not being a secret  society

member should be given the benefit of the doubt. I

know  that  whether  a person  is  in  the  secret

society  movement  or not is  well  known  to  the

police.  They  have  a record  of  secret  society

members.  They also have an unofficial  record  of

secret  society members. If arrests are  made  and

cases  brought before the Courts after the  police

have  consulted  all these records,  nothing  much

will go wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if an inspector acts on just suspicion and

uses  his  own  discretion, there might  be  cases

where  old  scores may be squared. We  must  avoid

this. No old scores should be squared. This law is

meant for the purpose of keeping law and order and

it should remain so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this, Sir, because I know that whenever a

raid is being carried out, a police inspector will

take  out  a  dozen or more men to the scene.  The

inspector would be there but the arrests would  be

made by the constables and detectives. They may be

within  sight  of the inspector,  or  out  of  his

sight,  but the inspector would have to  stand  up

for his men on such cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Government to give to the police

and to every individual



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



officer  minute instructions as to  how  this  law

should  be  operated, in order  to  safeguard  the

innocent.  We  are  all  against  secret   society

members. We want them to be cleaned up but, at the

same  time, we ask that the innocent be  protected

and not be inconvenienced.



<br><br>10.30 am.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

despite my hearty support of this amendment, yet I

wish  to  stress a few points. This amending  Bill

appears  to be very effective medicine to  cure  a

very dangerous disease - gangsterism; but in using a

very  effective drug to cure a dangerous  disease,

we must be very careful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown as well as the Member

for  Serangoon  touched upon abuse  of  powers  by

police  officers in applying the law which we  are

now  going  to  enact. Sir, we all respect  police

inspectors,  yet as I pointed out yesterday  about

the C.I.D. organisation, should not the Government

realise  that  an inspector can easily  be  misled

into  abusing powers? I do not say that inspectors

will  abuse the powers straightaway, but that they

may  be  misled  into abusing them, especially  as

many  of our new inspectors are fresh from  school

with  only  a School Certificate and three  years'

training. Then the whole source of his information

is   the  detectives,  and  I  invited  the  Chief

Secretary yesterday to come out with me  into  the

street  to  see  how  many people  have  faith  in

detectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the clauses in the Bill reads, ".. the

inspector  on  receipt  of  information  which  he

considers  to be reliable..". The inspectors  rely

on  the detectives' information and consider  that

reliable.  However, I have had  bitter  experience

about  this  in the past, and I think every  other

Member  here  must have had one  or  two  also.  I

remember  a  night not long ago when there  was  a

wayang play in Chai Chee Village. That night  from 10  p.m. my telephone kept ringing. Why?  Hawkers

and  farmers had been arrested and confined in Joo

Chiat   Police  Station.  Many  of  them  I   knew

personally, especially one fishmonger who  had  to

get  up at about 3 am to go to the fish market  to

get fish



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



to sell in Changi Market. Yet he was arrested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I contacted the police - by telephone of course - and

they said that they had received information of an

expected  gang fight at the wayang. I  dressed  up

and  went to the vicinity of the wayang. And there

I  saw a few notorious gangsters whom I knew  were

active  gangsters taking kwayteow, sitting  around

and  drinking  beer  near the  stage,  while  poor

innocent farmers and fishermen were in the  police

station!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is the sort of thing which has taught

me bitter lessons. Why should it happen? As I told

the House yesterday, it is because the head of the

gangsters is well known to the detectives and they

have  a  relationship. They  can  dine  and  drink

together in public restaurants and open bars.  Can

the  public have faith in detectives when they see

the   law  executors  drinking  and  dining   with

notorious gangsters in a kampong or a street?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, therefore I strongly put over this point to

the  Government: try to find a remedy  to  prevent

the  police from being misled into abusing  powers

which  this House and the country entrust to them.

Only  by  so  doing  can they  hope  to  make  the

detective   organisation  more   effective,   more

respected and more trustworthy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides relying on detectives, uniformed

inspectors  also rely much on the police.  In  the

past - I  do  not know what the reason  is - everybody

used  to  say, "Oh, the Chinese, because of  their

tradition, do not like the soldiers and  therefore

they do not like to be policemen". So many of  our

constables  have been recruited from  the  Malays;

worst  of  all,  they  have  been  recruited  from

Federation Malays. There is therefore not only the

language barrier between them and the people, but

also  differences in traditions and  customs.  How

then  can  you  make  the police  become  a  good,

reliable friend of the people, as I think it is  a

basic idea to have the people have faith and trust

in   the   police  force?  Therefore  unless   the

plainclothes   and   uniformed   police   can   be

completely  re-organised  into  an  effective  and

respected machinery, I am sure this amending  Bill

will be only just a waste of time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am putting this point now for the

Government,  not only for the Chief Secretary:  if

we  believe  in  the  proverb that  prevention  is

better than cure, we must think of ways how not to

make  it  necessary  to  arrest  and  prosecute  a

person.  Why  do  the police not consider  certain

measures  before  a  thing is going  to  happen - by

persuasion, by constant visits to the family of  a

suspected  criminal, by improving the relationship

between  them and the public? We know - and I  think

the Chief Secretary knows better than anybody else

here - that  in  many countries  in  the  world  the

policeman is the best friend of the youngsters and

adults  alike.  They take part  in  any  community

activity.  Why not here? Here we have a  very  bad

tradition.  When  children  start  crying,   their

parents   often  say,  `Stop  crying.  Mata   mata

datang!' That makes the police out to be a terror,

not  a  friend. They know all the bad hats in  the

area  yet they only watch and wait and only  start

arresting when they begin to commit crimes. Sir, I

do not think that is a good practice.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I quite agree that perhaps it

is not a good practice, but is not the hon. Member

straying a little too far from the Bill itself? Is

he relevant?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, that was my concluding

point - that  I consider this amending  Bill  to  be

defective  medicine. Therefore I put  forward  the

moral  of  the proverb that prevention  is  better

than cure, that it is better to adopt certain  new

measures  to prevent crimes happening rather  than

be  ready  to arrest and prosecute only after  the

crimes have been committed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg and am forced to support this

amendment.



<br><br>10.40 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

a few years back we did not require such a Bill to

amend  the law whereby, may I quote clause 3,", a

police officer not below the rank of inspector  on

receipt  of information which he considers  to  be

reliable...can ...".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



A  few  years back we did not require these  extra

powers for the police. The problem now is that  in

the  rank  and file of the police force, there  is

now  frustration, disappointment  and  discontent.

Why do I say this? If you were to be seated in the

C.I.D. building  today, Sir, you  will  see  many

police  officers, detectives, the rank  and  file,

each  and every one of whom is frustrated. Only  a

few days back, I understand a circular went out to

all  senior detectives directing that if they  did

not make an arrest or supply information to senior

police officers in the force, their services would

be  terminated  or  they would be  transferred  to

other branches of the force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is dictatorial. Just think of a police

officer  who has been in the force for  years  and

years; on receipt of such an instruction, what can

he  do? As we all know, most of the detectives  in

the force were all ex-members of secret societies,

so  that  instruction  will  force  them  to  make

arrests or to supply information against their own

enemies in other branches of the secret societies.

Why  do I say that, Sir? Only recently, the police

introduced   "Operation   Dagger",   under   which

thousands   and  thousands  of  people,   innocent

people, suffered. Walk along the streets and I  am

quite  sure you will meet people with tattoo marks

all  over  their bodies blackened. These blackened

tattoo  marks  are  for ever  impressed  on  their

bodies.  This  is  what  I  call  injustice.  Just

because  you  have a tattoo mark on your  body.  I

mean  a  mark  which  is related  to  one  of  the

insignias  of  a  secret society, for  example,  a

tattoo  mark of a man fighting a tiger - in  Chinese

they  call it Boo Siong pah haw - according  to  the

records of the C.I.D., the Boo Siong pah haw  mark

belongs  to Gang 18, you are a member of a  secret

society. That is rubbish - [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Sir, that is rubbish. Take other

examples:  if you have a Red Indian head  on  your

body,  they say you belong to Gang 24;  a  sailing

boat  on the body, Gang 24; a black panther,  Gang 24;  a  Goddess  of  Mercy.  Gang  108;  an  eagle fighting a snake,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



Gang  108. Why not arrest the soldiers and sailors

who have these similar marks? I am quite sure many

people, innocent people, have these marks on their

bodies.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was just wondering whether

a  detailed exposition of that nature is  suitable

for a debate on this Bill. I think the hon. Member

will  have  an opportunity, when we continue  with

the debate on the Governor's Speech, to attack the

police  as  such,  but in this particular  Bill  I

think  details  of that nature are really  perhaps

going a bit too far.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> That I will do so, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said just now, there is discontentment

because  we have people among the higher ranks  of

the  police  force favouring the  other  blue-eyed

boys  in the force. Therefore many members of  the

force,  the  rank and file, are very disappointed,

discontented and frustrated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally feel that this amending Bill is not

necessary.



<br><br>10.45 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> It should be on

the  record, Sir, that the operative word for  the

speech  of  the  Member for Tiong  Bahru  on  this

amending   Bill  is  that  it  is  not  necessary.

Probably some of his friends will be very  pleased

to hear it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two distinct ways in which one

could approach this Bill. First, the stand of  the

unsophisticated   democrats - the   rule   of   law,

evidence corroborated beyond all reasonable doubt.

When we try to bring the standards and patterns of

law  and  order from some foreign land which  does

not  suit  the realities of our local  conditions,

then  the  result  will be chaos.  The  democratic

system  cannot be transplanted wholesale.  Neither

can  its  rules, laws and enactments  be  repeated

without amendment. The first question is how do we

eradicate the source, the economic and the  social

causes  which  the  Chief Secretary  very  lightly

touched  upon. As long as the social and  economic

forces are there, there will be an endless stream



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



of recruits for secret societies, not only for the

purposes  of extortion, but also for the  purposes

of  overthrowing  the existing order.  The  second

question   is,   until  we  have   achieved   that

objective, what do we do about it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Japanese had a very effective way

of dealing with it-they just potong  kepala; and I

do  not  think anybody doubts that it was  a  very

effective  method. I do not think  the  people  of

Singapore, or indeed in Malaya, ever lived through

a  more difficult or a more trying period than the

three-and-a-half years of the Japanese occupation,

and  yet  gangsterism was nil; because there  were

swaggering sergeants with long swords who  made  a

habit  of  using them. And terror was  used  as  a

weapon  to  a  point where it was  not  worth  the

feeding  of  a chicken to have one's head  chopped

off.  I  think many of us here still remember  the

grisly heads that were stuck up on all the bridges

in  Singapore just to remind the people that there

was  such  a thing called law and order  with  the

Japanese samurai sword.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one way: you just knock down the other

fellow, never mind about evidence and so on; never

mind even if you knock out four innocent chaps  to

get one guilty one. But more important is that you

terrify all the rest of the guilty ones to a point

where they think it is not worth their fun.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other way I have only read about. I have not

seen  it at first hand, but I am told that if  you

try to be a teddy boy in Moscow, then you will not

last  very long. There are people who want to find

out  what your employment is, what you are  doing,

and why you are not doing anything and yet have so

many  of  the good things in life. Very  soon  you

find  yourself in a healthy camp where you do very

good work, and get yourself re-orientated into the

right way of thinking, that the purpose in life is

not  to try and cheat your way out of society, but

to work hard and contribute to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, somewhere between these two extremes, we

have  to find our solution. I am not in a position

to  say,  not  being  in  possession  of  detailed

information  of the probable habits and  reactions of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



these secret society gangsters, whether a Bill  of

this   nature  will  meet  our  needs.   Certainly

something has got to be done about it. The problem

is  to  find some method which can be an effective

counter,  and  can,  to  a certain  extent,  deter

people  from  embarking  on hazardous  occupations

such  as secret society gangsterism, without being

turned into a weapon of terror.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard this morning, pass unchallenged, the

statement  that  police inspectors were  ex-secret

society members. That, I think, is going a  little

bit too far. We all know, particularly those of us

who  by their profession have something to do with

the  Courts,  and  have to hear  the  evidence  of

detectives and inspectors, that it is not true  to

say  that  police inspectors have  been  ex-secret

society members. But it is unfortunately true that

there are very often ex-secret society members  as

detectives  in  the police force.  The  inspectors

quite  frankly tell us that you need  a  thief  to

catch another thief, and a monkey to catch another

monkey, because if you cannot climb a tree and the

other monkey can, you are left behind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being so, all we can do is no more than

exhort the Government to see that a great deal  of

care  and supervision are maintained in order that

there  should not be corruption - not just financial

corruption  but general corruption  in  discipline

and   morale - where  reliance  is  placed  on   the

evidence of purely ex-secret society gangsters  in

order to get present secret society gangsters. But

other than broad statements of principle, I do not

think  anybody in this House is in a  position  to

say whether this Bill really answers the need. All

we  can say is, we hope that Ministers have  given

careful  consideration to it, and we hope that  it

will answer the need.



<br><br>10.51 am.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, I welcome the general support

that  has been forthcoming for this Bill with  one

exception.   The   hon.  Member   for   Queenstown

suggested  that, as a result of his  question  put

down for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



answer  in this Assembly yesterday, the Government

had  moved  extremely quickly.  I  appreciate  the

bouquet  which  he is giving for  the  speed  with

which Government can move, but I am afraid I  must

tell  him  that  this Bill was in preparation  for

some time before he put his question down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose, Sir, to answer now the

accusations  which have been made  as  to  certain

elements  in  the  police force,  and  to  certain

abuses of their powers. That is a matter which  as

you  yourself have said, Sir, has been  raised  on

the  debate on the Governor's Speech, and I  shall

be  having  something to say when that  debate  is resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the general provisions of this Bill, I

am  entirely  in concurrence with the hon.  Member

for  Tanjong Pagar that what we have to do broadly

is  to try and find the proper balance between the

necessary  protection of innocent persons  against

abuse  of  authority and affording to the  police,

who  have  the  responsibility of  bringing  these

criminals  to  justice, the  necessary  powers  to

enable them to do so. No Government, and certainly

not this Government, would wish to give the police

or  anybody else more powers than are necessary to

discharge  their  functions.  Wherever  power   or

authority is vested, there is room for abuse,  and

that  is  a  fact which must be recognised.  I  do

assure hon. Members with regard to the application

of  the  provisions  of this  Bill  that  I  shall

personally concern myself with the application  of

these  provisions  and endeavour  to  ensure  that

there is no abuse of the powers with which I  hope

the Assembly is now prepared to vest the police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two minor points raised, Sir, in

connection with the wording of the Bill. One  hon.

Member referred to the provision in clause 3A  (1)

(i)  that  "on  receipt  of information  which  he

considers to be reliable" and suggested that since

that information came from a detective, it was  to

be  suspect - I  must point out  to  him  that  that

provision  refers  only  to  information  that   a

disturbance   is  likely  to  take   place;   that

provision has nothing to do with the arrest or the

grounds of arrest of any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



person. That is provided later in the clause where

it  is specifically stated that the police officer

not below the rank of inspector has to have reason

to   suspect  that  the  individual  concerned  is

connected with an unlawful society, and that is  a

matter  of  identification. And as I explained  in

moving the Second Reading, the inspector will have

to produce and support the grounds on which he has

made  his  arrest  when he brings  the  individual

before the Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have nothing further to add.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. Bill accordingly

read a Second time and committed to a Committee of

the whole Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the legislation which the Assembly has just

approved  will, as I have indicated, give  greater

powers  to the Police and to the Courts to  combat

the  activities  of criminal gangsters  under  the

Criminal Justice (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance.

The  Bill  now  before the Assembly makes  certain

amendments to the Penal Code to enable the  courts

to  impose  heavier  sentences  on  persons  found

guilty  of  certain  crimes  which  are  all   too

prevalent  at the present time and  to  act  as  a

deterrent against their commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first amendment in clause 2 deals with

persons   who  are  guilty  of  the   offence   of

committing  an affray. The punishment provided  at

present  in  the  Penal Code for this  offence  is

unduly   lenient  in  the  present   circumstances

consisting  as it does of imprisonment  which  may

extend  to one month or a maximum fine of $100  or

both  such  imprisonment and fine. I have  already

indicated  to the Assembly the vicious  nature  of

the type of gang fights which are unfortunately of

such frequent occurrence in Singapore and I do not

doubt  that  hon.  Members  will  agree  that  the

present penalties which I have detailed are not  a

sufficient deterrent in the present circumstances.

It   is  accordingly  proposed  that  the  maximum

punishment  for  committing an  affray  should  be

increased to imprisonment for a maximum period  of

one  year or to a fine which may amount to  $1,000

or to both such imprisonment and fine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 3 of the Bill makes a number of

amendments  to certain sections of the Penal  Code

to  increase the sentences which may be imposed by

the   courts  for  the  crime  of  kidnapping   or

abduction  to ten years and to make such  offences

also  punishable  with whipping.  Members  are  no

doubt  aware from reports in the daily press  that

over a number of years there have been several



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>



cases  of kidnapping and also a number of attempts

which  have been thwarted by the vigilance of  the

Police. There is also good reason to believe  that

there have been other successful kidnappings which

have  not  been reported to the Police  and  which

have  resulted  in the payment of  large  sums  of

money   as  ransom.  Sir,  the  essence  of  every

kidnapping  case  is  to put the  victim  and  his

relatives   in  fear  of  physical  violence   and

frequently involves the detention of the victim in

conditions of extreme discomfort. If this form  of

crime  is  to  be  adequately discouraged,  it  is

imperative  that  the punishment  for  this  crime

should  be increased to a level which will  afford

the severest deterrent to those who seek to profit

from   it.   Although  modern  penal   reform   is

antipathetic  to  the use of corporal  punishment,

these principles of reform, if they are to achieve

their purpose, require the existence of conditions

which it must regrettably he admitted do not exist

in  Singapore  today. The thugs who take  part  in

these crimes of violence are not for the most part

susceptible  to  the sympathetic  treatment  which

these  principles  symbolise and  for  the  better

protection   of  the  public,  it  is   considered

advisable  to arm the Courts with this  additional

power to be used at discretion and which will  act

as  a  greater  deterrent to those who  now  think

nothing  of inflicting physical violence on  their

innocent victims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.05 am.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker Sir,

the  introduction of this Bill to amend the  Penal

Code  Ordinance should be most welcome. I may  say

that  this  amendment  more  or  less  answers  my

question  yesterday rather than the previous  one,

the   Criminal   Justice  (Temporary   Provisions)

Ordinance, as this applies more to kidnapping  and

gangsterism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in my opinion, I feel that the new

punishment  proposed under this new  amendment  is

still inadequate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



Kidnapping  and gangsterism  are  very,

very serious offences because they cause fear  and

alarm  not only to the rich and poor but  also  to

every  individual  citizen in  this  country.  The

condition in which the victim finds himself is not

all  to  be considered. We must also consider  the

condition  of  the family of that victim.  When  a

victim  is  kidnapped  and confined  illegally  or

wrongfully, the family is put under mental torture

and suffers more if that victim is the sole bread-winner  of the family. People who steal or  commit

minor  offences may receive the sympathy and mercy

of the court but kidnapping and gangsterism should

not  receive the slightest sympathy at all.  These

kidnappers  or  extortionists  are  just  out   to

satisfy their taste for richness in that they  can

demand  fantastic sums of money from the so-called

rich people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the mental torture caused to the

family, the victim is also subject to torture just

as  in  one case where he was confined in a  small

box  some time ago. The only way to wipe out  such

offences  is  to  introduce the severest  form  of

punishment  so  that the courts could  impose  the

maximum  fine  allowed by law.  Although  the  new

legislation   proposes  ten  years'   imprisonment

and/or whipping, I feel that that is inadequate as

the  Member  for Tanjong Pagar this  morning  said

that  we  must show to those who intend to  commit

these  crimes  that  the Government  really  means

business - not just putting it on paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although I am not satisfied with this

proposed  amendment because the new punishment  is

not  adequate, I do not intend to propose  another

amendment  to  provide for more severe  punishment

because  I may be obstructing the passing of  this

law.  I am prepared to allow this amendment to  go

through. If after this amendment is made  law  and

further  crimes of this nature are not stopped,  I

would urge Government to consider introducing more

severe  punishment  than ten  years'  imprisonment

and/or whipping.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to support this amendment but there is one

point I would like to bring up for the consideration of Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment to section 160 of the Penal

Code proposes to increase the term of imprisonment

to  one year and a fine of $1,000. I think this is

beyond  the  power of a Magistrate Court  to  deal

with.  Therefore  if there are not  many  District

Criminal Courts available to deal with such cases,

the Magistrates' Courts will not be able to impose

the  maximum  term of imprisonment and  this  Bill

will  just  be  a  scrap  of  paper.  I  want  the

Government  to give me an assurance that  we  have

sufficient District Criminal Courts to  deal  with

such cases.



<br><br>11.13 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, the Member for Queenstown (Mr

Lee  Choon Eng) suggested that these penalties are

not  adequate enough; that I think myself to be  a

matter   of  balance.  In  providing  for  maximum

penalties, one must strike an appropriate  balance

between  different types of crimes and, of course,

it is for the courts in individual cases to decide

what  the  appropriate penalty may be.  What  this

legislation provides for is only the maximum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi (Mr Lim Cher Kheng)

pointed  out  that Magistrates'  Courts  can  only

inflict  maximum penalties of six months and  that

therefore  for  any  greater  penalty  under  this

amended provision, it would be necessary for cases

to  be  taken before the District Courts. That  is

the  case and serious cases will have to be  taken

before the District Courts. I can assure the  hon.

Member  as regards the number of Courts  that  the

position will be watched.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Citizenship (Amendment)

Ordinance,  1958 came into force on 15th  January,

1958. It will be remembered that one of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



provisions  of that Ordinance was that any  person

who  applied for registration as a citizen  before

31st January, 1958 - that is the end of the initial

registration period - and was registered within  one

month  after that date, would be deemed  to  be  a

citizen  of Singapore on 1st February,  1958, for

the   purpose  of  being  included  in  the  first

registers  prepared for the Singapore  Legislative

Assembly elections. 1,412 persons in this category

were registered during this extended period of one

month.  The present Bill seeks to extend this  one

month  period  by a further month. The  reason  is

that  in  respect  of a number  of  persons  whose

applications were approved by the Minister  before

28th February, 1958, it was impossible to complete

the  formalities by that date and they could  only

be  registered  during March. There  were  a  very

large  number of applications outstanding on  31st

January,  1958, for investigation during  February

and   although  the  Advisory  Committee  and  the

Minister  concerned considered these  applications

with  all  possible speed, there were a number  on

which  it  was  only possible to  complete  action

leading to approval at the very end of the  month.

It  is considered that it would only be fair  that

such persons so registered will also be deemed  to

be  citizens  of Singapore on 1st February,  1958,

for  the  purpose of being included in  the  first

registers  prepared for the Singapore  Legislative

Assembly  elections.  This  Bill  therefore  makes

enabling provision for the above purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>11.25 am.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday I

was  speaking on the fishing industry  and  I  was

referring  to the slogans that were encouraged  by

the Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J.  M.

Jumabhoy). One of his slogans was, "Support  local

industry and buy Singapore goods."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by allowing the Japanese to come here and

compete  with  our local fishermen, I  wonder  how

that slogan can mean what it is meant to mean.  Is

the  Minister not contradicting himself and  going

against  the  policy  of  his  own  Government  to

encourage  local  industry? The Governor's  Speech

stated,  Sir,  that  the  Government  intends  "to

assist  local  fishermen who  are  willing  to  be

trained in new methods of fishing". In what way or

how  can the Government train our local people  in

new  methods of fishing? In Singapore, we have  no

fishing   schools.  Furthermore,   the   Fisheries

Department do not have the personnel to train  our

local  people in the fishing industry.  Government

has got to rely on the Japanese to train our local

people here but are the Japanese prepared to teach

our  local  people when they know very  well  that

when  our  local  people  are  fully  trained   as

fishermen   it   will  affect  their   own   trade

considerably? I am quite sure that  they  are  not

prepared.  So the only way, Sir, under  the  guise

that  they  will train our local people,  is  they

offer  very,  very  small salaries  to  our  local

people  who join them as recruits for training  in

the  catch of fish. Street boys from road  corners

are  recruited and the salary that they now  offer

is  between $80 to $100 a month. Sir,  can  a  man

live on $80 to $100 a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



month?  It  is rather difficult. Now,  Sir,  apart

from this low salary, these street boys, as I call

them, are in fact treated as deckhands instead  of

learning  how  to catch fish. They are  given  all

sorts  of  odd jobs aboard a ship to do either  in

the  way  of  carrying empty crates  or  boxes  or

crushing  ice to preserve the fish. Now,  is  this

what  you  mean by learning how to catch  fish-the

carrying of empty crates and the crushing  of  ice

or putting fish into boxes with the ice on top? Is

this what the Japanese mean by teaching us how  to

catch fish? Certainly, the Japanese do not want us

to   know  how  to  catch  fish.  So,  unless  the

Government  forces the Japanese to  give  adequate

salaries to our local boys who join their ships to

learn how to catch fish, I am quite sure that  the

response  will be very, very poor. This  state  of

affairs suits the Japanese very well because  they

do  not  want in fact the right type of people  to

come into the fishing trade. As I said, if we have

the right type of people who come into the fishing

trade, their trade will be killed by us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only suggestion I can put now, Sir, is to

compel  the  Japanese  to pay  our  boys  adequate

salaries. That is one way to encourage new methods

of   catching  fish.  Another  way,  Sir,  is   to

establish fishing schools in Singapore and  engage

Japanese  personnel to come to Singapore to  teach

our  local boys in our schools and after a certain

period  of  training or learning in  the  schools,

they will go out under the supervision of our  own

local  officers to show them how to actually catch

fish. Unless Government implements this sort of  a

scheme,  I am afraid that it will not be  able  to

introduce any new methods of catching fish so that

our boys can learn how to catch fish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next subject is on education, Sir. This time I

must give credit to the Government for having  the

foresight   to   build  more   schools   for   our

youngsters.   The   Government   must   also    be

congratulated  on its policy "of seeking  to  give

every  child the chance to have primary  education

up  to the age of 14." Education is very essential

for a country and unless



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



our  younger generation are given proper education

when they are young, then however much improvement

you  may  have  in  your  country  will  serve  no

purpose. But one thing is lacking in the policy of

the  Government and it is that, according  to  the

Governor's Speech, the primary schools being built

"will  be allocated for Malay, Chinese and English

language teaching according to the parents' choice

and  available staff." Sir, I am not an Indian but

as  multilingualism has come  to  stay,  I  cannot

understand why the Tamil language has been omitted

from  the policy of the Government. Malay, Chinese

and   English   are  given  prominence   and   the

Government will continue to give further education

in  these  three languages. What about  the  Tamil

language?  Are we going to say that  there  should

not  be any Tamil language teaching here? What  is

the  purpose of introducing multilingualism in the

Assembly, in the City Council and in the  District

Councils?  It  serves  no  purpose.  I  hope   the

Minister  for  Education will be able  to  explain

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more bouquet I may give to the Government,

and  that  is  that the University  of  Malaya  is

introducing   part-time  training   for   teaching

diplomas; but, Sir, this is not sufficient.  After

the  war Singapore has progressed considerably  in

the  construction  field.  We  can  now  see  many

skyscrapers  constructed within the  city,  and  I

understand some of them have been designed by  our

local  boys. This is another indication  that  our

local  lads  can undertake big jobs  if  they  are

given  the  chance. But what I regret  to  say  is

this - that  our  local boys have to go  abroad  for

their   architectural  training.  There   are   no

facilities  in Singapore for local  boys  to  take

degrees  in architecture and they have  to  go  to

foreign countries to learn the profession. We have

here  the  University of Malaya  and  the  Nanyang

University, and I feel that it is the Government's

responsibility   to   see  that   a   Faculty   of

Architecture should be established, either in  the

University of Malaya or the Nanyang University, at

the earliest possible date, so that our local boys

will   have  the  opportunity  of  learning   this

profession here rather than go abroad.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now wish to touch on the housing policy of the

Government.  Its  present  policy  is   that   the

Singapore Improvement Trust will be converted into

a  Development and Housing Authority. That is what

is stated in the Governor's Speech. But, Sir, this

is  not  the  first  time we  hear  of  a  Housing

Authority. We heard that more than two years  ago.

But  I  must congratulate the Government  that  at

long  last  they  are serious  in  establishing  a

Housing Authority. The people of Singapore are fed

up  with the Singapore Improvement Trust with  all

the  Iron Curtain administration behind it. Nobody

knows  what  is  happening. The points  system  in

regard  to  applications for houses is top  secret

and  known  only  to very high  officials  of  the

S.I.T.  So I want to ask: is Government  going  to

establish  this Housing Authority very  soon?  How

long  more  will it take? Two years  have  already

gone  by.  Maybe even after its term of office  we

will not have a Housing Authority. I hope that the

Government will see to the establishment  of  this

Housing  Authority without further delay, so  that

we can have it in reality and not on paper.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

after hearing the Governor's Speech I do not think

anyone will disagree with it. All that I would say

is  that  it  consists of a great  deal  of  pious

hopes, a rehash of what had been given in the last

two  Sessions. We do not want just pious hopes  or

promises  that the Government will carry out  this

or  that. What we want to hear from the Government

is,  "These are our methods. We will work them out

and produce results." There are such hopes as: "We

will increase trade. We will build more houses. We

will  have  more  home-grown food.  We  will  have

greater stability. We will offer greater incentive

to  capital  investment and so on." But  when  you

look  behind all these promises and get  to  grips

with  them, you will find that many of  them  have

very  little  substance. I  think  the  people  of

Singapore  and people outside Singapore  want  the

Government here to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



give them some concrete assurance. However, I will

come to all these subjects later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday we had a few speakers on the Governor's

Speech. One Member said that it sounded hollow and

he  had  nothing more to add to the hollowness  of

the  speech  or the promises, but he  turned  this

Assembly   into  a  sounding  board  for  election

purposes.  The  question  was  asked:   Will   the

Government hold early elections? Is the Government

serious  about holding early elections?  To  these

questions  the Member arrived at the answer  "No".

But  what  I  think is more important is  not  the

question of early elections or late elections, but

the  question of getting the machinery  ready  and

making   sure  that  Singapore  will  retain   its

democratic form of government. That, Sir,  is  the

most important thing to Singapore. If a Member  is

dissatisfied  that elections are  delayed  and  he

wants  early elections, I think the remedy  is  in

his  hands.  He has just to file a motion  in  the

Assembly asking that elections be held early,  and

I  defy any Member in this Assembly - and we have 32

Members  in  this House - to say no to that  motion.

Everyone  will say yes, and there you  are - so  any

Member  who  wants  early  elections  can  file  a

motion. There is no need to ask the Government  to

hold early elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> You pledge to say yes to the

motion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> We are more concerned with

what  form of government we will get later on.  At

present  the  Government intends  to  go  back  to

London  to  hold  another talk with  the  Colonial

Office. In fact, during the past weeks I have been

pestered by the Press who asked me, "What  do  you

know  of  the  mission? You were one of  the  five

members." I had to tell them, "No, I know  nothing

about it. I have not received any indication  from

the  Government.  I  do not  know  what  they  are

cooking.  No drafts have been circulated,  and  if

there  should be anything known, it is just  known

to the Government." As a member of the delegation,

I think I should be allowed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



into  the  secret of what is to come. I  think  in

fairness  to  all of us, we should be given  ample

notice  of what to expect. We should be acquainted

of  any changes if there are any. I can assure the

Government that, if what we are going to secure is

not  less than what we have got and it is  in  the

interests  of the people, we will go;  but  if  it

should be less than what we have got, and if it is

not in the interests of the people-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Better follow the P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> -then we may think again. But

I  assure  the House that we will not  follow  the

P.A.P.  In  fact, whichever direction  the  P.A.P.

goes, I think it is the wrong way, and we will  go

directly  opposite to that! We  have  the  classic

example  of big brothers and small brothers  being

enacted  in  Singapore. We had  the  City  Council

election  in  December and we  have  the  type  of

democracy  which  is  said to  be:  "Here  is  the

people's government. Come and have a look at  it."

I  can  only say, "God help us if we are going  to

have  the same thing repeated in the Assembly.  If

we  are  going to have in the Assembly  cat-calls,

booings   and  all  the  disturbances  that   have

occurred  in the City Council, then I  think  that

the  people's  government  will  be,  dictated  by

intimidation - intimidation  by  another   type   of

secret society. Say the wrong things and when  you

walk  out of the Assembly you will be expected  to

be beaten up. Be careful you should be escorted by

one  of  their members to the taxi, otherwise  you

get  the  worse  of it. That is not  democracy.  I

think  that  is a very poor form of government.  I

think even Communist countries have not that  form

of   government.  At  least  they  can  deliberate

whatever action they need take in quiet and peace.

With  that lead given in the City Council and  the

failures  that  have  occurred  there  one   after

another,  the small boy cried on the shoulders  of

the big brother and the big brother takes it up in

the  Assembly!  The people want  something  better

than that. The people want something more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



stable.  The  people want sane  people  to  govern

them.  The  people of Singapore want a  government

consisting of sane people and not any Tom, Dick or

Harry  picked  up  on  the  road  to  voice  their

opinions. They do not want people who clench their

fists,  shout slogans and then carry out a  policy

that is only right if they propose it! In the past

we have had experience of that sort of government.

You   must   have  trade  unions  for   collective

bargaining.  We must not suppress the workers,  or

working class, or anything you like to call  them.

They  must  be  given a chance to negotiate.  They

must  be  given  the  right to strike  for  better

conditions.  But  let  me  tell  the   people   of

Singapore, Sir, if we are going to have  the  form

of  government that is at present exhibited in the

City Council, we have heard that swift retribution

will  come  if  you  do not toe the  P.A.P. line:

"Carry  out  our orders! Be our henchmen,  or  you

will  get it in the neck!" That is not the  way  a

democratic government is run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Sir, we have also had a line or two

from  the  former Chief Minister, and I think  the

P.A.P. is  also  wise to follow  that  policy  of

calling  for All-Party committees to negotiate  on

matters  on which they have failed. Here  we  have

the  P.A.P. leader saying that there is  an  All-Party  Committee  in the City Council  negotiating

with the union to avert a strike. They say that if

the  P.A.P. should  offer 20 cents,  then  nobody

should offer more. You must all offer less! If you

offer  less, then you are against the workers!  If

you offer more, then you are wrong, you are trying

to  out-P.A.P. the P.A.P., which is  again  wrong.

What  is right? I am sure that what they want  the

people  to  do will be, "Follow us. We are  always

right."  That  is  not  the  democratic   way   of

thinking.  Anybody may be right. Let us  take  the

best  idea. If the strike takes place, the  P.A.P.

leader   pointed   to  the  Minister   for   Local

Government and said, "The trouble will be in  your

hands. Follow us again." I think that is the wrong

idea.  We  must  always try and strike  a  balance

between  the demands of the workers and  what  the

people of Singapore can take. I do not think the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P.is always right. If the P.A.P. thinks it  is

always   right,  then  do  not  appoint  All-Party

committees - go  it alone. Appoint a  committee  and

you  will find that they will again use  it  as  a

soiled rag. Anything is wrong, and all the dirt is

put  on  it.  Anything is right, and that  is  the

P.A.P.'s work! That is not at all a fair deal.  It

does not become the leader of a great Party to say

all these!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Thank you! It is a great Party!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> But that great Party, Sir, is

divided  into many smaller parties. There  is  the

Right-wing  group  and there is the  extreme  Left

group.  I  rather agree with the hon.  Member  for

Changi that our friend the hon. Member for Tanjong

Pagar belongs to the Right wing of the P.A.P. and

he  is trying to exert control over them; but  his

silence from December to March did not give  us  a

very  good picture. Neither did his Party's annual

election,  which got him into a fix - as to  whether

to  go ahead with the extreme Left or to come  out

on his own - give us a very good picture of a leader

trying  to run the Party. It seems to me that  the

Party  is  running the leader and that the  leader

will  take a cue from those who boo from the  City

Council galleries. Otherwise I am sure that sooner

or  later he will be in an unenviable position  of

being left high and dry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think for the stability of Singapore the hon.

Member  should  be persuaded to see further  ahead

and  consider  the  interests  of  the  people  of

Singapore rather than have two legs, one  on  each

boat.  If  the  two boats should run  in  opposite

directions, he will be right inside the water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the Government's policy on trade, I find

that  Singapore  is getting into a very  difficult

position.  The  Government stated  that  Singapore

exists  because  of  its  trade.  Right  from  the

beginning  of  Singapore  until  today,  everybody

knows  that Singapore exists because of its trade.

Singapore must have its entrepot trade but today I



am afraid that despite all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>



the  Government's  efforts  to  try  and  bring  a

greater volume of trade to Singapore, that  volume

is  not  increasing. I have heard very  disturbing

reports that the centre of entrepot trade  is  not

going to remain in Singapore for a very long time.

At least we will have a lot of rivals. I know that

plans  are now being put forward by large shipping

companies  and  business interests  to  shift  the

centre   of   the  entrepot  trade  to   Hongkong.

Previously  we  have all the  trade  and  all  the

transhipment  by small steamers from Singapore  to

North   Borneo,  Brunei,  Sarawak  and  the  other

islands.  Today we have transhipment from Hongkong

to these other places, and I know that notices and

circulars  have been sent round to the dealers  in

all  these islands asking them whether they  would

agree   to   transhipment  being   effected   from

Hongkong.  That is very serious, Sir, and  we  are

going to lose a great deal of that entrepot trade,

if  it  comes  to  that.  Again,  Sir,  previously

Bangkok  has  sent its produce to  Singapore  and,

thereafter,  Singapore, as a distributing  centre,

has sent the goods forward to Sumatra, Java or the

other islands. Today we have direct shipping  from

Bangkok  to  all  the other places.  This  serious

problem,  Sir,  is  not  without  cause.  Business

people  will only look towards what they  can  get

out  of  trade.  Singapore has  been  used  as  an

entrepot centre from time immemorial because it is

centrally   situated.  It  is  a  most  convenient

centre.  It  is  logical to have  Singapore  as  a

distributing  point,  with  all  the  harbour  and

transport facilities. I ask, Sir: Do we still have

these harbour and transport facilities? The answer

is yes, we still have these facilities here. Then,

Sir,  why are people shifting their entrepot trade

to  other  ports? I say the cause  lies  with  the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> You must be getting nightmares!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> The Singapore Harbour Board

has  its many troubles. It has had strikes.  There

is  a go-slow programme. All these are done in the

name of the interests of the working



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



people.  The  workers  must have  higher  pay  and

holidays.  If  they cannot get a  pass  for  their

union secretary into the Harbour Board, they  must

go  slow or go on strike. All this means delay  in

handling  goods, higher storage costs  and  higher

handling costs. Soon we find that business  people

are  not quite ready to take all that. We are  not

dealing with people inside the colony that we  can

control. We are dealing with people in independent

countries. Whether to use Singapore or  any  other

port  is within their right. They have the choice.

If they choose Singapore, they will use Singapore.

If  they  choose Hongkong, they will use Hongkong.

Because  of  the things happening here,  they  are

slowly  trying  to find whether  they  can  choose

another  substitute port instead of Singapore.  To

the  workers  what benefit have we given  them  by

such  actions? Today the volume of trade  will  go

down. Tomorrow it will be less. Soon you will find

that  the  labourers, instead of getting a  bigger

pay  packet,  will  have nothing  to  bring  home.

Unemployment  will surely come. Those  who  handle

cargoes  in the Harbour Board will have  a  little

bit more, but for the many other unfortunates, the

Social Welfare public assistance scheme will  have

to  go into higher gear to assist them. These  are

the  doings  of the P.A.P., and for  the  good  of

Singapore!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is a very important point, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I am not giving way, Sir. On

a  matter like this, Sir, the P.A.P. and all other

politicians  must  act sanely.  If  they  want  to

increase  the earnings of the workers,  they  must

not  increase  their earnings today and  make  the

earnings diminish as the days go by. If they  want

to  assist  the workers, they must try and  create

more employment so that the workers will have jobs

and  pay,  and  sooner  or later  their  pay  will

increase.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another contributing factor

regarding the shifting of this entrepot trade.  We

know that we have to create certain facilities for

Singapore.  If we cannot cheapen labour,  then  we

must use mechanised equipment in order to get over

this.  Furthermore,  Singapore  must  provide  all

facilities  which  are required for  its  entrepot

trade.  We must have a good system of shipping  to

other   places.  We  must  encourage   our   local

shipping. If we can have local shipping brought to

a  high  degree of efficiency, then  we  have  the

facilities  for the people of other  countries  to

come  to Singapore. Our local ships may be few  in

number, but we have to make a start somewhere.  We

are not starting badly. We have quite a number  of

local  ships. Let the Government assist our  local

shipping so that its fate will be in our hands and

not  in  the  hands of other people who  establish

their  business here. Help our local  shipping  to

have more cargoes to send out. Keep them alive. If

we  do  that, we will build them up. If we have  a

few ships today, we will have more ships later on.

It  will  not only help these shipping lines,  but

incidentally it will also provide employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always urged the Minister for Commerce and

Industry to think of establishing a merchant navy.

That  is what Singapore wants. If we can establish

it,  it  will  go a long way to keep the  entrepot

trade  going.  If we cannot establish  a  merchant

navy, then at least find ways and means of keeping

our  local shipping alive. After all, if the ships

are  registered here, all that they earn will come

back  to  Singapore. We will be  grateful  if  the

Minister  for  Commerce  and  Industry  will  take

concrete steps to help our own local people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in the matter of trade, we must have

many  parties.  We simply cannot depend  on  other

people choosing to make use of Singapore. We  must

at  least  adopt some of the tactics of  insurance

agents.  Many of them come along very persistently

selling their policies to customers. Some  of  the

customers want to buy and some do not, but in many

cases  when  you  have  a very  skilful  insurance

agent, he invariably persuades



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



his  "victims" to buy policies. Let us adopt  that

tactic. Establish trade missions in all the places

where we can trade with, where we think we will be

able to get goods from them or send goods to them.

If  we do not have the money to establish missions

there,  we  can follow the example of the  Israeli

Government  appointing somebody here to  be  their

honorary consul. We can at least approach somebody

and  ask  him,  "Will you act  for  us  there  and

promote our trade?" If we set up missions  in  the

countries  we  trade with, we  can  publicise  the

facilities we have here and it means a great  deal

when   we   have   publicity.  For   example,   in

publicising our facilities, we can also  publicise

tourism.  If suggestions like this are adopted,  I

am sure they will go a long way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have heard from the Government that they

are going to promote industries and that they will

establish an Industrial Promotion Board. They  say

they  will  assist the industries, especially  the

small  ones  with no capital, but I find  that  in

practice  they have not done much. They  have  not

even  touched  on the fringes. If  the  Industrial

Promotion Board is going to do good work, then  it

must  not  act  like  a  bank - "Show  us  all  your

securities; show us that you have money,  so  that

we  may lend you money." It is bound to fail. That

is  the  work of banks. But for industrial boards,

Government should know whether a certain  type  of

industry is going to prosper and whether  it  will

help  the  people of Singapore. If  Government  is

convinced that it will assist them, the best thing

for  Government  to do is to initiate  a  move  to

start  such  an  industry. If,  however,  such  an

industry  is  already in existence and  Government

knows  that it will not make a loss but instead  a

profit,  then  Government should help  it  in  the

proper manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said in this Assembly sometime ago that

certain  industries have been affected,  like  the

shoe factories, the beehoon factories, the biscuit

factories   and  others.  They  need  help.   Have

Government helped them? The Minister for  Commerce

and Industry has promised to help them. Have these

industries received



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



such help? I shall be glad if I can have an

answer  to  that,  and I shall  be  glad  also  if

Government will confirm that they have not  helped

them. Why have they not helped them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Sembawang today, Sir, you have a station

called the Sembawang Experimental Station to  help

farmers  rear their poultry, to help pig  breeders

and  vegetable farmers. But I think  it  would  be

better to put all these experiments into practice.

Today we still have a lot of vacant land that  may

not  be  used  for short periods of time  or  long

periods  of time. We will say that there might  be

pieces of vacant land which have been lying vacant

for  15  years, but nothing is going  to  be  done

about them, because Government is having a plan to

build  a hospital or houses on them! But I believe

that  whenever  Government  have  plans  to  build

houses  or anything on vacant land, they will  not

be  able  to  do it immediately, but a  long  time

after. If in the intervening period we could allow

that piece of vacant land to be made use of by the

farmers living around there, at least it will be a

practical   way  of  increasing  food  production,

instead  of  Government  just  saying,  "We   will

increase  food production." In places where  plots

of  vacant  land are available - and  I  know  there

are - the  farmers should be given fixed  tenure  of

occupation  of  the land. The Government  have  of

course  built  experimental roads  for  all  these

farmlands, but I think more of such roads could be

built in order to help the farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Budget sittings I said that one

direction  in  which  the  Government  could  help

Singapore in food production would be fisheries. I

was  disappointed  that the  Government  have  not

licensed more deep-sea fishing companies to go and

operate in deep-sea fishing to catch more fish. In

fact,  many applications for licences for deep-sea

fishing  were  turned  down.  I  think  once   the

enthusiasm of the applicants is gone, it  will  be

difficult  to  ask them to come back  and  operate

again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest to Government that it we cannot

get  our  local  capital  interested  in  such   a

project, then we invite foreign capital. More fish

will be landed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



here; at least our boys can be trained in deep-sea

fishing. At least we will have a percentage of the

earnings.  All  in  all,  Sir,  Government  should

candidly tell the people, "We will help trade  and

industry." We may not have original ideas  but  we

can  follow  our neighbours. We can declare,  like

the  Federation or Sarawak, tax holidays  for  new

projects. We can allow a percentage of the  profit

to  be remitted back to the land where the capital

comes from. We should also be prepared to take  on

our hands a survey of our needs so that we may  be

able to advise people who are interested to invest

money here. It is no use telling the people, "Come

and  put your money into Singapore." What  to  put

in?  What do we need? And I think our needs cannot

be  ascertained until we have had that survey  and

until  we have a permanent office to advise people

who  are interested. There are, I can assure  you,

plenty  of people who have money but just  do  not

know  what  best to be done with it and  where  to

seek advice. If you publicise that section of  the

Ministry which can give advice, at least that will

help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way would be to insert in the Press a

note informing people that if they are prepared to

come  here and start new industries, we  have  the

land available, as shown in Map A, or B or C,  for

whichever purpose. That will save these  people  a

lot  of  trouble in having to find land  to  build

their factories; but one factor may not be in  the

hands of the Government, because they always  deny

responsibility for that, and that is  the  passing

of  plans  for factories and houses.  That  matter

comes  within  the jurisdiction of the  department

which  everybody complains about, and that is  the

Singapore Improvement Trust.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed on Question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, I was talking

about the Singapore Improvement Trust. I think  it

has  been  most  obstructive with  regard  to  the

building of factories and houses. I have never yet

heard  of anybody in Singapore saying a good  word

about  the S.I.T. Whenever any plan gets into  the

S.I.T.,  you can count the months before it  comes

out again.



<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Member</b>: Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> In fact, in many cases, the

plans get into the S.I.T. and come out again  with

a  request about some slight alterations and  then

they  get in again for another period of time  and

out  again. In this manner, it has caused a  great

deal  of  delay.  I  know  of  one  factory  which

submitted  a  plan  for  a  factory  and  workers'

quarters and the S.I.T. asked them to draw a  line

as  a  demarcation  between the  factory  and  the

quarters for a playground for the children. It has

gone  inside there for months just for the drawing

of a line - an imaginary line for the demarcation

of  a playground-and it has not yet come out. This

is what I call an unnecessary delay which is aimed

at  discouraging these people from pushing on with

their job and acting contrary to what the Minister

for  Commerce  and Industry (Mr J.  M.  Jumabhoy)

said  about  encouraging  local  industries.  More

serious than that, Sir, is that Singapore needs  a

lot of houses and we not only need the building of

houses  for the people by Government but  also  by

private  enterprise.  Yet we  find  the  Singapore

Improvement  Trust insisting on  its  own  way  of

having  the  houses built. We know that  Singapore

has  got  very little land. We want to  build  the

houses cheap so as to bring them within the  reach

of  those  who can afford to buy them and  yet  in

Bulim Estate, the S.I.T. says, "You may build only

one  house on one acre of land. For every acre  of

land,  you  can  build only one house  and  not  a

housing estate." That scheme



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



was  abandoned  by the builder. What  nonsense  is

this,  Sir,  obstructing the people to build  more

houses  when the S.I.T. itself cannot  build  more

for  the  people of Singapore! I know  of  another

instance  in  Ponggol.  A person  wants  to  build

houses  for  a few thousand dollars  and  yet  the

S.I.T. says, "You must have double the  land  for

each house or else your plans will not be passed."

And  that means a great deal more money for  those

few  who want to buy them. Again, that scheme  was

shelved.  In  such  instances, Sir,  I  think  the

S.I.T. is not acting in accordance with the policy

laid   down  by  the  Government.  It  is   acting

contrariwise. It is not assisting in  the  housing

programme. Yet when questions of this sort are put

to  the  Minister for Housing, (Inche Abdul Hamid)

the  reply  is  that  the S.I.T. is  out  of  his

control.  If  the S.I.T. is going to act  in  this

manner,  then  I  think it is high  time  that  it

should  be  re-organised  with  saner  people  put

there. In fact, I think in the S.I.T., the passing

of  plans, etc, is all in the hands of one  single

person.  He has the say as to what Singapore  must

do  and what Singapore must not do. All the  plans

are  in  the  hands of one man. One man  can  say,

"Yes" to the whole plan; one man can say, "No"  to

the  whole  plan.  That does not  make  sense!  At

least, Sir, if it were a Board which has come to a

conclusion after some consideration, it  might  be

said  that they had thought about it but  to  have

one  man  controlling the destiny of Singapore  in

the  matter  of housing, I think it  is  really  a

shame  that we should be prevented from  providing

more houses or encouraging more people to come and

establish factories in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I turn on to some more pleasant aspects

of  Government work. I must say that the  Ministry

of  Education has done a good job. It has  started

night  classes for those overage people who cannot

attend  day classes. It has opened up new  avenues

for those who cannot ordinarily study right up  to

Senior Cambridge or Chinese Middle III to study in

the  evening  to  bring their education  up  to  a

general standard.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



That is good. It has given the parents a choice of

schools in which their children can go to. I think

that  is  a  sane step. But it must do more.  This

morning  we  passed amendments to the Penal  Code,

all  aimed at getting at the gangsters. There will

be  no gangsters or they will die out if they  get

no recruits and the recruits that they are getting

now are those people who cannot attend schools and

who  have nothing to do. I suggest, Sir, that this

serious  problem should be tackled not  only  from

the  point  of view of strengthening our  laws  to

deal  with  the  criminals but also with  positive

action by the Government to help them. In column 8

of the Governor's Speech, you will read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To provide for the leisure of Singapore's

youthful  population, a large expansion  in  youth

clubs  and  youth  organisation is  in  hand,  and

training courses are being given in Chinese, Malay

and English."



<br><br>Of  course,  this paragraph does not give  further

details. I would say that this is the type of work

that  is done by the voluntary organisation called

the Federation of Boys' Clubs. This is the work of

that  voluntary  organisation in conjunction  with

the  Government  and I say that this  organisation

can  do  more  and will do more if the  Government

will co-operate with them. I believe that not only

must  we allow the young people places like  clubs

and organisations to train them in games and other

things  but  we can also start vocational  courses

whereby  a boy can be taught a trade. I  think  if

these boys can be taught a trade, then instead  of

frequenting undesirable places, they will be  able

to  learn something. A boy who cannot go to school

any  further and who has no aptitude to learn will

be able to learn something that will help him make

a living. I have suggested this scheme tentatively

to  the  Ministry and if they feel  that  this  is

useful  enough  to be pursued, I  am  prepared  to

pursue  it further and assist the young people  of

Singapore  to  help  themselves.  That   will,   I

believe,  Sir, lessen the burden on Government  in

having   to  have  more  police  to  get  rid   of gangsters.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the matter of the other Ministries, Sir, I

just  want  to touch upon the Ministry of  Health.

Government may have tried its best but I find that

out-door  dispensaries and clinics are  still  not

sufficient.  A  large number of  people  going  to

these  clinics  have to wait for a long  time  and

many are forced to go to private practitioners not

because  they  have the money but because  of  the

inconvenience they experience when  they  ask  for

treatment.  If Government will also see  to  this,

then  I  think it will assist the people who  need

such attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, Sir, I believe that the policy as

outlined  in  the  Governor's  Speech  should   be

supported  by  Government  with  actions  and   if

actions  are forthcoming, we expect to see greater

progress  and  satisfaction from the  public  this year.



<br><br>2.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   I   am  amazed  at  the  omission  in   His

Excellency's Speech of any reference to  the  City

Council.  Sir, it has now occurred to  Members  of

the  Assembly that the City Council has become the

centre  of the Government. The City Council  today

is   what  this  Assembly  was  in  1955.  It   is

unfortunate  that  nothing was  mentioned  in  the

Governor's  Speech  as to whether  the  Government

approves or disapproves the activities of the City

Council.  In  spite  of  the  Minister  for  Local

Government,  Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul  Hamid

bin  Haji Jumat), the City Council, in my opinion,

is  doing  a magnificent job. When I say the  City

Council  is the centre of the Government,  I  mean

that the City Councillors do not plan to go to the

United   Kingdom  on  pleasure  trips  on  various

pretexts of Government business or plan to  settle

down  in  various countries immediately they  lose

the next elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I want to bring forward is that

the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister  referred  to  the

"Marshall" law. He said that had it not  been  for

the  "Marshall" law, the subversive elements would

have  been  all over Singapore. It is a matter  of

regret  to  me  that the Member for Tanjong  Pagar

(Mr Lee Kuan Yew) did



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>



not  thank  Mr  Marshall for the "Marshall"  law.

Because  of  this "Marshall" law, the  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar was able to get rid of some  of  the

true,  democratic  and national  elements  of  his

Party in the name of subversion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For two years, sir, we sat here listening to the

speeches  of the Member for Tanjong Pagar  of  the

honesty  of the Party leadership, the same  leader

who  sat  back  and  saw  his  closest  colleagues

imprisoned  and  did not take  any  action  except

lament,  and  after seeing that, he  followed  the

executioners  to London and, signed the  so-called

tiga suku merdeka. He was not able to fight a  by-election   when   his  closest   colleagues   were

imprisoned, even as a protest, but he was  willing

to  fight  a  by-election to defend  the  colonial

constitution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> The people voted for him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Yes, the people voted for him and

he  was able to win the by-election only with  the

tiga  suku  support  of the gangsters  because  he

signed  the  constitution and came here  and  said

that he had signed only a tiga suku merdeka..

<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Yes, a challenge. Sir, for the last

two  years whenever there was a chance, the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar used to mention about political

spoils.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



have  noticed that the leadership is not here.  It

is  somewhere else and you will all agree with  me

not in this Assembly!

<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

normally sitting on this side of the House, we are

expected  to criticise the Government. I  for  one

believe  that credit should be given where  credit

is  due.  The Labour Front Government despite  all

its  faults has done not too badly under difficult

circumstances. The Member for Tanjong Pagar whom I

respect,  Sir, has lately been very  boastful.  He

has  challenged every other Party in Singapore and

believes  that  the  P.A.P. will  win  the   next

elections. If I am not mistaken, I think  he  also

said  that not only the P.A.P. will win  but  will

also win in every division. That I think is a  bit too much.

minds of the general public. Singapore, I am sure,

will  be  in a very sorrowful state if the  P.A.P.

were  to  win the next general elections.  I  hope

that the people of Singapore will now wake up  and

realise that their common enemy as was supposed to

be  in the past is not the Liberal-Socialist Party

but  the P.A.P. As the merits and demerits of  the

Governor's  Speech have already been expressed  by

other  Members of this Assembly, I will not  touch

on it any more but I feel very strongly, Sir, that

we  must not criticise the Government just for the

sake  of  criticism. We should have enough courage

to give them credit if they have done well.



<br><br>2.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  think the leader of my Party has  covered

His  Excellency's  Speech  quite  comprehensively.

However,  there  is  one very short  paragraph  on

which I would like to comment. The paragraph is in

column 7 which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The drive to produce more home grown food will

receive further impetus when the Sembawang Station

starts  operating and as the results  of  research

now  being  carried  out  are  made  available  to

farmers."



<br><br>Sir,  I think just telling the farmer how best  to

grow  vegetables  is  not  good  enough.  Sympathy

without relief is like mustard without beef. It is

no  use demonstrating to the farmer the wonders of

a  mechanical plough when he cannot afford to  own

one.  Having  lived  since  childhood  among   the

farmers,  I  can  say,  Sir,  that  if  a   little

financial assistance can be given to the  farmers,

it will go a long way towards helping them. If the

farmers'  financiers commonly called  shop-keepers

can  allow credit to the farmers without  security

at least the Government can give out small loans

<br><br>2.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Siak Kew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Siak Kew (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have   heard   with  interest  so  many   speeches

yesterday  and today on the Governor's Speech.  It

appears to me that none of these speeches have any

substantial criticism to offer the Government  and

in  fact  most  of  them support the  Government's

policy, though with some advice or other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Government having realised that

Singapore exists because of its trade has  already

hit  the nail on the head and I think they are  on

the  right path. The possibility of trade  depends

on  the  confidence and stability of the  currency

and   the   Government's  assurance  on  this   is

particularly  welcome. If trade  is  possible,  it

will enable us to have the revenue to finance  all

our planned measures - social, welfare, educational,

health, housing and all other measures - designed to

uplift  or  to  maintain  the  well-being  of  our

people.  Furthermore, it affords a living  to  the

capitalists,  businessmen, clerks,  labourers  and

professional men. Therefore, it could be seen that

the importance of trade to Singapore is paramount.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government intends to encourage trade and

industry  and everybody knows that this is  right.

The  success  or  failure  of  these  measures  of



encouragement is however dependent, to my mind, on

the mechanics of how this encouragement is to take

place.  Government  is  aware  of  the  increasing

population  and  it  is very  eager  to  encourage

industries   to   supplement   our   all-important

entrepot  trade. It has established an  Industrial

Promotion  Board  and it is now proposed  "to  re-organise and strengthen the industrial section  of

the  Ministry  of  Commerce and Industry  and  the

possibility   of  the  present  Industrial   Board

actively assisting in the promotion of large scale



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



industries".  We  know, Sir, that  the  Industrial

Promotion  Board was initially put up  to  promote

small  industries. No doubt, the  intention  there

was  good.  However, what the Industrial Promotion

Board is really doing and how successful it is  in

this  field is very little known. Any  one  of  us

with  experience will know that the setting up  of

industries   is   only   possible   through    the

determination and readiness for hard work and  can

only  be  maintained by continued hard work.  Only

then, can they be able to maintain their existence

from day to day and from hand to mouth. There  are

many  industries  which we  know  are  practically

impossible  to introduce in Singapore  because  of

acute  competition from outside both in efficiency

and  in labour costs which are disadvantageous  to

us.  Therefore,  there  is  a  danger  that  these

Government  Boards having been set up  would  find

themselves in fact being unable to do anything and

because  they try to justify themselves  of  their

existence  would be spoon-feeding  some  of  these

industries   without  properly  ascertaining   the

necessary efficiency and willingness for hard work

of  the  owners. I have some experience  of  this,

Sir,  and  I  can  quote one  Rubber  Packing  and

Shipping Board which is still existing and  which,

in  many  people's opinion, is quite  unjustified.

Therefore, these Boards, if unnecessarily put  up,

are  a  burden  to  the taxpayer  because  of  the

additional  administrative expenses  and  in  this

connection, as I have just expressed myself to  be

apprehensive  about,  we  have  the   failure   of

R.I.D.A. in  the  Federation  which  is   another

example.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the entrepot trade, Sir, I think this

trade  was  built, as in many industries,  by  the

sheer  hard work of the people and in fact by  the

vast  majority  of the businessmen here  who  were

originally  either clerks or labourers themselves.

It  is because of our facilities here, of our fine

harbour  and of the services given by our banking.

insurance,   storage   and   especially   by   our

businessmen who through long years have learned to

re-process  whatever raw produce we get  from  the

neighbouring territories to suit the world markets



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



that   Singapore  has  now  attained  its  present

status. Government has expressed that it would try

its  best "to encourage entrepot trade". This,  of

course,  is very good also, but I think the  basis

for  the entrepot trade has been built because  of

the free enterprise and the profit incentive which

have  encouraged people to take some risk. I think

that   where   Government  interference   is   not

necessary in the matter of encouragement it should

refrain  as far as possible from meddling  in  the

entrepot trade and allow the traders to do it  for

themselves. One thing however which Government can

immediately  help very much in the maintenance  of

this entrepot trade is to see that a fair rate  of

freight  is being accorded to Singapore.  We  know

that  we  depend very much on shipping. Now,  some

time ago, we had the very disturbing spectacle  of

seeing - I will quote one particular commodity - copra

going  from the Philippines to Europe at the  rate

of  110  shillings  per ton whereas  the  shipping

conference  here was still charging us  241s.  6d.

per  ton. Of course, representations were made and

the rate was reduced at one stage to 184 shillings

and  now  to 136 shillings a ton which is still  a

long  way above the freight rate of other  places.

There  has been the question as to why copra  does

not  come here. In the ordinary course of trading,

in  such  circumstances, copra will not come  here

because  if  it  comes  here,  it  cannot  all  be

consumed  internally and even if  it  were  turned

into  oil,  it would still have to be  re-exported

with that handicap in freight to pay. So there  is

a  very great danger that Singapore's trade  would

be  at  the mercy and in the firm grip of shipping

conferences.  We know that there is  a  world-wide

recession in shipping freights but we have not yet

noticed  that freight charges either  to  or  from

Singapore  have been reduced. Another instance  in

this  connection is that I heard one  hon.  Member

mention  this morning about local shipping:  there

was  a  lot  of  produce which used to  come  from

places like Borneo



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



and  Indonesia and landed here and which  was  re-processed  and  shipped to  Europe.  The  shipping

companies  now  are enabling this  produce  to  be

shipped  direct  on a through bill  of  lading  to

Europe,  but using the free services of  Singapore

harbour  storage to enable them to do so. This  is

the  most  important thing which I would like  the

Government  to  look into if  we  are  not  to  be

gradually cut off from our entrepot trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now coming to the elections next year or this

year,  from  the businessman's point  of  view,  I

should  say that business would have to  take  any

Government   that   comes  in.   In   fact,   most

businessmen have not much interest as to who is to

govern  next but they would certainly like to  see

that,  whichever Party comes into power, it has  a

sense  of  responsibility  as  expressed  in   the

Governor's  Speech - a sense of  responsibility  to

the  livelihood of all the people here and not  to

one  section of the people. As I say, most of  the

businessmen  have built up their  businesses  here

from  scratch.  Most  of them were  labourers  and

clerks  before.  By dint of hard work,  they  were

able  to  achieve whatever they have  now  and  if

there   is  any  sign  that  Singapore  would   be

destroyed because of politics, then those who  are

most able to - the biggest ones - will be running away

and  those  who cannot afford to run  away,  I  am

quite sure, will fight for their lives. Therefore,

I  should like all political Parties to bear  this

point   in  mind,  that  the  livelihood  of   the

people - capitalists, the average  businessman,  and

every section of the people - should be guarded  and

not  destroyed.  If  it were destroyed,  not  only

would  the present capital not be maintained  here

but  outside capital would surely not be attracted

here.   Besides,  as  I  said,  Singapore  thrives

because of its services - the harbour, shipping  and

storage.  If  the services of these establishments

were  driven to be priced out of the world market,

then  there would surely be no trade here  and  if

there  is  no  trade here then everybody  will  be

losing their livelihood.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

there  is nothing in His Excellency's Speech which

is  praiseworthy or brings out any achievements of

the present minority Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the present Governor - the third Governor

during  the  last three years of Government  by  a

Coalition  regime - we have an experienced  man  who

has  been in the previous Legislative Council  and

in  the present Assembly. He has been promoted  to

the  governorship of this island and he knows  the

pulse of every Member in this Assembly through his

experience and mixing with us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I comment on the Speech, I was rather

amused  at  the  remarks of  the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister  (Dr  Lim Yew Hock) on his  ex-boss  and

also much more amused by the remarks of the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) against  his

co-partners on all the important issues during the

last   three  years.  Something  has  gone   wrong

somewhere; I do not know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Perhaps you want to be the third Chief Minister!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> But one thing is certain; such

alliances do not mean stability of the Government.

They  become friends, break off, attack,  do  this

and do that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, coming to the new constitution in His

Excellency's Speech - I believe that this  has  been

agreed  to by the last All-Party delegation  which

went  to  England - it  is a wonder  why  the  three

political  Parties  have not  pressed  the  United

Kingdom to send this new constitution earlier.  It

was the duty not of the Labour Front, because they

would like to govern as long as they can, but as a

duty the Opposition Parties could have pressed for

it  if they had wanted to. However, we are assured

by  the  Hon. the Chief Minister that we  will  be

getting a copy of the new constitution by the  end

of  this  month. Now, Sir, it is idle to  talk  of

this  new constitution because it has been  agreed

to  already. This new constitution keeps Singapore

still as a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



colony  and  introduces  only  some  high-sounding

words.  As I have said before, we have no  control

of  external affairs, foreign policy or defence in

our  hands. We cannot even have trade and cultural

relations  with  other countries unless  with  the

consent  of the United Kingdom Government.  But  I

would  still  advise that we accept  this  as  the

future   basis  to  secure  our  independence   by

ourselves, or by the coincidence of a new war,  or

possibly by the establishment of a Commonwealth of

Asian nations which might help us later; otherwise

there is no salvation and we have to remain as  we

are.  Sir, I hope that there will be no more delay

and   that  we  shall  get  the  new  constitution

immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to the subject of union with the

Federation,  it is inevitable. Everybody  believes

it and knows it but it is not possible at present.

Everybody knows that too, why go on harping on the

same  subject  every  time?  The  Hon. the  Chief

Minister remarked that both territories are inter-dependent. I think that this is a fallacy;  it  is

not   correct.  Singapore  is  dependent  on   the

Federation,  but not the Federation on  Singapore.

Why  say  something that is displeasing  to  them?

What  for?  We have no raw materials of  our  own.

Whatever  we  get  is from other  countries,  more

especially  from the Federation, such  as  rubber,

tin,  copra, oil, and so on. They can  ship  their

commodities  direct.  Even the  limited  companies

formed  here for rubber and tin, as time goes  by,

will shift to their place of origin, that is,  the

Federation, where production takes place.  So  our

position  is  dependent on the Federation  and  we

have  to  consider  the Federation  as  our  elder

brother  and continue to humour them  as  long  as

possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the subject of elections, I will leave

this important subject to the last in my speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming, Sir, to the achievements of the present

Coalition  Government, I do not think  that  there

has  been  any  of an extraordinary  nature.  What

progress  has been made in health, education,  and

so on was either laid down in the policy of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>



the  previous Government and it is the duty of the

Government - or  whoever  is  in  power   for   that

matter - to continue the progress made, and they are

paid for it very well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to entrepot trade, my good friend the

new  Nominated Member (Mr Tan Siak Kew) has given

good  advice.  He has had a lot of  experience  in

trade  for  many, many years. I myself  have  been

watching  the  entrepot trade since  the  last  44

years  in Singapore. We have lived on the entrepot

trade and if we want to exist, we have got to live

only  by the entrepot trade. We should try to keep

it  so,  but  as I have said before in  this  very

House  time and again that the countries who  have

become independent have direct trade treaties with

producing, or manufacturing countries and that  it

is cheaper for them to avoid Singapore. Further if

the costs are very high, we are certainly going to

lose  the entrepot trade. This trade can  only  be

maintained by a stable Government and not by an un

stable Government as it is at present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, people talk about industries and foreign

capital. Will any one come and invest his  capital

over here with all these troubles existing in this

little   city   of  Singapore  plus  an   unstable

Government?  Why  should anybody  come  here?  Why

should  foreign capital come here at  all?  Unless

you   create  a  favourable  climate  for  foreign

industrialists  to  come over here,  there  is  no

reason for them to do so. On the other hand,  Sir,

even  if  an industry is started, as I  said,  the

basic  need  for our products is cheap labour  and

production should be cheap so that we can  compete

with  other producing countries and this  is  most

difficult over here. But we can certainly  do  one

thing and that is this: we can encourage the women

or  unemployed people or their children in cottage

industries. We can let them have a marketing board

and  give them advances, and so on. That will keep

the  wolf from the door of the unemployed. But  to

talk big is nothing but nonsense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one gentleman on this side of the House

touched  on local coastal shipping. Local  coastal

shipping  means  ships  owned  by  the  people  of

Singapore or who at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



least  own 51 per cent of the capital. If that  is

so, any government of any country - of course it has

to be an independent country - will have legislation

so  that  no other foreign ships will be  able  to

engage in the coastal trade except those owned  by

its  own  country.  It  is then  only  that  local

shipping  can  thrive. I do  not  think  that  the

colony is in this position at present. Possibly, a

fully  elected Government in September  this  year

may  be  able  to  devise  means  by  which  local

shipping can flourish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, His Excellency has never mentioned the date

of  the  next General Elections in his speech.  In

September  1956, when the Hon. the  present  Chief

Minister (Dr Lim Yew Hock) took office he told us

that   his   Government  was  only   a   caretaker

Government with the knowledge that he had only ten

elected  Members on his side as against 15 elected

Members  in the Opposition. He has only 15 Members

in  all on his side as against 17 on this side  of

the House. Of course, they had the private support

of  the P.A.P. Besides nobody else was willing  to

take  charge of the Government for a short period.

We  also  wanted  to give them  a  chance  in  the

constitutional  talks  and we  wished  them  `good

luck'.  But, Sir, a caretaker Government does  not

mean  that it should continue in office  from  6th

September, 1956 up till now - not one day, one week

or  one year, but nearly two years now - and it  now

seeks  to  extend its office from  September  this

year  to  next March. In his own words,  Sir,  the

Chief  Minister promised that the elections  would

definitely be held in April this year and then  to

a question put by an hon. Member on this side, the

then Hon. the Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode)

said that the elections would be held in August or

September this year. Now, Sir, what is the  reason

for  the  delay?  We all know  that  many  of  the

Members of this House who are drawing from $500 to

$3,500 a month will not be here any more. Is their

lust for power so great that they want to harm the

country  by  sticking to their posts  as  long  as

possible?  Sir, the controversy which I have  read

about in the Press is this,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



and His Excellency has also mentioned it. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The time-table will depend on the preparation

and  enactment  of  the  necessary  constitutional

instruments and legislation



<br><br>If  the  caretaker  Government were  honest,  they

could   have   introduced  all  this   legislation

earlier. Why wait?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, District Council elections were to

have  been held in March, but now they are  to  be

held  in  June. Why? It is the people's  wish  and

nobody can prevent them from voting one way or the

other.  It  is for them to choose, but  for  God's

sake, elect a stable government, whatever Party it

may be. We want stability, and the public will  at

least  know  that  they have  to  deal  with  this

Government  only,  and they are waiting  for  that

day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first phase of the Labour Front

Coalition  Government has been murder,  riots  and

strikes.  The  second phase has  been  travelling,

self-publicity  and talking.  I  do  not  see  any

achievements - they  are  nil.  If  they  have  done

anything good, well, it is their duty.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That is first-class!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> They are paid for it! The public

pay them for it. There is no credit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the subject of education, I am glad the

Member  for Queenstown brought up the question  of

the  omission of the Tamil language.  I  hope  the

Minister for Education will take note of this - that

he  should be fair to all the languages which have

been  accepted by this House and, if education  is

to be given, it must be given equally to all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is driving out trade and

industry,  and is keeping the people in  suspense.

It  is  best for the Government to take  steps  to

hold  the elections in September. Three months  or

six months of sticking to their posts will do them

more harm than good.



<br><br>3.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  it  is rather regrettable that I,  the  only

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Two holes!



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> No, because I believe the ship

two  subjects which I believe I know  quite  well.

Another reason is that I believe this is the  only

way  I  can  voice  my opinion with  any  hope  of

effect, because my past pleadings to the Ministers

have been falling on deaf ears.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two subjects which I am going to raise are

the  Singapore  Improvement Trust and  the  Public

Works  Department. The Governor in his  speech  on

22nd April, 1955, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To further the carrying out of public housing

and slum clearance, legislation will be introduced

to  set  up  a  Housing Authority to  replace  the

Singapore Improvement Trust."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 29th August, 1956, the Governor in his speech

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Public housing development has hitherto been

slowed  down. To carry out this building programme,

the  Singapore Improvement Trust will be  replaced

by a Housing Authority."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 9th April, 1958, the Governor in his

speech said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To carry out future building programmes, the

Singapore Improvement Trust will be converted into

a  Development and Housing Authority and  planning

duties will be dealt with separately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has only 225 square miles of land.

Population  at present is 6,600 per  square  mile,

and  may  by  1967  be  10,000  per  square  mile.

Consequently, long-term planning is  necessary  to

make  sure that all land is used in the  best  way

and not wasted."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is already three years since the Governor

promised  this  House  that  legislation  will  be

introduced  to  have  a new Housing  and  Planning

Authority, and today, three years later, we  still

have  that kind of promise; and if we survive  the

elections next year, it is quite possible the same

thing  might be repeated in the Governor's  Speech

again.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to deal with the Singapore

Improvement Trust. I endorse everything  that  has

been  said  by the Member for Serangoon about  the

S.I.T.  They  are the most obstructive,  the  most

corrupted organisation one can ever expect to have

in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Shame on the Government!



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> This corruption did not start

only  after  the war. It started even  before  the

war. I am sure everyone will remember how the then

Manager  of  the Singapore Improvement  Trust  was

conveniently found drowned beside the reservoir at

the   height  of  the  investigation  into   Capt.

Loveday's  corruption, and today, with development

more  than ten times that of pre-war, one can come

to  the  conclusion of the kind of harm the S.I.T.

has done to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Improvement Trust is the Housing

Authority  as  well as the Planning Authority  for

Singapore. Let us start with the Housing Authority

first. I am not going to be so unkind as Dr  Foch

who  has  criticised the housing  put  up  by  the

Singapore Improvement Trust as being monotonous. I

think,  on the whole, it is not so badly designed.

But  what  I would like to say is that the  S.I.T.

are  most unrealistic. They are talking of  having

two  bedrooms,  a sitting-room, a  dining-room,  a

kitchen  and everything for the people. Yes,  very

good,  I agree, but can you provide enough  units?

With  the limited resources the S.I.T. has at  its

command,  how many hundreds of years do you  think

the S.I.T. would take to provide anything near  to

the  requirements of the people? Sir, I have  seen

housing  throughout the world. If the S.I.T. were

more  realistic,  I think they should  adopt  some

things  that  Hongkong has done. I would  not  say

their's is the best way of housing people, but the

housing authorities in Hongkong are more realistic

and  they  can cater for a much bigger  number  of

people  than can the S.I.T. today. The people  are

being housed in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



single   units - by  single  units,  I  mean  single

rooms - an  area of 10 feet by 12 feet, with  common

kitchens and bathrooms. I do agree that is not the

best  way of doing it, but it is a practical  way.

With  the  same  amount of  money  you  can  house

possibly  four  families instead  of  one  family.

Until  you  can do better, why not give them  that

type  of  housing today, instead  of  having,  for

instance, the recent fire at Lorong 3? And  if  we

are not going to do anything, we may have many  of

these  Lorong  3  fires to come. They  had  one  a

couple  of  years  ago, they  have  had  one  very

recently, and they may have many more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> God forbid!



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Whether God forbids or not, it

is  a  fact we must face. I can imagine  what  the

S.I.T. are thinking about. They say, "We will plan

an  ideal  town. We can possibly get a few  medals

from  the Town Planning Society." But they  forget

that  these medals are stained with the  blood  of

the  people  of Singapore and that their  children

will  be only too pleased to get rid of them.  The

S.I.T. just want idealism. What do they care  for

the  people of Singapore? They will go  away  very

soon from here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now about the Planning Authority, as the Member

for Serangoon has said, they are most obstructive.

We  know  very well, as I said a moment ago,  that

with  the  limited resources at its  command,  the

Government will never expect to solve the  housing

problem  for  Singapore for  generations  to  come

without assistance from the general public. So  it

is  only to be expected that an organisation  like

the  S.I.T. should assist in whatever way it could

in developing the housing industry or whatever the

requirements of this place demand. The S.I.T. ask

for  a lot of unrealistic requirements. Unless you

are one of their gang-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Which gang?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Well, not your gang anyway-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is forgetting

himself. I do not think I belong to any gang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> I apologise, Sir. The question

is  this: the Planning Authority has a lot  to  do

with  the prosperity of this place, whether it  is

housing, schools or factories, and I would like to

crave  the indulgence of this House if  I  may  be

permitted to quote a few examples of the  type  of

treatment which the public gets from the S.I.T.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for instance, a piece of land in South

Bridge Road. One association wanted to develop  it

and  build a number of shophouses and a few  flats

on  it.  The  original application  was  submitted

about 1950. When the application was presented  to

the   S.I.T.,  they  turned  round  and  told  the

association, "Oh, you cannot do that. That land is

required for a traffic island. It will be cut into

half.  What  about  changing  over  to  the   land

opposite?" The association said, "Yes, since  this

is  for the improvement of the town, we should co-operate  with  the authorities." After  that,  the S.I.T. said,  "Oh, no, there is a  difference  in

value.   The   opposite  will  be   dearer."   The

association  then said, "All right, then  you  get

the   City  Assessor  to  assess  the  land."  The

Assessor  said,  "$10 a square  foot  extra."  The

association said, "All right, whatever it  is,  we

are  quite  prepared  to do it."  This  time,  the

S.I.T. said,  "No,  we do not  need  the  traffic

island  any  more.  You start  re-submitting  your

plan". When the association submitted their  plan,

the S.I.T. replied, "No, we are still not sure  of

the  scheme.  Can  you wait six  months  or  eight

months?" The association said, "All right, we will

wait eight months." After eight months, the S.I.T.

said,  "You can proceed with the scheme,  but  you

must  bear  in  mind that there  will  be  a  road

overhead,  20 feet above the street, and  provided

you  comply with that, we will approve the  plan."

When the association submitted the plan, they said

this time, "Oh, no, the Master Plan considers that

an  ancient building must be preserved." And there

you are stuck. So you can see, in 1950 the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



S.I.T. knew very well that the association wanted

to   turn  that  ancient  temple  into  a   modern

building,  yet today that half-fallen building  is

still there for everyone to see.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case is about an application for a

factory in the Tiong Bahru area. It is about eight

years  ago. The application was submitted  to  the

S.I.T. but no reply was received from them.  When

the  applicant asked, "Why do you not  give  us  a

reply?",  they said, "Oh, we sent it to the  wrong

architect." Afterwards they said, "Oh,  we  cannot

give you a reply. We want the land to develop some

other building."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing that the Government should have

preference  over private requirements,  yet  today

the empty land is still there. If you are in their

group, you can get everything done. You can always

get  away  with  murder.  If  you  are  not,  then

everything is wrong because, as one member of  the

Board  of the S.I.T. told me, "The power given  to

them is shocking." If you apply to the S.I.T. for

permission to build a factory on a piece  of  land

just  outside the so-called factory area which  is

of  their own making - no one knows what it  is  and

how  far it extends - they say, "Oh, yes, since  you

are  a  friend,  we will just lift  the  line  and

include  your  piece of land.  All  right,  it  is

approved." If you are not, they say, "Oh, no, your

land is just outside the factory area." And if you

talk  too  much, they will just lift the line  and

put  the centre on the land and render it useless.

If  you  appeal to the Governor - there is no appeal

to the courts - then the Governor will write back to

the S.I.T. and the S.I.T. will advise the Governor

accordingly, and you get nowhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone may ask why those who drew up the

legislation should make it in such a way. Well,  I

think  I can tell you why, because those who  drew

up  the legislation then knew very well they  were

in  it.  When  they  were in it,  they  knew  that

through  their influence they could  get  whatever

they  wanted. It is because they can get what they

want and others cannot that they can make money.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another complaint is that the S.I.T. never give

you  the  reason in writing for disapproving  your

application,  so  there  is  no  proof.  If   they

disapprove  your application, they say,  "You  can

always  come  and interview the Manager."  I  have

interviewed  the Manager four times  on  the  same

case, and four times he gave me different reasons.

The   S.I.T. do  not  give  you  a  reason   for

disapproval  in  writing  because   it   is   very

convenient  for them to do so. The S.I.T. do  not

give you a reason for disapproval in writing. They

can  favour their friends when they come, or  they

are  offered a big enough prize to do so. Such  is

the  S.I.T.- and yet that kind of organisation  is

allowed  to remain with this Government for  three

years!  Every time we ask the Ministry, "What  are

you  going  to  do  about  it?",  they  say,  "The

expatriate   officers  are   objecting."   I   can

understand  why they are objecting, because  their

grabbing  opportunities are about to  come  to  an

end;  because  they know their days are  numbered,

and  if  they do not grab now, they have no chance

of  grabbing any more. That is the reason for this

delayed  legislation and unless it is  brought  up

very  soon,  I  think I will have to  introduce  a

motion to amend the S.I.T. Ordinance and take  out

the absolute powers given to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I wish to raise is the Public

Works  Department. The P.W.D. is known  throughout

Singapore   for   building  the   most   expensive

buildings  they can ever think of, because  it  is

public  money, and if those who are in control  of

building do not make the cost as high as possible,

how  can they squeeze anything out of it? Remember

that  you  cannot squeeze water out  of  a  stone.

Fortunately we have a Financial Secretary  who  is

most sympathic-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What is he suffering from?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Sympathetic. I have managed to

persuade him to see some three bedroom flats  with

all  the proper finishes costing less than $20,000

each, whereas the P.W.D. ask for more than $50,000

for  an  ordinary assistant doctor's flat.  During the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



Budget  debate on the question of the Polytechnic,

I  asked that a commission be set up. What did the

Government   do?  They  appointed  an   expatriate

officer, an ex-architect of the P.W.D., giving him

$8,000  to do a two months' job. When I asked  the

Minister, "Why do you pay him so much money?", his

reply was, "If I do not pay him in a lump sum,  he

might  take  years  to do it. That  will  be  more

expensive."   If  the  Minister  had   so   little

confidence in that expatriate officer, do you  not

think  it  is  quite possible  that  if  a  person

slipped  a  few thousand dollars in  his  hand  he

would  make  an  entirely wrong report,  different

from  what  the actual situation was?  I  appealed

once to the Minister to have a committee set up to

enquire  how  to cheapen the cost of building.  I,

for one, am prepared to challenge the Minister  or

any  of  his  experts to a public  debate  on  the

P.W.D.,  without the protection of the  privileges

of   this  House,  at  any  time,  any  place  and

anywhere.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday

one  of  the Members of this House criticised  the

morale  and  efficiency of the police and  claimed

that  the  public  has entirely no  confidence  or

faith  in  the police, especially the  detectives.

Sir,  there  is  no foundation or  truth  in  this

statement. I am not surprised at this statement at

all,  for  there are many people in Singapore  who

believe that there is no need at all for a  police

force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, relations between the people and the police

have  been disturbed first by the first world  war

and  then  by the emergency. In recent  years  the

police  have  steadily built up public confidence.

Adequate  measures  have from time  to  time  been

taken  to  see that the police - public co-operation

is  maintained  at a high level. In  a  democratic

country,  Sir,  it is wrong for the Government  to

resort to either Fascist or Communist methods  for

the  prevention and detection of crime. Government

is taking the natural cure through firm education,

which  is the only lasting and worthwhile measure.

Government  is  doing its utmost  to  educate  the

people. Already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



the  police are taking a big part in the  frequent

civics   courses   run  by   the   Department   of

Information   Services.   Police   officers    are

lecturing in schools, at rural district committees

and community centres. I am sure hon. Members, are

aware  that these lectures have done good  to  the

people.  I  am reliably informed that  the  police

have received favourable reactions as a result  of

these lectures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police are trying to get more public

telephones  for  emergency  reports,  and  it   is

pleasing  to note that the mobile police  stations

which  were  in  use recently have been  extremely

useful  to the people. Efforts to break  down  the

mistaken  idea  that the police  are  in  any  way

different from the people have been made. Talks by

the  police officers drawn from the various  units

they belong to about the inside of their work  and

how  they can help the public are being organised.

This  will  also  illustrate the normal  every-day

contacts  of  the  police  with  the  public.  The

Department of Information Services will take  tape

recordings   of  these  talks  in  all  vernacular

languages  and broadcast to the people  throughout

the length and breadth of Singapore. The radio and

Rediffusion  will  assist  in  our  campaign  with

programmes on the police background. Radio  Malaya

will  also  ask listeners for questions on  police

matters  and  will  build up Question  and  Answer

programmes. Dramatised shows are also  planned  on

the theme - Police at your service - to stimulate the

people's  interest. Four films of police work  are

in  the making. These will be shown throughout the

island  of Singapore. We are also seeking the  co-operation  of theatre management in  the  city  as

well as in the rural areas to show these films  to

the  people.  Besides  these,  the  Department  of

Information  Services will show  them  in  various

parts of the rural areas in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A poster competition has been initiated by the

Government  to  illustrate  the  slogan  "Citizens

fight  the  extortion evil", and I hope  that  the

people will enter this competition and make  it  a

success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hoped, Sir, that these efforts, which are

designed  to  promote  co-operation  between   the

police  and public, will be a success and  through

this  education young people will not be attracted

to gangsterism. Sir, this is the answer to Members

who  spoke  on  secret societies and  the  methods

which  the  Government is taking  to  educate  the

people to understand police activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a Member of the Assembly, I would like to

participate  in  the debate. Some Members  of  the

Opposition  have clearly indicated that  they  are

not  interested in any of the plans  envisaged  by

the Government in the coming months. But as far as

I  am  concerned, Sir, I particularly attach great

importance  to the Rural Development  Panel  which

the  Government will be setting up shortly. For  a

very  long time in the rural areas there has  been

no  co-ordination to stimulate the  rural  economy

and  to raise the standard of living of the  rural

dwellers. So the Rural Development Panel  will  be

particularly welcomed by them. In the rural  areas

particularly there are very many roads which  need

immediate  attention, roads which  would  help  to

raise  the  standard of living of the agricultural

workers-
