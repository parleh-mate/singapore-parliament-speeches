<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  in  support of Mrs Lim Hwee Hua's motion to  thank  the

President



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



for his Speech during the Opening of the Tenth Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before that, after hearing the introduction of the Bill

on  birds and animals, I will try and see whether I can  make

my  point  about more than just birds and bees.  It is  about

harmony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are at the crossroads, said the President. Our

collective  rejoinder should be, let us  make  sure  we  know

which  route to take.  The price can be high if  we  were  to

take  the  wrong turn.  As stakeholders, we all  have  vested

interests in that common destination.  Equal rights, however,

demand equally shared responsibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social cohesion and religious harmony are obviously the

cornerstones  of  Singapore's  future,  after  all,  as   the

President   had  cautioned,  it  is  one  of   our   on-going

challenges,  except that it has taken a certain urgency  post

September  11.   The earlier we recognise  that,  the  better

placed we are to prepare for the tasks ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I was in Marrakech, Morocco, a

fortnight ago, to attend the 107th Inter-Parliamentary  Union

Conference.  Leading the Singapore delegation, I was proud to

announce   at   the  Conference  that  Singapore   celebrates

pluralism.  Even our delegation was symbolic of that.   I  am

glad that Mr Chiam has just walked in.  Although the majority

of  Singaporeans are Chinese, two of the representatives were

Malay/Muslims,  Mr  Ahmad  Khalis  and  myself.   The   other

delegate,  Mr  Chiam See Tong, is Chinese, a  Christian  (not

from  the  majority Buddhists/Taoists group),  and  from  the

Opposition  too.    I  must  add that  Mr  Chiam  is  a  true

Singaporean,  especially overseas.  I dare say  that  I  look

forward  to  my  next  trip travelling with  Mr  Chiam  as  a

companion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IPU Conference, Sir, was also preoccupied with the

issue  of  the global fight against terrorism.  That reminded

me   about  the  UN  Conference  on  Racism,  Xenophobia  and

Intolerance,  in  Durban, a few days before  the  tragic  and

horrible attack by extremists and heartless terrorists on the

World  Trade Centre.  Ego and emotion engulfed the  minds  at

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



conference, leaving it a failure, despite being held  in  the

Land of the forgiving Nelson Mandela.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After September 11, the world is never the same again.

But  has  the world really learnt its lesson?  In the  Middle

East,   the  Israel-Palestinian  time-bomb  is  fast  ticking

towards madness.  The ghost of the Al Qaeda network continues

to  haunt,  not only in Afghanistan but also in our backyard.

The  reality of the Jemaah Islamiyah arrests and the severity

of  the  security risks they pose to Singapore  still  escape

some.   As Dr Balaji reminded us yesterday, imagine  if  they

had  chosen Singapore instead of the World Trade Centre.  The

sooner  we realise the dangers of such extreme behaviour  and

take  steps to minimise, if not eradicate it, the  better  it

is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How Muslims interpret Islam, in particular the need to

champion  moderation in the modern, progressive  and  secular

world  today, will have serious ramifications on how we  live

together  in harmony in Singapore, the region, in  fact,  the

world.   It is not just about tolerance, neither coexistence.

Coexistence  can  be  described as a relationship  between  a

farmer  and  a  turkey, until Christmas.  That  is  not  good

enough.  We do not need `cold turkey' in our multi-racial and

multi-religious relations.  It needs better understanding and

trust.   That  may sound a cliche, but that is a  warning  or

reminder  worth reiterating.  This will be the most important

test for Singapore's resilience.  Indeed, it will be the most

challenging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding Islam and the many faces of Muslims in the

world  today will be and must be an important agenda  for  us

global  and cosmopolitan Singapore.  The concept of Ummah  is

important in the Islamic vocabulary, but do not misunderstand

when  they  endeavour to be good Muslims or  even  religious.

Muslims  in  Singapore, however, must be more discerning  and

rational  in  their  judgment, especially  when  it  involves

extremism  and  conservatism.   Fortunately  for   us,   most

Singaporeans are moderates, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



was mentioned by Mr Ahmad Magad yesterday.  Nevertheless,  it

is  always  the extreme minority that is strident and  vocal.

They  can  do serious damage to the interests of  the  silent

moderate  majority, just like the Talibans and  the  Al-Qaeda

network.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Muslims have to be brave to go moderate and

main  stream, not extreme.  No doubt, Muslims need to believe

in  the  supremacy of the Koran and the Syariah, but look  to

the golden era of the Prophet and the Caliphs to see the open-mindedness,  the  emphasis  on  knowledge  and  science   and

technology.     Not   the   quarrels   over   khilafiah    or

interpretations, or who is more Muslim or more  sincere.  The

Islamic  civilisation  was  the centre  of  trade,  arts  and

sciences  then,  not veiled withdrawals into exclusivity  and

conservation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President of the Moroccan Parliament told me that

Moroccans  are  proud  of  their Berber  civilisation,  Arab-Islamic  background and close to the Western European  world.

They  did  not allow one to trouble the other.  They  achieve

harmony of thought and mind, and progress in tandem with  the

modern  world,  not  secular  in  approach,  neither  totally

Muslim,  as  would be understood by some extreme groups,  but

humane, which is just as Islamic to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy to stir trouble under the guise of defending

fellow  Muslim rights, but how many 'brothers' will  come  to

our  help  when we are in deep waters ourselves.  Muslims  in

Bosnia  knew  that.  Chairman Arafat must  be  wondering  now

where  will  help come from.  Muslims in Singapore  must  not

allow  Muslim  `brothers' from outside who know little  about

our  own developments and situation, or worse, with their own

agenda,  to  make our challenges more complex.   We  have  to

resolve them ourselves, our way, whether tudung, madrasah  or

upliftment.  I realise the issue of tudung in school is still

bugging  the  minds  of many Muslims, but  we  will  have  to

continue to work on it.  No minority extreme views should  be

allowed to dominate or influence the moderate majority.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Address highlights the challenges we

face together  -  not Malay problem, not Chinese problem, but

Singaporean  challenges.  Voices accusing the  Government  of

marginalising   the  Malay/Muslims  have  been   heard   when

convenient  by  certain  quarters  and  parties,  inside  and

outside  Singapore.   Sure, for a community  which  has  been

lagging behind for decades in education and the economy,  one

does  not  and must not expect miracles to turn the situation

around.  Even affirmative action programmes in many countries

have proven inadequate.  There are still many areas that need

urgent   attention,  education  in  particular.   The   Malay

community recognises that, so does its leaders.  It  is  that

awareness  that  has  allowed  the  community,  through   its

upliftment  programmes,  to  show  credible  progress.    The

performance of Malay students in mathematics was the  7th  in

the  world in the 1999 World Mathematics and Science  Survey,

surpassing the US, Canada and UK.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not also say that there were no opportunities. Our

first  President was a Malay and we now, Sir,  have  yourself

the  Speaker of the House, a first for a Malay.  The Minister

in  charge  of  Muslim Affairs is a PhD in  Engineering  from

Stanford,  and  look  at the new crop of  MPs  that  we  have

brought  in at the last general elections.  With due  respect

to ex-teachers and journalists like myself, we have a lawyer,

an international labour unionist, another PhD, a sociologist,

and  a  polytechnic lecturer.  Some may say that we have  not

come  to  the  stage  of  producing people  like  the  Senior

Ministers  of State Mr Tharman and Mr Khaw, and Ministers  of

State  Mr Ng, Dr Balaji, Dr Balakrishnan and Mr Raymond  Lim,

but  that  should  not be a point for us  to  gripe,  neither

despair, but indeed that should serve as a challenge  for  us

to strive for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The community should indeed feel inspired to work even

harder to uplift and together build greater resilience.  When

the  Malay  community progresses and strengthen  further  its

educational base, the stronger will the community



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



become   and   thus  the  more  resilient  our   multi-racial

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, listening to the President's Address

makes  me  more convinced the importance of the  CDCs.   Make

CDCs  all the more relevant as catalysts for social cohesion.

The  Government needs to relook at the resources given to the

CDCs to enhance their role.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may use the North East CDC as an example, and I

declare  my  interest  as  Mayor  of  North  East  CDC,   its

philosophy  and basic principles not only address short  term

immediate   problems,  but  also  tackle  future  challenges.

Resilience  means  enhancing  personal  responsibility  where

assistance  is  aimed  at  helping  individuals  gain   self-reliance.   After all, all programmes are aimed at  promoting

community  self-help.   The  responsibility  of  any   social

problems must be shared between the Government, the community

and individuals.  The CDC's role should be that of enabler of

community.  The CDC provides the infrastructure and resources

to facilitate all to play their part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, ideas may be easy to come by but, more

important,  is  the  will  to make  multi-racial  and  multi-religious  Singapore succeed as a more cohesive nation.   For

that,  we need a greater sense of common destiny.  That  must

be  our shared destination, our shared responsibility.   That

is our road ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to speak in support  of  the  motion

standing  in the name of Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, Member for  Marine

Parade GRC.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has reflected a very tough external

environment  and  has  laid out several  present  and  future

challenges for Singapore.  I would like, first, to comment on

economic  restructuring and why we need to develop a  society

of  creative  thinkers, before moving on to propose  ways  to

build social cohesion.  I will end by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



arguing  why  there  is a need for more than  just  political

renewal.



<br><br><i>Economic  restructuring and developing a society of  creative thinkers</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well known that Singapore's economy is highly

dependent    on    electronics   and   manufacturing.     The

manufacturing sector has served Singapore very  well  in  the

last several decades. We have virtually exported our way out,

from a third world to that of a developed nation.  Credit  is

due  and  must  be  given to the founding leaders  for  their

wisdom and foresight in pursuing this policy.



<br><br><i>Reducing business cost</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, times have changed. We are now a developed

economy  and cost is awfully high.  We are expensive  and  no

longer  cost-competitive.  Our manufacturers  cannot  compete

efficiently in terms of pricing alone.  We are trying to move

up  the  value  chain and technological expertise.   However,

these are just ways to stall for time before other countries,

like China, catch up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, we need to look into ways to reduce the

high cost of doing business in Singapore.  Most of these high

costs, like licence fees, public service charges, land  cost,

rental, direct and indirect taxes, transport cost and so  on,

can  be traced to the Government.  Like Mr Ravindran said,  I

also  wonder if the public service departments are recovering

costs, or making huge profits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in the interim measures to make Singapore

competitive,  the Government should take the  lead  to  lower

these  burdens  and adjust them to a more competitive  level.

This is the best immediate way to help reduce business costs.



<br><br><i>Developing a creative thinking society</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the longer term, we need greater initiative to

develop more unique products and services that we can export.

To achieve this, we must be free to think.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



Look  at  the USA - their emphasis on creativity and a  free-thinking society have paid off very well economically.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creativity is the current buzzword in education and

society.   What  actually  constitutes  creativity?   Sir,  I

believe  there  are two types of creativity  -  artistic  and

thinking.   I  cannot  speak  for  artistic  creativity,  but

thinking  creativity is something that  we  can  nurture  and

build  upon.   To be a nation of creative thinkers,  we  must

first  start  by  getting our citizens to  ask  the  question

"Why".   For example, why must we rely so heavily on Malaysia

for  water?   Why must we fear China's economic growth?   Can

there  not  be  a  better  solution  to  what  the  Ministers

proposed?  There must be other fresh solutions to Singapore's

many challenges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sim Wong Hoo of Creative Technology must be spending

a  lot  of time thinking, "What new products can I market  to

the  world?   How  can I improve on the sound blaster  card?"

Sir,  it  is through the questioning attitude that opens  our

mindset  to the possibility of looking for solutions  out  of

the  box.  Had Sir Isaac Newton not asked, "Why did the apple

drop  from the tree?", he would not have gone on to  discover

the laws of gravity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the Member for Ang Mo Kio

GRC, Mr Wee Siew Kim, that for a truly questioning mind to be

developed,  it  has to start from a young age.   A  safe  and

encouraging environment must be present for children  to  ask

questions and speak their mind.  This should be the  priority

in  our schools.  The Education Ministry must seriously  look

into this.  It is not healthy for young Singaporeans to learn

to  keep  their mouths shut - like the fishes in  Jack  Neo's

movie "I Not Stupid".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have a questioning mind is the beginning of wisdom.

It  is  more important than constant mugging for examinations

or  the  memorising of facts and figures.  We must  give  our

only natural resource, that is, our human talents, a lot more

care,  encouragement and empowerment to bring them  to  their

full potential.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not all will turn out to be another Mr Sim Wong

Hoo,  at  the  very  least, they will be  equipped  with  the

correct thinking skills to be creative thinkers.  The art  of

asking  questions  will definitely kick  start  the  thinking

process,  foster initiative and a sense of ownership  of  the

problems  on  hand.  It will break our infamous  attitude  of

kiasu and kiasi that Mr Seng Han Thong mentioned on Monday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly believe that a "thinking person" will be a

model  citizen  with  the  `spirit of  resilience  and  self-sufficiency'  that Dr Ng Eng Hen mentioned on Monday.   Their

first instinct will not be to run to the MPs to ask for help,

but  to think of the problems, and to take the initiative  to

solve the problems themselves.  This will certainly boost the

brand name of our Singaporean professionals and managers.



<br><br><i>Building social cohesion</i>



<br><br><i>(a) Develop a more tolerant, magnanimous and forgiving culture</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now I would like to move on to talk

about building social cohesion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To continue to develop this culture of creativity and

initiative,  we  must restructure our society  and  political

system, allow for differences in thinking and attitudes.   We

must let our citizens feel real ownership of our society, not

just physical ownership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As leaders, we must learn to agree to disagree. We can

disagree  professionally but we must always work together  to

uphold  the decisions of the majority, while considering  the

concerns of the minority.  This will provide the social  glue

for a more cohesive society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politics is very discouraging for the young, especially

for  those  on the opposite side of the governing party.   In

past  elections, there were many settling of scores  and  law

suits.   This  does  not  make a more  gracious  or  cohesive

society, especially when it is seen as a big Goliath bullying

a small David.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe as national leaders, we should learn to

be  more  forgiving of political opponents.  We  should  give

more  leeway  for  the  heat generated  during  an  electoral

contest,  and  not make a big issue out of  a  molehill.   We

should  be  more magnanimous to those who spoke out  and  are

highly critical of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, I am on talking terms with my political

opponent, Prof. Low, from Chua Chu Kang.  I respect him -  he

is not here - for his electoral victory, but I shall continue

to  work  the  ground  and  try to win  the  support  of  the

residents  there.  This is civil competition.  It is  healthy

and should be encouraged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May the best person win" should be the motto of our

society.  This is the spirit of meritocracy.



<br><br><i>(b)  Adopt a balanced approach to managing society</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we need to take on a balanced approach

to society.  I believe that our society has been over-managed

to the extent that Senior Minister complained there is little

buzz.   The  Government  has  been  taking  a  very  top-down

approach in managing our society.  I agree very much with the

President's  view that, and I quote: "We must  open  up  more

space for Singaporeans."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is high time to set in motion this bottoms-up

approach - to spend more time engaging and listening  to  the

people, to understand their concerns and aspirations;  to  be

more sensitive to their needs and wants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good way to start this bottoms-up approach is by

having each Residents Committee (RC) and its Chairman elected

by   the  residents  themselves.   Currently,  it  is   being

appointed  by the MP, and for most residents they  would  not

know who are the Chairmen of the RCs.  By being elected, they

will get to know the residents better, earn their respect and

be  their  voice  to Government officials.  This  interaction

between  the  community  and the Government  will  definitely

build a more dynamic society.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must trust the people and allow them to

help  shape  policies that affect their lives.  By empowering

the  people to make wise decisions, Singaporeans will be more

supportive and pursue these policies wholeheartedly.



<br><br><i>(c)  Develop a sense of belonging for Singaporeans</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the President's Speech on "international

talent", I agree it is important to attract these talents  to

Singapore.  I applaud the President for his use of  the  term

`international' over the often-controversial phrase  `foreign

talents'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that not all foreigners are that talented.

Some   are   just  more  outspoken  or  better  in  packaging

themselves.   In Jack Neo's movie, political satire,  "I  Not

Stupid",  the  expatriate  is  only  holding  a  very  junior

position in his home country and not very creative.   But  he

became  the creative director in the show because  he  is  an

expatriate.   We  must correct and stop this assumption  that

all foreigners are talented.  Many are not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are many young Singaporeans who

are equally, if not more talented.  They are either not given

the  right  opportunity or not empowered  to  exercise  their

talents.   It  is important that we put greater  emphasis  in

developing this talent pool.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to develop a stronger sense of belonging.

Specifically,  Singaporeans must have special privileges  and

rights  that they hold dear in Singapore.  If they decide  to

migrate  overseas, they will forfeit these rights.  Sir,  let

us  all think of ways to build more privileges and rights for

Singaporeans,  so  that  even international  talents  may  be

attracted to become our citizens.



<br><br><i>More than just political renewal</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the President talked about political

renewal.   I  think  we need more than  that.   Ms  Irene  Ng

yesterday



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



had  talked  about the four divides.  Today, I will  add  the

fifth divide to it - the political divide, ie, the divide  in

the population between hardcore Opposition supporters and the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair political competition in Singapore is almost non-existent, and so are constructive and rational non-governing

political  parties.   Singaporeans want  and  hope  that  the

General  Elections will be fairer.  The use  of  threats  and

goodies,  together with the last-minute announcement  of  new

electoral  boundaries, does not make elections fair  to  non-governing party candidates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than being known as kiasu and kiasi, Singaporeans

are  also  known to kia zhenhu.  They are afraid of offending

the  governing party based on - please correct  me  if  I  am

wrong  - the unfounded belief that their livelihood would  be

jeopardised.   This is especially so when the  ballot  papers

have serial numbers on the back.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not help to build confidence in the electoral

process, especially when the vote could potentially be traced

through the serial numbers.  Something must be done once  and

for  all  to convince our voters that their votes are  really

secret.   The  best  way is to completely remove  the  serial

number at the back of the ballot papers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Prime Minister Lee had mentioned before the last

General  Elections the introduction of the  Fair  Competition

Act.   It  is very much our hope, Mr Speaker, Sir, that  this

Act will also cover fair competition in the area of politics.

In line with that, the Elections Department should come under

the  jurisdiction  of  the President, instead  of  the  Prime

Minister's Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Leader of the House, during the

debate  on  the motion for nomination of NMPs  in  the  Ninth

Parliament, said, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As Opposition Members, they will generally take an

adversarial  position  in the debates though  sometimes  they

have been constructive."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  by definition, I am from the Opposition.  However, what

am  I  opposing?  We do not oppose for the sake of  opposing.

What  is there to oppose if a policy is for the good  of  the

people?   If it is not good for the people or the country,  I

believe  many  Government  party  members  will  join  me  in

opposing  such  a  policy.   Are  they  then  considered  the

Opposition as well?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Elections are long over. Seventy-five

percent  of  the  voting population voted for  the  governing

party.   The  rest  have  rejected  it  and  voted  for   the

Opposition.  Whatever the reasons, it is time for us to  rise

above  party politics and work together for the common  good.

My alliance Chairman, Mr Chiam, had expressed that here is an

important role for us to play as non-PAP MPs.  Sir, I believe

that  role  is  to  represent the sizeable  minority  of  the

population  who have supported us.  It is very important  for

the Government to respect their desires and work closely with

us to close this political divide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a very small and vulnerable country. It is

very  important  for all of us to be objective,  level-headed

and not be adversarial for the sake of being adversarial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summing up, Mr Speaker, Sir, being a non-Government

party  Member, and being the youngest in this House,  I  have

spoken  my mind without fear or favour.  Now, I volunteer  my

services  to the sub-committees in the remaking of  Singapore

and  its economy.  Will I be invited to participate?  Or will

we  be  excluded?   I would like to look forward  to  a  good

working  relationship  with all Members  to  restructure  and

prosper Singapore in this uncertain world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I support the motion to thank the

President for his Speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support the motion in the name of Mrs Lim Hwee Hua.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last five years have been very sobering years

for the Government and the people of Singapore.  While we saw

about 30 years of almost uninterrupted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



growth,  except for a couple of short downturns, in the  last

five  years, things have been very different.  We  have  seen

two  successive  recessions in a short span  of  five  years,

something that we never expected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the awakening of the two sleeping giants in Asia,

namely,  China  and  India,  the  five  tigers  of  the   old

industrial economy are facing tremendous threats.  All  these

changes  are going to redefine the rules of the game  in  the

new economy.  The five old tigers of Asia will have to search

for new roles to play in this new economy while they struggle

to  redefine their models of economic development.  Singapore

is  not  alone in its quest to restructure its economy.   All

the  five Asian tigers are very much at it and, so far,  only

South  Korea seems to have had some success in restructuring,

while Taiwan and Hong Kong are seeing a possible hollowing of

their own domestic economies but are aggressively growing the

external wing of their economy through China.



<br><br><i>Remaking of Singapore Economy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is an opportune time for Singapore to be looking

at how she can change herself.  The industrialisation formula

of  the past, driven mainly by foreign direct investments, is

in no way going to help us in the future.  The future lies in

an  innovation-based  economy, driven  by  entrepreneurs  and

private  enterprise, participating in a global  market  where

technologies and business models are constantly changing.  We

need bold new strategies to succeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three fundamental points I would like to make

on  how we can find the right elements to successfully remake

the  Singapore economy.  They are, firstly, changing the  way

we  plan  our  economy;  secondly, the economic  colonisation

model  for Singapore; and finally, the role of Government  in

business, including GLCs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the remaking of the Singapore economy is everyone's

business.  The Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister  and

everyone involved in the process



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



have  invited every Singaporean to be involved  and  to  come

forward.   So  when Mr Steve Chia says that he  hopes  to  be

invited, I think he has already been invited.  But he  really

needs  to be a lot more proactive and take the initiative  to

do  something about it to make proposals.  I head  the  Indus

entrepreneurs  - and this is the chapter of entrepreneurs  of

Indian  origin  all  around  the  world  -  and  without  the

Government  asking  us,  we have  had  about  two  months  of

activities  in  trying to come out with proposals  in  a  few

areas.   In about two weeks' time, we will be ready to submit

a  report to the Government.  So please do not sit and  wait,

do something about it.



<br><br><i>Changing the way we plan our economy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first point I want to make is about changing

the  way  we  plan  our  economy  from  central  planning  to

distributed  planning and from a straight  line  planning  to

fuzzy  planning  process.   Looking  back,  while  being   an

impressive  development,  our  first  30  years  of  economic

development  have  really been driven by  a  fixed  model  of

growth,  planned centrally where straight line  planning  was

workable because of the type of economy we were growing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a straight line planning model, once we decided on

the   formula   for  growth,  the  rest  was  left   to   the

administrators to plan and all they needed to do was to  make

straight  line projections like the amount of foreign  direct

investments to bring in, number of jobs to create, number  of

training places to establish and other similar measures.  The

straight  line  planning model, driven by  a  strong  central

authority, managed by a few good men, worked because  all  we

needed  to do was to do more of the same and to do it  better

than our Asian neighbours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last five years, we have entered into the era of

the  new  economy  and  we  have quickly  realised  that  our

planning models and theories do not work well as evidenced by

our inability to forecast the economy well.  We have not only

seen near misses, in fact we have seen huge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



fluctuations  and variations of what turned  out  to  be  the

reality  versus  our  expectations.  The Government  agencies

have  not been able to grasp the elements of the new  economy

because  we  cannot be planning an economy thinking  narrowly

within our own borders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a globalised world, we have to think of the whole

world  as  our  market and when we do this, we will  have  to

think  of  new  models simply because the  Government  cannot

possibly  have  influence  outside  our  borders.   There  is

therefore  an  urgent need for us to understand  how  we  can

effectively  participate in and find new ways  to  plan  this

economy.  The sure thing is that the Government alone can  no

longer monopolise and drive economic planning and development

in  the  future.  It requires the involvement  of  many  more

people,  especially the private sector, which  can  influence

foreign  markets by their presence there.  We  have  to  move

away from a strong central planning approach to a distributed

planning  approach that many more people and not just  a  few

good  men  are  involved in planning and  executing  economic

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A partnership formula with the private sector playing an

active  role  needs to be defined.  Government should  define

the  broad visions and leave as much as possible the economic

planning to the private sector.  Since things will no  longer

be  clear,  our models will have to be changed to incorporate

concepts  of fuzzy planning, where we will never be  able  to

have  enough  information to put together concrete  forecasts

and projections and where we will have to constantly redefine

the  rules  of the games as the world around us changes.   In

such  an  approach,  it is wise for the  Government  and  our

Government  agencies  to  define the general  directions  and

broad goals and then be involved in just facilitating and not

driving  the economy directly.  The Government can no  longer

be involved in the minute details of planning the economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This distributed and fuzzy planning approach is

consistent with what many of us have identified as a solution

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>



the  new Singapore economy.  In this approach, the Government

should   focus   on  creating  and  nurturing   a   conducive

environment,    which   breeds   private   enterprises    and

entrepreneurs  who  will  in turn determine  the  success  or

failure  of  economies.  In this model, we must  accept  some

chaos,  some  unstructuredness, some  mavericks  and  a  much

rougher ride for everyone, including the Government,  and  we

must be prepared to take much higher risks than before.   The

Government needs to learn to let go and place more  trust  on

the private sector for us to be effective in developing a new

model  of the Singapore economic development.  The USA  model

is  an  example  of  what government agencies  like  the  Fed

control  just  a  few levers and leave most of  the  economic

development  to  private enterprises,  while  they  create  a

business friendly environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an illustration of the problems of central planning,

let  me  use  an  example of Belgium.  Why is  Belgium  still

successful  in  the  textile industry?  By  our  approach  of

economic  planning,  Belgium should have thrown  out  textile

manufacturing  a long time ago by encouraging  relocation  to

low  cost countries.  Instead, what they did was to  work  on

continuously strengthening their core competencies such  that

they always stayed ahead, and how did they do it?  Well, what

I  heard  when I was in Brussels, about nine months ago,  was

that they operated highly automated and mechanised factories,

less  dependent  on manual work and more  on  machines.   The

factories are so big that technicians cannot go on foot, they

have to go round on bicycles to go and check the machines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore have to look at how we are restructuring

ourselves.   Many of our Government agencies, as a  strategy,

advocate throwing out the old industries to bring in the  new

ones  too prematurely, either directly or indirectly, through

policy changes or through incentive and disincentive schemes.

Like    the    Belgians,   instead   of    making    complete

transformations,  we  should stretch our  competencies.   The

right thing to do is to focus on our core competencies, which

we  have  developed over so many years and  see  how  we  can

improve our productivity,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>



efficiency  and  capabilities, such that we can  continue  to

compete effectively in the same areas for a longer period  of

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when we say, let us bring in life sciences and the

petrochemical industries, we should not do it at the  expense

of  the other strengths that we have developed over the  past

30  years.  Those new industries are important too but it may

take  time  for  us  to  build those  capabilities.   In  the

process, we cannot lose our old capabilities.  We should also

think  of  ways of continuing to be champions in those  areas

that  we  have  invested so much in in the past  years  until

there comes a point when we cannot improve any more.  In  the

process, we would have a long overlapping period between  the

old and the new industries, thus minimising the stress to the

economy and to the people of Singapore.



<br><br><i>Economic colonisation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is one of economic colonisation - setting up of a true external wing. Singapore should

aggressively embark on a colonisation programme.  We have  so

far  successfully developed the external wing of our  economy

and  I  feel  the  way forward is through  this  colonisation

programme,  which will accelerate the growth of our  external

economy.  We have to start building Singapore all around  the

world.   And I would like to suggest three ways that  we  can

achieve this accelerated growth.



<br><br><i>New model of globalisation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, a new model of globalisation. Recently, there

has  been  a  lot  of  debate on  how  we  can  create  local

multinational  companies.   I  feel  that  our   failure   in

developing  world-class  companies  may  have  been  in   the

approach  we  are  taking and Professor Peter  Williamson  of

Insead  University, who advises us on some of  these  things,

very well summaries it, and I quote him:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot of Singaporean companies want to become

multinational.   If they do the traditional route  of  taking

what  they learnt here and spreading it around the world,  we

think  that  is going to be very difficult because  they  are

latecomers  [ie, Singaporeans are latecomers] to the  process

and  also the pool of knowledge in which they are fishing  is

too small."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Williamson rightly points out that if we try

to  copy the models of the big developed economies of the US,

Europe and Japan, we will not succeed and, for Singapore with

a  small domestic economy, we will never be able to learn the

true needs of the world market if we do not quickly go out of

Singapore to do our businesses.  What this means is  that  we

do  not  necessarily  have to take the traditional  route  of

growing  global  businesses  by first  growing  a  successful

domestic  market  before  we embark on  internationalisation.

Many  of  our  companies,  especially  the  Government-linked

companies,  are still thinking of the old model, and  I  feel

that  they must start thinking differently by sometimes doing

more  globally  than  locally.  The  Israelis  are  the  best

examples   of   how  local  companies  went   straight   into

international  markets like the US and Europe to  become  the

world's  best companies in a number of areas.   We  have  one

home-grown  example, ie, Interwoven, where the founder  leap-frogged  to  the US market to create a successful  technology

business.



<br><br><i>Setting up centres of competencies all over the world</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second approach for colonisation is setting up

of  centres  of competencies all over the world.   We  really

need a two-prong approach of setting up local capabilities as

well  as  setting up bases of competencies in other parts  of

the  world  where talent and opportunities are in  abundance.

While we should attract talent into Singapore, we should also

tap them from where they are located.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, instead of setting up a giant biopolis in

Singapore, why do we not set up a few smaller units all  over

the  world, with a much smaller one in Singapore?  Why do  we

not set up a technopolis in India instead of one big facility

in   Singapore?   The  Government  can  take  the   lead   by

diversifying  its research institutes to other parts  of  the

world.  Sir, my visit to Xian in China last year left me with

an  impression that it is an excellent place for us to set up

research



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



institutes in the area of life sciences to tap the wealth  of

expertise  and  talent of the people there.   They  have  the

potential to do truly world-class and leading edge work  and,

similarly,  there are areas of competencies  all  around  the

world and we should try to locate ourselves there too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our net gain is that we immediately tap on the talents

which we may have difficulty attracting into Singapore and we

can,  over  time, also invite the best to come to  Singapore,

after  years of cultivating them from where they are.   I  am

glad to note that Mr Sim Wong Hoo has started the process  by

setting  up  the  Creative-Dragon Science Park  in  Shandong,

China, as a means to tap resources outside Singapore, and  we

hope  that  many more people will follow him, especially  the

Government  agencies.   As  an example,  Nokia,  one  of  the

world's  most  successful companies, coming  from  a  country

quite  like  Singapore  in  terms of  size,  Nokia  used  R&D

capabilities from UK, customer needs and trends  from  Japan,

and  manufacturing  efficiencies  from  Europe  and  Asia  to

overtake Motorola in a short span of five years.



<br><br><i>Acquisition  of  businesses  as an  alternative  of  starting

companies</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third route to economic colonisation is by

acquisition  of  businesses  as an  alternative  to  starting

companies.   Our entrepreneurs and enterprises  should  start

thinking of alternative formulae of starting companies.   The

way  forward may not necessarily be through brand-new  start-ups  but  through  acquisition of  businesses  and  companies

already successful in foreign countries.  With our ability to

raise  funds and to tap funds and good management skills,  we

have  the  opportunity  to take over  businesses  which  have

proven track records, and in areas where it may take too long

for us to build up competencies if we start from scratch.  As

an  example,  YTL  Corporation in  Malaysia,  a  construction

company,   recently   acquired  Wessex  Waters   from   Enron

Corporation.   It  was  a  good buy.  Wessex  specialises  in

supplying  water and water-related activities to 1.2  million

residents in the UK.  Theirs is an example



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



of jump-starting a business, which may have taken too long to

build   up   had  they  done  it  in  a  Greenfield   manner.

Importantly,  they  are diversifying  away  from  a  slumping

domestic  construction industry to new areas of competencies.

We must learn from YTL of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to go on the path of economic colonisation by

developing our strengths, including all resources to  be  set

up  all over the world.  We should be thinking of cultivating

and  harvesting competencies and capabilities from around the

world as part of our formula of growing our economy.  We have

the  means, the timing is right and opportunities all  around

the world are in abundance.



<br><br><i>Role of Government in business</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final point I would like to make today is the

role  of Government in business.  Whether we like it or  not,

whether  we  want  to  admit it or not,  the  Government  and

Government-linked companies do have a significant  impact  on

the Singapore economy, whether directly as business units  or

indirectly by crowding out private enterprise and the private

sector,   or  through  incentive  and  disincentive   schemes

operated by Government agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that many of our GLCs have been operating too

much  in their comfort zones, being given too many privileges

in  the  domestic  economy and, therefore,  unfairly  beating

private  companies  in competition with  them  in  the  local

market.   However, in the long term, success in the  domestic

economy   alone  is  not  sufficient  as  the   whole   world

globalises.   I  personally feel that many of our  GLCs  will

fail  when they globalise and face global competition,  where

true  market forces rule.  We, therefore, need the Government

and  the  Government-linked companies to find new  roles  and

find  a  new strategic position for themselves in this global

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the elements, which could constitute a good

strategic position for them in the future, are:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, being globally-focused instead of locally-focused, and a spirit of partnership with other companies.

With the increasing activity in global Free Trade Agreements,

countries  and  companies will have to  compete  on  a  level

playing  field.  While this will be a threat in the  domestic

market, it is also an opportunity which we should be ready to

cultivate  when the time comes.  Our GLCs should,  therefore,

use  their  strengths to quickly go out and lead the  way  of

economic  colonisation  and  find success  in  globalisation,

instead of working in their comfort zones at home.  To do so,

GLCs  should  also think about partnership with  other  local

private companies or, for that matter, with other GLCs.   The

problem  is  that  both GLCs and the private local  companies

have  developed a culture of suspicion and distrust such that

they  seldom  ventured  into  a  collaboration  approach   by

combining their core competencies to create a cluster of core

competencies  and  then using this new combined  strength  to

compete  with  large  foreign companies,  either  locally  or

globally.  I feel we can best globalise if we work on pooling

our  competencies together and with a spirit  of  partnership

where  each  company,  whether big or small,  contributes  in

creating  very strong clusters capable of competing with  the

best companies from around the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point about Government in business is on

divesting and outsourcing.  While we can accept that GLCs had

a  role to play in our economic development and still have  a

role  to  play  in  the  future, it is not  quite  right  for

statutory  boards  to get involved in businesses.   Over  the

years,  we  have  seen  many instances  of  statutory  boards

getting  into  businesses,  which compete  head-on  with  the

private   sector,  and  this  definitely  leads   to   unfair

competition  because of the strong backing of the  Government

agencies  they  are in.  The Government needs  to  have  more

trust  in  the  private  sector  and  develop  a  culture  of

outsourcing as many activities as possible, especially to the

private sector, and not only to the GLCs.  Similarly, Temasek

and  other Government agencies should actively look  out  for

opportunities to proactively divest companies which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



could  better  perform if they are run on  a  truly  private-sector  basis by inviting private-sector players  to  discuss

opportunities to be partners at the shareholder level.  I  am

not advocating that divestment be done blindly, but where  it

makes sense.  For example, it makes no sense to ask that  the

Government  divests SIA or PSA, because these  are  areas  we

obviously  have  world-class  competencies  and  the  current

structures will work well in the future.  There are, however,

many  more  businesses  where  the  Government  has  majority

control and which, in the long term, will not be viable  once

they  compete in the global marketplace.  Instead of  hanging

on  to  such  businesses until they collapse, it is  wise  to

divest  those to competent shareholders, whether  foreign  or

local.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to realise that in a globalised world,

Government's direct involvement in business can be viewed  as

a  big  negative and may not necessarily help  our  companies

when  they  attempt to internationalise.   Recently,  we  saw

glimpses  of  this  effect when the US Ambassador,  Mr  Frank

Lavin,   highlighted   the  concern   of   the   Government's

involvement  as  an  issue  which  may  hinder  some  of  the

negotiations  leading up to the signing  of  the  Free  Trade

Agreement.   He quoted the practices of GLCs as a significant

issue that has to be tackled before we can move forward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to emphasise that we

will only be successful in remaking the Singapore economy  if

we are prepared to change mindsets.  The Government has to be

prepared  to  play  a new role, with a lighter  touch,  while

Singaporeans and Singapore companies need to come forward  to

take on the responsibility of nation-building and in building

our   economy.   We  cannot  expect  the  Government  to   do

everything.  Neither should the Government expect to  be  the

sole  driver  in  the  whole  process.   Striking  the  right

partnership model between the public, private and the  people

sector  will be of utmost importance.  We can do it and  must

start immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the motion, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Minister of State for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Defence (Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion raised by the

Member  for Marine Parade GRC to thank the President for  his

Opening Address.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President spoke about the many challenges that

Singapore   faces.   Indeed,  rapid  changes  in  technology,

coupled  with  globalisation and the terrorist  threat,  will

pose a great challenge for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has said that it is making fundamental

changes to Singapore's economic strategy, from an investment-driven   economy   to  an  innovation-driven   economy.    In

restructuring the economy, we can expect dislocations in  our

society.   Whether we succeed depends not  only  on  our  new

economic  policies  but also on how Singaporeans  jell  as  a

people as we face the cut and thrust of our new challenges.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that Singapore will do

well  to  build  up its social capital.  Sociologist  Francis

Fukuyama defines social capital as "a set of informal  values

and  norms  shared  among members of  a  group  that  permits

cooperation  among them."  Society depends on social  capital

to  enable its members to coexist harmoniously even  as  they

retain their individual uniqueness.  High social capital will

benefit Singapore in at least a couple of ways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, social capital supports our new economic

strategy.  It is also a hedge against social disruptions that

may  arise from erratic economic performance and the widening

income gap, both of which are likely to characterise our  new

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it supports our defence strategy. Social

capital   acts  as  a  deterrent  against  conventional   and

asymmetrical warfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me discuss how social capital may

support  our  economic strategy.  National economic  planners

around  the  world are confronted with many  questions  about

sustaining their economic viability.  The overriding question

is  reduced to the following:  how does a nation justify  its

workers' wage premium over the wages paid by a plant in China

run  by  a  multi-national corporation with all  its  process

efficiency, high productivity and best practices culled  from

across  the world?  For good measure, China already  produces

half  of the world's air-conditioners, a third of the world's

refrigerators, and a quarter of the world's washing machines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To justify Singapore's wage premium, we are moving away

from  value-adding  activities to value-creating  activities,

from  production  efficiency  to  innovative  capacity.   The

problem  is  that many other countries are also pursuing  the

same  strategy.  They too know that land and capital  do  not

innovate.  Only humans do.  Therefore, human talent  will  be

hotly  sought after because it has become the most  important

factor of production.  In the battle for talents, the country

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



offers  the  best  homes will win the new economic  war,  and

social  capital is a pre-condition for good homes.  With  it,

we  will  have  better odds of keeping talented  Singaporeans

within  our shores and will not lose them through emigration.

It  will  also  attract new talents to  sink  roots  here  in

Singapore and help us rebuild our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To boost our social capital, we must continue to be

tough on crimes, especially heinous crimes and the types that

infringe  on  the rights of others.  Such crimes  reduce  the

society's radius of trust and deplete our social capital.  On

the other hand, I feel we must lighten up.  We need a mindset

change.  In Singapore, we want to do everything right but the

new paradigm is really about doing the right things.  We have

too many rules and regulations that lead to a national psyche

of  conformance,  a  conformance to the status  quo.   It  is

hardly an environment where creativity may flourish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to break this mould is to bring in more civil

servants  with  work  experiences  in  the  private   sector.

Another  way  is  to  allow selected  civil  servants  no-pay

sabbatical  leave  to pursue their private  sector  interest,

including  starting their own businesses.  If  they  succeed,

well  and  good.  Entrepreneurship in Singapore  will  get  a

boost.   If  not,  they will return to serve  in  the  public

sector and their so-called "failures" would put them in  good

stead.   They  will help formulate Government  policies  that

better  reflect the harsh realities in our brave  new  world.

They  can  then  tell their bosses in the various  Ministries

that  a  certain  policy has not worked  and  they  have  the

'battle  scars' to show for it.  Social capital  between  the

public and private sectors will therefore be enhanced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On education, although the streaming system in our

national  schools has been successful in reducing the  number

of  school  dropouts, we must find more ways for children  of

mixed  ability to interact so that the strong  may  help  the

weak and the formation of social capital may take root from a

young age.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has cautioned that Singapore is unlikely

to  perform at the sort of high economic growth rates that we

enjoyed  in  the  past.  I believe that not  only  would  our

growth  rates dip, they would also be more erratic.  That  is

the  nature  of the new beast.  This will put stress  on  our

society  and  therefore  developing more  social  capital  in

Singapore is a worthwhile and timely insurance against social

disruptions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, there is a widening income gap in

Singapore and it is not likely to get better.  The Government

can only do so much.  In fiscal policy, progressive tax rates

do help to redistribute income but if overdone, it will drive

away our high income earners to cheaper tax regimes.  It  is,

therefore, much better if income redistribution occurs  as  a

result  of  high social capital.  When managers and employees

elect  to cut salaries instead of jobs, it demonstrates  high

social  capital  in the organisation.  When  our  Government-linked companies lead our small and medium enterprises at the

vanguard of a geese flight formation as they expand and  seek

new  businesses,  social capital is generated.   The  Straits

Times'  School  Pocket Money Fund is  a  step  in  the  right

direction  in  building up our social capital.   Although  it

hardly closes the income gap, it is not inconsequential.   It

is  an  example  of how the seeds of giving and  sharing  are

sowed  from a young age.  Singapore's volunteerism rates  are

also  way  below those of the developed world.  We  ought  to

promote volunteerism in our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me move on to discuss how our

social  capital  may  support our  defence  strategy.   As  a

deterrent against conventional and terrorist attacks,  social

capital  is  no  less  important  than  sophisticated  weapon

systems and well-trained troops.  It was a lead from a civic-minded  resident  that  led  to  the  arrest  of  the  Jemaah

Islamiyah operatives in Singapore.  This person has prevented

untold harm on Singapore, and that is social capital at work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High social capital will go a long way in ensuring that

we will make it through



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



whatever  adversity together as a people.  The  will  of  our

people  to  preserve and defend our way of life is  the  best

assurance of enduring peace in Singapore.  And how might such

'will' be forged?  Through a set of shared values embraced by

all Singaporeans, or otherwise, known as social capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that, I support the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to take part  in

the  debate  on  the motion to thank the President   for  his

Address at the opening of this Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President mentioned in his Speech that the opening

up  of  the  Chinese  market will pose a great  challenge  to

countries in the region, including Singapore. China is a huge

country  with rich natural sources and low labour  cost.   It

has  all the conducive conditions to attract a lot of foreign

investments  to  China.  With the entry of  WTO  and  Olympic

Games  in  2008, China's economy is poised for a  great  leap

forward.   We must prepare ourselves in anticipation  of  the

further  opening  up of the China market and  the  challenges

that come with it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China's domestic market is gigantic and its low business

costs  are  already attracting and will continue  to  attract

substantial foreign investments to China.  These investments,

with  advanced technology and scientific management  know-how

that  come  with  them,  will improve the  quality  of  their

products  which are flooding the market at low  prices.  Five

years  ago, when you see a product with the "Made  in  China"

label,  you  would think twice before you decide to  buy  it.

Nowadays,  the  "Made in China" label is  already  widespread

throughout  Europe,  America and Asia.   These  products  are

welcomed  by the consumers everywhere because they are  cheap

and  good. This is particularly so in this time of recession.

Low  cost products become a very useful competitive edge over

others.  This capability to produce goods at lower production

cost  and  reasonably good quality has boosted the confidence

of foreign investors to go to China.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of China is very rapid, whether in urban

or   rural   areas.   Manufacturing,  finance  and  insurance

industries   are   developing  at   tremendous   speed,   and

enterprises are springing up in the various cities in  China.

The prospects are very good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years ago, when you go to Pudong, Shanghai, you

could probably still see a lot of chicken farms and pig farms

everywhere.  That  place was somewhat like Singapore  in  the

1960s.  At that time, Mr Chan Soo Sen told me that there  was

a  saying in Shanghai that, "You would rather have a  bed  in

Puxi, than to have a house in Pudong."  That goes to show how

backward Pudong was compared to Puxi.  Nobody wanted to  stay

in  Pudong, everybody wanted to enjoy the prosperity of Puxi.

But  now,  if  you  go  to Pudong, you  will  find  Pudong  a

beautifully  developed place with very attractive skyscrapers

and  many  five-star  international  hotels.  It  is  a  very

prosperous  city,  even more prosperous and infrastructurally

more advanced than our Orchard Road in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a few engineering students from our local

university who wanted to go for vocational attachment as part

of  their  studies overseas.  I suggested to them  that  they

should  go  to Shanghai, China. But they said "No" without  a

moment of hesitation.  I tried again to persuade them to give

Shanghai a try, but they were quite adamant against the idea.

Subsequently, for some reasons, they changed their  mind  and

went to Shanghai.  Upon their return, they told me that their

perception of China was entirely wrong.  Now that  they  have

seen  the development of Shanghai, they suddenly woke up  and

became aware of the rapid development of Shanghai. The  visit

there  was indeed an eye-opener for them.  The image of China

in  their  mind has changed, especially the massive buildings

and  the  clean urban environment left a very deep impression

in their minds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is Hong Kong. Under 99 years of British

colonial rule, Hong Kong became a trading centre and regional

financial hub. But it took China



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



only 15 years to turn the neighbouring Shenzhen from a swampy

slump into a prosperous special economic zone that gives Hong

Kong a run for their money.  This shows that China has a  lot

of financial resources and experience that they can draw upon

to   develop  other  cities,  and  to  have  better  economic

development.  Prime Minister Zhu Rongji has already said that

the development of China should not be concentrated in just a

handful  of big cities, like Beijing, Shanghai and  Shenzhen.

This  is  because by doing so, it will cause a lot of Chinese

nationals  to go into these cities and cause a lot of  social

problems.  He encouraged all cities and provinces to  develop

themselves so that there is a balanced development throughout

China. There are 36 provinces in China, and each province has

a  number  of  major cities which possess the conditions  for

economic development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For foreign investors, if you have big capital, then you

should  go  to  the  big  cities like Shanghai,  Beijing  and

Shenzhen  to  invest.  As it is said,  the  big  ocean-liners

should  sail  in the big ocean. But if they do not  have  big

capital to invest, you should go to the smaller cities to try

your  luck.   Because if you are a small little  sampan,  you

would  better ply it in the streams and rivers, but  not  the

big seas or oceans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I represented EM Services Pte Ltd Company and

two  other local public-listed companies, we took a  trip  to

the  Gangzhou  City, Jiangxi Province, to do  an  on-location

survey and to explore the possibilities of investments there.

Gangzhou may be a small city with only eight million  people,

but  it is rich in resources.  With the view of taking  their

development  to a higher level, they built a highway  linking

Guangzhou,  the  capital  city of  Guangdong  Province.  This

highway  will certainly expedite its development plan.   Now,

if you travel by car from Guangzhou to Gangzhou, it will take

you  some  eight hours. By 2004, with the completion  of  the

super  highway,  the same journey would take  just  over  two

hours to complete.  With this kind of construction, you  will

be  able to expedite the development of the industrial parks.

At the moment, Japanese investors have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



already  moved  in  to capture the opportunities  offered  by

Gangzhou.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to attract more foreign investments into the

new  investment areas, a lot of incentives are being offered.

Take  the land price, for example, one mu (= 0.0667 hectares)

of land, with electricity, water, gas, telecommunications and

access.  The government charges RMB$20,000, i.e. only S$5,000

per  mu  (668  sqm2)  and is tax free for  five  years.   The

monthly  wage for a worker is between RMB$800-1000, that  is,

between  S$200  and S$250.  The government  gives  them  five

years  of tax holidays.  In terms of public relations, senior

government officials from the mayors down to the heads of the

various departments would personally come down to explain the

various development projects to the potential investors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During our visit there, we were warmly received and well

treated. All these officials are very young, very capable and

full  of energy.  After the meeting, we were invited to  join

them  for  dinner.   In ancient times,  you  drank  wine  and

recited  poetry  at the banquets.  But now, the  new  way  of

doing business is to drink and talk business.  The idea is to

close  their business deals as fast as possible.  When we  go

to  China for business, we should not rush back to our  hotel

rooms  to write reports immediately after the meetings.   The

idea  is  to go and have dinner together with your host.   At

the meeting room, they will inevitably quote you the official

prices.  But,  after  a few rounds of  drinks,  you  will  be

offered  the preferential prices.  I can see Mr Chan Soo  Sen

nodding  his head.  I think he agrees with what I am  saying.

When  doing business in China, it is very important that  you

build  up  good inter-personal relationship with the relevant

people in China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that in the next few years, China will be able

to  achieve very high economic growth. They forecast a growth

rate  of  between  7%  and 8% and this is  a  very  realistic

objective  based on the factors that they have a big  market,

low cost and an attractive incentive pack-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



age.  Our Government should thoroughly explore the terms  and

conditions  and  encourage our investors to  go  there.   Our

costs  are high, our incentives are not good enough and hence

we  are  losing  out  to China in the attraction  of  foreign

investments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the Economic Review Committee be

bold  enough  to  thoroughly review and  recommend  effective

measures  to deal with the high cost of business,  like  high

rentals,  high  utilities charges, high  cost  of  transport,

etc.,  which  are  contributing to the  high  cost  of  doing

business  here.   We  know that in the next  few  years,  the

growth  prospect in China is like the rising  sun.   We  must

think of ways and means to set up a partnership with China to

make  use  of  their favourable conditions and advantages  in

line  with  our advantages.  We hope that MTI will  introduce

potential investors to go and set up joint ventures in China.

At  the  same  time,  we  must also  encourage  our  SMEs  in

Singapore   to  pool  their  resources  together   to   build

consortiums  with enough capital and financial  resources  to

compete with other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To invest in China, from my personal experience, the

following  points must be observed: firstly, we must  find  a

reliable  and sincere trading partner. You must  explore  the

investment  atmosphere and then seize the opportunity  to  do

what  you should do.  Secondly, you must build up good inter-personal relationship with the Chinese partners.  Learn  from

Mr  Chan  Soo  Sen.   When  deciding  on  the  size  of  your

investment there, you must cut your dress according  to  your

cloth.   Start from small, and gradually build up your  scale

at the appropriate time, and then you have a better chance of

success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the business world is like a battle

field.   You  may  win, you may lose. But,  as  it  is  said,

"Failure  is  the mother of success." We should  not  be  too

depressed  and distraught when your venture fails.   Buck  up

your  courage to learn from your mistakes and then start  all

over again.  One day, success will come your way. In order to

help our entrepreneurs invest overseas and be successful,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



I  suggest  that the Ministry of Trade and Industry  join  up

with  the  Chinese Chamber of Commerce to set up an  Overseas

Investment Consultative Committee, and invite all members and

potential  entrepreneurs to join this  committee.   They  can

then  share  their success stories and lessons in failure  so

that   we   can  prepare  our  potential  investors  overseas

psychologically to take on the challenges.   They  must  have

the  entrepreneurship spirit in them so that they can  invest

in overseas countries with success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When investing overseas, some succeed, some fail. Let

me  give  you some examples.  Mr Chua Kim Hua is the Chairman

of  King  Wan  Corporation Ltd, a listed  company  which  has

invested  in  a  number  of projects in  many  provinces  and

municipalities  in  China.  Recently, the Chinese  government

passed a regulation that all buildings six-storeys and  above

must  be  white-washed  regularly. With  his  sharp  business

acumen,  Mr Chua immediately decided to seize the opportunity

to  set  up a paint factory in China to produce the materials

necessary for all these white-washing works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chua went to the province of Hubei to make a

feasibility  study  and decided to set up  his  plant  there.

Right from the beginning of the negotiation, the officials of

the  industrial  park, like the Jurong  Town  Corporation  in

Singapore,   took  the  proposal  seriously  and   personally

accompanied  us to visit the proposed site.    Upon  visiting

the  site  and speaking to the officials, Mr Chua decided  to

take  the piece of land offered to him and to build his plant

there.  On the same day, he went to the officials' office  to

negotiate  the price and eventually signed the contract.   Mr

Chua  told  them  that he was returning to Singapore  in  two

days'  time as he had some urgent matters to attend  to.  The

officials  told him to go back the following  day,  and  that

they would prepare all the documentation for him to sign, and

construction work could commence straightaway.  Mr Chua  went

back  to  office  the  following  day,  sceptical  that   the

documentation could be completed by then. To his surprise, he

found officials from all the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



relevant  authorities,  such as the  officers  in  charge  of

utilities,  land  use,  sewerage, etc.   A  truly  "one-stop"

service.   Mr  Chua  was  very impressed  with  the  kind  of

services  provided.   He asked the officials,  "How  did  you

manage to organise all these in so short a time?"  They  told

Mr Chua, "We learnt this from Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do have "one-stop" service, but it simply means "one

department one stop".  If we have three permits to apply,  we

have  to  go to three departments. But in China, they  learnt

from  us  and improved on it.  They call it the "one  dragon"

system  (a  coordinated process).  All the  services  of  the

various  ministries  and  departments   are  coordinated  and

linked up and aligned - like one dragon.   You just go to the

dragon and all the necessary procedures are dealt with at one

go.   So,  because of this "one dragon" system, Mr Chua,  was

able to get things done expeditiously, and start work on  the

paint  plant  almost immediately.  The way things  are  being

done  with  such efficiency and speed is indeed  frightening.

They  are  even prepared to work late into the night.  Before

long, the plant was ready for production, and the market  was

captured.  Of  course, Mr Chua and his company have  profited

through  this  project  and  even the  shareholders  back  in

Singapore  also made a lot of money when the share prices  go

up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that in times of difficulties in our economy,

changes  should  be made to the way we do business.   Venture

overseas  and  search for opportunities. Make a profit,  even

the  people  back home will benefit.  There  is  this  famous

saying,  "Poverty gives rise to a desire for change.  Changes

will  lead  to  a  breakthrough." This is one  way  of  doing

business.   We have a lot of good entrepreneurs in  Singapore

and we could learn from them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, primarily, I believe that Singapore has

done  well over the past few decades. If we continue to  work

hard, and with a strong spirit of entrepreneurship, I am sure

that  Singapore  will do well in the future  and  enjoy  good

economic growth.  Our prosperity will be sustained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, between the Opening

of  the Ninth Parliament and this one, so much has changed in

the world.  Five years ago, we were brimming with confidence.

The  then  President  spoke of prospects for  Singapore  that

seldom  looked better and of seizing opportunities that  were

coming  our  way.   Nobody then foresaw  that  within  a  few

months,  the Asian financial crisis would engulf us,  Suharto

would  fall  from power in Indonesia and Singapore  would  go

through  two major economic crises.  The dream of  more  good

years  for  Singaporeans would be put on hold, as they  would

find  themselves losing their jobs.  Asset enhancement  would

become asset disenchantment, as Singaporeans saw the value of

their  properties and other investments fall.   With  falling

incomes,   many   would  find  themselves  faced   with   the

difficulties   of  paying  the  mortgage  on   their   homes.

Certainly,  nobody  at  that  time  would  have  imagined  an

economic  downturn and the sight of Singaporeans now  queuing

up  to collect money from their MPs to give them relief.  And

most  certainly, none of us ever thought it possible that  we

will  ever see the sight of two airplanes plunging  into  the

World  Trade Centre in New York.  It was something that could

have come out of a movie, but when we saw it happen on TV, it

was  for real, and it was an event that would eventually lead

to  the  possibility of terrorism rearing itself on our  very

doorsteps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amidst these dramatic events, the Government called an

election before it was due in order that it could clearly get

down  to  tackling  the problems that  suddenly  seem  to  be

raining  like a thunderstorm on us.  We wanted to be able  to

quickly  provide hope for our people.  It was, in my opinion,

a right move.  And these are the pressing issues that we have

now  before  us,  the  deepest recession since  independence,

unemployment,  finding  jobs for our  people,  high  business

cost,   our  economic  competitiveness,  the  tudung   issue,

relations with our neighbours and terrorism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it somewhat baffled me that while we went out to

seek a new mandate from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



the  people  very  quickly, it took almost  five  months  for

Parliament  to  be convened in order that the representatives

of  the  people could meet to discuss the issues that are  so

crucial   to   Singaporeans  and  to   our   future.    While

Singaporeans  know well that they have a Government  that  is

efficient and dependable and can deal with the problems, they

too  want  to  see their elected representatives  in  action,

airing  their grievances, probing the Government and offering

suggestions  that can improve their lives,  especially  at  a

time  like  this when so many critical events  are  unfolding

before them and are affecting their lives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am in no way suggesting that the Government is

not seeking to engage Parliament, far from it.  Having been a

Member  of this House for a long time, I can attest that  the

Government   has   not  shirked  in  its  accountability   to

Parliament,  and  it  can  handle convincingly  most  of  the

criticisms  levelled against it.  But this  time,  now,  more

than  ever, there are so many urgent issues that should  have

been discussed, and sooner, rather than later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can therefore well understand the scepticism of many

Singaporeans  of  our political process.   Some  Singaporeans

tell  me that the Government makes all the decisions.  It  is

all  done  behind closed doors.  They ask for  feedback.   We

know they hear us, but do they listen enough?  Sir, questions

like  these  are  perplexing to me.   Yet,  I  was  heartened

yesterday to hear Mr Khaw Boon Wan tell the House that  there

was no lack of young Singaporeans, particularly those abroad,

responding  positively with feedback to the  Economic  Review

Committee.   And when I heard the President telling  us  last

week  that  we  need  to  open up  more  space  for  them  to

participate in the national debate, I know we have made  some

progress in the right direction.  But I still ask myself  why

do  most  Singaporeans  still feel this  way  about  us,  the

Government and Parliament.  Why do they feel left out of  the

political and decision making process?  So I ask myself,  are

we  missing  something here?  Maybe it is  their  failure  to

understand  how  we  arrive  at  our  decisions,  whether  in

Parliament or in the Executive branch.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



Perhaps part of this failure to understand us lies in the way

we do things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also find myself grappling further with questions like

these:   why  are  Singaporeans, particularly  younger  ones,

cynical  of our political process?  How can we be  more  open

with  the  way we arrive at our decisions, so that  they  can

understand  that policies are not made and rammed down  their

throats,  but that every conceivable alternative  and  option

would  have been weighed and pondered over before  the  final

decision  is taken?  Perhaps we are sometimes too  efficient,

or  some  may say, too business-like in the way we do things.

After  all,  we  dispose  of  our  parliamentary  work   very

expediently.   We  pass  Bills  very  efficiently,  sometimes

hardly without any debate.  There is nothing wrong with that,

but  maybe we should pause at times and fine-tune some of the

things by incorporating many of the good suggestions made  by

MPs  during  debates.  It is indeed a rare occasion  in  this

House  where  a Minister accepts changes to be  made  to  his

Bill, except as one Minister once put it, "I guess I can live

with the changes if they are just commas and full-stops."  Or

we  may  want  to  consider  sending  more  Bills  to  Select

Committees  so  that  we  can engage participation  from  the

public.   I  think we may have overlooked this point  in  the

last Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Seventh Parliament, we committed seven

Bills, and in the Eighth Parliament, we committed nine  Bills

to  Select  Committees.   But in the Ninth  Parliament,  only

three  Bills  were  sent to Select Committees.   And  I  find

myself  asking further, having seen how GPCs have  worked  in

this  House:  Has the GPC system proven so effective for  the

Government  in that it allows the Backbenchers to thrash  out

issues  with Ministers behind closed-doors?  Has it  been  so

effective to the extent that by the time the issues reach the

floor  of the House, much has been conveniently resolved,  or

as  they say, the sting has been taken out, so much that  the

public   perceives  our  Backbenchers  to   be   either   too

understanding  or  amenable  of  the  Government's  position?

After all, Sir, no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



matter  how much we disagree, we always start off or end  off

our speeches by saying, "We support the Bill", even if we  do

not mean it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this just a case of misperception on the part of the

public?  Is it the way the Government handles MPs' criticisms

and  proposals that leads the public to think  that  MPs  are

less  effective than they would want them to be?  Sir,  there

are  MPs  and  MPs.  Likewise, there are also  Ministers  and

Ministers.  Like MPs, Ministers too come in all shades.  Some

are more receptive than others.  But I have seen on occasions

how  sometimes a Minister can, if I may put it  in  a  gentle

way,  bristle  at some of the criticisms levied  against  his

policies.  But parliamentary debate is all about cutting  and

thrusting  at one another.  Our Backbenchers have often  been

reminded  to be responsible for what they say, and they  must

be  prepared  to  face the rebuttals because  Ministers  will

defend  their  policies  robustly.   That  is  correct.   But

Ministers too must accept that where criticisms are valid and

where suggestions are good, they must be receptive enough  to

accept them and to give credit where credit is due.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just give two examples. Sir, for many years, MPs

have been arguing for compulsory education.  In recent years,

Mr Chiam See Tong, Mdm Claire Chiang, Dr Wang Kai Yuen, among

others,  made  the  plea.   I have always  found  that  their

arguments  were  sound.   But  it  was  always  difficult  to

convince the Minister and even his predecessors.  Finally, we

had  a  Committee on Compulsory Education to study the matter

and  we got the Act passed two years ago.  In my mind, it was

an  issue,  based  on the merits that were expounded  in  the

House,  that  should  have been settled  sooner  rather  than

later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, the Member for Kreta Ayer-Tanglin GRC

(Kim  Seng) asked for subsidised breast cancer screening  for

women.   The  now famous, or is it infamous, reply  from  the

Minister was, "What's all the big fuss about?  After all, the

test  costs  less  than the price of a hairdo."   Well,  some

months  passed and now his Ministry has announced  that  such

subsidised tests will now be given.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is nothing wrong with a turn-around of

policy.   MPs are merely reflecting the ground sentiment  and

the  merits of their arguments may have belatedly  dawned  on

the  Ministers.  But my grouse is that in such instances, and

there  are also other instances in the past, not a squeak  of

acknowledgement  was given to the MPs who  first  raised  the

matter.   And  I think if we acknowledge that the suggestions

did originate from the Backbenchers, it will go a long way to

enhance their credibility as elected representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to the subject of how we can encourage

more  active  debate in the House.  The People's  Alternative

Forum or so-called "Shadow Cabinet" was, in my opinion, a non-starter.   Nobody really gave any credibility to  the  notion

that   the  Government  would  want  to  structure  its   own

Opposition.  Anyway, what is a "Shadow Cabinet"?  A shadow is

something that does what I do.  If I stand, it stands;  if  I

sit,  it sits; if I run, it runs.  So now much buzz is  given

to  the lifting of the Whip.  MPs of the ruling party may ask

for permission to vote freely on a case-by-case basis, except

for  some crucial areas.  And the Whip will be lifted for all

matters  of conscience and selected issues.  So what is  new,

Sir?  I still have to get permission to disagree.  Matters of

conscience?   It  is  a  term which has  never  been  clearly

defined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if to show how generous we have been in lifting the

Whip, we always take a kind of skewed pride in parading as an

example,  our  lifting of the Whip during the debate  on  the

Abortion Bill.  But, Sir, that was 33 years ago!  Since then,

we  have lifted the Whip only on two other occasions: in 1979

when  we debated the revised structure of education;  and  in

1992  when there was a motion whether to accept NMPs or  not.

Even then, when Parliament debated whether to have NMPs again

in 1997, the Whip was not lifted.  So it is three times in 37

years!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not the first time we have asked MPs to

speak up.  When I first came



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



to this House in 1976, it was already a one-party Parliament.

So Backbenchers were told that we had to play the role of the

Opposition and to reflect the coffee-shop talk.  One MP  told

me that the call was similar to the words of Mao Zedong: "Let

a  thousand flowers bloom".  But the MP also advised me  that

when flowers bloom, they get chopped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, towards the end of the 80s and the early 90s when

we  moved towards a more open and consultative Government, OB

markers,  as  they  are  called,  were  then  put  in  place,

undefined as they were, to limit the discussion space.  So  I

ask  now, if we really mean it this time, if we want to  ease

up, why do we need to impose the Whip at all?  After all,  we

have  such an overwhelming majority in this House that it  is

inconceivable that the Government would ever be defeated in a

vote.   There is another reason why this suggestion,  radical

as  it  may sound to some, is "safe" for the Government.   By

and  large,  Sir, I have found that its arguments  have  been

sound.   It  will take a lot for an MP to take a decision  to

vote against his own party very lightly.  An MP who chalks up

a  record of consistently voting against his own party cannot

in all conscience bring himself to face the electorate on his

party  platform, of which he has been so critical,  the  next

time  round.   And if the Government should ever  smell  that

there  are  just  too many MPs disagreeing with  whatever  it

intends  to  do, then there has to be something fundamentally

wrong  with the policy and it should go back to the  drawing-board.   We  need only impose the Whip on crucial  matters  - money   matters,   motion  of  no-confidence,  constitutional

changes  -  and  not  lift it only when the  Government  Whip

decides to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have now one last suggestion and how to curb the

cynicism  of Singaporeans about our decision-making  process.

On  important  issues,  I feel that we should  let  Ministers

state their individual views.  I have often heard the remark,

again  from  cynical  Singaporeans, that on  practically  all

issues, all Ministers share the same view.  It was as if  one

person had singled-handedly orchestrated their response to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



anything.   Now  we  all  know  that  great  minds   do   not

necessarily think alike, at least not on everything  and  not

all  the time.  Can we not allow Ministers to state their own

views  freely  before the final decision  is  taken?   And  I

think, Sir, we must find a workable formula for this, without

compromising  on  the principle of collective  responsibility

and confidentiality in Cabinet because if we have good men in

Cabinet, like Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Mr Raymond Lim, both

of  whom  have up till now been respected by the  public  for

their  individualistic sound arguments, sometimes views which

are  against  the  establishment, they are men  who,  as  the

latest cliche goes, can think out of the box - but may I  add

that I hope the box will not be crushed - if we allow them to

freely  expound  their  views  before  decisions  are  taken,

Singaporeans  can  only  stand  to  benefit  greatly  by  the

diversity  of views that they can bring and can  then  better

understand how decisions are finally arrived at.  [Applause.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support  the Motion of Thanks to the President.  I intend  to

take  the  former Speaker, Mr Tan Soo Khoon's  suggestion  to

heart and state my individual views, crushed or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Address, the President saw the road ahead as one

in   which   there  must  be  greater  civic  and   political

engagement.  I fully support that.  I am convinced  that  the

only  way for us to succeed as a society is that we recognise

that we are a community and not just a place with 3.2 million

individuals.  Our future is bound to one another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all too often these days, we have Singaporeans

who  make  demands  on  the Government as  though  they  were

impatient   customers  waiting  for  service  in  a   crowded

restaurant  or  rowdy spectators at a soccer  game.   Yet,  I

believe  that  for  democratic government  to  be  effective,

people need to take their civic duties seriously.  This means

that  we  are more than just spectators or customers  of  the

Government but we, as citizens of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



country, have responsibilities not just to ourselves  but  to

each other in the public sphere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this was why I was heartened to hear the President

declare  that the Government is committed towards a  stronger

civic society.  He said that this was necessary if we want to

foster   a  spirit  of  enterprise  and  risk  taking   among

Singaporeans.  He is right.  But equally as important, if not

more,  is  that a vibrant civic society helps to  deepen  the

emotional  attachment  that  Singaporeans  feel  towards  our

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago, George Yeo argued that to develop the

Singapore  soul, we need to have a lively civic society.   He

quoted  Edmund  Burke who said that, ". to love  that  little

platoon we belong to in society, is the first principle  (the

germ  as it were) of public affections.  It is the first link

in  the  series  by which we proceed towards a  love  to  our

country, and to mankind."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share this view. I believe that we should encourage

self-organised  communities.   The  active  participation  of

Singaporeans  in  these  communities can  help  our  citizens

develop a stronger sense of belonging to the larger Singapore

community by forming strong bonds with their fellow  citizens

and participating in community life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to facilitate this is for the Government to

revamp  the Societies Act.  It has served us well.   But  the

issue today is whether it is relevant for the sort of society

we want in the future.  We want to foster a greater spirit of

community  initiative and responsibility.  My  suggestion  is

that  we  empower our citizens to form societies,  clubs  and

associations by changing the Act to one of self-registration.

Somewhat  akin to the airport customs regime, which is  self-declaratory,  there  will be a green zone  and  a  red  zone.

Those  societies, which are not religious, race  or  foreign-linked,  will  be automatically registered upon  declaration.

That  is  the green zone.  Those that are religious, race  or

foreign-linked, need to go through the red zone.   This  does

not necessarily



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



mean that they will be prohibited but that certain checks may

be needed to be carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a false declaration, then those who are

responsible for it will have to answer for it.  This must  be

so.  The greater the freedom, the greater the responsibility.

Minimum  regulation  must entail maximum accountability.   As

George  Bernard  Shaw  said, "Liberty  means  responsibility.

That is why so many men dread it."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these changes were effected in the Act, it would mark

a  significant  step towards greater citizen  engagement  and

empowerment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February this year, the Government launched the

Remaking  Singapore Committee.  Its task was  to  relook  the

political,  social and cultural aspect of  Singapore.   There

has  been  a  fair amount of cynicism since its launch.   Its

critics  say that it is nothing more than a 2002  version  of

the  1990s  Singapore 21 consultative process and  the  1980s

Agenda  for  Action  advisory panels.  They  argue  that  the

various  "Beyond  Cs" committees should  go  beyond  talk  to

action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that some actionable outcomes are desirable.

But I feel that civic participation should not be measured by

its  immediate results.  Its value is not just whether  there

has  been  useful  feedback  to  the  Government  or  whether

suggestions  have  been acted upon by the Government.   These

are  important.   But what is critical is that  we  recognise

that  it is only through active citizen involvement that  our

people learn about the realities and constraints of living in

a  modern, complex and plural society.  Resources are finite,

priorities  will shift and trade-offs are inevitable.   These

political  skills  of  negotiation and  compromise  that  are

necessary  to ensure a healthy democracy can only be  learned

if  we  give  not  just politicians but all Singaporeans  the

opportunity to be involved in matters that affect  our  lives

and our country.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to put my money where my mouth is. To my

knowledge,  Mr  Steve Chia has not offered  to  serve  in  my

subcommittee  in the Remaking Singapore Committee.   But  now

that I know he is keen, I am happy to invite him to serve  in

the focus group headed by Dr Warren Lee.  I am doing this not

because  he  is  a politician, but because  he  is  a  fellow

Singaporean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not do this, then two characteristics of civil

life  in Singapore will continue.  One is that whenever there

is  a  problem, Singaporeans have a tendency to turn  to  the

Government  to  solve it or arbitrate.   The  other  is  that

whenever  there  is  a  national  issue,  the  debate   often

polarises  itself  into  the Government  versus  the  people.

Instead  of  the  public being "anti"  a  particular  law  or

policy, it becomes "anti" the Government or the State.   Yet,

there  are  other parties interested in the  outcome  of  the

debate, but they are slow to speak up.  Even if they  do  not

agree with the others, a good number do not speak up as  they

expect  the Government to resolve or manage the problem.   We

need  a  more textured, layered civic society rather  than  a

flat  sheet  with  occasional wrinkles that  get  reflexively

straightened out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the right to speak up is fundamental to an open

society.  However, this needs practice, or it will get  rusty

through neglect.  Some have argued that this reluctance stems

from fear of retribution.  But if you look at the Forum pages

of  the newspapers each day and the columns written by  local

journalists,  some  are  openly and  fearlessly  critical  of

Government  policies.  Obviously, the fear that  there  is  a

chance  that  they may be hit by a big stick has not  stopped

them   from   speaking   their  minds.    I   applaud   these

Singaporeans.   Others should learn from them.   As  Franklin

Roosevelt  said,  "The only thing we have  to  fear  is  fear

itself."   The  Government has said that  it  is  serious  in

wanting  Singaporeans to speak up and be counted.  We  should

take  them at their word and hold them to it.  The Government

is  ultimately ourselves and not an alien power over us.  The

choice thus really lies with us and no one else.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To seek assurances from the Government that we will only

be  treated with kid gloves is to be asked to be treated like

political adolescents.  If we say we are grown up and  should

have a say in matters that affect our future, then I think we

should  look things in the eye, exercise our rights and  take

things  as  they come.  Public debate is seldom  like  a  tea

party  where  we politely discuss the cakes and drinks.   The

responses  sometimes not just from the Government but  others

that disagree from us will be robust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an example. In the PAP Convention in

November last year, I argued that, to effectively govern  the

country,   the  PAP  must  widen  the  circle  of   political

participation.   A day after that, an irate Singaporean  sent

me  an e-mail, attacking me personally and attributed what he

sees  as  the contentiousness of the young to people like  me

who  support the Prime Minister's policy of greater  openness

and  consultation.   I took this as par  for  the  course  in

public  life.  It is far better to have a response even  when

it  is  unpleasant than to have no reaction at all.  At least

you  know  then that not everyone was asleep while  you  were

speaking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should not be important to us whether we get a purr

or  roar from those who engage us.  What is vital is that the

Government  and  us  - the citizens of this  country  -  work

together  to  nurture  a  political  culture  that  not  just

tolerates but respects differing points of views.  In such  a

culture,  people will learn to appreciate that just  as  they

have  a  right to their views, others do too and the eventual

outcome may thus be different from what they desire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reporter asked me recently, that given this view of

mine,  how do I reconcile this with the Government's  attacks

on former Fateha chief, Zulfikar Mohamad Shariff.  I told him

there is nothing to reconcile.  The problem with Zulfikar  is

not  so  much his opinions as his extremism.  What  is  wrong

with extremists is their intolerance.  The danger is not what

they  say  about  their cause but what they say  about  their

opponents.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the case of Zulkifli Baharudin, a former Nominated

Member of this House.  He told me that after he had spoken up

against  Zulfikar, he had to endure vicious personal attacks,

not  just on himself but members of his family, on the Fateha

website.  Zulkifli had the courage to speak up even though he

knew  he  would  be vilified.  Many more I felt  should  have

spoken up.  For those who think that it is safer not to  take

sides,  they will do well to note this - people who  stay  in

the middle of the road, simply get run over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should never allow the extremists to set the agenda

of  our  society.  This is especially so when the  extremists

come  garbed  in religious or ethnic clothings.   Ours  is  a

young nation where the primordial pull of race, religion  and

culture  remains  potent.   Potent  enough  to  shatter   the

internal  social cohesion that we currently enjoy.   This  is

the reality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what we need to balance the pull of religion, race

and  culture  is a strong sense of who we are  as  a  people.

When  we  speak  of  a lively civic society  as  being  vital

towards   developing   a  strong  emotional   attachment   to

Singapore, we need to ask what are we attached to.   Exactly,

who are we and what do we stand for?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a young society, we have no deep roots or traditions.

To maintain our cohesiveness as a society, we need to develop

a  national identity which all communities can relate to  and

which  will  guide  our national life.  This  will  serve  to

anchor  Singaporeans  to  the country  and  ensure  that  our

society  is more resilient to the natural rifts that  run  in

it.   Singapore  21  and  the 1988  Five  Shared  Values  are

attempts in this direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we need to start at the basics and begin at the

beginning,  which is how Singapore, as we know it today,  was

born.  Every nation has its point of origin and enshrines its

birth  pangs  in  a "myth of creation".  This basic  identity

founded on consensus is critical to every society's sense  of

origin and pride in itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not make the Pledge do this? Yesterday, it was not

surprising that when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>



three naturalised citizens spoke in this House - Ms Irene Ng,

Dr  Amy  Khor, Mr Khaw Boon Wan, and they were talking  about

core  values that underpin Singapore - they used the language

of  the Pledge.  I firmly believe that who we are and what we

stand  for  as a people are well encapsulated by the  Pledge.

The  Pledge  was  written at the time of our nation's  birth.

This  gives  it a special, haloed significance.  It  was  the

founding  compact  which our leaders  and  people  made  with

destiny.  A destiny which at that time was fraught with  huge

uncertainties.   It  was  not clear then  that  the  founding

values of multi-racialism and meritocracy as enshrined in the

Pledge  would survive this fledging nation.  We had to  leave

Malaysia   because  we  rejected  race-based  politics.    It

brought out the best in us, in the worst of times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore 21 and the 1988 Five Shared Values do not

quite  have  the same weight as the Pledge.   They  can  help

instead to inform the Pledge as guiding principles to realise

these  founding  ideals of our nation at birth.   Ours  is  a

small house and we have a tendency at times to rearrange  the

furniture somewhat.  But some things, such as the essence  of

what  we  are as a people, we should be very slow to  change.

The  Pledge is our anthem in prose.  We should not  just  get

our  young  to recite it in mind numbing fashion.  We  should

teach  them its genesis, its significance and its meaning  to

us as a people.  We should strongly encourage our children to

give life to it, to live their lives by these founding ideals

so  that  generations to come would understand when they  put

fist to heart what it means to be a Singaporean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just as the Pledge was conceived at a

time of immense turbulence, the challenges of the future,  as

the President said, are equally as formidable.  That founding

generation which led us from Third World to First was truly a

gutsy,   extraordinary   and  exceptional   generation.    My

generation has the privilege and good fortune to stand on the

shoulders of these giants.  Our covenant to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



them  and  to the people of Singapore is that we will  ensure

that  this improbable nation created by the indomitable  will

of these men and women, will continue not just to be a robust

reality  but  a scintillating success.  That is our  mission.

We intend to fulfil it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, thank you very much for allowing me to join  in

the debate.  I too would like to reiterate my support for the

Motion of Thanks to the President at the Opening of the Tenth

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many hon. Members have spoken on the importance of

a  strong tripartite relationship and how tripartism can help

us  to ride out this period of economic difficulties.  Others

have spoken on the plight of the unemployed, especially older

workers,  and how difficult it is for them to find a  job  in

this new environment of higher unemployment rate.  Even those

who  are  today employed are feeling an increasing  sense  of

insecurity  as  competition chips  away  at  their  company's

businesses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a totally new situation, one which many

Singaporeans  may not have experienced in the  past.   If  we

look back, except for the brief periods between 1985 and 1987

and,  again,  in  1998 and 1999, when our economy  went  into

recession, we have been able to enjoy steady economic  growth

for  the  past  three decades or more.  This translates  into

almost  30  years  of  very low unemployment,  three  decades

during which jobs were plentiful for our school leavers,  our

polytechnic  and our university graduates.  It was  one  long

period of tight labour market when the Ministry of Labour and

Ministry  of  Manpower had to entertain and  had  to  try  to

satisfy  the unending demand of employers for more  and  more

workers.   Today, it is different.  And in fact, perhaps  the

long   period   of  tight  labour  market  had  caused   many

Singaporeans  to feel secure in the sense that a  well-paying

job can be had with minimum effort.  It is almost a matter of

right  for  graduates that well-paying jobs await  them  upon

graduation, and that life is just one long beautiful spring.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the President stated in his Address, the Asian

financial crisis in 1997 followed by the economic tailspin of

all  the regional economies had altered the situation.   That

this  took place during a period of globalisation with  major

changes  and adjustments in the flow of trade and investments

had  added  to  the  pressures on  Singapore  and  the  other

regional  players.  China had entered the WTO  last  November

and  is already exerting an extraordinary pull on investments

and  shifting  the balance of competition with  its  enormous

market,  manpower and other production resources.  Singapore,

with  our  very  limited manpower resources, cannot  hope  to

compete  head on with such an economic juggernaut.   We  must

prepare  our workers for the inevitable restructuring  if  we

are to recover and prosper again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last September, I had the privilege of accompanying

the President on his visit to China.  Everywhere we went,  we

saw signs of change.  In Xian, which I first visited in 1985,

the  old ramshackle building which housed the display of  one

of  China's national treasures, the terracotta warriors,  had

been  replaced by a modern museum, which would be  the  pride

and  joy  of  any city.  Coastal cities, such as Xiamen,  had

become  hives of economic activities, with world-class hotels

and  high-rise commercial buildings and industrial complexes.

Shanghai's  Pudong  had risen out of the  farmlands  which  I

first  saw  in 1986.  Shanghai itself had an almost  palpable

beat and dynamism.  It is certainly going places.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President visited one of their latest projects

in  Shanghai,  an  ultra-modern high-tech  wafer  fabrication

plant.    It   was  fully  automated,  with  state-of-the-art

production equipment.  The manager told me that they  had  no

difficulty recruiting engineers.  Of course, wages are  at  a

fraction  of what engineers would be paid in Singapore.   But

what  was  more telling than the fact that they had an  ample

supply  of  ready and well-trained workers was  that,  within

this  wafer fabrication plant, there was in effect a lifelong

learning  institution.   As  we were  shown  around,  we  saw

classrooms and lecture



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



theatres, and there were workers and engineers who were  off-duty, not working, but learning.  Their employees within  the

wafer fabrication plant were able to sign up for a variety of

skills  upgrading  and even professional courses.   Employees

were  not  just satisfied with landing a good job,  but  they

were all aiming higher.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can we afford to be different? Can we afford to be

complacent?   As we set out to remake the Singapore  economy,

it  is  instructive for us to look around  the  region.   Our

workers  must  not feel complacent with the job  skills  that

they  have  today.   The rapid pace of technological  changes

will make these skills outdated very quickly.  Those who  are

unemployed, face the challenge of acquiring new skills.  They

have to compete with younger and better-educated Singaporeans

who are entering the job market by the thousands each year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is dedicated to upgrading

the  skills  of our workers and enhancing their employability

in  the  new economic environment.  The going is  tough.   It

will  get  tougher in the years ahead of us.   Jobs  and  low

unemployment cannot be taken for granted.  We must  learn  to

tackle  the  growing structural unemployment.  Older  workers

must acquire new skills, so as not to end up in the ranks  of

the long-term unemployed.  We already have programmes such as

the   Skills   Redevelopment   Programme,   National   Skills

Recognition System, National IT Literacy Programme and others

which  are  running  at  full speed.   These  programmes  are

focused on bringing the most vulnerable group of workers, ie,

the  older  and the lower-skilled workers, up  to  the  basic

levels  required  for  the new jobs.   We  will  develop  new

programmes to reinforce those in place and also to reach  out

to  more  workers  facing the threat of displacement  as  the

economy changes gear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to respond to the hon. Member

Ms  Irene  Ng  who yesterday spoke on the need for  an  Equal

Opportunity Commission, and here I would like to say  that  I

take to heart what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



the  hon.  Member  Mr Tan Soo Khoon mentioned  earlier  about

Ministers bristling at suggestions from the Backbench.  I  am

certainly  not bristling at the suggestion.  I just  want  to

take  this opportunity to point out some pros and cons as  we

consider an Equal Opportunity Commission or such like.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I have to state that I agree

wholeheartedly  with  the hon. Member that  each  Singaporean

should have equal opportunities and be subjected to the  same

meritocratic process to recognise and to reward contributions

to the economy.  Sir, as the hon. Member noted, the principle

of  equality before the law is enshrined in our Constitution.

The specific prohibitions of discrimination on the grounds of

religion,  race, descent or place of birth are stipulated  in

Article 12(2) of the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our employment laws do not have specific

provisions  against  gender or other form of  discrimination,

equal  opportunity  and  the  principle  of  meritocracy  are

extensively  practised.  So do we need an  Equal  Opportunity

Commission  or  Council?   Sir, let  me  recount  a  previous

experience  on  this  issue.  In 1999,  we  had  a  spate  of

complaints  from  members of the Singaporean  public  against

discriminatory   job   advertisements.    There   were   some

advertisements  specifying  that the  employers  only  wanted

Chinese,   or   some  race  was  specified,  in   these   job

advertisements.  There were calls for a body  similar  to  an

Equal   Opportunity   Commission  to   ensure   equality   in

recruitment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry took the initiative to form a tripartite

committee   comprising  representatives  from  the  Singapore

National Employers Federation, the NTUC and, of course,  from

my  Ministry,  to  address the issue  of  discriminatory  job

advertisements.  The committee was also asked to consider the

desirability  of  introducing  legislation  to  outlaw   such

practices.  The committee had a careful study, many  meetings

were held, and they recommended that instead of resorting  to

anti-discriminatory laws, a promotional and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



educational  approach be adopted.  And,  in  line  with  this

approach,  the  tripartite  committee  formulated  a  set  of

guidelines on non-discriminatory job advertisements to advise

employers on how job advertisements should be presented using

objective  factors such as skills, qualifications, attributes

and  individual capabilities that are required for  the  job.

With  the  support of the tripartite partners and  the  major

newspaper  publishers,  the incidence of  discriminatory  job

advertisements  has been drastically reduced from  more  than

30%  of  the job advertisements carried in the newspapers  in

1999  to  less than 1% today.  The recalcitrant  minority  is

being  tackled  individually as and when  the  advertisements

appear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, experience in other countries has shown that

legislation on equal opportunities may not have achieved  the

objective of eliminating discrimination in employment.   What

had  happened was that such legislation gave rise  to  labour

market   rigidities  and  undermined  efforts  on  employment

creation.   It is true that in the United States, legislation

had  brought  about a large number of discrimination  claims.

But  a  great majority could not be substantiated,  and  many

ended up without a solution.  Sir, based on the report of the

US'  Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission  for  the  year

2000,   a   total  of  96,000  allegations   or   claims   of

discriminations of all sorts in employment was  received,  of

which,  16,008 or 20% were related to discrimination  on  the

ground of age.  Of the 16,008 age-discrimination claims, 8.2%

were  deemed to have reasonable cause, some of which resulted

in  successful conciliation.  Only 34 cases or 0.2% justified

the  Commission pursuing direct suits or jointly  filing  law

suits with complainants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this would suggest that legislation only deals with

a  very,  very small proportion of the total claims,  whereas

conciliation  or mediation was far more effective  and  could

result in mutually satisfactory solutions in many more cases.

Sir,  this is in fact the strategy that we have adopted.   We

have  and  will continue to offer a conciliation service  for

workers who feel that their grievances have not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>



been  fairly  dealt with, or that they have, in some  way  or

other, been discriminated at their workplace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the major disadvantage of a legislative approach is

a  change  in the workplace culture.  It creates a  mood  for

employment disputes to be tackled through litigation, instead

of  being  resolved  between the parties concerned.   Such  a

situation would be harmful to our harmonious labour relations

climate, which is built on the basis that employment disputes

should   be   amicably  resolved  through  consultation   and

conciliation, with the intervention of the trade  unions  and

the Ministry of Manpower, if necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member felt that we are unnecessarily

worried  by labour market rigidities, if an Equal Opportunity

Commission  is  created.  In the UK, it has been  shown  that

providing   special  protection  to  older  workers   through

legislation could, in fact, reinforce societal and employers'

perception that older workers are less receptive to  training

and upgrading, less productive and more inflexible to changes

and,  hence, needed legal protection.  So, instead of helping

older  workers,  such legislation may well have  given  older

workers an unfair branding.  Likewise, having laws to  compel

employers to employ on the basis of gender distribution could

create  even  more difficulties for us.  Here, I am  reminded

that  many  production operators in our electronic  factories

are  women.   Is  this an instance of discrimination  against

men,  or is it because employers find more women willing  and

suited  for  the  particular jobs available?   Should  we  be

insisting that these employers employ more men for such jobs?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the negative effects of protective employment

legislation were highlighted in a comprehensive OECD study in

1994  and  validated in a subsequent study  in  1999.   These

studies  revealed  that  rigid  and  over-protective   labour

legislation  undermined  the  efficient  functioning  of  the

labour  market,  stifled entrepreneurship  and  hindered  job

creation.  Hence, we must learn from the experience of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>



these  countries and avoid these pitfalls.  As more and  more

investments  are drawn to China and elsewhere, should  we  be

introducing more legislation to disadvantage ourselves?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member has also made the observation that

more  women are facing unemployment.  This was based  on  the

Census  2000  survey.   We  should look  at  this  in  proper

perspective.   In  fact, the latest labour  force  survey  in

December  2001  showed  that female unemployment  rate,  non-seasonally adjusted, was 5.3%, while that for men  was  5.8%.

I  understand that over the past few years the trend actually

has  been  that the unemployment rate is slightly higher  for

men than for women.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not suggesting that there is no concern or

that there is no need for us to be concerned about more women

being  unemployed.  In fact, I am concerned, because most  of

the  retrenchments in the last two years or so came from  the

manufacturing industries, and the worst hit was,  of  course,

the  electronics  industry.  And  here,  in  the  electronics

industry,  you find many more women workers.   Hence,  it  is

also  not  surprising to see many more women being retrenched

during this downturn.  But this has nothing to do with gender

or  with  discrimination.  It is a reflection of  the  labour

market development and the change in economic circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to wages, the hon. Member mentioned

that women, on the average, earn only 78% of men's wages.  It

is true that, in aggregate terms, women's wages are generally

lower than men's.  But this is because more women, especially

in  the  older age group, are holding lower paid jobs due  to

their  lower qualifications and skills as compared  to  their

male  counterparts.  Another reason is that,  in  fact,  many

women  leave  the labour force after marriage  and  birth  of

children.   Hence, in aggregate terms, women in the workforce

have  a shorter working experience.  With our seniority-based

wage  system, it is not surprising that, in aggregate  terms,

women also earn lower wages.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the younger age group of 25-29, the wage

difference  between  women and men is  almost  insignificant.

Hence,   young   female  professionals  and   managers   have

comparable  gross  wages  to their  male  counterparts.   The

difference here is only an insignificant 2%.  In the case  of

sales  and  service workers, young females earn 8% more  than

their male counterparts.  So we cannot conclude, on the basis

of  the  figures  shown in Census 2000, that women  had  been

discriminated somehow and ended up earning lower  wages  than

men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more and more women are receiving better and higher

education, and more and more are also opting to remain in the

workforce  after  marriage.  Women are  also  moving  up  the

occupational  ladder  and increasingly holding  higher  level

jobs.   So  we can expect this gap at the aggregate level  to

narrow  in  the future.  I would not rule out the possibility

of  an  Equal Opportunity Commission sometime in the  future.

Nothing  remains static.  The environment will  change.   The

circumstances  may change.  But I am just asking  for  us  to

consider whether we should be introducing such a mechanism at

this  moment.  Is this best suited for us as we reinvent  our

economy?   Is it the mechanism which will help us  to  regain

our  competitiveness and that it will help us  to  enter  new

areas or carve out new niches for ourselves in this much more

competitive globalised economy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that we should be careful about

introducing such an institution or concept at this  juncture.

Let  us  use  our existing dispute settlement mechanism.   We

have  them  in my Ministry - dispute settlement mechanism  to

deal  with  unionised  workers and  mechanism  to  deal  with

individual  workers who are not unionised.   We  should  also

take  advantage  of  our  strong tripartite  relationship  to

continue to address any instances of discriminatory practices

and  if  there are, in fact, cases of discrimination, we  are

able to use mediation and conciliation to help the workers to

overcome  the difficulties.  This is what we should  continue

to do.  What is more important, at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



this  juncture, as we set out to reinvent our economy, is  to

get  economic growth going, bring in more investments, create

more  good and secure jobs for our people.  If we succeed  to

do  that,  then  we  have  employment opportunities  for  all

Singaporeans, men or women.

advocate  that.  But what I did advocate was a level  playing

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I join

my  colleagues in this House in rising to thank the President

for his Address at the Opening of this Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having been in Parliament since 1984, I feel

privileged   to   have  been  intimately  involved   in   the

transformation  of  Singapore for the  last  18  years,  both

economically  as well as culturally and socially.   Over  the

years,  many  committees were formed to remake  Singapore  in

varying  degrees.  And over the years, we have shown that  we

were  able  to  plan ahead and change to better our  economic

prospects and improve the lives of our citizens despite being

just  a  "tiny  red  dot" in an ocean of much  political  and

economic uncertainty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are once again at the crossroads to remake

Singapore  -  in all respects so that we can ensure that  the

success  that  is  Singapore  today  will  continue  for  our

children and many generations to come.  It is inevitable that

if we are to continue to succeed and prosper, we will have to

make changes to our policies and even to our way of governing

Singapore.  Change is necessary and desirable in so far as it

allows  for  progress  and improvement in  this  increasingly

complex global economic environment.  I am therefore in  full

support  of this national exercise involving many communities

and  many  younger  Singaporeans to redefine  our  goals  and

priorities and remake Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am of the view that this exercise is of paramount

importance, and that we should not rush to complete  it.   By

all  means, take time to debate and build up consensus  among

Singaporeans on what we want Singapore to be and how  to  get

there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to add a word of caution to my

younger  colleagues  and  fellow citizens  involved  in  this

project to remake Singapore.  Whilst we should indeed revisit

some  "sacred cows", which may no longer be relevant in  this

day  and age, we should not throw out the "baby with the bath

water".  There is a need to recognise certain core values and

tenets



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



of  our  success, and ensure that in our attempts to redefine

our  goals  and priorities, we do not abandon  and  lose  our

heartbeat for what is good and fundamental to our society  as

Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of immediate relevance in the post September 11 world

would  be  the precarious hallmark of racial integration  and

harmony  that we have built up over the years.  Whilst  there

is a need to liberalise and enable greater diversity in ideas

and  culture  to  flourish here and to stimulate  creativity,

this  should  never be at the expense of damaging  the  bonds

built  up  over  the years between our different  ethnic  and

religious groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one need not look very far to be inundated with

media  reports on the daily human tragedy in the Middle East,

in  India,  in  the Balkans and amongst some regions  in  our

neighbouring  countries on the cost of racial  and  religious

intolerance  and  conflicts.  We have to continue  to  ensure

that   in  remaking  Singapore,  avenues  to  foster   better

relations  and  build closer bonds remain  a  basic  building

block of our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, we have to ensure that Singaporeans as a whole

continue  to  progress, so that no one group is left  behind.

Our  traditional  building blocks  of  family  and  community

should  continue  to  have a relevant role  to  play  in  the

future.   For  example, in order to avoid  the  hardship  and

problems that large disparities in income have caused in many

other  countries,  we  must remember that  our  success  will

continue  only if the successful continue to contribute  back

to  society  and  the  community.  The more  successful  must

continue to help the less fortunate in our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, going forward, although different Singaporeans may

follow the beat to different drums, the general direction for

all Singaporeans must be one of improvement in the quality of

life  for  everyone, such that no one group is  left  behind.

Indeed,  in facilitating the next stage of promoting economic

opportunity  and  growth,  our  core  Singaporean  values  of

diligence, meritocracy, honesty and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>



integrity,  have  to  be blended with more  risk  taking  and

creativity,  so  that the Singapore brand  is  preserved  and

enhanced,  and  not  abandoned.  I hope our  Economic  Review

Committee  and the Committee looking into Remaking  Singapore

will bear this in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to me, remaking Singapore is not just about

economic growth and material success.  To be successful as  a

country, we have to develop a heart and a soul.  Our cultural

attitudes and mindsets ought to be less focussed on  material

success  measured by the number of 'As' we get in school,  or

the  number  of 'Cs' one owns.  There is a need  to  be  more

flexible,  less structured in our expectations  of  ourselves

and of our children, in terms of where they should be at what

age.    Different  individuals  of  different   talents   and

capabilities will progress down different paths.   We  should

enable  them  to  be the best that they can be,  without  the

social  stigma associated with banding, streaming in schools,

jobs, etc, putting a lid on budding talent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure many of my colleagues in this House will agree

with  me that "ITE" cannot be "It's the End".  Those  of  you

who  have  seen the popular local movies "I Not  Stupid"  and

"Money Not Enough" will agree with me that they clearly  show

that the average Singaporeans struggling to earn a living  or

raising  a  family  can themselves be capable  and  creative.

They  can achieve far beyond what our society judges them  by

the  number of 'As' they have or have not, or the  number  of

'Cs'  that they have or have not collected along the  way  in

life.   To  get there, our society has to be warm,  forgiving

and  nurturing, rather than judgmental, cold and  just  plain

competitive.   We  need to imbue passion and compassion  into

our  way  of living.  This reminds me of another local  movie

production, "Chicken Rice Wars", where it shows that  passion

and  compassion  unites the community, the  family  and  even

couples.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this exercise to remake Singapore, I suggest we

seriously look into

collectively  changing  our  attitude  towards  a  group   of

Singaporeans,  often called the underdog, and  they  are  not

small  in  number.  They are the slow developers, the  under-performers and the less fortunate in our society.  We need to

help  them.   We have to show greater sympathy and compassion

in helping to solve their problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our experience as Members of Parliament tells us

that  it  is  very  difficult for Singaporeans  who  are  ex-prisoners,  ex-drug  abusers or any person  convicted  of  an

offence  and having to spend some time in jail, to  seek  re-employment  or  be  integrated back into  society.   All  the

efforts  to rehabilitate these individuals will fall flat  if

our  society  cannot accept them back.  We need  to  be  more

forgiving  to  these people.  Perhaps Government  departments

should   take   the  lead  on  some  of  these   efforts   of

reintegration by consciously giving them employment  as  well

as  relaxing the rules and regulations governing the issue of

permits or licences to these people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, for bankrupts, it is a real social stigma in

Singapore  today  to  be a bankrupt.  It is  associated  with

failure.   Genuine  attempts  by  individuals  resulting   in

failure have to be recognised and accepted by society, if  we

are to progress to be a more entrepreneurial and enterprising

nation.  I therefore propose that the Government reviews  all

relevant policies, rules and procedures with a view  to  make

it  easier for this group of Singaporeans to be accepted back

in society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, there is another group of Singaporeans

who  require  help and I am referring to those  who  want  to

marry  foreigners  or  work permit  holders.   Many  have  no

choice.  They have neither proper education nor 'As' or  'Cs'

in  their  lives.  They cannot find Singaporean wives.   They

have  a  genuine desire to love someone, play their  role  as

filial  sons or daughters, set up a family and do their  part

for  the  community.  We should encourage  them,  instead  of

denying  them  to get married. I propose that the  Government

reviews  its  policy on contract marriages, and suggest  that

civil servants



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>



show  more  compassion and make it easier for this  group  of

Singaporeans to marry foreigners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, the measure of our success as

a  nation hence is not just about being able to navigate  the

rough seas and unpredictable tides that we will face with the

new  skills  and  technology acquired, or new  attitudes  and

perspectives.   It will also be determined  by  how  well  we

stand  together as one nation, with full confidence and trust

in  each other, so that we can respond with unity and quickly

to any crisis that may befall us, just like before.  The more

successful must help the less successful.  We should give the

slow  developers and the underdog a chance to catch  up.   We

must provide them the opportunities to try and encourage them

to  succeed.  We need to imbue greater passion and compassion

in  our way of life.  A less materialistic outlook and a more

forgiving  culture  would  contribute  to  mutual  trust  and

building bonds.  These values, to me, are pre-requisites  for

any attempt to remake Singapore successfully.  I am confident

that  Singaporeans have the will, and will find  the  way  to

succeed again!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng (Minister, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Lim Boon Heng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is my sixth term in Parliament.

So  I  am  hardly  one who is expected to contribute  to  the

remaking  of  Parliament, nor one to tell our civil  servants

how  they  should  change.  After all, civil servants  merely

carry out Government policies that we approve in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, I rise to raise some questions I hope that

new  Members  of this House will help to answer  during  this

debate or in the Budget session to come.  I fully agree  with

Mr Zainudin Nordin, Member for Bishan-Toa Payoh, when he said

yesterday that the top issue on the minds of people today  is

jobs.   Retrenchment hangs like a heavy dark  cloud  although

there  is  a  silver lining.  But what is in  the  nature  of

retrenchments  that we have seen?  There are  companies  that

retrench because they are doing poorly in the depths  of  the

business  cycle.  They lose money and cannot afford to  bleed

further.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



When these employers retrench, their employees understand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, there are companies that relocate because the cost

of  doing  business here is higher than in  other  locations.

These  companies  may still be profitable but  see  declining

profits.  They act to stay competitive before it is too late.

Again,  most  of their employees understand.   Their  leaders

have seen the competition elsewhere, such as in China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there are companies that consolidate after

mergers  or acquisitions, and they have to let off  redundant

workers.   Yet, again, union leaders understand.   Those  who

hold their jobs are relieved, but those who lost theirs leave

with great apprehension, as the job market is very poor.  The

retrenched  hope that the severance benefits  that  they  get

would be fair, and enough to tide them over during the period

of unemployment, possibly a long one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, there are companies that retrench, even as

they  are  profitable.  In the current situation,  most  have

seen  profits decline.  They ask employees to take pay  cuts,

otherwise the numbers they will retrench will be higher.  Are

they  doing  so  just because profits have declined?   Sadly,

observing what is being done elsewhere, particularly  in  the

United States, we will see more and more companies laying off

large numbers of workers, even if profits have not declined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? This is the age of "shareholder value".

Shareholders  expect not only good dividends, but  also  high

share  prices.  This puts management under great pressure  to

deliver.   Increasingly, the managers are also paid in  stock

options, and so their interests are more closely aligned with

the  shareholders.  My colleagues in the unions  called  this

"unbridled  greed".   The management work hard,  restructure,

make use of technology to produce more, with less people,  at

lower costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1980s, we held up employers who did not retrench

as model employers.  They were Japanese companies (in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



Japan)  and  the  best  of American employers,  like  IBM  or

Hewlett  Packard.  IBM and Hewlett Packard proudly said  that

they  would never retrench, as they value their employees  as

their greatest asset.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the pace of change quickens, product life cycles

become  shorter.   So,  companies found that  keeping  excess

workers  on  the  payroll eat up the financial  resources  of

companies.  Some succumbed.  Others were brought to the brink

of  failure, for example, IBM or Nissan.  They had to give up

their principle of not retrenching.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, companies retrench as they strive to stay

profitable,  or  meet  return on equity  benchmarks,  or  EVA

standards.  If they do not, they could be dragged  down,  and

sink.   Managers  with stock options see the value  of  their

options fall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we fight this trend? Look at Europe. Western

Europeans  have  a  different  philosophy.   They  are   more

egalitarian,  feel that the community should carry  the  less

fortunate.  So their laws make it difficult for companies  to

retrench.    They   pay  high  taxes  and   social   security

contributions.  But when Western European companies  have  to

compete in the world market against companies operating in  a

free  market  environment, they have to react.  So  companies

stop  hiring  full time workers.  There are more part-timers.

But  the  greater problem is: they shift operations overseas.

So  there is high unemployment.  What survive are high value-added activities and domestic services.  For example, Germany

has 4 million unemployed but are short of skilled workers for

high  value-added  work.  A paradox  -  shortage  of  skilled

workers  when 4 million are unemployed.  And they are  trying

to  amend their laws to allow more foreign skilled workers to

enter Germany.  Germany's example is a warning to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In global competition, no country can fight this trend

when  there are other countries willing to be more  flexible,

or are hungrier.  Companies in Singapore are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



reacting  to this new competitive environment.  For  example,

our  banks  may  be  profitable,  but  if  they  are  to   be

competitive,   they  have  to  lower  expense   ratios,   use

technology, and eliminate many jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asian financial crisis and the global downturn hit

our   workers   hard.   More  were  retrenched   because   of

restructuring.  Many of those who were retrenched still think

the jobs will come back when the recovery comes.  They won't.

This time round it is not just the rank-and-file workers  who

are  affected,  but  also the professionals  and  executives.

Almost   40%   of  the  retrenched  were  professionals   and

executives.  It has been a painful adjustment for  those  who

found new jobs.  They took big pay cuts.  Part of the problem

is  our  seniority-based wage system.   So  my  question  is:

Should  we move to rate for the job?  That does not guarantee

there  will be no retrenchments.  But it gives older  workers

an  even chance with younger workers in competition for jobs.

If our new Members of Parliament were working for the unions,

what would they do?   And what about now, since restructuring

the wage system cannot be done overnight.  What should we do?

Lower the cost of employing older workers?  Should we cut the

employers' contribution to CPF for older workers?  If you are

advocating this course of action, how would you explain it to

the  rank-and-file workers and also to the professionals  and

executives who have to find re-employment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 100,000 workers are unemployed. The CDCs all have

job-matching  services.  So I believe most MPs  now  have  an

idea of the problem of matching people with jobs.  There  are

jobs  that go a-begging.  The shipyards are enjoying a  mini-boom just now.  They have been taking in workers and recently

wanted  5,000  more.  I am told they managed to recruit  300,

but  I  am  not sure how many of these will stay on the  job.

Jobs  in  our  shipyards are not unskilled  jobs.   They  are

skilled jobs.  Yet, many foreign workers come here unskilled.

They  leave well-trained, and much sought after.   When  they

leave,  they  join shipyards elsewhere competing  with  ours.

How can we convince more Singaporeans to take up those jobs?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our shipyards have done well over the years. Why?

Because our shipyards were set up in the 60s and 70s, and  we

placed  some of our top local talents in those jobs, learning

the ropes from foreign expatriates.  And because of these top

local  talents,  the  shipyard  industry,  which  is  a  very

competitive one, has survived and still earns good money.  So

will there be younger and able Singaporeans, and some of  our

best, entering this industry?  Or are we going to see the old

breed  die  out,  and the shipyards closed, and  the  foreign

workers leave when they do?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are other jobs, paying $800 to $1,200 per

month.   But  there are few takers.  Why?  The job applicants

say  that the wages are too low.  So the employers appeal for

more  foreign  workers.   To  many workers  from  surrounding

countries,  such  wages mean comfortable middle-class  living

for  their  families.  For Singaporeans, it is a  tough  low-income life.  What should we do?  Compete on wages?  How  can

we  do  that when many workers in countries near us would  be

quite happy to get a job paying about S$100?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution lies in attracting higher value-added

industries here - knowledge-based industries.  To  start,  we

need  a  critical mass of skilled manpower.  We do  not  have

enough  from  our population pool.  So we recruit foreigners.

But  then,  some Members say that it makes Singaporeans  feel

second-class  in  their own homes.  So, the question  to  new

Members is:  How do we build up a knowledge-based industry if

we  cannot  persuade Singaporeans to welcome foreign  skilled

workers for the start-up phase, at least?  With respect to Mr

Inderjit  Singh's comment about investments in  biopolis,  he

advocated  that instead of spending that kind  of  money,  we

should invest elsewhere.  My point to him is:  If we do that,

where  are  the jobs for Singaporeans?  We are doing  so  not

because  we do not want a good return on our money.  We  want

to  do  so against the odds, because we want to create higher

value-added jobs that pay well for Singaporeans, and we  have

succeeded in specific areas, and well known in the  world  as

leading best in the field.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we must remember that with all these new industries

that  we try to bring in, there will be low-skilled jobs that

are  created.   For example, in precision engineering,  about

one-third  of the jobs will be low-skilled ones and  suitable

alternative jobs for the workers that are now retrenched.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unless we can persuade Singaporeans of the need to

absorb  foreign skilled workers, the solution  to  employment

for  our  low-skilled  workers is  to  return  to  developing

country status.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to an often discussed topic. We have one

of the highest saving rates in the world, and yet many do not

have  enough  cash for retirement.  Why?  Is there  too  much

invested  in property?  Today, every young person expects  to

get a new HDB flat after he or she starts working.  It is not

just  young couples who are getting married, but increasingly

the  singles  too, as the Member for Tanjong Pagar,  Indranee

Rajah,  so  eloquently argued on Monday.  I believe  this  is

unique in this world.  Are we not already over-housed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, too, conduct meet-the-people sessions like all other

MPs.   I get my share of heart-tugging cases.  One woman came

to  see  me  because her electricity supply was disconnected.

Why?   She  owed Power Supply more than $3,300.  Her  husband

died  more than two years ago.  With no income, she  had  not

been  paying her utility bills.  Furthermore, she is  staying

with  a  retarded  son.   I asked another  of  her  sons  who

accompanied  her, who supports her household.   He  said  the

siblings  do, but because each one has his or her own  family

to  look after, they can only contribute a little each.  What

is  the  solution?  An MP's letter may bring respite.   Power

Supply may agree to reconnect.  But after a few months,  when

the  bills continue to be unpaid, they will disconnect again.

Do I write another letter?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this not a problem of over-housing? Should this

woman  not  be  staying with one of her other sons,  so  that

household expenses can be kept down?  There is a life-cycle - what happens to old flats



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



when  their  parents  go to the next world?   Can  all  young

Singaporeans, married or single, expect to buy a new HDB flat

indefinitely?  Are we prepared to face up to this  truth  and

have  our  expectations move in line with those of the  young

people  in  other countries where the purchase of a property,

not  necessarily a new one, is the norm?  So what  should  we

do?   Apportion more of the CPF into the Special  Account  so

that  there is less spending on housing and more savings  for

retirement?  So I would like some views from the new  Members

of Parliament on this important issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am an old Member of this House. I am

no  revolutionary.  The problems before us are big ones.   My

purpose is merely to highlight some unpalatable truths.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the motion which I must,

because we have proved it in Cabinet.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</b> Sir, in the aftermath of the

terrorist  attacks in the United States and the detention  of

the  13  members of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI),  it  would  be

dangerous to ignore the heightened sensitivities to race  and

religion  that  have  surfaced.  Apart  from  the  political,

security  and economic concerns brought about by the shocking

terrorist  acts in Singapore, we have to come to  terms  with

major  ongoing issues and trends which would affect our well-being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



and sense of nationhood.  As has been repeated many times  in

this House in the last few days, the world has changed and we

must  take  a  hard look at the implications of these  events

before  we  can make our own adjustments and  move  on.   The

world  economic  environment  has  changed.   The  nature  of

economic  competition for investments, jobs and  markets  has

changed  as a result of economic globalisation, the  rise  of

China,  rising competition from regional neighbours  and  the

faster pace of technological changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to reinvent ourselves to have a role in the

changing  economic  environment on which  the  President  has

reminded us.  But today, I would like to focus on one  aspect

of   the   President's  Address  which  is  social  cohesion,

especially in the light of the September 11 terrorist attacks

and the JI arrests.  Prime Minister, Ministers and all of us,

Members  of  Parliament  of this House,  have  facilitated  a

series  of  frank and open dialogues on how we should  manage

racial  and  religious  harmony.  We have  to  discuss  these

issues  constructively if we want to strengthen  our  racial,

religious  and  social cohesion which is fundamental  in  our

statehood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of Inter-religious Confidence Committees

and Harmony Circles could help to promote greater interaction

and understanding among different races at grassroots levels.

Following  media reports, discussions and debates  after  the

September  11  incident and JI arrests, some members  of  the

Malay-Muslim community feel that they and Islam have been put

in  the  spotlight.  Government leaders have taken  pains  to

allay  such fears and concerns and to remind non-Malay-Muslim

Singaporeans  that  their  fellow Malay-Muslim  citizens  are

largely  moderate and peace loving and should  be  given  the

support  to  continue  to be so.  It is  not  enough  to  see

community  leaders distancing themselves from extremists  and

radical acts and tendencies.  It is equally important for  us

to  have  the average citizens to understand the  issues  and

reject extremism and radicalism.  That is why it is important

that we reach out to the average citizens, not just community



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



leaders.  The way they react could be influenced by their own

personal  experiences and that of people known  to  them  and

also by individuals with influences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of moderate Malays and Muslims would want

to   tell  their  fellow  Singaporeans  not  to  fear  or  be

apprehensive  with  the  wearing of the  headscarves  or  the

tudung  by  Malay/Muslim  women.  They  would  also  want  to

reassure  that the covering of the head does not signify  the

closing  of  the  mind  and that their  contribution  to  the

companies  and  employers would not be reduced  just  because

they put on the tudung.  Malays and Muslims would also, among

other  things, want others to know that their quest for halal

food does not mean that they cannot eat at the same table  as

non-Muslims who take non-halal food or drinks.  Sir,  on  the

other  hand,  there is also a need for Muslims to  understand

the  kind  of  perception that they may  create  if  they  go

overboard   and   insist  on  things  that  make   themselves

exclusive.   Unfortunately, Sir, there are  elements  in  the

community  who are pushing the agenda in the way  that  would

stir  the calm and harmony that we have achieved.  The Malay-Muslim  community must not be swayed by such people  who  may

use  religious arguments and who may even sound logical  but,

in  reality,  are  intolerant and  even  extremist  in  their

attitude.  Sir, like some other Members of the House, I would

like  to  urge  fellow  Malay/Muslim  Singaporeans  and   all

Singaporeans to focus their attention on education as a  tool

to  move  upwards  and  to  play a better  role  in  society.

Education  supports  racial  and  religious  harmony  in  two

important  ways.   Firstly,  education  is  one  of  the  key

institutions  that develops social capital  and  expands  our

common space.  Our schools represent the one way whose  reach

is  almost universal and where common experience starts  from

young.   The schools are critical institutions in  which  our

young  enjoy  a  common education experience  of  growing  up

together  or  finding out about our history and heritage  and

working towards a common goal.  It is therefore important for

us to guard our schools jealously as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



a  common  space  for  our multi-racial  and  multi-religious

community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, education is one of the pillars that supports

the    principle   of   meritocracy.    Education    provides

opportunities for our people to reach their fullest potential

regardless   of   their  race,  religion  and  socio-economic

background.   While  we cannot eradicate totally  the  income

divide,  we  have,  by investing heavily in education,  built

many  bridges and open the doors for Singaporeans to move  up

the  socio-economic ladder.  It is up to the  individuals  to

seize these opportunities for training and education so  that

they  can  secure  a  better life for  themselves  and  their

families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay community has been making steady progress over

the  years.   In year 2001, for example, 92% of Malay  pupils

taking the PSLE qualified for secondary school, and this  was

an  improvement from 74% in 1990.  The corresponding national

averages were 97% in 2001 and 88% in 1990. Sir, the  gap  has

been  narrowed  to  just  five  percentage  points  from   14

percentage  points  over a period of  about  10  years.   The

community needs to continue to focus their minds and energies

on  raising  the  educational and skills  qualifications.   I

would  again  like  to  urge  the Malay/Muslim  community  to

continue  to push forward in education and make full  use  of

the opportunities that have been and will be open to them  at

all levels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malay-Muslim community can make even better

progress  in education, the profession and commerce  if  they

focus their attention on the things that matter - education - and  not be distracted by a small but loud minority who  want

them  to  believe  that the community has been  discriminated

against,   their   religion  belittled  and  their   concerns

trivialised.  If such people like those in Fateha.com succeed

in  making the community believe that it has been made second

class  citizens in Singapore, the Malay/Muslim community  and

Singapore will be the poorer for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, racial and religious harmony will continue to be a

key prerequisite in our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



pursuit for continued progress and nationhood.  But it is not

the  only form of cohesion we need to achieve.  We also  need

to  forge  cohesion  among people of  different  backgrounds,

between  the  better-off and the less  endowed,  between  the

better  educated and those with modest education, and between

Singaporeans  and  new Singaporeans and foreigners  who  work

here.   Efforts through the Remaking Singapore Committee  are

opportunities  for  us  to  achieve these  objectives  beyond

economic progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot control the storms and waves that we sail

in.   But  we can strengthen the boat and the crew.  We  have

just embarked on a process of remaking Singapore.  This is an

opportune  time for us to come together with fresh  and  open

minds  to chart the future course for Singapore.  If  we  can

forge  the  type of social compact and strengthen racial  and

religious  harmony  together, we can face  and  surmount  any

challenges that Singapore will face.    On this note, Sir, I support

the motion.



<br>3.55 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like  to join my colleagues in thanking the  President

for his Address.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Address, the President paints a very gloomy

picture  of  our  outlook over the next  three  years.   Many

Singaporeans after hearing him are taken aback by  the  bleak

forecast.  Our people have always assumed that with  the  PAP

Government  in  charge, our future is assured.   At  the  3rd

November General Elections, our people were already painfully

aware  of  the  severity of the recession and the  challenges

facing the nation.  They gave the PAP a renewed mandate  with

increased popular support because they believed that  with  a

proven  team in place, Singapore will be able to weather  the

recession and to continue to do well.  Five months had passed

and  before  Parliament  was convened,  during  this  interim

period,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



the recession had deepened, the unemployed continued to rise.

Our people long for our Government to hold out a ray of hope,

a  promise of a better tomorrow.  After all, is it  not  what

the General Election was all about?  Vote for the PAP and  we

will guide you to a better tomorrow.  After listening to  the

President,  our people are not so sure anymore.   Instead  of

hearing  what the Government could do to lead us out  of  the

recession,  in the debate so far, we have heard  from  Member

after  Member telling Singaporeans that they have to be  more

self-reliant,  that we should not look to the  Government  to

solve all our problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is well and good that our people

should  be more self-reliant.  But there is a limit  to  what

the  individuals  could do, especially in an  island  country

like  Singapore.  We cannot go back to farming, we cannot  go

back  to  itinerant  hawkers, we cannot drive  pirate  taxis.

Yes,  we  could go back for more training and retraining.   I

think  it  is right and proper that we look to the Government

to bring us through the recession.  Are we Singaporeans being

too  dependent  on the Government?  I do not think  so,  Sir.

After all, what is the role of a government?  To do what  the

individuals on their own cannot do.  To provide leadership in

a  crisis.   Our people want to be led.  So, we  should  lead

them.  It is important at this juncture when Singapore is  at

a   turning  point,  at  the  deepest  recession  since   our

Independence,   that   this   Government   provides    strong

leadership.  We all could recall, close to 30 years ago,  the

then Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, pointed to a bare batch of

land  and declared, "On this piece of land, we will  build  a

modern  metropolis."  He was brash, even arrogant, confident.

But  he did egg our people on.  I hope in the remaining  days

of  this  debate,  we  would be able to hear  the  frontbench

elaborate on the Government's vision of our country  and  the

plan  to bring us there.  We need a strong dose of leadership

to restore the confidence of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we understand that the various

committees  established by the Government after the  GE  have

yet to finish their work.  Yes, we anticipate that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



their  recommendations would probably result in new  policies

and  new  tax changes, come the Budget in May.  However,  the

elapsed  time of half a year by the time we come  to  May  to

figure  out  what to do, seems rather long.  As  the  Chinese

saying goes, "yuan shui jiu bu liao jin huo".  Basically,  it

means  "distant  water is useless in fighting  the  immediate

fire".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, Sir, the long delay seems to give us two

impressions.  Firstly, the Government is unprepared about the

need  to  make  major  changes and is  now  scrambling.   One

wonders how is it that our highly acclaimed civil service did

not  anticipate the challenges facing us and make appropriate

plans  for  it,  not to mention taking the necessary  action.

Secondly,  it gives the impression that the better  ideas  of

how  to fix our nation's problems could be found only in  the

various  remaking Singapore committees whose members are,  by

and  large,  drawn from the private sector.  We have  already

heard from Mr Khaw Boon Wan, who left the comfort zone of the

civil  service,  that he gained a lot from interactions  with

the  members of these committees.  He paid accolades  to  the

wealth  of  experience  brought to bear  by  these  committee

members.   He has been in the civil service for a long  time.

What  he  said is actually telling us a lot about  the  civil

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps we are a bit too pessimistic

about  the  Singapore economy in the short term.   But  maybe

that  is  how Government works:  underestimating the severity

of  the  recession  before  it hit, and  over-estimating  its

severity  after it hit.  The recession turned out to  be  the

worst  in our history primarily because of our dependency  on

electronics  and hard-disk drive manufacturing, whose  global

demand  had  fallen off the cliff in the past 12 months.   It

seems  to me, Sir, now that the external demand is recovering

as  the  US  experienced a strong growth of 6% in  the  first

quarter  of  2002.   The  US Consumer Confidence  posted  the

largest jump in 11 years in March this year.  So, just like a

spring  that has been compressed, once the force is  removed,

the spring will bounce back.  Given the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>



depth  of  our recession, the Singapore economy will  rebound

without too much Government interference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the mid to long term though, the President

is  correct  that  we  are facing the toughest  challenge  in

returning  Singapore to growth.  Mr Matthias Yao pointed  out

earlier the nature of the retrenchments in recent months, ie,

these  retrenchments are the result of restructuring and  not

because of failing businesses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the Government is focusing on the remaking of

Singapore,  I  suggest  that we should  not  forget  the  few

lessons  this  recession has taught us.  One lesson  that  is

foremost in my mind is the difficulty faced by older  workers

in  finding  new  employment.  The Government has  introduced

several  training  schemes for retrenched workers.   This  is

indeed  laudable.  However, we all realise  that  the  number

going  for retraining is low compared to the number  who  are

unemployed.  One of the reasons is the scarcity of  jobs  out

there.   Without  the assurance of a job, the  motivation  to

retrain is hard to sustain.  The other reason is the bias  of

our society against older workers.  Many Members have already

spoken  on this.  Ms Indranee Rajah had touched on  the  50+-year-old  lady who could not find a job despite  her  search.

We,  as  Members, have all come across individuals who cannot

even  get  an  interview, when the potential employers  learn

that  they  are over 40 years old.  These employers  did  not

even  bother to find out about the experience or  the  salary

expectations of these older workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that we should remove as many

of  the  hurdles standing in the way of the older workers  as

possible.  I would like to see the Government take a more pro-active  stance  in eliminating discrimination  against  older

workers  based on age.  I think this has already been touched

on  by  certain Members.  Ms Irene Ng spoke about introducing

legislation to ban all kinds of discrimination.  The Minister

for  Manpower has already responded and I will not  elaborate

further.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do have a suggestion to make, and this is to

overcome the employers' concern about higher medical costs of

hiring older workers.  Today, when an employer hires an older

worker even at the same pay as a younger worker, he still has

to  worry about the higher likelihood of the worker having  a

serious  illness sooner.  He has to pay the insurance company

a  higher premium to cover the medical benefits of this older

worker.   I  suggest that we should have a portable insurance

policy for workers, very much like the CPF scheme.  I am  not

talking  about  the  Medisave Scheme, which  is  basically  a

medical scheme for post retirement.  I am referring to a  new

initiative of having a portable insurance scheme in place  so

that  as workers change jobs, they still carry with them  the

same  insurance  policy  across  employers,  that  they   can

continue  to enjoy the premium paid in the past.   I  believe

that  having  such a scheme in place would  remove  one  more

disincentive of hiring older workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the immediate concern of businesses in

Singapore today is the difficulty of making a profit.   In  a

recession, there is very little one can do on increasing  the

turnover  side.  Thus, cutting business costs is foremost  in

the minds of most CEOs and businessmen.  Most businesses have

already   cut  their  internal  costs  to  the  bones.    For

additional  cost reduction, they look towards the Government.

This  was the sentiment expressed by CEOs and businessmen  in

the recent series of dialogues organised by the Feedback Unit

on the upcoming Government Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, the word "feedback" means the transmission

of  evaluative or corrective information to the  original  or

controlling source about an action, event or process.  So, by

its very nature, the process of feedback is a one-way street.

If  my  eminent  colleague,  Dr Amy  Khor,  wants  a  two-way

communication,  she should not use the word "feedback".   She

should  advocate  "dialogue".   And  instead  of  having  the

Feedback Unit, perhaps we should have a "Dialogue Unit".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, coming to the work of the Feedback

Unit, there is consensus among participants that Singapore is

a  high-cost country.  They opined that we have become such a

place  through our high wage policy, asset enhancement policy

and   land   transport  policy,  such  as  vehicle  ownership

restrictions.  In all these areas, there is no  easy  way  to

climb  down  from  the  high  plateau  without  major  social

dislocations.  For instance, in the case of land cost,  there

is   no   easy  way  to  reduce  this  cost  without  causing

politically unacceptable asset deflation in Singapore.  Thus,

most  businesses are holding their breath, waiting  for  some

relief  to  be announced by the Government.  As I  have  said

earlier,  half a year seems to be a lifetime for those  whose

noses are already below the water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But cutting business costs only offer short-term relief.

And,  as  we  all  know, competing on  costs  is  a  game  of

diminishing returns.  We need a long-term strategy for future

growth.  And what is this strategy?  We long to hear from the

Government.   Mr  Inderjit Singh has done  an  excellent  job

earlier  describing the ills of our economy and some  of  the

ideas to fix them.  Mr Balaji Sadasivan was right on the mark

when  he  called  for  the creation of a  catchment  area  of

consumers within a 7-hour flight time around Singapore  based

on   the   Singapore  brand  of  quality,   reliability   and

consistency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if we look at the countries around the

world,  we  could  group their economies roughly  into  three

groups  based on their major wealth creating activities.   In

one group are countries with primarily agricultural and earth

resource  sectors.  Then, there is another group of countries

with the manufacturing sector as their engine of growth, such

as  Taiwan,  Korea,  Japan, Singapore and,  increasingly  so,

China.  Then, there is a third group that has gone beyond the

production  stage  of economic development  with  diversified

major  contributors from the other sectors, such as services,

education, entertainment and knowledge-based.  For want of  a

better  word, let us call the third group the post-industrial

economies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore became successful by pursuing the production

model  where  manufacturing plays a central  role  in  wealth

creation.   And  to support that role, we have  an  education

system  that, by and large, produces technicians,  engineers,

administrators  and people like me, to man the  economy.   To

date,  we have done very well.  But, along the way, our costs

have increased.  As Mr Heng Chee How pointed out earlier,  we

probably have gone as far as this formula could take us.   If

we  were  to continue fine-tuning the formula, we  would,  at

best,  become another Japan, albeit on a much smaller  scale.

Today,  the  Japanese  industry is still  the  pride  of  the

industrial world.  But its domestic sector is very arcane and

inefficient.  It is now in a deflationary trap  as  more  and

more   of  its  production  facilities  are  being  relocated

overseas.   Mr  Balaji  pointed out rightly  that  we  should

transform  ourselves into an economy with goods and  services

that  people are willing to pay regardless of cost - in other

words, the post-industrial economy.  The question is how.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, we could take a closer look at the US. Its

economy  is broad-based and has vibrant sectors in  services,

food,  entertainment and sports, besides the more traditional

sectors  in  agriculture,  manufacturing  and  housing.   Its

lifestyle  products  are permeating the whole  world.   Every

time  we  eat  a McDonalds hamburger, bite into a  Pizza  Hut

pizza,  take a sip of Coke or buy a pair of Adidas  shoes,  a

certain amount of our payment is transferred to America.  The

same  thing happens every time we listen to a piece of music,

watch a movie or a sports event copyrighted in America.   The

US  is a high-cost country, yet the world continues to pay no

matter  how  expensive the products  are.   As  long  as  our

economy  is  stuck  in  what  I call  the  manufacturing  and

production  stage,  it would be easy for other  countries  to

join  in the competition.  If Japan could not compete against

China  in low cost and yet quality production, there is  very

little chance that we could.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should emulate the US in our own ways. At this

point,  I find myself echoing the views of Mr Steve  Chia  on

the role that creative thinking could play in a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>



diversified economy.  In fact, we have so many common  points

that  we almost sound alike.  No wonder, Sir, he was  at  one

stage mistaken to have come through the ranks of the PAP.  We

should  develop  our  own franchise food chains  like  Katong

Laksa,  our  own  entertainment industry and our  own  sports

heroes.   Again,  Associate Professor Chin talked  about  the

pursuit  of  arts and other activities that at this  juncture

are  not  assigned  economic value by our economic  planners.

However,  in a post-industrial economy, where creativity  and

innovation  are  valued,  we do not  just  need  technicians,

engineers  and  administrators, but individuals  with  unique

talents.  We talk about greater creativity and innovation  as

being crucial to our future.  We also know that to bring this

about, we have to fix our education system.  But, Sir, we  do

not  know  how  or  perhaps we are hesitant to  make  drastic

changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key question that we have to ask ourselves is this:

as  people  are  our only resource, are we  handicapping  our

children  to face challenges in the future as we continue  to

foster  behaviour to our examination systems like  PSLE,  "O"

levels and "A" levels examinations?  Today, we have created a

system  where  teachers  and students  become  very  good  in

producing  As.   In  the  latest "A" levels  examinations,  I

believe  there were close to 700 students with  4As  and  the

newspapers reported that some of the Junior College  students

cried  when they scored only 3As.  My goodness - what are  we

becoming?   What  does  an  'A'  mean  in  this  examination,

especially  in  technical subjects like Mathematics,  Physics

and  Chemistry?   I think we have just become  very  good  in

using  existing  knowledge to solve  known  problems  in  the

shortest possible time.  That is what it means.  When we  put

our best and our brightest through a grill to the neglect  of

other  more intellectual and leadership development pursuits,

we  have to ask ourselves whether we are doing justice to our

children  and whether we are laying the foundation for  their

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that MOE is exploring ways to address some

of the perceived problems in our education system.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



Progress has been made here and there.  Assoc. Prof. Low Seow

Chay had touched upon it yesterday on some of these attempts,

but emphasising examination results is a problem of our whole

society, and not just our education system alone.  For MOE to

address  this issue by itself would be like solving  problems

piecemeal without seeing the big picture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if we are indeed serious about

diversifying  our economy, I surmise that  we  have  to  make

fundamental changes, and to make fundamental changes  in  the

education system, we have to review the reward system for our

young people which we have fine-tuned to perfection over  the

years.   For  a  start, we should review how  candidates  are

selected for the best job in the Government, which happens to

be  also  the best job in the country.  We should  re-examine

the  selection  of scholars for scholarships offered  by  the

Public  Service Commission, other statutory boards and  GLCs.

Nowadays, a student will never get a chance for a scholarship

interview without "S" papers and scoring all As.  Sir, if  we

continue  to select candidates based on examination  results,

we  are  not  going to encourage creativity  and  innovation,

something  which my colleague, Mr Zainudin Nordin, also  felt

strongly about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the post-industrial economy, we need individuals who

would  be  able  to create value from their activities  where

none  existed before.  Yet, in our education system,  we  are

grooming  an elite class who has become very good in  solving

existing   problems  using  known  solutions  and  only   the

exceptional ones are able to break out of the mould and think

out  of the box.  Clearly, Sir, there is a mismatch and  only

the  Government  could transform this value system.   Parents

alone could not do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is useful to reiterate that

meritocracy  should be based on the ability of an individual,

and not on academic achievement.  We already know that.  When

we  look  at  the Frontbench, there are very few  PhDs.   But

there are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>



quite  a few in the Backbench, including myself.  So, why  do

we  not  extend it down to the "O" or "A" levels?  For school

leavers  without  working experience,  we  have  always  used

examination  results in the past as a proxy  to  determine  a

person's   ability.   When  the  number  of  As  started   to

proliferate,  this  proxy has outlived  its  usefulness.   We

might  want  to  broaden the selection  criteria  to  include

participation in sports, leadership quality and so  on.   For

male  candidates, I think we could include their  performance

in  national service, such as whether they have been selected

as  officers.   If we do so, I am not sure what  we  will  do

about  the  female  candidates.  Perhaps, someone  can  think

about other appropriate criteria.  For those with jobs in the

Administrative  Service,  one way is  to  select  them,  mid-career,  based  on  their  actual  performance  in  the  job,

preferably  in  the  private sector.  The  problem  with  our

current approach is the uniformity of ideas and responses  in

our  elite Administrative Service.  In a crisis like what  we

are  facing  today, as I have said earlier, we have  to  look

outside  the Administrative Service for different experience.

And yet, through our scholarship programme, over the past  30

years,  we  have locked up a significant number  of  talented

individuals  in the comfort zone of the civil  service  to  a

point  where we might actually starve the private  sector  of

talents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are just specific examples. I am not saying that

if  we  fix all these, all would be well.  But I am confident

that  once we change the reward system for young school-going

children, our young people will respond and Singapore will be

all the better for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that we have to make system-wide changes that will shake Singapore to its very core,

changes  that  will bring about the desired behaviour  needed

for  continued  progress.   Changes,  as  we  all  know,  are

difficult,  especially changes that go against the  grain  of

our  own  experience.   We  are  all  prisoners  of  our  own

experience.   Our  Ministers and top civil servants  are  all

products  of  the existing education system.  Could  we  make

such a change that will deny our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



own  experience that has brought us success?  But if  we  are

serious about leaving no stone unturned, we have to slaughter

some sacred cows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we must avoid being stuck in the

production   economy  and  migrate  to  the   post-industrial

economy.   Our  present difficulties are not  caused  by  the

emergence  of  China.  If it is not China, it would  be  some

other  countries like Vietnam or Thailand.   China  has  just

made our condition more difficult and shortened the timeframe

we have to carry out the transition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Wang, you have got about three minutes

to slaughter your sacred cows before your time is up!



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Thank you, Sir. As I mentioned, we

need  to  work as one to move in the right path.   We  better

make  the right choices at this juncture as the wrong choices

would mean that we would have wasted our efforts and we would

need many more years to recover from our mistakes.  I do  not

envy  the burden placed on our new team of leaders.   Leading

Singapore after year 2007 will be a difficult task but I have

confidence  in them.  If the right solution is somewhere  out

there, I am sure that they will find it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> May I seek a point of

clarification, Sir?  With due respect to the Member for Bukit

Timah,  I understand that the definition of feedback at  this

point  in time is what the eminent Member has stated.  But  I

think feedback is also an iterative process because after the

feedback is given, the people giving the feedback will expect

some reactions so it becomes feedback begets feedback.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Wang, I will give you two minutes to

reply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am an engineer by

training.   In all the feedback systems that I have  studied,

designed  and worked myself, the feedback loop is always  one

way.   The arrow goes in one direction.  It never comes  back

in the other direction.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

perhaps  the  two  Members can carry  on  their  conversation

outside  this  Chamber.  Sir, I wish to speak in  support  of

this  motion  in the name of Mrs Lim, the Member  for  Marine

Parade GRC.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President in his Address draws us to two sets of

challenges facing this country  - one external and the  other

internal.   He  identifies  them  as  the  most  severe  ones

challenging  our country in our history.  I can remember  two

occasions  in  the  past  37  years  of  our  history   since

independence  in 1965 when we were confronted  with  economic

and  political challenges of this dimension.  One was in 1967

with  the prospect of British withdrawal and the unemployment

rate  at  10%.   The challenge then was really  domestic  and

economic  and  we were so down then that there  was  probably

little choice.  Once we embarked on the policy alternative of

attracting  foreign direct investment and  export  promotion,

the  ground was set for take off.   We were fortunate as  our

leaders  then took this path, while the other countries  have

not  quite got their act together in the late 1960s  and  the

early  1970s.   They  were  still  entangled  in  ideological

arguments  about theories of economic development.  Political

leadership then of gelling our people into a cohesive nation,

and  a rugged society took us on the growth path once and for

all for more than two decades.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second challenge to us was in the mid-1980s when,

through  some  of our own economic policies, we  realised  we

were  pricing  ourselves  out of  the  growth  path  and  the

Economic    Competitiveness   Report   made    many    policy

recommendations for getting ourselves out of  the  recession.

The challenge then was also domestic and of our own creation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the problem we face are both of external and

domestic,  economic and political.  In the  economic  sphere,

the  challenges we face this time are drawn from three  major

driving   forces   of  changes  in  the   world   economy   - globalisation,  deregulation and rapid technological  change.

These driving forces will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



affect  us in determining our growth and employment  profile.

Together,  they  form a new definition of  the  new  economic

citizenship.  There are new opportunities but they bring with

them new risk and uncertainties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is about global competition. Since the end of the

1980s,  two billion people in the world gave up the  plan  or

command  economy and joined the market economy - among  them,

China, India, the former Central and East European countries,

Russia  and the Latin American countries.  They have  skilled

and  industrious  people and for several decades,  they  have

been  waylaid, living under the plan or command economy which

did not react adequately to market signals and demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, these countries are competing for global foreign

direct  investment  and going for growth.   Their  supply  of

labour, resources and land is huge.  In particular, China and

India stand out for their tremendous market potential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What remains then of our competitiveness in attracting

foreign direct investment for growth? The markets are growing

in  the new economies.  The developed economies which we have

been integrated with in trade and investment are slowing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future for us, I believe, lies in industrialising

the technology we have acquired or developed by ourselves  or

in  joint partnership.  If we overcome this current recession

with the same mode of attracting foreign direct investment to

add  to input growth, I would not consider it as credible  or

even as a middle-term solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must collaborate and develop the technology for

products and processes.  Switzerland, though a small country,

has built up huge enterprises with their own technologies  in

product,  process and market access.  Examples are Nestle  in

food,  Ciba-Geigy, Roche in pharmaceutical.   Yet  the  Swiss

have their own traditional economic sectors where business



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



organisation,  operation and processes are honed  to  service

the  domestic  economy, including the  tourists.   All  these

things are easier said than done.  But that is precisely  why

this   current  challenge  is  so  immensely  different   and

uncertain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestically, we have to undertake economic

restructuring.  The fact of it is that dynamic economies have

to  continually restructure by introducing challenging market

forces  into  the  economy for the participants,  whether  as

businesses,  workers  or government to  react.   This  is  so

because of changing technologies and changing demand.   Also,

new entrants will always do it cheaper elsewhere.  And to  do

this, we need enterprise and flexibility in the business  and

regulatory environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President in his Address talks about identifying new

areas  of growth, especially in the services sector  such  as

telecommunications,   banking,   retail   and   construction.

Industry-wide  structural changes globally and  technological

changes  brought  about  the  competitive  changes  in  these

industries.  They raise issues of viability of the businesses

in competition and skills retraining for the labour force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to point out a paradox for Members to consider.

The  two  most  protected  sectors we  had  all  through  our

sustained  economic growth period of the seventies,  eighties

and  into  the nineties were paradoxically telecommunications

and  banking.  Did we not pride ourselves in the world  as  a

telecommunications hub and financial centre all  this  while?

And  paradoxically, while we lament retail and  construction,

these  are  the  two  sectors most exposed  to  international

competition from the early days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Services embrace many areas of businesses, from the high

investment,  high technology type, such as telecommunications

and IT, to the more mundane corner-street retail shop service

or  the  cleaning services.  Knowledge-based  businesses  are

also  classified as the services sector.  By  virtue  of  its

wide definition and the fact that so much of these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



services  do  not  enter  into  the  tradeable  international

competition, it makes sense for us to develop this sector, at

least  for  our  domestic economy and the employment  it  can

create.   It does not have to be reflective of the  state  of

the  art,  but  must  answer to  our  need  -  the  need  for

employment of our dislocated workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who lost his job and starts a shop selling

something  is also in retail.  He must be given a chance  for

his effort to try.  He is not going to compete with the likes

of  Carrefour  or Wal-Mart, but he may find a niche  for  his

business activity.  We must not make entry into business  too

restrictive, by control over space or regulation.   Hence,  I

am  not surprised that the Voluntary Exit Scheme proposed  by

HDB last year for shopowners met with such negative response.

Make the use of the space more flexibly and lower the rental,

and I believe HDB will be helping the economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold Storage, owned by Dairy Farm and previously by

foreigners, was not born yesterday.  It was here earlier than

FairPrice.    Then  there  were  Yaohan   and   K-Mart.    In

construction,  big  foreign  contractors,  with   their   own

government  support had always had the advantage  of  bidding

for  contracts in Singapore.  Why is productivity so  low  in

the  construction sector where we have put the most  part  of

our  domestic  capital  formation in  it?   We  have  foreign

contractors and foreign labour galore in this sector.  Why is

it  a  laggard sector in productivity?  Obviously,  there  is

something   about  the  innovative  process,  the   so-called

construction  technology, that is missing, or has  not  quite

been  achieved  in  spite  of  all  the  money  spent  there.

Something  about the skill development process that  was  not

quite  nourished  sufficiently.  Something about  the  market

signals  which  large  number of cheap  foreign  construction

labour failed to provide in the market corrective mechanism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Address mentioned that we can no longer

expect 8-10% growth, and that we should be happy if we make 4-6%  per annum.  I am gratified by this revised growth target.

However, I suggest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



that more important is for us to focus on productivity growth

and, correctly, total factor productivity growth that is  now

the  champion  of  SPRING,  the Standards,  Productivity  and

Innovation  Board.  I have argued the case for  total  factor

productivity measurement for the last 13 years in Parliament.

It is in Hansard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An economy can grow by adding up growth in factor

inputs, such as capital investment and labour input.  But  up

to  a  point, such growth is futile, if productivity gain  is

not  generated because wage increases will eat into the value

added;  or newer production from somewhere in the world  will

make  us less competitive.  Capital investment will also move

to  these  countries  in search of better  rates  of  return.

Today, faced with competitors with huge labour supply,  input

growth is not a viable solution.  In the long run, it is  not

growth  but  productivity that determines whether our  people

will have a better standard of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the Government's intention to strengthen the

spirit   of   entrepreneurship   and   risk   taking    among

Singaporeans,   as   the   basis   for   Singapore's   future

competitiveness.  We must welcome foreign  talent.   We  must

also  value  our  own.   That must be the  corollary  of  our

national  economic agenda.  Are our existing  rules  flexible

and expeditious enough for our entrepreneurs to allow them to

pick  up  the threads and go ahead quickly, or be  caught  in

bureaucratic regulatory pitfalls?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the issues highlighted in the Addendum to the

President's Address touches on innovation, the responsiveness

of the public sector and improvement in service delivery.   I

totally  agree and I find that a lot of good can be  achieved

through some inter-Ministry coordination to cut red tape.   I

give two examples.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs will have come across this problem in their

house-to-house  visits where residents complained  about  the

mosquito  nuisance  for themselves and  their  children.   It

could  be  in the open field, which is under one Ministry  or

the Land



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



Department, or a construction site for a school under MOE, or

a  construction  site  under MND.   I  see  that  the  Senior

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the  Minister   for   National

Development is smiling.  So, many different Ministries can be

involved  in  these sites, and the Town Council staff,  which

the  poor  MP  can count on, has to get the bureaucratic  red

tape  sorted out before some action can be taken.  Every time

after  a  Ministry's clearance, some fogging is done  by  the

relevant   body  and  after  that  forgotten,   leaving   the

mosquitoes  to breed again.  It seems an unsolvable  problem,

but  actually  the solution is quite simple.  Quite  frankly,

some  local action by the Town Council can be done  on  these

sites to fog regularly and the bill and fines be given to the

Ministry or the contractors.  But that would require an inter-Ministry coordination effort to cut the red tape.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second example I want to give concerns the never-ending fortnightly visits to the immigration authority office

to   extend  social  visit  passes  of  foreign  spouses   of

Singaporeans.   Each time the poor Singaporean  has  to  take

leave to bring his/her spouse to the office and pay a fee for

renewal.  Can we not make life a bit easier by granting  such

Singaporeans' spouses a 3-month visa?  Straightaway  it  will

help  to solve the frightful queue at the SIR office and help

save  cost  for  these Singaporeans.  Do  these  spouses  not

deserve at least a 3-month visa?  I have actually come across

many  cases  where they have been renewing fortnightly  visas

for  two  years.  If anything, it will enable  them  to  plan

their family life better with a 3-month horizon, and put less

stress  on the families.  Can one imagine what life  is  like

with a foreign spouse on a 2-week visa for months on end?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I note in the Addendum that it is the

Government's  policy to ensure as low a tax  burden  so  that

Singapore  would  be  attractive  for  investment   and   job

creation.  It is also mentioned that the Government is aiming

for  a  modest budget surplus over a business  cycle.   If  I

understand this correctly, as it seems to be saying, it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



would  be  good  news.   Maintaining  fiscal  discipline   is

undoubtedly important.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not against budget surplus, but persistently high

budget  surpluses draw dynamism away from the private  sector

economy.  Public savings in Government revenue must find  its

corollary  effects  in  diminished  private  sector  savings,

thereby  affecting  private sector investments  which  create

further  wealth and jobs.  The public sector officials  argue

for  public  savings  for the ageing  economy.   But  do  not

forget,  the  private sector members must be responsible  for

saving for their own old age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other statutory costs, Government charges, licensing

fees  add up as other additional costs besides taxes.   While

taxation  may be comparatively low, the operating environment

after the flow through may cause the cost of operation to  be

high  because of the various statutory costs.  A look at  the

Report  of the Estimates Committee will bear me out,  to  see

the  amount of such statutory collections.  We need to really

address  this issue in our review of the economy to make  our

economy competitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the President has highlighted the cultural

issues  and challenges we face as a nation.  I have  focussed

mainly  on the economy, but there is no doubt that the social

challenges confronting us require a renewed response from  us

to  find  more  common ground.  We need to  know  more  about

ourselves  as Singaporeans.  This should be done in  schools,

in  the  workplaces, in community centres, in the celebration

of  festivals.  We must learn to speak the languages  of  our

other  brothers and sisters.  Only then will the  bond  among

Singaporeans be stronger than the forces which  can  tear  it

apart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</b> Sir, may I

take  this opportunity to congratulate you as Speaker of this

Parliament.  I would also like to thank the President for his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



invaluable  insights, and Mrs Lim Hwee  Hua  for  moving  the

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is late in the day. You have listened to close

to  40  speeches.   It  is unfortunate that  I  am  the  last

speaker.  Although I am the last speaker, I am sure I do  not

have  the last word.  But I thought, Sir, you might  like  to

listen to a story for a change.  This story happened in China

during the warring period, what the Chinese call the Zhan Guo

period,  roughly  from  475 BC to 221  BC.   Because  of  the

constant outbreak of wars in China during that period,  hence

the term "warring states".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two states, Wei state and Zhao state decided to sign a

peace  treaty, but they did not trust each other.  Hence,  in

order  to  enforce  the sanctity of the treaty,  it  was  the

practice  then  to exchange hostages, and the higher  ranking

the  hostage they would exchange, the more sincere the treaty

would  be.   The Wei king was very keen to secure this  peace

deal,  because he knew, like us, that peace is the foundation

for  prosperity.  So he sent his most loved son to  the  Zhao

state.  But the journey from the Wei state to the Zhao  state

was long and hazardous.  There were bandits and all kinds  of

people  waiting  to disrupt the journey.   So  the  Wei  king

decided  to send Pang Gong, his most loyal, trusted and  most

able  official to escort the prince.  Pang Gong was  honoured

but very worried.  The journey to the Zhao state was long and

treacherous,  but  that did not frighten him.   What  he  was

worried  about was that the long absence from the  Wei  state

would allow his adversaries in the palace to poison the  mind

of the king, and undermine the trust the king had in him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he left for the journey, he asked for a meeting

with  the  king.  So he asked the king, "Your Majesty,  would

you believe me if I told you that I saw a tiger in the street

this  morning?"   The king replied, "Of course,  not,  it  is

ridiculous.  This is Wei state.  We are a peaceful  country."

The loyal official persisted and said, "Your Majesty, suppose

I  told  you  that another person saw a tiger this  morning."

The  king  said, "In that case, I may have to look  into  the

rumour.  I cannot dismiss the rumour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



outright."  "Your Majesty," the official insisted, "what if a

third  person also saw the tiger on the streets and told  you

so?"   The  king  said, "If three persons told  me  the  same

story, then there must be truth in it.  I believe there  must

be  a  tiger in the streets."  The loyal official said, "Sir,

Your Majesty, I have just tricked you, because you must never

believe  in  rumour.   There is no tiger in  the  Wei  state.

When  I  am away, Sir, many officials will try to poison  me.

You  must  never believe them, because my loyalty to  you  is

absolute."  The king said, "Don't worry. Go!  Just  send  the

prince  there.   Secure  the peace deal.   You  are  my  best

official,  most  loyal  and the most skilled."   And  so  the

official went.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sooner had the official gone on the journey, the

first enemy came and poisoned the mind of the king.  The king

dismissed him, "Go!  I don't believe you."  A few days later,

a second official came and told the king, "Pang Gong may harm

the  prince along the way.  Don't trust him."  The king began

to  waver.  And then a few days later, a third official,  and

more  and  more,  came  to tell the king  that  the  official

accompanying  the prince cannot be trusted.  Eventually,  the

king  lost trust in the loyal official, and this story became

known  in  the Chinese idiom as san ren cheng hu,  translated

literally, it means "three persons make a tiger".   Sir,  you

might  well ask: What relevance has this story got to  do  in

this important Presidential Address?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of late, there is a climate of gloom and doom all

around.  I enjoyed Dr Wang Kai Yuen's speech very much.  Even

his  speech  was  very pessimistic.  This haze  of  pessimism

hangs  over  many of us - in this House, outside  the  House.

The   interminable  streams  of  media  stories  about   MNCs

relocating  their factories and operations out of  Singapore,

the  stories  about  terrorism at our doorsteps  and  stories

about  insecurity  around the region are  depressing  indeed.

People  are  whispering quietly in our ears:   Can  Singapore

compete?   Will  our  children have a future?   Or,  will  we

perish?   The rumours are spread from one person  to  another

person outside the confines of this House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One begins to wonder if Singapore is indeed losing its

core  strength - its competitiveness.  While each  individual

story is true, Maersk has gone, maybe more may be going, more

factories  are  closing, Shell IT hub may be going  to  Kuala

Lumpur, BMW may be going away again, or part of it at  least,

together,  these stories become a tiger out in  the  streets,

and  we  believe that a tiger exists waiting to vanquish  our

economy.  Indeed, some of my closest grassroots leaders  have

told  me  quietly  over  coffee-shop  talks:   Is  this   the

beginning of the end of Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore must never fall into the trap of being

haunted by the ghost of the tiger in san ren cheng hu.   Take

the  story  of  PSA.   Many people  have  told  me  that  the

relocation  of Maersk to Tanjong Pelapas is the beginning  of

the  end  of  PSA.  I say these people do not know  Yeo  Ning

Hong.   They do not know PSA's management.  They do not  know

the  port  officers and the port workers' union.  I know  all

four  of  them.  When I became MP, Yeo Ning Hong was in  this

House.   I  went to the NTUC; I worked with the port officers

and  port  workers' union.  Khoo Teng Chye was my schoolmate.

And  these are brave warriors, Sir.  I do not think they will

let PSA down.  Well, we might have lost Maersk, maybe one  or

two  more might go, but I think PSA will survive, and we must

believe  it  will, and we must support these people  and  not

blame  them for chasing Maersk away.  Let me tell Members  in

this  House  and  the  people in the streets.   PSA  is  PSA.

Tanjong Pelapas is Tanjong Pelapas, and the twins shall never

meet.   We  will revisit this topic sometime later.   History

will vindicate me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard so much about remaking Singapore. It is

becoming  a fashionable word - remaking, remaking,  remaking.

You  cannot go wrong if you remake something.  But before  we

remake   Singapore,   Sir,  I  think  we  should   rediscover

Singapore, rediscover our indomitable spirit to fight in  the

face   of  adversity,  rediscover  the  confidence  in   this

Government, rediscover the talent in each one of us.   Unless

we discover these attributes, remaking is no use.  We are not

short of ideas.  Ideas



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



are a dime a dozen.  You talk to your Feedback Committee,  Dr

Wang.   Everyone  will  give  you  three  ideas.   You   want

intellects, Ph.D, go to the university, a dime a dozen.   Not

enough!  Send  out consultants' reports.  Ask consultants  to

come, Mackenzie.  Anybody, you pay to give you all the ideas.

They are mercenaries.  You pay them, they give you ideas!  No

payment, no ideas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the attributes I talked about cannot be bought. We

must rediscover them.  Over the years, rust has crusted these

attributes,  and  we  begin to blame each  other,  blame  the

Government,  blame the individuals, blame high  costs.   More

than 30 years of uninterrupted growth has made us rich.   Now

we are afraid to lose what we have gained.  Thirty years ago,

our  fathers,  our grandfathers fought with this  Government,

and they fought together, because we had nothing to lose.  We

stared danger in the face, and we came so far.  Today, we are

rich.   We  are scared.  We are facing a brave new  world,  a

little  uncertain, but very scared.  I say, do not be scared.

We should rediscover the spirit of the brave men and women of

the 60s, and face the brave new world with renewed courage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we are not so strong and confident, we will

suffer  the  same  fate as Hongkong.  What  is  happening  in

Hongkong  today?   The new Hongkong is the most  dynamic  and

entrepreneurial city state in the world, but no  longer.   If

you go to Hongkong today, a different mood, a different gloom

has befallen the city.  Some years ago, before the changeover

in  1997, on the front page of Fortune magazine, the headline

story  was  called, "The death of Hongkong".  That story  was

sold  like  hot cakes in Hongkong; not that they enjoyed  it.

They  read it, and they were incensed, and many people put  a

challenge to the editor of Fortune magazine that if  Hongkong

were  to suffer post British rule, the editor of Fortune will

be made to eat the cover of that magazine from page to page.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five years on, I think that challenge rings hollow.

Hongkong  is  in  the  death throes.  Hongkongers  have  lost

confidence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



in themselves, and many have given up, and more are giving up

day by day.  Unemployment today in Hongkong is a record 6.8%.

We  are  close to 5%.  Up to January 2002, that  means  early

this   year,  Hongkong  has  had  36  months  of  consecutive

deflation.   That means, month after month,  people  are  not

buying,  people  are not spending and not investing,  because

they  are waiting for prices to go down even more.  They have

lost  confidence.  And they are wallowing in pity and sorrow.

This  year, Hongkong is expected to chalk up a record  budget

deficit of something like HK$65.6 billion.  The Secretary  of

Finance said that if it goes on like that, Hongkong's coffers

will be broke in five to six years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surprisingly, all these are happening in the shadow of

China, the fastest growing economy in the world.  So one must

ask:  why are Hongkongers so pessimistic?  Should it  not  be

riding  the dragon?  Hongkong used to be the tail that wagged

the  dog  of  China.   Today,  Hongkongers  are  walking  the

streets,  their heads down, and the unkinder ones say,  their

tails between their legs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, I read a column by Christine Loh. Christine

Loh  used  to  scold  the Government.   She  would  tell  the

Government to go to hell, Government is doing this wrong  and

that  wrong.  And it is surprising to see that Christine  Loh

took on the role to rally the people, and Christine Loh wrote

in  a  column of South China Morning Post - I think the South

China Morning Post weekend.  She said: "Why are we so gloomy?

There  is  a future in Hongkong.  Just listen to Zhu  Rongji.

What  did Zhu Rongji tell Hongkongers?  He said, and he  told

the  Hongkongers, `There is no city in mainland  China  today

that  is  able  to  surpass Hongkong.  Not  yet.'   From  Zhu

Rongji, the Chinese Premier to Hongkongers."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my recent visit to Hongkong, many Hongkong friends

(taxi-drivers,  casual  street  vendors)  have  told  me   in

Cantonese.   And, Sir, with your indulgence,  I  will  repeat

what  they told me.  They said, "Heong Kong wan yuan ler,  mo

ta wan de ler!"  In other words, the game is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



over, game set and match.  Hongkong is finished, kaput habis!

And  that is worrying because Hongkong survives on a dose  of

confidence; without confidence, Hongkong is nothing.  I think

the  mercurial Hongkongers will survive but not  until  their

people  have  picked  themselves up  and  rediscovered  their

spirit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a bit like Hongkong today. We are demoralised.

We  are worried about high costs.  And in this House, we have

heard  many pessimistic speeches.  But now back to Singapore,

Sir.   Tales of downsizing, retrenchments, relocations, shut-downs  are  indeed very depressing.  These stories appear  in

the  newspapers  every day.  That we have  gone  through  the

worst  recession, at least statistically speaking, is a fact.

Yes, unemployment is a record high.  The Ministry of Manpower

has  warned that it might go higher.  Yes, terrorism is  here

to  stay  and  we cannot wish it away, and, yes, Malaysia  is

picking  on  us again.  Yes, of course, we are  an  expensive

city.   And, yes, the region is trapped in a global slowdown.

Indeed, we have lots of problems.  But, Sir, no, this is  not

the  end  of  Singapore.  The first thing we must believe  is

this is not the end of Singapore, and we will survive, and we

will  reinvent ourselves once we have rediscovered our  basic

virtues.  Just like we did in the 60s when the road ahead was

even more uncertain, more rocky.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to conclude, there are three reasons for my

conviction or one conviction based on three reasons.   First,

we  have  more  resources today than we have ever  had.   Our

reserves  are healthy; financially we are liquid, with  very,

very little debts; our infrastructure is impeccable.  Yes, we

are expensive, we have got to watch the costs.  This is where

remaking  comes in.  Second, we have a better workforce  than

we  have ever had in the 60s.  Our best are world-class.   Dr

Wang said that there are a few Ph.Ds. in this House.  In  the

60s, there were very few, probably none, maybe Dr Toh and  Dr

Goh.  Third, we have a formidable total defence force and  an

extremely cohesive community.  The Government, the unions and

employers  work  as  a  team.  In the 60s,  the  people  were

fighting the Government on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



streets,  the unions were fighting each other, and  employers

and  the unions were at each other's throat.  Today,  we  are

sitting  on  the  same side of the table  and  talking.   But

beyond  all this, I think the most important reason  is  that

the  Government  is  not  in  self-denial.   The  President's

Address  laid  out the challenges, pointed  out  the  dangers

ahead - I think that is a good rallying point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can remake Singapore once we have driven the

tiger  -  the tiger of san ren cheng hu - back to the warring

states.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Tan Cheng Bock shall be our last

speaker.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker,

Sir.   I know I am not scheduled to speak.  But when I  stood

up to speak, I was stopped by you, Sir.  I had only wanted to

caution my good friend, my fellow MP Inderjit Singh,  on  his

choice  of  words.   He made a good speech.   Throughout  his

speech,  I  was feeling very uncomfortable in  his  call  for

economic  colonisation.  He belongs to the new generation  of

Singaporeans.  He did not live under the colonial  days,  and

economic colonisation may be a new economic buzzword -  am  I

right?   I  am  not  so  sure.  But I live  at  a  time  when

Singapore  was  a colony, and the British were  our  colonial

masters.   And  the  word "colonisation" has  a  very  strong

emotive meaning, not only for my generation but also for  the

generation  of  those  people  across  the  Causeway  and  in

Indonesia,  and also in many other countries not only  within

this  area  but  just  a  little bit  further  from  the  two

countries which have just got rid of their colonial  masters.

Therefore,  the  words  "economic  colonisation"   could   be

misconstrued and misinterpreted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



by  many  people,  and we coming to invest  with  a  colonial

mentality when we go there to do business.  We must not allow

this to happen.  That is why I chose to speak.  And I am sure

Mr  Inderjit  Singh never had this in his mind.   He  may  be

quite  innocent, but these two words could carry a very wrong

connotation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are a small nation with some

economic  clout,  but  we are nothing  compared  to  the  US,

nothing compared to Japan, nothing compared to Europe.  We do

not  have  their might and influence.  So we should  get  our

perspective right.  We are only trying to find niche  markets

in  this global economy.  So, let us just do that, and do  it

in a quiet and humble way.
