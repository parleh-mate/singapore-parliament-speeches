<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 3.58 p.m. the Sergeant at Arms came and brought the Mace, and laid it below the Table.





<div align="center"><b>RESIGNATION OF SPEAKER</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House being met; and Mr Loke Weng Chee,

Clerk  of  the  Legislative Assembly,  Mr  Abilio

Lopez,  Clerk Assistant, and Mr Tan Peng  Chiang,

Second  Clerk Assistant, coming in procession  and

repairing  to  their  seats;  the  Clerk  informed

Honourable Members that he had that day at 12 noon

received  a  letter under the hand of  Sir  George

Edward  Noel  Oehlers  resigning  his  office   as

Speaker of the Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff (Anson)</b> stood

up,  and  addressing himself to the Clerk  of  the

Assembly  (who, standing up, pointed  to  him  and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That George Edward Noel Oehlers do take the Chair

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There being no other proposal, the

Clerk then declared George Edward

Noel Oehlers to have been elected as

Speaker of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assembly having thus unanimously called Sir

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker</b>, standing at the Table, took and subscribed the Oath of Allegiance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker</b> went to the Chair and sat down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Mace (which before lay below the Table)

was placed upon the Table.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I would like most sincerely to say

that  I  am  deeply conscious of the great  honour

which  this  Assembly  has conferred  upon  me  by

calling me to this Chair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From today I take the Chair of this Assembly no

longer as a Speaker nominated and appointed  by  a

Governor,  nor as a Speaker, as it were,  "written

into   the   Constitution", but  as  an   elected

Speaker - a  Speaker elected by Honourable  Members,

who  are here, in this Chamber, by the will of the

people  of Singapore and whose every act  in  this

Chamber  may  well be translated as  a  reflex  of

public opinion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore with added pleasure that I enter

into a new phase of my life in the public service,

and   that   pleasure  is  a   source   of   great

satisfaction because, in this Assembly as  in  the

past,  there are undoubted opportunities for  warm

friendships, for understanding, for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



tolerance and for good humour. Those are  some  of

the  essentials  without which no  Parliament  can

ever hope to flourish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members will, as time goes on (if they

have not already done so), come to experience that

sense  of  love,  reverence  and  pride  for  this

Assembly   which  the  dignity  of   Parliamentary

establishments   and  the  orderly   practice   of

Parliamentary democracy will inevitably breed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an Assembly which has grown in stature

during the past few years. There is much that  has

yet to be done and accomplished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, for example, the question of the

independence of the Assembly Staff which  has  not

as  yet been achieved, but on which the Honourable

the  Prime  Minister touched during the course  of

the  past  session and on which, I  am  sure,  he,

other  Honourable Members and I myself would  wish

to say a few words during the coming session.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the pressing problem of the speedier

production  of our Official Reports - our  Hansards.

It  is,  to  my mind, a matter of urgent necessity

that recognition be given to the importance of the

question of speedy production of our Hansards, not

only in relation to the convenience of Members but

also  in relation to prestige. Other legislatures,

large  and small, have been able to produce  their

Hansards   overnight.  The  problem  facing   this

Assembly  is  one of ways and means of  increasing

the   number  on  our  reporting  staff  and   the

facilities now available in the Printing Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is the perfection of our system

of  simultaneous interpretation in  this  Chamber.

Simultaneous interpretation is an art which is  so

new  to  Singapore and which is of such difficulty

and  complexity  that  one must  expect  "teething

troubles", and these "teething troubles", I  fear,

are  still present; but they will disappear in the

course of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are some of the problems which confront this

Assembly,  and  with  goodwill,  forbearance   and

assistance from Honourable Members, I am confident



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



that  those problems will be solved and the steady

pace  of our growth will be maintained. Honourable

Members  will know that it is as much  their  duty

and  responsibility, as it is mine, to  guard  and

nurture  the  exemplary tradition  and  reputation

which  this  Assembly has slowly but  surely  been

establishing in South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with those thoughts that I sincerely thank

Honourable  Members for having called me  to  this

Chair and I humbly submit myself to the service of

this Assembly.



<br><br>4.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker,   in   accordance  with   the   best   of

Parliamentary traditions established elsewhere,  I

have  been accorded the honour of being the  first

to  congratulate you. But I find  that  the  usual

sentiments expressed in other Parliaments on  such

occasions are, by and large, inappropriate for the

situation,  which we are in. It is  inappropriate,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, to express regret at our having

lost  your powers of eloquence, humour and wit  by

your  being elevated to the Chair and, at the same

time, to congratulate ourselves on having acquired

a   wise,  just  and  impartial  arbiter  of   the

proceedings of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task which we have invited you to continue

discharging  is  not the simple one  of  following

traditions  and precedents. You have been  Speaker

of  the last Assembly, in which the beginnings  of

the  rules of debate were laid down, and the  tone

and  atmosphere  of this Chamber  slowly  evolved.

But, with the introduction of multilingualism, the

task  to which you have been elected has now  some

of   the   complications,  which  a  Chairman   of

international  conferences  must  face.   Can   we

maintain decorum and an air of intimacy in  debate

in  spite  of the fact that the Chairman and  many

Members  of the House will not know what is  being

said  until  it is irretrievably recorded  in  the

official  tapes? Can such a Chairman  develop  the

intuition and the powers to fathom evil intentions

of wicked tongues before these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



words  have been uttered? Can there be a sense  of

humour and an atmosphere of conviviality as one is

being  harangued in a language not understood  and

even  through an interpretation not always clearly

understandable? The past year has  given  us  some

experience  of  the problems,  which  we  have  to

resolve  if  we are to maintain this  House  as  a

debating  and a thinking Chamber, and not  just  a

forum for declamations and denunciations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I congratulate you on having

won  the unanimous support of all Members of  this

House  by  the fair and judicious manner in  which

you  have  discharged your duties? And may  I,  on

behalf of the Government Bench, assure you of  our

continued  support in maintaining  this  House  in

good  humour  and good order and  in  keeping  the

country in good heart?



<br><br>4.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I am very grateful indeed for the opportunity that

has  been  afforded me to speak on behalf  of  the

Singapore   People's  Alliance   in   the   House.

Unfortunately,  the  leader of  my  Party  is  not

present  here  today and it has fallen  to  me  to

speak on behalf of the Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I be permitted on such an

occasion as this to introduce a personal note into

what  I have to say. Mr Speaker, Sir, you  and  I

have  known  each other when we were both  members

for some time of the City Council, and previous to

that  of  the Board of Commissioners.  I  believe,

Sir,  it was in 1955 that you were called upon  by

the Governor to take on what was then, to my mind,

the  most difficult task of being the Speaker  and

setting  the  tracks  of the  Legislature  on  its

proper  course. When your name was announced,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  as  the  future  Speaker  of   the

Legislature, I personally was confident  that  the

right  choice had been made, because, having  been

associated with you and having worked with you  on

the Commission, I knew that you had won the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>



confidence and respect of that body on  which  you

served.  To my mind, Mr Speaker, Sir, a necessary

prerequisite to an efficient and impartial Speaker

is the confidence and respect of the Assembly over

which  he  presides.  You  had  that  respect  and

confidence  then, and you won that confidence  and

respect by hard work, by not talking out of  turn,

by  not talking on irrelevant things, and when you

did say things, all the people who listened to you

were convinced that you spoke because you had  to,

because you believed in what you said, and it  was

necessary that it had to be said. You came here to

this  Legislature - I was not in  it  then - and  from

what  I could gather from the past Members of  the

Legislature,  you  too  won  the  confidence   and

respect of that House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my honour to serve in the second

Legislature here. I have now seen you work for the

last year and I see that you have again gained the

confidence  and respect of this House to  such  an

extent  that you have been unanimously re-elected.

Might I, with respect, Sir, say that, in so far as

the  Opposition  is  concerned,  we  will  conduct

ourselves  in  the way that every good  and  loyal

Opposition must?



<br><br>4.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of my

Party, U.M.N.O., I congratulate you on your  being

elected as S peaker of this Legislative Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the constitutional talks in London, we

agreed that the post of Speaker should be held  by

you,  Sir,  for  a period of one  year  after  the

general  elections, and that after that period  it

would    be   left   to   the   elected   people's

representatives  in  this  Assembly  to  elect   a

Speaker of their own choice. The one-year  period

ends  today  and  the time has come  for  us,  the

people's  representatives  in  this  Assembly,  to

elect  a successor. You have just been elected  as

Speaker of this Assembly by a unanimous vote. This

means   that  we,  the  people's  representatives,

highly appreciate your good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>



services and experience as a man of justice who is

always  sympathetic, as one  who,  at  all  times,

respects  the rules and regulations and  does  not

deviate from the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in the past you were nominated by the colonial

government,  today you have been  elected  by  the

people's  elected representatives,  and  this,  in

effect,  means that you have also been  indirectly

elected by the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My U.M.N.O. colleagues and I have complete

confidence that you will discharge your tasks  and

responsibilities in the same manner  as  you  have

performed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



them  during the past five years; that is to  say,

to become the "Chairman" of this Assembly not only

in  accordance with the Constitution of the island

of  Singapore, but also that you will be guided by

the best traditions of Parliamentary democracy.
