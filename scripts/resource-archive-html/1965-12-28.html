<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0702 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0702 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1051.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the field of medical services, our

country  has  won  general acclaim. The  Government  has

spent  $40 million to look after the health and  medical

services for the people. Clinics have been built to look

after the people's health. In spite of the smallness  of

our country, our health services can be said



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



to  be  on par with the standard obtainable in any other

country.  For  this, I have to thank  the  Minister  for

Health and our Government for their able leadership. But

there  is nothing perfect in all respects. Therefore,  I

have   to   comment  somewhat  on  the   drawbacks   and

shortcomings of the General Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Hospital has been set up for quite a long

time.  It has an important place in Singapore's  medical

history.  It has set up an exemplary record  in  medical

service.   Nevertheless,   I   have   received   several

complaints from members of the public about the  General

Hospital.  Firstly, I would like to give an example.  In

my  constituency, there is a spinster 60 years  old  who

cannot  see beyond several yards. She went for treatment

at  the  General Hospital. But the officer-in-charge  of

the  Eye Clinic there did not treat her eye disease  and

did  not  give  any  reasons.  So  this  lady  was  very

frustrated and came to see me. I sent her with a  letter

to  see  the  Medical Officer-in-charge on  the  6th  of

December.  He  recorded her particulars,  including  her

name and address, and asked her to go back, telling  her

that  she  would be called when necessary. As far  as  I

understand,  the lady, after three weeks, has  not  been

called  back  for any attention. Sir, I would  like  the

Minister  concerned  to see whether  there  is  such  an

incident,  and I would like to know what is  the  reason

for this happening.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in respect of doctors and nurses, they do

not  promptly  deal with emergency cases. Of  course,  I

understand  there are lots of sick people going  to  the

General Hospital to seek treatment, and I understand the

doctors  and nurses are overworked. But in emergency  or

acute  cases, doctors and nurses seem not to have  acted

promptly   in  dealing  with  them.  Sometimes  patients

suffering from appendicitis have had to wait for two  or

three  hours,  and this delay might have been  fatal  to

them.  So  I  urge the hospital authorities to  be  more

concerned  with these emergency cases and  act  promptly

when they arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, concerning the attitude of some nurses in the

General Hospital.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



Many  members  of  the public have complained  that  the

nurses have not been courteous enough when dealing  with

patients.  Sometimes they have been contemptuous.  So  I

hope  the  authorities concerned  will  look  into  this

matter.  I hope such incidents have been very rare,  and

that there will not be any more of these to destroy  the

good  reputation of our medical institutions. The  staff

should  be  taught courtesy and to be kind  and

tender-hearted especially when dealing with patients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I understand the Ministry of Health has

been  conducting  a  nurse-training course.  Apart  from

giving  nurses  medical training, they  should  also  be

given  courtesy training so that they may treat  members

of the public well, especially the patients.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I believe the Member for  Sembawang  has

three sets of complaints to make against the Ministry of

Health. I would like to take them in the order in  which

they have been presented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first complaint, in one particular case, is that

there  was  a 60-year old woman who had an eye complaint

and  who did not receive any attention when she went  to

the  Opthalmic  Department of the General Hospital;  and

when  the complainant saw the Member for Sembawang about

this,  he  gave her a letter of introduction  which  was

duly considered by the people in charge, taken note  of,

and  she was asked to go back and she would be told when

to  appear again at the hospital. But up till now - it is

three weeks since he wrote the letter of introduction - there

has been no news requesting her to turn up at  the

hospital  for attention. I want to say that I myself  do

get  similar requests for letters of introduction to see

this doctor or that surgeon and I have to tell them that

although I personally may be the Minister for Health,  I

am  not  a Doctor of Medicine and I am not in a position

to  give any letters of introduction. So I think my good

friend  the Member for Sembawang has taken upon  himself

quite a lot by issuing letters of introduction addressed

to the doctors in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



hospital.  The proper procedure would be to  advise  the

patient,  or whoever is not feeling too well,  to  first

see  a  doctor,  who  would then be  in  a  position  to

diagnose the complaint.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After examining the condition of the patient, this

particular  doctor would then give a letter  -  what  is

known as a letter of referral; that is to say, a general

practitioner refers a patient to a specialist, who would

then  attend  on him. So I hope in future instances,  my

hon. friend  from Sembawang would do better  to  follow

this  line  of  routine  rather than  issue  letters  of

introduction  addressed  to  various  officials  of   my

Ministry. However, if he will be good enough to  let  me

know  the  name of this particular patient, the  60-year

old woman, I will try to assist him in this respect,  to

make  sure  that she gets some attention, but this  does

not go for all other cases in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second complaint is that many patients in the

General  Hospital  have  to  wait  a  long  time  before

receiving attention. I am afraid he is not so particular

in  this  complaint  in  that he makes  a  very  general

statement. It is very difficult to try to follow it  up,

and  I  would  prefer  if  he  could  give  me  specific

instances  of so-called delays encountered  by  patients

before  they received attention. I must, however,  state

that  it  is  more than one and a half years ago,  since

August  1964,  that  the Outpatient  Dispensary  of  the

General Hospital was closed down. In its place, there is

a 24-hour Emergency Unit in the General Hospital to deal

with serious emergencies or with cases where people have

been  involved in motor accidents. Ever since that time,

I have been given to understand that all such cases have

been promptly look after, and many of those who have had

occasion to go to this emergency unit have indicated how

pleased they were that the reorganisation has now  given

them  more  efficient  and  quicker  service  than   was

available hitherto.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is the case of an emergency patient having to

wait for a long time for a doctor to examine his case, I

would  appreciate it if the Member for  Sembawang  would

indicate the patient concerned and the day on which this

incident  happened,  so that I can then  follow  it  up,

rather than making just a complaint that people have  to

wait  for  a long time to see a doctor and just stopping

there.  I am afraid I am not in a position to follow  up

on a general complaint of that nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the third complaint about the attitude of some

nurses - I am glad that he says some nurses but not  all

nurses - who may appear to be somewhat ill-mannered  and

show  a lack of patience with some of those who are ill,

I  think it is almost impossible to expect a hundred per

cent of all nurses to be very well-mannered and full  of

patience  all  the time. Here again I do  not  think  it

would  be fair to make just a general statement  without

giving specific instances of bad, ill-mannered treatment

of  patients  in hospitals. It is almost  impossible  to

defend  against such a complaint. But in regard  to  the

remarks  of  the Member that perhaps in  the  School  of

Nursing there should be established a courtesy course, I

believe  this  is  a matter which the  hon.  Member  for

Moulmein has already raised some time ago, namely,  that

perhaps  we should institute a courtesy course  for  our

nurses.  This is part and parcel of the general training

of nurses, and I do not think it is necessary to have  a

specific courtesy course for nurses in general. They are

expected  to  treat  everyone  with  courtesy,  more  so

towards those who are ill and who would really need  not

only their attention but also normal courtesy which  one

citizen would extend to another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have been able to answer all the three points

raised by the hon. Member for Sembawang. Should he  have

occasion to have complaints, I would appreciate it if he

could   direct  them  to  me  personally,  giving   more

information than he has given.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I thank the Minister

for Health for giving me a detailed reply. Just now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



I  did not accuse all the nurses. I just mentioned  that

there  were  some occasions of that nature.  I  was  not

generalising,  otherwise the good name  of  the  medical

services  would be adversely affected. If  the  Minister

wants the names, I have a list already prepared for him.

I can give him this list of names.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member wish to proceed with his

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member is not moving.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0702 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1650.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, assistant nursing is a profession

which  requires  the necessary education,  training  and

skill.   Quite   a   number  of  our  girls   who   have

qualifications  higher  than the minimum  necessary  for

assistant nurses prefer to go for other jobs rather than

apply as assistant nurses. The reason is that they  have

to  undergo  training for not less than two  years,  and

they have to pass an examination. Once they are accepted

into  the  medical service, they have  to  go  on  shift

duties.  There are times when they have to be awake  the

whole  night  until morning. There are times  when  they

have to work while others have their day off on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



public  holidays.  However  that  may  be,  there  is  a

sufficient number of our girls who wish to work  in  the

hospitals in order to give assistance to members of  the

public  who  require medical attention, by  joining  the

service  as assistant nurses. The spirit of these  girls

who  do want to join as assistant nurses is dampened  by

the  existence  of  the  new government  system  -  this

applies  to pupil assistant nurses - whereby  those  who

passed  their examination after their training  have  to

reapply in order to become assistant nurses and serve in

the  hospitals. Those who are selected will continue  to

serve as assistant nurses and those who are not selected

will  be victimised. They cannot work in private clinics

because  they  have  qualifications  only  as  assistant

nurses,  and  private  clinics do not  employ  assistant

nurses.  I  do  not know whether there  are  nurses  and

midwives who, after having passed their examination, are

required to reapply. If the conditions of employing  the

nurses  and  midwives are the same as assistant  nurses,

and  those  who  are not selected can  work  in  private

clinics,  and so also the midwives can work  in  private

clinics,  or  become  private certified  midwives,  then

their  time  and  training would not have  been  wasted.

These  assistant nurses cannot work as private assistant

nurses.  The only place where they can work  is  in  the

hospital. Therefore, I hope the Minister concerned  will

see  to it that the system whereby assistant nurses have

to  reapply  in  order that they  can  be  taken  on  as

assistant  nurses  will be abolished. This  will  enable

those   who  have  passed  their  examination  to   work

straightaway as assistant nurses, because they have  had

training  for  not less than two years.  Otherwise  they

will  merely be victims of circumstances, and  it  would

not be possible for them to earn their living by working

elsewhere in a private capacity. Two years of their time

would  thus  have been wasted. I hope the  Minister  for

Health will see to it that the assistant nurses who have

passed  their examination will be accepted rightaway  to

serve as assistant nurses in the hospitals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member

for Kampong Kembangan is raising the question of some

assistant nurses who are now in the Tan Tock Seng

Hospital over their recruitment policy, which has shown

a slight change as compared with previous years. There

is no question at all regarding the value of assistant

nurses in our hospital service. When opening the School

for Assistant Nurses in Thomson Road Hospital some

months back, I had occasion to pay tribute to the

assistant nursing service which has become one of the

pillars of our hospital service in assisting staff

nurses to run our hospitals. There is a shortage of

trained nurses as well as trained assistant nurses in

our hospitals, and this will be so for quite some time.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unfortunately, owing to the fact that a number of

approved  posts  in the hospitals for  assistant  nurses

would  appear  to be a little less than  the  number  of

pupils in the School of Nursing, it was necessary in the

middle  of  this year (that is to say, in July),  for  a

tripartite  discussion  to be held  between  the  Public

Service  Commission, the Treasury, and the  Ministry  of

Health, to ensure that by next year, 1966-7, a situation

will not arise where there are less posts than there are

numbers  of trained assistant nurses who have graduated;

in  other  words,  we will be having  trained  assistant

nurses and not having posts for them. Therefore, it  has

been  decided  that the few batches of assistant  nurses

that  will graduate this year will be informed  that  it

would  be  necessary for them to go through a  selection

exercise  by the Public Service Commission. It  was  not

necessary  to do so in the past because there were  more

approved posts than there were trained assistant nurses.

So  it  was  actually  a  case  of  the  Public  Service

Commission having waived the requirements of a selection

exercise  after graduation. Hence, there  was  a  little

unhappiness amongst assistant nurses in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



Tan Tock Seng Hospital, that there has been a change  in

the  terms  of service. So I would like to assure  those

who  have graduated this year from the School of Nursing

as  assistant nurses, that there should be no difficulty

in placing them on the permanent establishment, but this

is  a precautionary measure being taken by the officials

so  as  not  to  have  a  situation  whereby  they  find

themselves caught, as it were, with more trained  nurses

than there are established posts approved by Treasury.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to say that the question of nurses

in  our  hospital service is a matter that is  receiving

attention  by the Nursing Board. This is a  question  of

reviewing  the whole position of staffing of  nurses  in

our  hospitals.  A memorandum is already in  preparation

and it will be studied by the Ministry during the course

of  the  next  few months. It is hoped  that  when  this

matter  is  finally  considered, a situation  like  that

which has recently taken place in Tan Tock Seng Hospital

will not have to take place at all.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish

to  thank  the Minister for the assurances he has  given - that the assistant nurses who have graduated this  year

will  not  face any difficulty in being taken  into  the

position regarding assistant nurses who graduate in  the

years to come?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I have said that for the present

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In speaking on this amendment, Members

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think it

is  correct  to  say that people are given  free  music,

because  everything  has got to be  paid  for.  Even  in

music, whether it is Rediffusion or Radio music, the set

has got to be installed at some cost. I do agree that it

is  nice  to be able to provide musical

entertainment - whether over Rediffusion or Radio - to cheer up the sick

and especially little children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for T.V. sets, they are fairly costly. So far, we

have  been  able  to install T.V. sets  through  private

donations. Certain wards in certain hospitals have  T.V.

sets installed through the kindness and excellent social

spirit  of  either  certain  individuals  or  charitable

organisations. I hope this spirit can be  continued  and

also  that the Member for Aljunied would make a move  by

donating  one  T.V. set  so  that  others  may  follow!

Otherwise  I  may have to work very hard with  our  Hon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is for information only. What I

want  to  know  under  this item is  this  -  are  these

patients from Singapore, and are there no facilities for

them in our hospitals?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this provision is

for  the reimbursement of a number of leper patients who

were  originally from Singapore but later were  sent  to

the  Malaysian  leper settlements of  Sungei  Buloh  and

Pulau  Jerejak. There are places available in our  leper

settlement  known  as Trafalgar Home.  In  fact,  unlike

other  hospitals,  we are in the fortunate  position  of

having  accommodation for more than a thousand  patients

suffering from leprosy, but at the moment there are less

than 600 patients receiving attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the number in Sungei Buloh is around 24.

Leprosy  is  a condition which could take  a  number  of

years  to  cure,  so  that  many  of  the  patients  are

practically permanently settled down there. It would  be

quite   a  difficult  matter  to  bring  them  back   to

Singapore,  although we could handle  the  situation  if

they  were here. So it is probably better to allow  them

to continue settling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>



there and we reimburse the cost for these patients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I would like to say that in Trafalgar

Home we have 18 patients who are from Malaysia. So it is

really like there are just as many Malaysian patients in

Singapore  as there are Singapore patients in  Malaysia.

We feel that perhaps the position could be left as it is

without  much disturbance of the patients,  rather  than

withdraw  them from Sungei Buloh and forcibly  put  them

into our Trafalgar Home.

rampant, I believe, not only in my constituency but also

in others as well. I do not know whether strong measures

have been taken to eradicate such nuisance. Almost every

night, for myself, I have got to get up several times to

beat off these mosquitoes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other fact is the question of flies. It seems to

me that this nuisance is also on the increase. I wish to

know from the Hon. Minister for Health what measures his

Ministry  will  take  to  eradicate  such  nuisances  in

respect of mosquitoes and flies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding these

two  complaints, the fly and the mosquito  nuisances,  I

think  it  is  not a question of my Ministry  not  being

aware of their existence so much as what steps are to be

taken  to  put  a  stop  to them, and  these  have  been

unfortunately  allowed  to deteriorate  for  quite  some

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated previously in this debate, in the

Appendix  to His Excellency's Speech, an indication  was

given  that  for  the  coming  year,  there  will  be  a

reorganisation  of  the  Environmental  health  services

which  will  include Public Cleansing, Hawkers  and  the

Anti-mosquito   services.  The  mosquito   nuisance   is

somewhat correlated to a number of other factors besides

just  dealing  with  mosquitoes by our  so-called

Anti-Malarial Department. If public cleansing is

defective - and  unfortunately it is to a great extent -  this  will

bring about considerable piles of refuse not being taken

away  and dealt with, and such refuse will block  drains

and,  therefore, there will be stagnant water which will

ultimately bring about mosquito-breeding and  hence  the

numerous  hordes of mosquitoes which worry not only  the

Member  for  Punggol  but also many  residents  on  this

island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already indicated that there will be licensing of

the 40,000 to 50,000 hawkers during the coming year, and

that  will  be the first step in the control of  hawkers

which will, of course, affect the reorganisation of  the

public cleansing services. And when this is tackled,  it

will  somewhat reduce the mosquito nuisance, because  we

will  then be able to clear away stagnant pools of water

now collecting in numerous drains throughout the city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to deal with the mosquito nuisance

particularly, as the tendency up to the present for  the

last  40  to  50 years has been to tackle  the  mosquito

problem  as an anti-malarial measure, which is  correct,

because as far back as 50 years ago - 1910 to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>



exact  -  there used to be tens of thousands of malarial

cases with over 2,000 deaths each year from malaria. And

then an Anti-Mosquito Ordinance was passed which brought

about  concerted  action against the anopheles  mosquito

which  was  responsible for malaria. Over  a  period  of

years,  malaria became controlled in Singapore  and  the

cases  of malaria began to drop considerably. But during

the Japanese occupation - the years 1941-1945 - the

anti-malarial measures collapsed and again by 1945,  we  came

back  to the 1910 situation where over 2,000 people died

from  malaria. Steps were again taken to put  our

anti-malarial measures back to their original footing, and it

was  only  in  1952  that we went back  to  the  pre-war

control of malaria. So all this while, we have had  more

or  less  been concentrating on anti-malarial  measures.

They have been fairly effective, but unfortunately, with

the  considerable urban development within the city area

and  less  attention being paid to the  construction  of

subsoil  drainage and open drains for  the  carriage  of

drainage  water, we are beginning to have  the  mosquito

nuisance because of the collection of stagnant pools  of

water.  And  I am afraid also that since May 1963  there

have been some difficulties with the workers in the

Anti-Malarial Department who refuse to cut grass if they  are

oilers.  They insist on division of labour. For example,

an anti-malarial oiler who distributes oil over surfaces

of  water in the past used to cut grass every sixth day,

but  unfortunately they now say that they want something

extra  for  cutting  grass,  and  there  has  been  some

difficulty  in agreeing to this request of  division  of

labour. So for the forthcoming year there will be a

re-organisation  to put this matter right. Also  mosquitoes

are  no  longer a nuisance when they just  bite  people,

because  we  are  beginning to find that  the  so-called

mosquito nuisance is no longer a nuisance. There  are  a

number  of  other  types  of  diseases  appearing,  like

filariasis, more commonly known as elephantiasis, caused

by   mosquitoes   biting  individuals   and   there   is

encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



hemorrhagic  fever (that is bleeding into the  skin  and

organs)  - all caused as a result of mosquito bites.  We

are getting something like a hundred cases per year.  So

because  of  these new trends arising  out  of  mosquito

bites, it has been decided to make malaria what is known

as a notifiable disease, that is to say, if a person has

malaria, which is confirmed by taking a blood slide,  it

becomes  obligatory of the doctor to notify the Ministry

of  Health.  We shall be bringing out a new Bill  to  be

called  the Destruction of Mosquito Act so that we  will

be able to have the legislative authority to deal rather

strongly   with  people  who  are  breeding   mosquitoes

probably very innocently in their gardens by putting out

shanghai   jars  for  collecting  rainwater  for   their

gardens,  but at the same time for breeding  mosquitoes,

and  they may all the time be complaining why there  are

mosquitoes  in  their  houses when they  are  themselves

helping  mosquitoes to breed. There will also be created

a new Anti-Mosquito Control Unit. As I have said, in the

past, the tendency has always been on anti-malarial work

-  but  now  we shall call it the Anti-Mosquito  Control

Unit  -  to cover anti-malaria and other diseases caused

by   mosquitoes.  We  have  been  fairly  successful  in

controlling the T.B. problems by establishing  an

Anti-T.B.  Control Unit. So we intend very soon to  establish

what  is known as the Anti-Mosquito Control Unit to

co-ordinate the activities of the Anti-Mosquito Department,

and to cover the whole island. We hope that within a few

years  the so-called mosquito nuisance will be gradually

reduced  and Singapore will be mosquito-free as  far  as

possible.  We  can say that Singapore has been  free  of

malaria  for a number of years, but we are really  right

in  the heart of a very malarious region, which includes

Indonesia  and our next-door neighbour, Malaysia.  Every

year we have a few hundred cases of malaria recorded  in

Singapore but they are all cases that are imported  into

Singapore  and  none  indigenous to Singapore,  although

last year at the Foo Yong Estate in Bukit Timah we had a

local outbreak of malaria which resulted in 29 cases of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>



confirmed malaria, and this occurred in what is known as

a controlled area; that is to say, although we had taken

anti-malarial  measures, yet there was a small  outbreak

of  malaria.  Therefore,  all this  while,  we  have  to

maintain  a very vigilant attitude towards the  mosquito

problem.  We have been reasonably successful for  nearly

50   years  in  the  control  of  malaria.  But  it   is

preferable,  now  that there is such  a  large  mosquito

nuisance  in Singapore, that we should take one  further

step in establishing a centralised unit to control it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now my colleague has spoken about

the  fly and mosquito nuisance. Kampong Kembangan is not

free  from  it. It is a low-lying area and the  fly  and

mosquito  nuisance  is  very  widespread.  However,  the

Minister   has  given  an  assurance  to   improve   the

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point which concerns rubbish in

Kampong  Kembangan. In this constituency,  many  of  the

roads  are  kampong roads and the labourers  dump  their

rubbish  at one place where the rubbish bins are placed.

But the Public Health Division does not send its garbage

lorries  to collect the rubbish on the ground  that  the

roads are narrow. Therefore, the labourers are forced to

burn the rubbish there, but when it rains, it cannot  be

burnt.  Further rubbish is dumped there as the  days  go

by. In those kampongs where the people rear poultry,  if

the  rubbish  is  not removed, the poultry  scatter  the

rubbish.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I ask the Minister to give consideration to provide

a  small  lorry or a jeep which can go over the  kampong

roads  for the collection and disposal of rubbish  which

has been collected from house to house and dumped by the

labourers. I believe that, in this way, the drains  will

be  kept  in  a  better condition and that the  sanitary

condition of the surrounding area will not be neglected.

I  hope consideration will be given by the Minister  for

Health to providing a jeep for the collection of rubbish

which is dumped there.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to  associate  myself with  the  hon.  Member  for

same  complaint that I wish to lodge in this House. Sir,

no  one  can  deny  that the health  facilities  in  our

country are one of the best in South-East Asia, for  the

cleanliness  of  roads  and so on.  Sir,  owing  to  the

increase in the population of our country, I would  like

to  take this opportunity to draw the attention  of  the

Minister  to  the fact that not only in my constituency,

but  also in many other constituencies, there is a great

need for additional labourers to clean kampong roads, to

remove  rubbish and to clean drains, etc. This not  only

applies  to our main island, but also applies to pulaus,

the Southern Islands, Pulau Tekong and Pulau Ubin in  my

constituency. If we can recruit more of these labourers,

I  think  we  can  look  after the  cleanliness  of  the

kampongs much better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point which the hon. Member for Punggol

has mentioned just now is about mosquito breeding in the

rural  areas.  I  too  support his  complaint.  I  would

suggest  that  the  Minister step up  the  anti-mosquito

measures  so that the Ministry can concentrate  more  in

the  rural  areas  rather than in  town  areas,  because

mosquitoes usually breed in rural areas where we get pig

sties, poultry, pot-holes and ponds in the rural



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



areas. Therefore, I urge the Ministry concerned to  take

more  measures  especially in the rural  areas  and  the

pulaus in Singapore. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker,  just  now  my colleagues  have  discussed  the

subject  of mosquitoes and rubbish. I also wish to  draw

the attention of the Ministry concerned to the fact that

the  administration of health facilities  in  the  rural

areas  is  far  from satisfactory. I wish  to  quote  an

example  in my constituency, Geylang Serai. The  rubbish

in  rubbish  bins is not removed by the Health  Division

for  as  long as three days or four days, and  sometimes

for  even one week. This rubbish dumping and stench from

the  rubbish  will affect the health of members  of  the

public.  There  are places in congested areas  where  no

rubbish  bins  are  provided, and this  results  in  the

residents throwing rubbish indiscriminately. I have  had

occasion  to inform the health officers in Katong  about

the  state  of affairs there. I personally  visited  the

area with a health inspector from Katong, after which he

informed  me  that lorries cannot go into the  roads  in

Geylang Serai as the roads are narrow. As this matter is

known to the Health Ministry, I hope it will be remedied

as early as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are drains which are not serviced by the

Anti-Malarial  Department. I would like  to  know  where  the

fault  lies,  and whether this Department  has  adequate

employees   or   otherwise.  I  hope  the  Anti-Malarial

Department  will get rid of this nuisance. I  feel  that

the  pumping of anti-malarial oil should be done for all

drains in the kampongs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the market at Geylang Serai, the Markets and

Hawkers  Department  has  allocated  one  stall  to  two

persons - one a night stall and the other, a day  stall.

The  area  of the stall itself is very small indeed.  It

can  accommodate only one table and there is no room for

stools and tables. What is more regrettable is that when

the  day-time stall-holder finishes his work, he has  to

remove his utensils and equipment. The night-hawker does

likewise. Both the night and day stall-holders sell  for

limited hours and they have to use their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



transport  to  remove their utensils.  I  have  received

petitions  from  such stall-holders  saying  that  their

profits  are  insufficient to cover the rentals  of  the

stalls. For this reason, they find it hard to make  both

ends meet. Hence, they give up their stalls and hawk  by

the  roadside.  We will find that it is  so  in  Geylang

Serai  where  they can hawk for unlimited  hours  rather

than  sell  in  the stalls provided by the  Markets  and

Hawkers  Department. I hope the Ministry concerned  will

be flexible in the allocation of stalls. This will be  a

great  relief  to hawkers to find a means of  living.  I

believe  if  this  can be overcome,  the  Geylang  Serai

market will be a boon to the hawkers there.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  my  colleagues who spoke before me were  unanimous

about  one  thing. They gave an adequate explanation  of

the  health conditions in our State. I wish to add a bit

to  that. For example, in big streets one does not  find

much rubbish. This rubbish is gathered in one corner and

taken  away  in vans. If one goes there in the  evening,

one  sees a big rubbish dump. The next morning too,  one

finds  the  same  rubbish dump there. The  Minister  for

Health  is fully aware of what the consequences will  be

if  this  rubbish  is left there. If one  takes  Tanjong

Pagar  Road  for  example, there are  stalls  along  the

roadside.  Even then the place is clean in the  morning.

But  at  five or six, there is a lot of rubbish  in  the

centre of the road. We want those who visit Singapore to

speak  highly  of it. If they were to see this  rubbish,

they would be very much ashamed of it and we should feel

disgraced.  We would like others to come  and  say  that

Singapore  streets  are clean and  well-kept,  but  this

rubbish is a setback for us. We shall be insulted  as  a

result  of  this rubbish. There are smaller  streets  as

well,  I  remember one thing. During the colonial  days,

all  rubbish was swept up, kept in dumps and taken away.

But  nowadays I do not see this happening. I do not know

whether  the Cleansing Department employees are sweeping

up  the  rubbish at all. If you go to the small streets,

you can see



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



for  yourself,  Mr Speaker, Sir, what happens  to  this

rubbish.  Even the people who live in those streets  are

not the least bothered about it. If such is the state of

things, what will happen to the health of this State? We

must  know how to remove rubbish and how to get  rid  of

all  the dirt and filth. I feel that all the Members  of

this  Parliament should volunteer to go  and  sweep  the

streets on a Sunday and set an example to the people  of

Singapore. Further, Mr Speaker, Sir, in Narcis  Street,

there  are no rubbish bins available. In Wallich Street,

there  are  rubbish bins. Those hawkers  who  ply  along

these  roads go and dump their rubbish in one particular

place.  If  proper bins are available, then the  rubbish

can be dumped into these bins.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health has said that mosquitoes breed

in  water.  But I beg to disagree. Mosquitoes  breed  on

rubbish. There are plenty of mosquitoes all over.  I  do

not know where they come from. There are even mosquitoes

in  running water. One wonders where they come from.  In

Thomson Road, there was a case where a child died  as  a

result  of  mosquito  bites. Therefore,  I  request  the

Minister for Health to consider this matter carefully. I

do  not  wish to elaborate very much on this because  my

colleagues have spoken on it.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lingam? Mr Lingam is not speaking.

Any  other Member who wishes to speak on mosquitoes  and

flies?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can fully

understand  the number of Back-benchers  who  have  been

descending on me and my Ministry over these nuisances.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has taken me some time to get down to the real

problem  of attempting to resolve public health measures

that have unfortunately been allowed to deteriorate, not

over  a  period of one or two years, but perhaps over  a

period of seven years. It is true that the matter  could

be resolved by employing more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



workers.  But I think that would only be just attempting

to   evade   the  issue,  because  with  the   best   of

organisation and the best of equipment, unless there  is

a reasonably efficient working force, then all our plans

can go wrong. And to have a reasonably efficient

force - I  am  not  asking for a highly efficient  force  but  a

reasonably efficient force - there has got to be  normal

discipline,   and  that  is  utterly  lacking.   It   is

impossible to run any department or organisation if  the

absenteeism which has to be faced fluctuates from  three

per cent to something like 15 per cent. As a result, you

can never tell how many workers are going to turn up for

work.  That  has  been  so for  the  last  seven  years.

Absenteeism is at its lowest - three to five per cent of

the  whole  working  force - on Sundays  when  there  is

double  pay, and on public holidays when there is treble

pay.  And  when it is normal pay on Mondays, absenteeism

is  15  per cent. Just how can any organisation work  on

such  a  basis? So I have not asked for the  filling  of

vacancies in such a situation because it is a ridiculous

situation.  Had  we filled the vacancies,  the  position

would have got from bad to worse, because it would  have

continued to be run on that basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, however, happy to say that after long

discussions  and  negotiations, a new disciplinary  code

has  been  drawn up dated 21st October, 1965,  only  two

months  ago,  by the Government, through the  Ministry,

the  Treasury,  with  the Public Daily-Rated  Employees'

Union  Federation. It is only two months since  the  new

disciplinary code has been effective, and now steps  are

being  taken  to pull up recalcitrant workers  who  have

been  taking  advantage of the former disciplinary  code

which  was  wholly ineffectual. Things are beginning  to

improve,  and  it  is  now  possible  to  consider   the

recruitment of more workers who would then  be  able  to

provide  a  reasonably efficient work force.  So  I  can

assure  the Back-benchers that the new year will see  an

improvement in the public health services of  Singapore;

but  like everything else, it will take some time before

it can be truly effective. I hope this time next year it

will be possible to report a much happier



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



situation and a general improvement in the public health

standards  by way of fewer mosquitoes, fewer  flies  and

less rubbish all round, whether in busy roads, in hawker

congregations or side streets. But I do not think it  is

enough  just to say that I have waited for two years  to

get this new disciplinary code put into effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps have also been taken since October of this year

to  create what is known as an Emergency Cleansing Corps

which, at the moment, has 200 workers. They are used  in

two  shifts at various localities which require what  is

known  as  a task force to clear up piles of  refuse  in

hawker congregations and markets. As an example, I  will

give some indication of the work that is being done. Let

me  take 15th December, which is just an ordinary  daily

report  which  I  receive for this  Emergency  Cleansing

Corps of 200 workers, which we intend to increase to 400

within  the  next few months, and on to 600  thereafter.

They  work in two shifts; from 6 a.m, to 1.50 p.m., that

is,  ten minutes to two o'clock, and from 11.30  in  the

morning  to  7.20 p.m. in the evening. The  places  that

they  go  to work, which might be of interest to Members

of  the  House,  are  as follows: Kelantan  Lane,  Jalan

Besar, Queensway, Jalan Bukit Merah, Paya Lebar Road for

desilting  of drains. Most of our drains are being  used

unfortunately by the public as if they are  just  refuse

dumps.   They   just  throw  things  into  the   drains,

unfortunately. And then for the maintenance of drains in

New  Bridge  Road, Bukit Timah Road, Hoi How Road,  Syed

Alwi  Road,  Waterloo Street, Dorset Road, Sims  Avenue.

That is the A.M. shift.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the P.M. shift, they go to the hawker

congregations, like the one at Narcis Street. On 15th of

December, the places that were tackled by our task force

were the Kandang Kerbau market area, Syed Alwi Road (big

drain),  Hock  Lim  Street, High Street,  Queen  Street,

Beach Lane, New Market Road, China Street, Pagoda Street

and  Smith  Street  junction, Narcis Street,  Tai  Thong

Crescent,  Idris Road, Lorong 25A, Lorong  Tahar.  Every

day this task



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



force  of 200 workers is sent out specially to clean  up

refuse  dumps which are known to accumulate over a  day,

and  it  goes round the island to ensure that  there  is

better  cleansing  than hitherto. This particular  force

will be doubled to 400 within a month or so, and trebled

to  600 in another few months' time. So it is hoped that

by this method and by further recruitment of workers for

public cleansing and in the anti-mosquito department and

so  on,  we  will be able to ensure, over the new  year,

some improvement. I hope to see in a matter of two years

considerable improvement in the public health situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need go further into the other

comments  of  the  hon.  Members because  they  are  all

related.  Hawkers, public cleansing,  mosquitoes  -  all

have   to   do   with  public  health,   and   standards

unfortunately have come down. Partly to blame for  this,

I think, would be the poor efficiency of the work force.

But  now that a new disciplinary code has been put  into

effect,  I  expect a great improvement  in  the  working

efficiency of our workers and that we can now  think  in

terms  of  increasing the number of  workers  on  a  new

basis,  and,  therefore,  in  a  position  to  make   an

effective re-organisation of our services.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Just now the

Minister  for  Health has explained that  the  emergency

task force works only in the urban areas. Can he explain

in  this  House if this emergency cleansing  corps  will

work  in  the  rural areas, like Kampong  Kembangan  and

other places?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am sorry if, in answer to the

problem,  I  appear  to have concentrated  on  the  city

areas.  But naturally what takes place in the city  will

affect  the  rural  areas, because  we  are  looking  at

Singapore  as a whole. May I just say that, to  give  an

example  of the size of the problem involved,  say,  for

refuse,  in  any  one  day  we are  now  collecting  and

disposing  of nearly 600 tons of refuse, of  which  over

400  tons would be within the city area. The rural areas

would be 130 tons. The task force deals with about 40 to

50 tons of refuse. That is the situation. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



are  really trying to tackle the big problem in the city

area,  where  a huge pile of refuse can be  seen  to  be

there;  whereas in the rural areas there is less  refuse

and  it  is also possible, as my hon. Friend, the Member

for Changi has said, for the residents there to bury the

rubbish within their compound. There is ample land to do

so.  But  it is not possible to bury refuse in the  city

area;  one could not dig up a hole, for example, in  the

concrete  road to bury the rubbish. But it  is  possible

for farmers to dispose of their own rubbish by

burning - I  am  glad some refuse is being burnt rather than  just

being  left  alone to rot and to attract flies.  So  the

problem of disposal of refuse in the rural area, in  our

view, is less urgent than that in the built-up area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think at this stage I might as well answer the hon.

Member  for  Anson when he says that he does  not  think

mosquitoes  come out from water but that they  come  out

from  refuse. It is true that if tins collect some water

in  them after rain or a shower - there is a little  bit

of  water  in the tins - that will be suitable  for  the

breeding of mosquitoes. So mosquitoes can come out  from

tins.  But  there is really water in the tin before  the

mosquitoes can breed.

replying  to  the  complaints of  the  hon.  Member  for

Geylang Serai. I believe his complaint was that, in  the

allocation of stalls for the Geylang Serai



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



market,  they  were  given to day-hawkers  and  separate

stalls were given to night-hawkers and, therefore,  they

were unable to make a decent living. Unfortunately, when

this  huge market was built in Geylang Serai, there were

more  hawkers  registered for  stalls  than  there  were

stalls in the market. So in order not to disappoint  the

hawkers,  it  was  decided to make  everybody  happy  by

giving  each hawker a stall, whether it is  for  day  or

night,  instead  of  allowing one hawker  to  enjoy  the

facilities of a stall for day and night. That was how it

arose,  and  there  was some dissatisfaction  over  this

division.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then unfortunately the two racial riots broke out,

and,  I  think,  all  the market stallholders  who  were

allocated stalls decided to move out. That unfortunately

is  the situation. We have a brand new market erected at

great  cost  -  I  think  over  $400,000  -  but  it  is

practically empty, which is a sad state of affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is better to tackle the hawker problem not just

for  Geylang  Serai but for the whole of Singapore.  The

problem  is, first, to license all hawkers, and, second,

after  licensing them, to try to control  them  and  get

them  into  markets, whether built by  Government  at  a

considerable  cost  of  a few hundred  thousand  dollars

apiece,  or  to encourage them to go even  into  private

markets  built  for that purpose. The  private  markets,

like Government markets, are half-empty. And it may even

be necessary to encourage hawkers to do their businesses

inside  shophouses  and  not to  hawk  in  the  streets,

because  Singapore is fast growing into a large city  of

two  million,  if  not more, people. There  are  over  a

hundred thousand cars in the streets. In course of time,

I  think hawkers should not be doing their businesses in

the  streets. They should be getting into shophouses  to

do their businesses properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to be the general trend, Sir. That would be

part  and  parcel of the new hawkers' code  when  it  is

announced. I hope that when it is implemented, we may be

well on the road to having gradual control of the hawker

situation.

recipient and a donor country. During the last few years

we  have  been  spending annually a sum of  $160,000  to

enable  deserving candidates from surrounding countries,

especially countries like Cambodia, Thailand and Ceylon,

to  receive  special training in Singapore, particularly

with  regard to port administration and housing. We also

allow  these candidates to join our institutes of higher

Singapore  is  placing a special vote in order  to  give

<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the lower income group of civil

servants,  that is, the Division IV civil  servants,  do

not  have  quarters.  Only very few  people  enjoy  this

privilege. Most of the Division IV employees are in  the

lower  income group. There are statutory board employees

who  are  given  quarters. So I hope  that  Division  IV

employees  of Government will also get these facilities.

If there are not enough Government quarters for Division

IV employees, they should be given S.I.T. flats - Housing

Board flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know

whether  the  translation was a literal  translation  of

what  the  Member for Anson said, when I heard over  the

loudspeaker  the term "S.I.T. flats". There  is  now  no

such  body as the "S.I.T." It is defunct, dead.  In  its

place there is the Housing and Development Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I should tell the House that it is the policy

of the Government not only to house civil servants whose

salaries are in the lower income brackets,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



but  it is also the intention of the Government to house

as  many  of the underprivileged citizens in  the  lower

income  group  of the whole of Singapore.  That  is  the

reason  why  we  have embarked on such a  large  housing

programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I understand the Member for Anson correctly, what

he  is  asking  for  is that all Division  IV  employees

should  be  housed.  Mr Speaker, Sir,  in  one  of  the

Sessions  of  the  Assembly  sometime  ago,  I  think  a

question  was asked by the Member for Moulmein  and  the

answer  given to her was that about 79 per cent  of  the

P.W.D. staff and 33 per cent of the staff in the Health

Department  are  provided  with  quarters.   Now,   this

percentage  is much more than the number of  people,  in

the  lower  income group in Singapore, who are  provided

with  houses. In spite of the completion of 51,000 units

of housing during the last five years by the Government,

and an additional 12,000 units this year, about only  26

per   cent  of  the  people  of  Singapore  are  housed.

Therefore,  compared  with the general  population,  the

group  of employees who are in the lower income  bracket

are  better  treated in the matter of housing  than  the

rest of the population of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually there are about 18,000 Division IV employees

in  the  civil  service  and  about  9,500  Division  IV

quarters,  institutional or otherwise.  Therefore,  more

than  half of them are being housed. Our duty is to  see

that  every section of the population does get the  same

treatment.  About  50 per cent, taking  an  average,  of

Division  IV employees are being housed; they are  being

given  quarters which are heavily subsidised, much  more

than  those  belonging  to the Housing  and  Development

Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on this matter, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  emphasise  the point brought up by  the  Member  for

Delta a few days ago, and that is that Government is not

making  any  money at all in providing the  public  with

Housing  Board houses. The rental charged, as you  know,

Mr Speaker, Sir, is $20 for a one-room unit, $40 for  a

two-room unit,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



and   $60  for  a  three-room  unit,  excluding  service

charges.  Now,  this  is insufficient  to  amortise  the

capital  that  is put in as well as the  maintenance  of

these  houses,  and  every year  Government  is  out  of

pocket.  So  for those people who are in  Housing  Board

houses, there is already an element of subsidy.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Government to adopt the suggestion made by the

Member   for   Anson  just  now,  that  if   there   are

insufficient   Government  quarters  for   Division   IV

employees,  then  they  should be  given  Housing  Board

quarters,  there is nothing now at this very  moment  to

prevent  Division IV employees from applying for Housing

Board  quarters so long as they pay the same rents  that

are  paid by the public. For his information, if he will

look  up the Development Estimates, there is a provision

of  $1.5 million next year for the building of some more

quarters  for  Division IV employees.  So  all  in  all,

compared  with  the  other sections of  the  population,

Division IV employees are well catered for in the matter

of housing.

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0807 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1191.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in this appointment, we still cannot

harmonise  the  law  with the fines in  the  regulations

concerning  change of address by people who  have  radio

licences  if  the  licensees move out.  The  explanation

regarding change of address was not satisfactory to  the

people and there was a lot of unhappiness. I support the

wish of the Minister for Finance, and it is the hope  of

the  Government, as well as the hope of the people, that

as  far  as  this  section  is concerned,  it  would  be

defeated if we could not harmonise law and fines and  if

this section was not improved. For example, Mr Speaker,

A  buys a radio and takes out a radio licence. He is  of

the  opinion that he has got a licence and he would  not

go  against the law if he were to stay in another  place

before  the  expiry  of the licence,  because  there  is

nothing  on  the  licence which says that  he  would  be

punished  if  he did not change his address.  I  believe

there  are  regulations and by-laws in regard  to  radio

licensing. But these are not known to the public  except

to  the  radio  inspectors. The  wording  on  the  radio

licence  is  only in English, and information  regarding

change  of address is also in English. The attention  of

the  owner of the licence is not drawn to the fact  that

if  he  does  not note the change of address  where  his

radio  has  been  installed, then he  has  committed  an

offence  and he would be fined. Mr Speaker,  there  are

people  who  know English who do not even realise  this.

What more for those people who do not know English? What

action  has  been  taken by the radio licence  officers?

When a radio licence officer discovers that the licensee

has  not changed his address he sends a compound  notice

for  $40.  This also is in English. The offence relating

to  change  of  address  should  be  explained  in  four

languages in the radio licence. And for the first  time,

he  should  be  given  one week's grace  to  change  his

address. If he still does not comply



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



with this, only then should he be fined. The penalty for

not  having  a radio licence should not be lighter  than

the penalty should a licensee not change his address.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is

always  the policy of Government to temper justice  with

mercy.  I am glad that the Member for Kampong Kapor  has

brought up this complaint, because though I have a radio

licence  and a T.V. licence, I have never taken  trouble

to  find  out whether they are written in four languages

or  one,  and I will make it a point to investigate  the

complaint that he has made with regard to fines for  not

changing  the  address.  I quite  agree  with  him  that

probably  there is not enough publicity  given  to  this

matter,  and  I  will  see to it that  the  Ministry  of

Culture give enough publicity to this so that there will

be  no  misunderstanding of the  rules  and  regulations

which  govern the issue of licences. That is all  I  can

say for the moment, Mr Speaker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding the re-numbering of

constituencies like Punggol, there are many attap houses

which  were  built more than 10 years ago -  of  course,

these   are   unauthorised.  With  this   national

re-registration  about  to  take  place  next   year,   the

residents  in  these  old attap houses  without  numbers

would  find difficulty in stating their address  on  the

identity  cards to be re-issued anew. What I would  like

to  ask  the Minister for Finance is whether such houses

could be given numbers so that the residents thereof can

also  apply  for  social amenities  such  as  water  and

electricity supplies.

re-numbering houses, and that also there are houses without

numbers.  This is where I should like my request  to  be

made  to  the  Minister for Finance;  Sir,  if  I  could

proceed along that line ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, carry on, you have made the point,

just  saying  that  national  re-registration  would  be

clearly  their  addresses; but in my constituency  there

are quite a number of attap houses which were built more

than  10  years ago and which are without house numbers.

So in the process of re-numbering the numbered houses, I

wonder  whether the Minister for Finance would give  due

consideration to my request that such houses be numbered

when our re-numbering of houses teams make their tours.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You mean the un-numbered houses?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Unnumbered houses. I have pointed out

the  reasons; that the residents can clearly state their

residential address and they can also apply  for  social

amenities like water and electricity supplies which  are

available;  and if they do not have house numbers,  even

though  their houses were built more than 10 years  ago,

then  they  will not be able to obtain such  facilities.

This  is  the  request I am making to the  Minister  for

Finance.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



with the views expressed by my colleague, the Member for

Punggol. But I have a different matter to bring up.  The

Inland Revenue Department was collecting assessment from

two  different persons, two different sums of money, but

under  one  house number. A certain person  had  an  old

attap  house  which was numbered by the  Inland  Revenue

Department and he was paying assessment for a number  of

years ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rajoo, I doubt very much if you are

in  order in raising the matter. But if the Minister for

Finance does not object, you may proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I am interested in hearing what he

has to say.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> In the year 1962, he applied to the

Planning Department and the Chief Building Surveyor  for

the  repair and renovation of his house with  zinc  roof

and  plank  partition. The Planning Department  approved

the  repair under condition that the house may exist for

one  year  only  from the date of the  permission  being

granted. This person is illiterate and he could not understand  the  implications of the condition. He  renovated

the  house  after submitting 13 sketch  plans  and  site

plans. True to the condition laid down, a year later the

Planning  Department  sent a  notice  to  the  gentleman

saying  that the permission granted to his house expired

on  such  and  such a date, and if he  still  wished  to

retain  the  house, he must submit a further  13  sketch

plans and site plans in order that the existence of  the

building be legalised. In the meantime, another  citizen

had applied for the erection of a zinc house on the same

plot  where  the previous building was situated.  Either

the  Planning Department or the Chief Building  Surveyor

must have approved this structure, because the irony  of

the fact is that this house was given the same number as

that  of  the  existing building and the assessment  was

collected  by  the Inland Revenue Department  under  two

different  names, but under one house number. A  further

shocking factor was that there was no condition attached

to the second house, as was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



the  case  in the first one. In other words, the  second

house  can remain for any number of years and the  owner

may  not submit any further sketch plans or site  plans.

Sir,  this case happened in the Woodlands area.  If  the

Minister  for Finance would care to look into it,  I  am

prepared  to  give  him full details.  What  one  cannot

understand is this. Why should there be different  types

of  conditions laid down for different buildings erected

on  the  same  plot?  If one house  can  remain  without

renewing  the  permit  annually, why  cannot  the  other

house? Is there or is there not any device in the Inland

Revenue  Department to find out their own  mistake  when

they  are  charging  two different types  of  assessment

under  one  house number? I understand these houses  are

now  given  two  different numbers for the  purposes  of

collecting  assessment. But the folly of the permit  and

the difference in conditions still exist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to take the request

from the Member for Punggol first. He is suggesting that

I  ignore  completely the building by-laws  and  approve

illegal structures by giving them numbers. I think, if I

were to do that, then architects would be out of job and

the  whole  of  Singapore would be a slum area.  If  the

residents  are really keen to see that their houses  get

numbers,  there is a way by which they can do that,  and

that  is to send the plans of their houses to the  Chief

Building  Surveyor and to see that the houses that  they

are  building  or  they are staying in  conform  to  the

building by-laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member for Farrer Park, the matter

he has raised does not rightly involve me. All I can say

is  that,  as  far as the Inland Revenue  Department  is

concerned,  I  should congratulate  them  on  collecting

assessments  from two persons on the same  number.  They

are  not  wrong there. Probably the numbering is  wrong.

But there are two buildings there. Therefore, two people

should  pay assessment, and correctly so. If I may,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, I would like to answer the point which  he

has brought up, and that is, why is it that there should

be different conditions for two buildings



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



which  are  on the same plot? What comes to my  mind  is

this.  Though the owner may have sent in 13,  14  or  15

sketch plans, none of them conformed to the building

by-laws,  and it is out of consideration for the  owner,  I

think,  that the Chief Building Surveyor allows  him  to

retain  the building for a year, during which  he  hopes

that  the  owner would comply with the building  by-laws

requirements.  As for the other case, I think  the  very

first  time the sketch plans of the building  were  sent

in,  probably  they  conformed to the building  by-laws.

That is why there are different conditions laid down.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Minister  for  Finance has missed my point.  I  did  not

imply  in  any way that the Minister for Finance  should

ignore  the building by-laws. What I said was about  the

attap  houses  in my constituency and which  were  built

more  than ten years ago. I wondered why action was  not

taken  earlier when they were built. I did not say  that

the houses were built one or two years ago.

I believe - I  am  not  sure if I am correct here - that  under  the

Local    Government    Integration   Ordinance,    1963,

unauthorised houses, or illegal houses, as the  Minister

calls them, built before September 1963 - I am not  very

sure - could not be pulled down. That is the main reason

why. More than ten years ago ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is not correct. Three years from

date of discovery.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker. Many

applications  have passed through me  at  my

"Meet-the-people" sessions, in which these people came forward and

asked  if  I  could help them to get permits  to  retain

their  existing houses. Sir, a permit is  obtainable  on

payment of $2, subject to approval by the Chief Building

Surveyor and subsequently the Inland Revenue Department.

So  it  takes  quite some time to get such  applications

approved.  I will be dealing with this matter under  the

Ministry  of  Law and National Development  at  a  later

juncture. A considerable length of time has to be taken,

say,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



three,  four or six months, when applications  are  sent

in,  and  officials  from the Chief Building  Surveyor's

Department  may not even go to the site to  investigate.

Although  sometimes permits were obtained,  still  house

numbers could not be obtained.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rajoo, do you wish to say anything?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am still not quite

satisfied  with  the  reply given by  the  Minister  for

Finance. The point raised by me is this. The house built

was  in  existence for a number of years and  permission

was  required to renovate it. For the renovation of that

building,  a  condition was laid down that the  building

would  exist  for only one year. When there  was  a  new

proposal  submitted by another man to build a  house  on

the  same plot, no condition was attached and permission

was granted. I again mention that there is the folly  of

the  permit.  If  the Minister cares to look  into  this

matter. I will give him full details for clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I only replied to

the  Member  for  Farrer Park because I  know  something

about  it. But if he really wants an investigation  into

that  particular case, then he has got to raise it  with

my colleague, the Minister for National Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether the Member for Punggol really

wants the Government to pull down illegal structures  or

to  legalise them, because, as you have clearly  pointed

out.  Mr Speaker, Sir, they have got to be pulled  down

within three years of discovery. Therefore, if we are to

recognise  that  they exist, then we have  got  to  take

action  within these three years. As it is now,  we  are

taking  quite a realistic view of the situation, because

during  the last ten years things have got a little  bit

out  of control, and, therefore, we thought that  if  we

were  really  to smack down all the illegal houses  that

are   in   existence   without   providing   alternative

accommodation, then the people of Singapore would really

suffer  great hardships. As it is, we have been able  to

clear quite a lot of illegal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



structures in slum areas and rehouse these people in new

houses built by the Housing and Development Board. I  do

not  know  whether  the  Member can  bring  up  specific

instances. Here again, I think he will have to raise  it

with  my  colleague, the Minister for Law  and  National

Development  - whether he is able to bring up  specific

instances  where there has been undue delay in approving

or  considering the plans submitted by owners  of  these

houses  in  order  to regularise the position  of  their

buildings. If there are such instances, them I would say

that it would be best if he would bring it to the notice

of  my  colleague,  the Minister for  Law  and  National

Development,  and I think the Minister would  look  into

them  and study every application whether the owners  of

these  illegal structures are trying to conform  to  the

building  by-laws, and the regulations of  this  country

would then he attended to as quickly as possible.

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for head 0901 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, earlier in this Session the Minister

for  Labour  introduced the National  Registration  Bill

which  was passed by this House. That Bill empowers  the

Minister  to  take steps to re-register  the  people  of

Singapore into two categories - one for citizens  and  the

other  for  non-citizens. I will  give  him  credit  for

imposing a fee of 50 cents on citizens, and I would  say

that  imposing  a  fee  of  $1 on  non-citizens  is  very

generous when we consider the amount of money we need to

provide social services for our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, identity cards, birth certificates,

and  citizenship certificates are all now very important

documents.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



The birth certificates at present issued are very flimsy

and  can be destroyed easily, and so are our citizenship

certificates.  I  would  ask the  Minister  to  consider

whether  he  would  also take steps  to  provide  better

quality   material   for  our  birth  certificates   and

citizenship  certificates, possibly like  those  plastic

laminated cards which he proposes to introduce  for  the

identity cards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, I believe that a person does

not  pay  a  fee for the registration of citizenship.  A

payment  of  $2  is  being imposed as  a  stamp  fee  to

legalise  the  document. This may possibly  be  so  when

citizenship  was  introduced years  back  and  when  all

Parties  were  trying  to  vote-catch  the  public  and,

therefore, a fee was not imposed. But as citizenship  is

now  an important document for the many good things that

the  Government will provide. I feel it is time that  we

should  also  impose a nominal fee for  registration  of

citizenship,  and I would ask the Minister  to  consider

this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

citizenship  is  very  important and  essential  to  the

people  of this country, especially after Singapore  has

achieved  its independence. The people who are  citizens

are   entitled  to  many  benefits,  for  example,  free

education,   housing,  employment  opportunities,   free

medical services. They are also entitled to the right to

vote  and  the right to be elected. During the past  ten

years,  many  people  in  Singapore  have  realised  the

importance  of citizenship. Therefore, this  Citizenship

Registry  is very busy because the applicants  run  into

thousands.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Could the Member please go a

little  more  slowly? The Interpreters  are  finding  it

somewhat difficult.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Therefore, the

Citizenship Office is faced with a very burdensome  task

and  has  received many complaints from members  of  the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to classify these

complaints  into several groups. First, there  are  many

complaints



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



to the effect that applications have been delayed for as

long as one year and that the Citizenship Office has not

given   any   reply   to   these   applications.   These

applications do not know whether their applications have

been accepted or rejected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there are many applications which are very

complicated.  For example, an Indian who has  been  here

since 1935 has resided here for 30 years. But during the

past  30  years he has returned to India  two  or  three

times.  According to the citizenship law, the period  of

his  return  to India cannot be taken into  account  for

residential qualifications. But the authority  concerned

and  the  officials have not clearly explained  to  such

people   why  their  applications  cannot  be  accepted.

Therefore, the applicants in such cases came to  see  me

because  they reside in my constituency. They complained

to  me that their applications for citizenship had  been

turned  down without reason and that they had  not  been

told  of  the  reasons. They also  complained  that  the

authority concerned and the officials in the Citizenship

Office  were  not courteous to him. I would,  therefore,

like the Minister concerned to consider this matter.  If

there are certain civil servants who are discourteous to

the   public,  it  will  affect  our  reputation  as   a

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the complaint is that perhaps after

independence  many people have to apply for citizenship,

and  therefore  the Citizenship Office is  crowded  with

applicants. But most of the applicants have to wait  for

at  least one day before their cases can be attended to.

They are not happy with this long delay and waiting.  So

I hope the authority concerned will rectify this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the complaint about language difficulties. For

example, some Hakka people do not understand Hokkien, or

some Indians do not understand Malay. Although there are

some  interpreters in the Citizenship Registry who  know

many dialects, they do not know all the dialects. So  in

future  when  we employ interpreters, we must  see  that

they   know  all  the  dialects  so  that  the  language

difficulties can be solved.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I must thank the Member  for  River

Valley  for  having  said  kind  words  about   my

Ministry.  As  regards  his  suggestion  that  the

Government should impose a fee for the issue of  a

certificate  for citizenship, a birth certificate,

and other documents, what I have to say is that we

will look into the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the re-registration campaign, as I

have pointed out earlier in the Second Reading  of

the  National Registration Bill, we are  going  to

issue   two  categories  of  identity   cards   of

different  colours - one for citizens and the  other

for non-citizens. The fee charged will he 50 cents

for a citizen and $1 for a non-citizen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I must take the opportunity to correct

myself.  Earlier  I  had said  that  the  cost  of

issuing a card was $7. This is not correct. I have

now verified it and the cost of issuing a card  is

about  $1  after  taking  into  consideration  the

machinery  and equipment that we have to  purchase

and the number of staff that we have to engage  to

run  the  registration centres. I  have  corrected

this  in  the Hansard. So 50 cents from a  citizen

and $1 from a non-citizen would be just enough  to

cover a part of the cost of the identity card.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the re-registration campaign starts, we

will  set  up  centres  in various  parts  of  the

island,  and  the cards issued will  be  specially

processed plastic cards. I have a sample  here  to

show  Members. This is the exact size of the  card

that  we  are going to issue as an identity  card,

but  the design of the card has not been finalised

because we are waiting for an artist to draw up  a

suitable format.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also various other technical matters

to  be considered. This sample card here is  of  a

very   convenient  size,  and  it  is  waterproof,

forgery-proof, and even crease-proof. When we have

dealt with the issue of these identity cards,  the

machinery that we have purchased will be available

to  laminate  the  other  documents  such  as  the

citizenship certificate and the birth certificate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present we do not have this equipment. We

have  placed  an order elsewhere to purchase  this

laminating  machine. As soon as we  have  it,  and

after  the  re-registration campaign is completed,

it  will  then be possible for us to go  into  the

question  of laminating the birth certificate  and

the  citizenship certificate, as suggested by  the

Member just now. [Turning to the Member for  River

Valley} If you want this ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister will lay it on the

Table.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Yes, so that Members

interested can have a look at this sample.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the comments of the hon. Member for

Sembawang on the Citizenship Registry, I think  it

is inevitable that consideration of an application

for citizenship is delayed because of the shortage

of  staff  in the Registry. We all know  that  the

citizenship  certificate is a sacred document.  It

entitles  the holder to many privileges which  are

only  extended to citizens, for instance,  in  the

application  for houses, jobs, places  in  schools

for  their  children, and so on. It is, therefore,

necessary   that  the  issue  of   a   citizenship

certificate should be properly investigated. There

should he some checks and counter-checks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the issue of this citizenship

certificate  is  a  very  important  process.  The

normal  practice in dealing with an  applicant  is

this:  on  being issued with an application  form,

the  applicant  is at once sent to  the  Interview

Section  where his form is to he filled up  by  an

officer   and  an  interview  takes  place.   This

procedure  can  only be adopted if there  are  not

more than 80 applicants a day; in other words, the

Registry  can  deal with about 1,600 applicants  a

month.  From  January to July this  year,  as  the

average monthly number was 1,500-odd, the Registry

staff  was  able  to deal with all the  applicants

quickly.  However, as from August 1965,  with  the

separation of Singapore from Malaysia, the  number

of  applicants  rose  very  sharply.  The  average

number  of  applicants  monthly  from  August   to

September was about 3,530. Therefore, in  view  of

this large increase, the Registry was unable to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



maintain  its usual procedure of granting interviews  to

applicants  on  the  same day. In  these  circumstances,

different  dates for interviews have to be given.  These

dates have been progressively advanced to December 1966.

This  is  an  inevitable process because  of  the  large

number  of  people wanting to get citizenship,  and  the

number of staff we have in this Registry is very small.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the case of the Indian applicant who has

been  a  resident in Singapore since 1935 and still  has

not  got  his citizenship papers, I think it is probably

because  of his various visits to India. At present  the

policy  of  granting citizenship is  that,  among  other

things,  the applicant must have roots in this  country.

In  other words, he must have his family here and has  a

stable job here. What we have found is that many Indians

who  have been resident in Singapore for quite a  number

of  years  do not have any family roots here. They  have

their  wives in India; their children are also in India,

and every month they send remittances back to India.  In

time  to come, they may even go back to India to retire.

Sir,  for such cases the policy is this: apparently this

applicant  is not treating this country as his permanent

home,  and he is only taking up citizenship for his  own

convenience,  and  therefore  normally  citizenship   is

refused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the complaint that the staff in the Registry is

not courteous to the public, I think the matter has been

taken  up  to ensure that the staff in this Registry  is

polite and treat the public well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the language difficulty faced by the applicants,

I  have  to point out that at present there is a  ruling

that  applicants for citizenship must understand or must

pass  a language test in the national language. Only  in

circumstances where the applicant is very  old  and  who

cannot  be expected to pass the national language  test,

will  he  be  exempted from the language test.  But  the

others  have to pass the national language test.  If  we

expect every person to speak the national language, then

this problem of language will not arise here. But in any

case,  we have many translators and interpreters in  the

Registry who can look after these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



people  who are old and cannot speak any language  other

than  their mother tongue. I think the interests of this

type of applicants are being looked after.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Minister  has  misunderstood me. I  only  asked  him  to

impose a registration fee for a citizenship certificate,

would  have  to  pay  $2 to obtain registration  of  his

child.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I ask that the Ministry of Labour should

look after the welfare not only of the workers, but also

that  of the workers who are with the Admiralty. I would

like  to give an example. On the 9th of December,  1965,

Corporal 1038 of the Naval Police died of sickness.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told that there is no free transport provided as

a  token  to  workers who have died. This  corporal  had

served  for  a long period with the Admiralty,  no  less

than 20 years. Even before that, Mr Speaker, there  was

another  incident  where P.C. 805  of  the  Royal  Naval

Police died in an accident, while carrying out his duty,

involving   a   van   which   went   against   Admiralty

regulations.  He also faced the same fate  as  the  said

corporal.  These  workers are outside  the  Ministry  of

Labour,  but  they are Singapore citizens. They  do  not

have  a  labour union to represent them. We do not  wish

the  Admiralty  to suppress their workers who  protected

the  interests and property of the Admiralty at  a  time

when  the  anti-nationals, led by the Barisan  Sosialis,

launched their campaign to topple the Government. I hope

the Ministry of Labour will resolve this problem so that

all  workers  can  enjoy and obtain the co-operation  of

their employers, not only in the matter of transport, as

I  have  related earlier, but also other facilities  and

benefits,   which  will  benefit  both   employees   and

employers as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker, concerns unnamed birth

certificates. I ask the Ministry of Labour  to  consider

more  sympathetically and carefully matters relating  to

birth  certificates  which have no names.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir, I quote



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>



here  an  example. A person was born here 40 years  ago,

but  because  his  parents were either  conservative  or

negligent, they did not name their child. Therefore, the

name did not appear on the birth certificate. Holders of

birth  certificates without names who have worked  here,

whose  names appear on the electoral register and  whose

loyalty   is   to  this  country  are  not   given   due

consideration  at  all. I think  this  will  defeat  the

object of re-registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the matter of birth certificates

without  names,  it  cannot be  denied  that  there  are

forgeries  and  falsifications by unscrupulous  persons.

Nevertheless  the Ministry of Labour must also  consider

that  there  are  bona fide cases where the  holders  of

birth  certificates  do  not have  their  names  on  the

certificates. I hope the Ministry will find a way out so

that  the would-be forgers would be caught, but the bona

fide cases whose loyalty to this country has been proved

can be given due consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to move, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  merely wish to add a little to what has already

been  said  by the Member for Kampong Kapor relating  to

birth   certificates  without  names.  I  believe,   Mr

Speaker, Sir, that while the Bill which has been  passed

is   good   because   it  will  prevent   incidents   of

maladministration,  it will also  deprive  the  rightful

citizens of Singapore of many facilities. I believe that

since  the  announcement has been made  regarding  birth

certificates   without  names  and  birth   certificates

supported by statutory declarations need not necessarily

be  proof  of  birth  in Singapore, the  office  of  the

Citizenship  Registry has been inundated with  inquiries

by  applicants for registration, because they fear  that

they will be deprived of the facilities enjoyed by them.

As  has  been  explained by the Minister for  Education,

those   who   are  not  in  possession  of   citizenship

certificates  or  are not children of Singapore  parents

will  have  to pay school fees both in the  primary  and

secondary schools. This will create a lot of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



problems   to  the  bona  fide  citizens  of  Singapore.

Therefore,  I  appeal to the Minister  for  Labour,  who

looks  after  citizenship  and  re-registration,  to  be

flexible  in  the  application of this particular  rule,

especially to those whose names appear in the  electoral

register and who have voted in past elections,  so  that

their citizenship applications may be approved and  that

birth  certificates without names but supported by other

documents, such as school leaving certificates,  may  be

considered   as  proof  of  birth  for  the   issue   of

citizenship certificates. This is to facilitate  matters

for  our bona fide citizens. If there is any doubt, then

the rules may be enforced.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are two

points  raised by the Member for Kampong Kapor. However,

I  want to deal with the first one which relates to  the

welfare of workers in the Naval Base. What he has raised

is  a matter which is not under my Ministry, because, as

we  all  know,  under the Defence Treaty with  Malaysia,

which  is still effective in Singapore, our labour  laws

are  not applicable to foreign bases. So as regards this

complaint   about  the  Admiralty  refusing  to   supply

transport  to  members under their employment  who  have

died, there is nothing we can do about it. But I am glad

to hear of this complaint which I am prepared to forward

to  the Admiralty for their sympathetic consideration in

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of birth certificates with no

names raised by the Member for Kampong Kembangan, I have

already  made  several statements in this  House  before

when  the  Member  for  Kampong  Kembangan  raised   the

question  under  the  Supplementary Estimates  and  also

during  the  Second Reading of the National Registration

Bill.  I  have  said  that the  provision  in  the  Bill

regarding certificates with no names is only a provision

to  deal  with forgeries and people who use  such  birth

certificates as a means to get their citizenship. I  can

quote  an example. If we do not have a provision in  the

law  regarding unnamed certificates, then all  kinds  of

abuses will occur. For instance, if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



two  brothers are born of the same parents one  born  in

Singapore  and the other in the Federation  and  if  the

brother who was born in Singapore is in possession of  a

birth  certificate without name dies, then  the  brother

who was born in the Federation will he able to come down

to Singapore, using the unnamed birth certificate of his

dead  brother and claiming it as his own.  In  fact,  he

could  get  his parents to file a statutory  declaration

stating  that the birth certificate actually belongs  to

him.  Now if this is the case, then there would be quite

a  lot  of abuses in this respect. And so this provision

in  the  Bill  is  necessary only  to  deal  with  these

forgeries.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the person who is genuinely born in Singapore

and  who is in possession of a birth certificate without

name, he has nothing to worry about. In fact, this is an

opportunity for him to rectify his position once and for

all,  because  it  is  very inconvenient  for  a  person

holding  an  unnamed  birth  certificate  to  apply  for

something   from  the  Government  whenever   proof   of

citizenship is required. When the registration  campaign

starts,  a  person  holding an unnamed  certificate  can

always.  If  he  can  prove to the satisfaction  of  the

Registration Officer that he was born in Singapore, have

that fact registered in his future identity card, and he

will  not  have to face all kinds of trouble  in  future

when his citizenship status is examined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for the present, I think it is not necessary for

holders  of  unnamed birth certificates to rush  to  the

Registry to have their status verified. A person born in

Singapore and holding an unnamed birth certificate and a

statutory declaration made by either of his parents  has

also to produce other supporting documents, such as  the

birth  certificates of his brothers and sisters, or  his

School Leaving Certificate, or the birth certificates of

his  children, or his vaccination certificate. If he can

produce  all  these relevant documents to establish  his

citizenship status, then he will be able to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



provide  ample  proof to the Registration  Officer,  and

thus he will have his status rectified.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I clarify a

little  bit  on  what  my colleague,  the  Minister  for

Labour,  has  said  and also with regard  to  the  query

raised  by the Member for Kampong Kapor? The hon. Member

spoke about members of the Admiralty Police who have  no

trade  union. I think that is a disciplined  force,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  and,  for obvious  reasons,  it  is  not

desirable   that  a  trade  union  should  represent   a

disciplined force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if there is any exploitation of workers in

the Admiralty or in the Naval Base which has come to his

knowledge. I am sure if it is brought to the  notice  of

the  Singapore Government, we will be able to make  very

strong  representations  indeed  to  see  that  our  own

citizens  are  not being exploited though  they  may  be

engaged  by a foreign power in our own territory.  I  am

sure  anything which is not satisfactory  there  can  be

rectified by us, if the hon. Member will only bring this

up.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on

the matter of the incidents relating to the Naval Police

personnel,  I  merely  wish to state  that  perhaps  the

Minister for Labour could find a way whereby the  labour

laws  could  be  fully  implemented  in  regard  to  our

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also sent a letter to the Admiralty authorities

dated  20th December, 1965. I have put my views to  them

regarding  the supply of vehicles on the  death  of  the

rank  and file of the Naval Base Police. So what I state

here  is  merely to request the Minister for  Labour  to

take  notice of what is being done in regard to our  own

citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I merely wish to put forward a

question to the Minister. How many students are there in

the  Muslim  College  Class  for  Religious  Studies  at

present, and are there no plans by this Ministry to send

students overseas, such as to Azhar University,  or,  in

other  words,  to  countries which are more  modern  and

progressive?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, the present

arrangement  whereby Muslim students  are  sent  to  the

Muslim  College Class for Religious Studies has been  in

existence  since 1961. Students are sent to the  College

on a scholarship, tenable for four years, with an annual

value  of  $1,500 which is paid direct  to  the  College

authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Muslim Scholarship was awarded to a scholar

who was admitted to the College in 1961 and he graduated

in  1964. The second scholar was admitted in 1962 and he

should finish his course at the end of this year.  There

were  no  scholars in 1963 and 1964: two  scholars  were

sent  - one  of  them left this College subsequently  for

further  studies at the Azhar University in  Cairo,  and

the  other is continuing with his studies. In 1965,  one

scholar was sent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desirability of sending Muslim scholars to Cairo

in  future is, in fact, being considered by my  Ministry

and,  to this end, inquiries are being made to ascertain

the conditions and terms of admission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to what extent has re-registration

of  political Parties such as U.M.N.O., the  M.C.A. and

the  M.I.C. been carried out in Singapore? In the  light

of  recent developments after Singapore was evicted from

Malaysia,   first,  is  the  Government   allowing   the

registration of the M.C.A. and the M.I.C., which, as  is

well  known, are now defunct? Second, is the  Government

paying attention to the status of U.M.N.O.? According to

the  constitution  of  U.M.N.O.,  as  I  understand  it,

U.M.N.O. stands for United Malays National Organisation.

If  the  constitution  of U.M.N.O. provides  that  only

Muslims  can  be  members of U.M.N.O., then  it  is  the

responsibility  of  the Ministry of Culture  and  Social

Affairs to get a suitable name for the Party so that the

word  "Malay"  will not be misused by people  of  Arabic

origin  who  have  the title "Syed" to their  names,  by

people  of  Pakistani origin who have the  names  "Hamid

Khan"  or the name "Khan" at the end of their names,  by

people of Muslim Indian origin with such names as "Naina

Mohamed"  or  "Naina  Hashim", by people  of  Indonesian

origin  with such names perhaps as "Parjo" or  "Pardjoe"

or  by people from the Bawean Islands, perhaps with  the

names of "Masmawi" or "Masmawal".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I bring out these points because

this  is  a  political matter which is  related  to  the

internal  peace  of the State. We do  not  wish  to  see

innocent  people  involved in differences  of  political

ideology,  so that each political Party in  this  island

carries out its functions, not by representing people of

one   particular  origin  but  people  of  all   origins

generally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the people in Singapore have come to a

midway stage in their political progress where they  are

able to differentiate between Parties which are communal

and  those  which are non-communal and for  the  general

welfare  of  all. Therefore, to my mind,  the  political

Parties which wish to be registered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



should  fight for the welfare of people not only of  one

racial  origin  but for people who are citizens  of  the

country as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we know that there are political Parties which

name their Parties after particular races, carrying  out

things  which  are  undesirable  and  thereby  involving

innocent   people.   Because  of   this,   it   is   the

responsibility of this Ministry to ensure that there  is

a  progressive  policy so that these  political  Parties

should  be  based on the welfare of the people  of  this

State as a whole.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Member  for  Kampong Kapor, who spoke before me,  talked

about  political  Parties. It is a  fact  that  communal

Parties  will always cause trouble to the people instead

of giving them good services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not know whether we need such Parties. Can the

Minister  tell  us  something about  this?  If  communal

Parties  are  formed,  they will  create  all  sorts  of

disturbances in this country. All communities should  be

joined together to make a political Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are communal Parties, then it is no good for

the  people. Instead trouble will be created. So I  want

to know whether the Minister will change the rules.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, everything has been

said about the racialist political Parties, but I wonder

whether the Minister is aware that the anti-national

pro-Communist  Barisan registration is in his  hands.  I  am

asking  whether  he  is  in a  position  to  cancel  the

registration  of the Barisan Sosialis, as they  are  not

interested  in  this House and in the  welfare  even  of

their  own few constituencies which voted them. I  think

it  is  fair  that  the  Minister  should  cancel  their

registration  no  more  Barisan  Sosialis  and  no  more

Communists. You know, butcher them!



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I wish to raise

two points,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Speaker.  One point relates to my  request  to  the

Minister for an answer concerning the establishment of a

Women's Institute to study the problems of women and  to

give  facilities for the study of such problems; and  to

ask   the  Minister  for  the  date  when  this  Women's

Institute  will be established. This is because  women's

problems are very important and our Party - that is, the

People's  Action  Party - made some  mention  of  giving

facilities  for  the solution of such problems  in  1959

when  the  Party first came to power. At that  time,  we

made a promise to the people of Singapore that when  the

Party  came  to power we would pay special attention  to

the  general problems of women. Since we came to  power,

several  years have elapsed. I am glad to note, however,

that with the co-operation of our Party colleagues, many

promises have been kept. For example, the Government has

already  made it a policy to safeguard the interests  of

women by having the Women's Charter passed to look after

their  welfare. The Women's Charter goes a step  forward

in  safeguarding the position of equality of women  with

men,  and  the status of women in society has also  been

clarified and established, particularly in the field  of

economics.  They  are given equal pay  for  equal  work,

irrespective of their sex. We have given women a  status

equal to that of men. A few months after the passage  of

the  Women's  Charter, the former Minister  for  Finance

took  steps to see that women civil servants were  given

equal   pay   for  equal  work  in  all  the  Government

Departments. Furthermore, steps have also been taken  to

alleviate  the  burden of working wives arising  out  of

their great number of children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ever since we came to power, many, many creches

have  been set up throughout the island of Singapore  in

order  to look after the children of working women.  All

these  steps have been taken in the interest  of  women,

and we are happy to note that throughout the island many

creches are available for use by working wives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning some young girls who have been `misled',

the  Social Welfare Department has also taken  steps  to

solve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



their  problem.  As  a result, this problem  is  not  so

serious  now.  In  fact,  the  number  of  young   girls

indulging in immoral activities has decreased, and  they

are no longer posing a problem in our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to point out that in spite of all

these   achievements  and  attention  given  to  women's

welfare, the Government does not seem to have done  much

with  the  plan  for  the  establishment  of  a  Women's

Institute.   We   all  know  that   Singapore   is   now

independent. We also know that in the past it  was  said

that we intended to set up a society in which there  was

no exploitation of man by man, so that socialism will be

established  and  its  principles  carried  out  to  the

fullest extent. Under such conditions, there would be no

problems   for   women.  Now  that  we   have   achieved

independence, we must give due respect and due weight to

the  possible  contribution that women  are  capable  of

making   towards  nation-building.  This,   of   course,

requires  encouragement  from the  Government,  and  the

Government  is  duty bound to give women  all  kinds  of

assistance  and  facilities  to  help  them  make  their

contribution towards nation-building. I think that, with

the  establishment of a Women's Institute,  we  will  be

able to unite women of all races under one organisation,

to  study  the  problems of women, and to advance  their

interests  so  as  to enable them to contribute  towards

nation-building and to tell them what they  can  do  for

our  country.  In this connection, I hope  the  Minister

concerned will give due consideration to my request  for

immediate steps to be taken for the establishment  of  a

Women's Institute which is, in fact, urgently needed  at

the present moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to raise, Mr Speaker, concerns

the  Commercial Service under the Ministry  of  Culture.

Mr   Speaker,  the  Chinese-educated  people  read  the

Chinese   newspapers  every  day  and  see  a   lot   of

advertisements and news items relating to advertising. I

think  it is the policy of the Government to stop yellow

culture  and all material relating to it. The Government

has  in the past done and up to the present is doing and

I think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



will  in  future  do all it can to stop  the  growth  of

yellow culture. I notice that a great deal of attention ---

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

the  problems of women. That is why I am trying  to  put

these points all together.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member may proceed if she relates it

to problems concerning women.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, we

have  noticed  that  the Chinese newspapers  have  often

given  space  for  advertising  material  which  is  not

conducive to the interests of women. In some cases, such

advertising  material  is  harmful  to  women.  I   have

discovered   instances   of   Chinese   herbalists   and

physicians  publishing advertising material  in  Chinese

newspapers   concerning  their  art   of   curing   some

particular  ailments of women. Some of them  even  claim

that  they  are all-rounders - that they  can  cure  all

sorts of illness.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this advertising material is actually

intended  for ignorant womenfolk. I wish to give  a  few

quotations  to  give you an idea that  such  advertising

material is connected with women's problems. I have here

one  advertisement which says: "If you have no children,

you can consult me."



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member cite the paper and the

date of the paper?

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes, this is the

Nanyang  Siang  Pau  of 22nd December,  1965.  There  is

another    advertisement   concerning   abortion.    The

advertisement says: "If you have irregular menstruation,

consult  so  and so, and if you do not have the  desired

result, your money will be refunded."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it from the same paper?



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes, from the

same paper. There are many items of various types. There

is  also  another type which claims that the  physicians

are  capable  of  curing all kinds of sickness,  ranging

from  the eye to every part of the body. They claim that

they  can  treat  all kinds of ailments with  guaranteed

results, otherwise money will be refunded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I feel that it is the business of the

Ministry concerned to take advantage of our present laws

or   regulations   relating   to   the   exhibition   of

advertisements, publications or publishing  material  to

have  some  form of control and supervision  over  these

advertisements  which are rampant, so  that  undesirable

characters are not able to make use of the loopholes  in

our laws to publish undesirable advertising material  at

the expense of our ignorant people and so that thousands

of women will not fall into the trap of such quacks as a

result of the advertising material. Otherwise, they will

suffer  a  great deal in loss of money and  even  suffer

some complications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, at the present moment, some people are

still  ignorant  of  the progress  in  medical  science,

although much publicity has been given to such progress.

These  people are the potential and intended victims  of

the  quacks I have made reference to. They are  gullible

enough  to  fall into the traps set by these quacks  and

they  will lose money and may even suffer to the  extent

of  having some complications, as a result of which they

will have to go to the government clinics when it may be

too  late. Because of these quack doctors, they may lose

money   and   even   lose   their   own   lives.   These

advertisements of the quacks are of much concern to  me,

and  I  wish the Minister will take immediate  steps  to

have some control over them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, the last point raised

by  the  Member  for  Delta has  more  to  do  with  the

publication side. May I ask my colleague, the Member for

Stamford, to answer that point?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the first point taken up by her, it is a matter

of policy and a matter concerning the establishment of a

Women's  Institute  similar  to  that  of  the  People's

Association.  If  she  will  officially  write  to   the

Government raising this matter, she will be informed  of

the position in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the matter taken up by the Member for Kampong

Kapor,   on   the   question  of  the  desirability   of

registering  communal political associations  under  the

Societies  Ordinance, a society, whether of a  political

nature  or otherwise, can he registered as long  as  the

Registrar is satisfied:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) That the rules of the society are sufficient to

provide for proper management and control;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) That the society is not likely to be used for

unlawful  purposes or for purposes  prejudicial  to

public  peace,  or  welfare or the  good  order  of

Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) That the application for registration complies

with  the provisions of the Ordinance, or any rules

made thereunder;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) That it would not be contrary to the national

interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering the application of any political

association   for  registration  under  the   Ordinance,

whether communal or otherwise, the Registrar, if  he  is

satisfied that the organisation is likely to be used for

unlawful  purposes  or for purposes prejudicial  to  the

public  peace or welfare or the good order of Singapore,

or  that  it would be contrary to the national  interest

for  the  application to be approved, of course, rejects

the application.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

grateful  to  the Member for Delta for bringing  up  the

question  of  undesirable advertisements  in  the  local

newspapers.  I am not aware of any existing  legislation

governing  the  professional etiquette of the  so-called

self-professed physician, but there is legislation being

administered  by  the  Ministry  of  Culture  which  may

perhaps  cover certain aspects of the complaint made  by

the   Member  for  Delta.  This  law  is  known  as  the

"Undesirable Publications Ordinance". In this Ordinance,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



there  are  provisions to control the contents  and  the

desirability   or   otherwise  of   publications,   even

advertisements. Here again, Mr Speaker, I am afraid the

Ministry  of  Culture is not the competent authority  to

decide  on  the  bona  fides  or  effectiveness  of  the

advertisements so claimed, and I am afraid  we  have  to

consult the Ministry of Health as to whether or not they

have in their Ministry any special body or any expert to

decide on the subject. However, Mr Speaker, I would say

in  passing  that this appears to affect  not  only  the

Minister  for  Culture and Social Affairs but  also  the

Minister  for Health, because, apart from the complaints

raised by the Member for Delta, it appears that such  an

advertisement  appears to be a direct  confrontation  of

what  the Minister for Health has earlier stated in  the

House,  that he is going to introduce the I.U.D. Another

aspect  is that it might affect the Minister for Finance

who will ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> What is I.U.D.?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I do not know the exact term ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> It is intra uterine device.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> The Minister for Finance will be

the  next worried man because of the assurance given  by

such  an advertisement, that if you wish to have a  son,

well  you  may  have  it. This may  cause  a  tremendous

population  explosion. I am afraid  that  not  only  one

Ministry is worried about such advertisements. I believe

that,  in  due  course, we may perhaps  get

together - perhaps  five  Ministries  together  -  and  come  to  a

compromise  with a view to introducing, if there  is  no

existing legislation strong enough for that matter, some

form  of  regulations  or  by-laws  under  the  existing

legislation to control such advertisements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would say that aside from the

undesirability of these advertisements, they do  provide

very entertaining reading.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the

Parliamentary Secretary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



to  the  Minister  for Social Affairs has  said  that  a

society will be registered if the Registrar is satisfied

with the conditions as set out in (a), (b), (c) and (d) which he has enumerated. Will the Registrar be satisfied

to  register  the said political Party if some  U.M.N.O.

members are non-Malays?



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

just now the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Social  Affairs replied to my remarks that his  Ministry

will  not  be  in  a position to do anything  about  the

advertisements.  But from what he said  just  now,  that

measures against such advertisements should be taken  by

the   Ministries   which   are   concerned   with   such

advertisements,  I  hope that the  Ministries  concerned

will  co-operate with one another in order to stamp  out

such  undesirable advertisements. I think this could  be

done  and  can be done. There is a saying that there  is

nothing impossible in this world.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we feel that such advertisements are harmful to

society,  especially to the health  of  the  people,  we

should  take immediate steps to deal with them.  I  feel

that the Ministry of Culture and Social Affairs is in  a

position to do something about them, either directly  or

indirectly. We should stop such advertisements and  give

treatment to those who suffer from such ailments. I hope

the  Ministry will pay due attention to what I have  put

forward just now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

supplement what I have said just now. I wish  to  assure

the  Member  for  Delta that there  is  no  question  of

passing  the buck. Still less do we intend  to  start  a

merry-go-round  among the Government Ministries  on  the

subject. I fully appreciate the points raised by her and

I  am personally aware of the situation. As a matter  of

fact,  the  Controller of Publications has,  on  several

previous occasions, discussed the matter with me and  we

are  now digging deep into the existing Ordinances being

administered  by  the Ministry with a view  to  settling

this matter.
