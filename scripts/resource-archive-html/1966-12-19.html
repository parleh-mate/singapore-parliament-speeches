<div align="center"><b>STRIKE BY CLEANSING WORKERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Health

what  plans he has to meet the threatened  strike  by

the cleansing workers of the Ministry of Health.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the

Ministry  of Health has been planning for a  complete

re-organisation of the public cleansing  service  for

some time and has also been gradually building up  an

Emergency  Cleansing Corps towards this  end,  I  can

assure  the  Member for Bras Basah  that  should  the

cleansing  service go on strike at midnight  on  29th

December, 1966, we shall be able to maintain not just

a skeleton service during the strike but at the start

perhaps provide one-half of the present service  with

a gradual buildup thereafter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 26th of August this year, I reported to this

House   that  the  then  strength  of  our  Emergency

Cleansing  Corps was 624 and it could be  stepped  up

without limit to keep up with the requirements of re-organisation.

I am happy to state that  the  present-day  strength  of  our Emergency Cleansing  Corps  is

1,325. This is twice the strength



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>



of  what it was four months ago and is equivalent  to

one-half of the strength of the present work force in

the  Public  Cleansing  Department  of  the  Ministry

should they go on strike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to add, Sir, that strike or no strike, I

shall  personally  take charge of  the  complete  re-organisation  of  the public cleansing  service  with

effect  from the 3rd of January, 1967, which is  only

two  weeks ahead. Re-organisation will proceed  along

the following principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, our public cleansing service will

henceforth  be  on  a two-shift basis  and  this  has

twofold   advantages.  One,  productivity   will   be

practically  doubled because the same  equipment  and

vehicles  could  be used to clear twice  the  present

output  of refuse daily. Two, we can double our  work

force   if   necessary  and  thus  provide  excellent

employment  opportunities  for  our  large  pool   of

unemployed citizens now numbering about 70,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it will put a stop to the nonsensical

system  of cleansing workers turning up for  work  on

Sundays for double pay and public holidays for triple

pay  as  of right and absenting themselves on Mondays

and  days following public holidays! This racket  has

unfortunately gone on for too long even since 1960  -

for  six  long  years! We must put  an  end  to  this

historical   farce!  Hereafter,  Sunday  and   public

holiday work, if any, will be at the request  of  the

employer,  which  is  and  has  been  the  prevailing

situation in Singapore for some time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, since the re-organisation is to take

effect,  strike  or no strike, as from  3rd  January,

1967,  I  am  now  in the position to  offer  to  all

members of our Emergency Cleansing Corps prospects of

permanent  employment in 1967 subject, of course,  to

completion  of three months' satisfactory service  in

the Emergency Cleansing Corps.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Can the Minister

assure  this  House  that during the  period  of  the

strike,  the  Government will not  use  blacklegs  to

break it?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I can give the Member for Bras

Basah  this  assurance  that we  shall  step  up  the

strength  of the Emergency Cleansing Corps  from  the

present 1,325 to as much as is needed to carry out an

essential service for the public.

<div align="center"><b>FIRE BRIGADE POLICY ON ERECTION OF TARPAULIN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SHEDS FOR PARTIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Culture

and  Social  Affairs what is the policy of  the  Fire

Brigade  Authorities in regard  to  permits  for  the

erection  of tarpaulin sheds to shelter the  audience

at a Chinese "wayang", a dinner party, etc.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Fire

Brigade authorities have no objection to the  use  of

tarpaulin   sheds  for  parties  and   other   social

functions  generally. For the performance of  Chinese

wayangs  on wooden stages in public streets, however,

we generally discourage the use of tarpaulin sheds on

the  ground  that  such sheds tend  to  increase  the

danger  to  members of the public watching  a  wayang

should  a  fire  break out on the  stage  or  in  the

vicinity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a policy which quite obviously must be

administered  with  due  regard  to  the   particular

circumstances  of  each case, and  cases  of  refusal

brought to the attention of the Ministry are reviewed

sympathetically  resulting  in  the  Fire   Brigade's

objections being over-ruled in some cases.

<div align="center"><b>QUARTERS FOR PUBLIC UTILITIES BOARD EMPLOYEES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Law and

National  Development if he will consider asking  the

Public  Utilities  Board if the Board  will  consider

providing   quarters  to  its  employees  with   rent

concession  as  is  done  by the  Port  of  Singapore

Authority.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> The answer to the question is

`No'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Ordinance does empower the

Minister to issue to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>



Board such general directions as appear to him to  be

required  in  the  public interest.  But  it  is  not

considered  that  the question of providing  quarters

for  the  Board's  employees  is  one  on  which  any

direction should be issued. Rather, it is one for the

Board to consider in consultation with its employees'

representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of now, the Board has provided quarters for

about  38  per  cent of its daily-rated employees  at

rents ranging from $6 to $16 a month. Free light  and

water  are also supplied with the quarters. With  the

construction  of more quarters in future,  the  Board

expects to provide housing for a larger proportion of

its  daily-rated employees. At the moment, about  782

units are under construction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of monthly-rated employees, it is the

policy  of  the Board to provide, wherever  possible,

quarters  for  officers who are required  because  of

exigencies of service, to live at or near their place

of  work.  About  30 per cent of the  Board's  senior

officers  and  about 18 per cent of  its  junior  and

subordinate  officers  at  present  occupy   quarters

provided by the Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Can the Minister inform this House

what is the figure represented by 38 per cent of  the total   number  of  daily-rated

employees  who   are provided with quarters?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a total

number  of  4,489  daily-rated employees.  Of  these, 1,724 are housed.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> When we rose on Friday, the 16th

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>

will propose the Question again,



"That  the  sum  to  be allocated for  Head  1001  be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1051."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Minister for Culture and Social Affairs

wish to add to anything he said on Friday?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said in this

House  just  before we adjourned last Friday,  it  is

outside the jurisdiction of the Sports Department  to

direct  or  order  any  sports  association  on   the

question  of  premises to be used by the association.

It  is up to the association concerned to choose  the

type  of premises it feels it can afford. If  it  has

adequate  funds,  it will probably  acquire  its  own

separate  premises. But if it is a poor  association,

then  it  may  probably have to share  premises  with

another sports association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not uncommon, Sir, to see two or three sports

associations  occupying one  premises.  In  the  case

mentioned  by the Member for Changi, the  sharing  of

one   premises   by  the  three  sports  associations

concerned would appear to be a convenient arrangement

which  has  been adopted to their mutual  benefit.  I

understand that they are being managed by one and the

same official.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The function of the Sports Department, besides

organising  and  promoting sports activities,  is  to

help,  advise and co-ordinate the activities  of  the

various  sports  associations not  only  in  national

sports   events  but  also  in  international  sports

competitions.  It will also give guidance  to  sports

associations in planning central training  either  by

helping  to  arrange for the services of  instructors

and coaches, or by granting monetary assistance where

required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also the Singapore Sports Council, which is

an  advisory body set up under the Ministry of Social

Affairs,  consisting  of  representatives  from   the

various  sports associations and officials  from  the

Ministry,  including those of the Sports  Department.

The main function of the Singapore Sports Council  is

to organise the Pesta Sukan and to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



advise  the  Minister  in charge  of  sports  on  the

promotion  of sports activities in the Republic.  The

Ministry  is  also  looking into the  possibility  of

establishing a Singapore Sports Foundation which will

be  the  main body for the provision of the necessary

funds  for  sports  promotion. I am optimistic,  Sir,

that when it is established, all sports-loving people

in  the  Republic, including the business  community,

will not hesitate to contribute to the Foundation.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto we have had a very generous response from

the business community to our appeals for funds. This

enthusiastic response from the business community has

enabled us to send three sports delegations abroad  -

to  the  Commonwealth  Games at Kingston,  the  first

Ganefo Games in Phnom Penh, and the Asian Games which

is still going on in Bangkok.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member that when the Sports

Department begins to function fully within  the  next

few months, there will be a considerable increase  in

the tempo of sports promotion in the Republic with  a

view  to  achieving higher standards  all  round  and

ensuring   that  the  cream  of  our  sportsmen   and

sportswomen  will  find  their  way  to  the  top  in

national and international competitions. The Ministry

is now looking for qualified and competent men to man

the  Sports Department, and applications for jobs  in

the  department  will be called for by  advertisement

soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can also assure the Member that with the

establishment of the Sports Department, the  Ministry

will  be reviewing the position of the various sports

associations  to  ensure that they are  properly  and

smoothly   run.  The  Member  need  not   fear   that

officials, sportsmen and sportswomen sent  abroad  to

participate in international sports competition  will

be  going  there  just  for a holiday  and  to  enjoy

themselves. We have set a special Selection Committee

under the chairmanship of the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the Minister for Social Affairs whose job  is  to

select officials and sportsmen and sportswomen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



who  are worthy to represent Singapore abroad. As you

will have seen from the selections made for the Asian

Games, high standards of performance and conduct  are

required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to add, Sir, that under Head 0804

subhead  2255,  there is a sum of  $175,000  for  the

promotion  of  sports.  This sum  represents  various

donations  which have been received from civic-minded

business   firms  and  members  of  the   public   as

contributions to the Government for the promotion  of

sports.   All   existing  sports   associations   are

registered  under the Societies Ordinance  and  their

bona  fides  are  beyond  question.  However,  it  is

possible that some sports associations are badly run,

with  the result that the officials make use  of  the

name of the association to raise funds without proper

accounting  of some of these donations.  Should  this

practice  come  to the notice of the Government,  the

case  will  be properly investigated and  appropriate

action taken where necessary. Here again, Sir, it  is

up  to the members of the associations themselves  to

see  that  they  elect  dedicated  leaders  who  will

discharge  their duties properly and  honourably  and

will  not  use the association to further  their  own

selfish  interests or to acquire funds for their  own

ends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this House will agree with me that the

existence  of  these organisations  is  a  tremendous

threat to the peace and security of our Republic. For

instance,  the  pro-Communist Barisan  Sosialis  have

chosen to carry on their so-called

struggle in the streets, and not in Parliament,  with

a view to creating riots and chaos, and have resorted

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to bring to the notice of the Minister

and  the  Minister of State of Defence that about  40

unruly  Barisan  members visited my  constituency  in

Pulau Tekong Besar last Saturday and distributed anti-national pamphlets. They visited one of the residents

who  happened to disagree with their logic and  their

behaviour. This poor resident was surrounded by these

unruly Barisan birds ---

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, in answer to the query by

the  Member  for Changi, there are at  present  1,738

registered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>



societies in Singapore, out of which 12 are political

societies.  They are the People's Action  Party,  the

Barisan   Sosialis,   U.M.N.O.   Singapore,    M.I.C.

Singapore,  Party Rakyat (Singapore State  Division),

P.M.I.P.   Singapore,   U.D.P.,   M.C.A.   (Singapore

Branch),  Alliance Party Singapura,  Peninsula  Malay

Union, United People's Party, and the Workers' Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Sir, all these organisations have

been  registered under the Societies  Ordinance,  and

under  its provisions any organisation which is being

used   for   unlawful  purposes   or   for   purposes

incompatible  with the peace and good  order  of  the

Republic  can  be  deregistered. On  de-registration,

such organisations will become unlawful societies and

any person managing or assisting in the management of

any  unlawful  society is liable, on  conviction,  to

imprisonment  for  a term which may  extend  to  five

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member that a close watch is being

kept  on the activities of anti-national and communal

organisations.  And  should  they  be  found  to   be

involved  in  activities which are  contrary  to  the

national interest, appropriate action will be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may also remember that at the beginning

of  this  Session I introduced a Bill  to  amend  and

consolidate the law relating to societies.  The  main

change  provided by this Societies Bill is the  power

of  the  Registrar to refuse the registration of  any

society which is a political association if its rules

do  not provide for its membership to be confined  to

citizens  of Singapore, or if it has such a provision

or connection with any organisation outside Singapore

as  is  considered  to be contrary  to  the  national

interest.   Any   political   organisation    already

registered  which fails to amend its  rules  to  meet

these  requirements  within a reasonable  period,  in

accordance  with the request from the Registrar,  may

be dissolved by the Minister.

before  you  decide. Mr Speaker, as I  have  already

indicated  earlier, healthy cultural activities  have

been  flourishing in recent years.  This  is  a  good

sign,  of course, although there have also been  some

unhealthy  cultural  activities  going   on,   as   I

mentioned  to  this House on 5th December  during  my

adjournment speech. In any case, when we  are  making

efforts  to  promote healthy cultural activities,  we

must  also  pay  attention to the  positive  measures

taken by civic organisations and individuals. We must

pay our respect and tribute to their efforts.

Affairs?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you. In

talking  about the other aspects of the  Ministry  of

Social Affairs, I would like to direct my remarks  to

the  policy  of  the Social Welfare  Department.  Mr

Speaker, we are spending a great deal of money  every

year  on  public assistance, amounting to  about  $10

million  a  year,  in  order to  help  the  poor  and

unemployed people, including all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



those   who   suffer   from  T.B.   With   Government

assistance, these unfortunate people are able to pull

along for the time being. I have discovered that  the

efficiency  in  the Department of Social  Welfare  is

praiseworthy.  In my Meet-the-people sessions,  I  am

receiving  less  and  less  complaints  against  this

department. This goes to show that it is taking great

care  in  handling  matters relating  to  the  people

receiving   public  assistance.  For   example,   the

payments  are very prompt and very little trouble  is

given to the recipients of public assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have some other aspects to deal with. The

recipients  of  public assistance have complained  of

the  inadequacy of such assistance. I  give  you  one

concrete  example.  In my constituency,  there  is  a

widow  with  two children. Every month  she  receives

public  assistance amounting to $36. But out of  this

she  has  to  pay $20 for rent, leaving a balance  of

$16.  According  to  her, she is unable  to  maintain

three  persons  on $16 a month. As a result  of  this

complaint,  I have suggested to the person  concerned

to  do some work, for instance, washing clothes.  She

has  said that if this is discovered, then her public

assistance  allowance will be cut  off.  Under  these

circumstances, we can see that the public  assistance

given to this family is far from adequate to maintain

it.  I  would like to ask the Minister whether he  is

prepared to consider giving some kind of rent subsidy

or  increase the amount of public assistance in cases

like  this, so that the people concerned will be able

at least to live at subsistence level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to raise relates to disabled

persons and children. At the present moment, there is

no home for them, other than two which are not run by

the  Government.  One is run by  the  Salvation  Army

which  takes  care of disabled children and  persons,

and  the  other  is run by another organisation.  But

there is no Government run organisation, institute or

home  for these people. I do not know whether in  our

future  plan,  or  even at the  present  moment,  the

Government  is  prepared to set up a  home  to  house

these disabled persons. Mr Speaker, I beg to move.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker, I wish to get an explanation  from  the

Minister  for Social Affairs. He informed  the  House

recently that there was no suggestion to give a  rent

subsidy to the recipients of the social welfare dole.

As   the   Housing  Board  rents  in  Singapore   are

relatively high, it is appropriate that the  Minister

should  consider  the possibility of  paying  a  rent

subsidy to the recipients of the social welfare dole.

in  the  absence of a rent subsidy, these  recipients

are obliged to lodge with their friends or relatives.

The  officers  of the Social Welfare Department  will

then  consider  that  they  have  received  all   the

assistance  from  their lodgers.  This  is  an  added

responsibility to those who provide lodging for them.

This  also  results  in people  refusing  to  provide

lodging  facilities to recipients of  Social  Welfare

assistance,   because  they   fear   they   will   be

responsible. Therefore, I raise the matter  with  the

Minister with a view to asking him to consider giving

a  rent subsidy to those recipients of Social Welfare

assistance  in  the hope that it will  help  them  in

their livelihood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Republic of Singapore has practised

democracy  by allowing people to carry out  political

activities  freely. All this is under the  charge  of

the  Registrar  of  Societies,  which  is  under  the

Ministry of Social Affairs. There are occasions  when

some societies commit a breach of the rules. However,

the  Registrar  has  taken no  steps  to  remedy  the

situation  and  this has resulted  in  the  societies

committing  further breaches. I  am  not  quite  sure

whether  the  department  concerned  is  aware   that

U.M.N.O.  Singapore, which is under  the  control  of

Syed Ali Redha and Inche Ahmad Haji Taff, are engaged

in activities which are against the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three types of breaches of the law. First,

members  of  U.M.N.O. Singapore are not elected  from

amongst   their  members  in  Singapore.   This   was

explained  by  Inche  Ahmad Haji  Taff,  as  head  of

U.M.N.O.,  at the U.M.N.O. delegates meeting,  a  few

months  back. This was reported in the Berita Harian.

The committee of U.M.N.O. Singapore was appointed by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



leaders  in  U.M.N.O.  Malaya.  There  is  nobody  in

Singapore  U.M.N.O, who can dissolve  the  committee.

With  this  announcement, it  is  clear  to  us  that

U.M.N.O.  Singapore  is  not  a  political  body   in

Singapore  but  is  a  part of  U.M.N.O.  Malaya  and

receives directions from Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I wish to say in this House that U.M.N.O.

Singapore, which is led by Inche Ahmad Haji Taff, has

not  yet  shown  its allegiance to  the  Republic  of

Singapore.  Although this country is independent  and

sovereign, U.M.N.O. Singapore even up till today  has

never  hoisted  the  Singapore  flag,  not  even   in

U.M.N.O.  House at Changi Road, when  the  people  of

Singapore  celebrates  National  Day.  This   is   to

demonstrate their hostility towards Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Inche Ahmad Haji Taff and Syed Ali Redha,

who  claim to be leaders of U.M.N.O. Singapore,  have

collaborated with the employees of Alsagoff Estate in

circulating  application forms for  the  purchase  of

land in Alsagoff Estate. This is done from the office

of U.M.N.O. Singapore. These people have been engaged

in  false  propaganda  to  the  effect  that  if  the

residents of Geylang Serai refuse to fill these forms

and  purchase the land, then the Government  in  1968

will  acquire the land and demolish the Malay  houses

and  instead put up flats. This has proved that Inche

Ahmad Haji Taft and Syed Ali Redha have used U.M.N.O.

and  U.M.N.O.  House  as a tool for  their  nefarious

activities  and  selfish ends,  in  order  to  create

unrest among the Malays, so that they will be hostile

to the Singapore Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What steps does the Minister propose to instruct the

Registrar  of Societies to take, and will he  condone

such nefarious acts? I feel that if these people  are

allowed  to continue with their nefarious activities,

they will endanger the safety and peace of Singapore.

As  U.M.N.O. Singapore has the same name as  U.M.N.O.

Malaya,  this  will  confuse the people  of  the  two

independent countries. U.M.N.O. Singapore is  engaged

in  undesirable activities controlled by Inche  Ahmad

Haji  Taff  and  Inche Syed Ali  Redha.  As  U.M.N.O.

Malaya is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



ruling party in Malaysia, so is the P.A.P. the ruling

party in Singapore. We should, therefore, maintain  a

close   relationship  between  the  two  neighbouring

countries. We should avoid indulging in matters which

will  lead  to  a  misunderstanding between  the  two

countries.  In order to solve this problem,  I  would

like to suggest to the Singapore Government that  the

name  of  U.M.N.O. and its flag should be  prohibited

from  being  hoisted in any building,  including  the

U.M.N.O. building in Singapore, until the amendments

to  the U.M.N.O. Constitution have been submitted  to

and approved by the Registrar of Societies.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, under this Head 1001, I would like to  touch

upon  matters  relating to women in  Singapore  which

have been shelved for a very long time.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as a female representative of the

people, I crave your indulgence and ask you to  allow

me  to  speak  about  the  problems  of  women  after

Singapore  achieved independence. It  is  undoubtedly

clear  that  since  the  P.A.P, came  to  power   in

Singapore,  there  have been tremendous  achievements

all  round  for everybody to see. However, concerning

the basic problems of women, up to date there has not

been  much  improvement. Such problems are  still  in

existence. As an efficient Government we must not  be

complacent  about our achievements  so  far.  On  the

contrary,  we  must  go  a  step  further  and   work

progressively for the people in general, irrespective

of  sex.  We must contribute to the population  as  a

whole,  particularly as there is  no  Opposition.  As

representatives  of  the  people,  we  are  given  an

additional role to play, i.e., to supervise the  work

of  Government  in general so that we can  truly  say

that we have come from the people and shall work  for

the  people and we will go back to the people at  the

proper time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, basically speaking, the social problems

of  women  are  no  longer of an outstanding  nature.

Certain efforts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



have  been made by Government to improve the  lot  of

women,  and to do away with the legacies left  behind

by  the  colonial past. For example, in 1961 the  big

axe  was  swung to do away with polygamy in Singapore

which  had existed for over one hundred years.  Steps

have  also  been taken in some sections to  see  that

equal  pay is given to women for equal work  so  that

the status of women is raised to the same as that  of

men. Thus women's social problems have partially been

solved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More creches and clinics have been set up all over

Singapore.  Homes for misguided girls and women  have

also  been set up in Singapore. Action has also  been

taken  to  wipe  out illiteracy among women  folk  in

Singapore.  But the efforts exerted so far  to  solve

the  problems  of  women  have  not  shown  that  the

Government  has been able completely to  improve  the

status  of  women as a whole and solve  their  entire

social problems basically. The Government should look

into  the matter and try to improve the social status

of women in Singapore as promised by them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, circumstances have changed in

Singapore. Our country has become independent and has

entered  a new stage in its history, particularly  in

the population where one half is female and the other

half is male. In other words, both women and men  are

equal  in  political potentials and we must encourage

women  folk  to come out and take an active  part  in

social activities together with men so that they  can

work   together  shoulder  to  shoulder  in  national

construction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also depend on the efforts of women to

improve our economy. In this respect, it is the  duty

of  the  Government to look after the widows and  the

children. Mr Speaker, to remove this injustice,  you

will  agree  with  me  that it is  the  duty  of  the

Government to take effective and immediate action  to

assist women to stand on their own economically so as

to change the entire status of women in society. This

is what we have always been reminding the Government.

We have been urging it to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



implement the pledges as mentioned in The Tasks Ahead

by  setting  up a Women's Institute. This matter  was

raised  by  me in 1965 when I spoke on  it  with  the

Minister  concerned. The reply given to me  was  that

the authorities were still considering the setting up

of  this  institute. But up to date, Mr Speaker,  we

are  still awaiting its establishment. There has been

no  better reply than the one already given  so  far.

There  is a Chinese saying to this effect -  that  we

only  hear  footsteps, but we do not see  the  person

coming  down the ladder. So today we must raise  this

matter  again  in  this  House  so  as  to  urge  the

Government  to  take immediate  steps  to  set  up  a

Women's Institute so that women of all races would be

able, under the banner of this institute, to consider

the  problems  of women and try to solve  them  by  a

concerted effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I shall stress again the importance of

setting  up a Women's Institute in Singapore.  It  is

not  an institute of an advisory nature only or  just

for  discussion purposes or for prestige. It must  be

an  organisation  charged with the responsibility  of

working  out  solutions to women's  problems  and  of

improving their employment opportunities and welfare.

More important still, this organisation must start  a

campaign  for  the improvement of women's  status  in

Singapore,  for example, educating rural women  folk,

making more women understand current affairs and  the

political   situation,   creating   more   employment

opportunities  for them, encouraging  more  women  to

take   part  in  social  activities,  teaching   them

handicrafts  and  the importance  of  their  role  in

national  construction through their own  labour  and

sweat. All these are matters which must be considered

for the actual raising of women's status so that they

are able to contribute not only to the needs of their

own family but also to the needs of society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I hope that the matter I am raising now

will  receive better consideration and a better reply

from  the  Minister. It is my hope that he will  give

new hope to the women in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Devan Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Devan Nair (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker,

the  Home  for the Aged, which is run by  the  Social

Welfare Department, is not serving Muslim and  Indian

food.  Malay  and  Tamil  newspapers  are  also   not

provided.  These  matters have  been  brought  to  my

notice.  If  they  are true, can  the  Minister  take

appropriate steps to remedy the situation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if a husband is the breadwinner, then the

public  assistance given to the family who live  with

their  parents  is  very small.  If  there  are  four

children in the family, very little money is given to

them. The parents can provide only lodging, but  they

cannot  provide other facilities. The mother  has  to

provide  food  for five persons, clothing  and  other

amenities.  She  has  to pay for  all  the  expenses,

except  the rent for the house. The public assistance

given  by the Social Welfare Department is not enough

even  for  one week. The Department has to look  into

this and increase the public assistance given to such

families.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Members for

Sembawang, Geylang Serai and Moulmein have all raised

the  same  question, i.e., whether the Ministry  will

consider  an increase in public assistance grants  to

the present recipients. The Member for Geylang Serai,

I  believe, has also raised the question of whether a

recipient  can  be given a rent subsidy.  Sir,  as  a

matter  of  policy,  it would  not  be  desirable  to

provide  an increase in public assistance  grants  to

cover rentals being paid for Housing Board flats.  If

this  were done, a similar increase would have to  be

given  to other public assistance recipients who  are

not living in Housing Board flats. And this will mean

a  general  increase in the rate of public assistance

grants.  The  present rates of public assistance  are

already the highest in this part of the world, and it

is  not  considered desirable to increase  them.  The

rates are: $21 for the head of household; $10 for the

wife;  $8  for each dependant of 16 years and  above;

and $5 for each dependant below 16 years. The maximum

allowance payable to a family is $90 per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



month.   In  addition,  the  Ministry  also  provides

allowances from the Silver Jubilee Fund for  children

of  widows who are attending school - those  children

who  have  to go to schools further away  from  their

homes.  I  will be happy, Sir, if Members will  bring

specific  cases about the hardship of  widows  to  me

because  their children require assistance for  going

to  school,  and  I  will personally  look  into  the

matter.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question raised by the Member for Geylang

Serai,  that  U.M.N.O. Singapore has not,  since  the

independence  of Singapore, flown the Singapore  flag

on  its  building, I would like Members to know  that

U.M.N.O. Singapore has been informed that, in view of

Singapore's  status  as a sovereign  and  independent

Republic,  it  would be desirable for  its  name  and

symbol  to  be  changed, as they  resemble  those  of

U.M.N.O.  Malaya  and  may give the  impression  that

U.M.N.O.   Singapore  still  has   connections   with

U.M.N.O. Malaya. U.M.N.O. Singapore, however, has not

complied  with  the request to change  its  name  and

symbol.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new Societies Bill which has been introduced

in  Parliament,  there  is  provision  requiring  any

society  which  is formed for political  purposes  to

have  its  membership confined to Singapore  citizens

and  to  have no affiliation or connection  with  any

body  outside  Singapore which is  considered  to  be

contrary  to the national interest. The Registrar  is

empowered to refuse registration of any society  that

does  not meet this requirement. If any such  society

which  has  already been registered fails,  within  a

reasonable period, to amend its rules to comply  with

this requirement, it may be de-registered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Sir, there is no law to compel any

person or organisation to fly the Republic flag  and,

therefore, it will not be possible for any action  to

be  taken against U.M.N.O. Singapore for refusing  to

fly the Republic flag.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also raised the

question of the possibility



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



of  establishing a retarded children's hospital. Sir,

it  is  the  policy  of  the  Ministry  to  encourage

voluntary efforts. The Retarded Children's Society is

doing   good  work  in  this  respect  for   retarded

children.  On  the medical side, these  children  are

looked  after  by the General Hospital  and  the  St.

Andrew's  Hospital. For the moment, the Ministry  has

no plan to establish such a hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question raised by the Member for Delta - it

is  the  same  one which she raised in a question  to

this  House - that is the establishment of  a  Women's

Institute, I did then say that the matter  was  being

looked into by my Ministry. It is now proposed to set

up   a   Committee  to  study  the  matter  and  make

recommendations to the Government. I  hope  that  the

lady Members of this House, including the Member  who

has  raised  this matter, will agree to sit  on  this

Committee and assist my Ministry in this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two questions were raised by the Member for

Moulmein.  One was about the Old People's  Home.  She

said  that the old people there complained that  they

are  not  being served with Malay or Indian  food.  I

would like to tell her that the food in the Home  for

the Aged and other welfare homes is being prepared in

a central kitchen. Unfortunately, there are no Indian

or  Malay cooks. The number of Indians and Malays  in

the Home for the Aged is very small. However, Sir,  I

will  look into this matter and see whether there  is

any possibility of preparing Malay and Indian food in

the central kitchen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of newspapers, it is the same thing.

There are few Malays and Indians in the Home for  the

Aged.  So I do not think that the Home should provide

newspapers  for  the  sake  of  one  or  two  people.

However, I am prepared to look into this matter also.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it the intention of the Minister to accept my

suggestion that the U.M.N.O. flag be prohibited  from

being flown on U.M.N.O. House or other places until a

decision is taken by the Registrar of Societies? This

question has not been answered.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> On the first question, Sir, if a

person is given board and lodging, the Social Welfare

Department  provides  him with a  certain  amount  of

money  which  is  termed "pocket money".  He  is  not

provided  with the full amount because  he  is  given

board and lodging. It depends on the circumstances. I

know  of a case of a woman who is provided with  food

and  shelter  by  her  relatives  and,  in  addition,

receives $16 per month as pocket money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question, Sir, I have already said

that  there is no law to prevent U.M.N.O. from flying

for   Programme  Production  -  Expenses.   The   sum

allocated   for   subhead  2261  is   for   Programme

Production - Fees. These three sub-heads are more  or

less  the same. What I want to know is why do we  not

produce  the same programmes in our own country?  The

expenses  could  then  be reduced  and  our  economic

situation would be improved. Can the Minister  inform

us whether that is possible?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since

the Member for Anson has expressed his desire to deal

with  the  three subheads together, I will  begin  by

enlightening him on the purpose of the sums allocated

for these three subheads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision of $1,150,000 for subhead 2251

involves the acquisition of programmes meant for T.V.

only.  This  amount is to cover the  hire  of  films,

telerecording and the purchase of rights of  locally-produced programmes and films. The estimate for  1966

was $1 million. The increase of $150,000 for 1967  is

to provide for more hours of transmission next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of $300,000 for subhead 2260 is for

Programme  Production Expenses. Members of the  House

will note that there is an increase of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



$50,000  for  1967 and this is due to  the  following reasons:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The anticipated increase in the hours of

production, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The use of four studios in Television Centre as

against  one  temporary  studio  which  is   now

demolished  in the old Broadcasting  House.  The

increase   in   the  number  of   studios   will

naturally   increase   the   number   of    live

productions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 2261 is in respect of Programme Production

Fees  in the sum of $500,000, and this is for payment

of  fees  to artistes. It will take us some  time  to

give  a  break-down of the increase  in  payments  to

individual artistes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful to the Member for Anson for his

suggestion  that we should endeavour to produce  more

local  programmes. In fact, T.V. Singapura under  the

Ministry  of Culture is doing exactly that. In  doing

so,   we   have   to   take  several   factors   into

consideration. I will enumerate a few of them for the

information  of the Member for Anson as well  as  for

the general information of the House.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the big difficulties is the scouting for

talent which I am sure the Member for Anson will have

noticed  in some locally-produced programmes.  In  as

much  as we wish to improve the standard, we  do  not

find it possible for the time being to do so, as T.V.

plays  and  T.V. acts are still in their  infancy  in

Singapore,  and  it  will take some  time  for  local

playwrights and artistes to get acquainted  with  the

T.V. studio.  The  production technique  in  a  T.V.

studio is quite different from that in a normal  film

studio.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next problem is markets for our programmes

produced.  If we can secure a market to  sell  or  to

hire out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



programmes  produced  by us, it will certainly  help  in

defraying   the   cost   of  production.   You   will

appreciate,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  that  it  is   very

difficult  to secure a market for our programmes,  as

some  of  them are repetitions of programmes  already

produced in other countries, and when we compare  our

programmes with theirs, there is quite a wide  choice

of  preference  in  view of the different  tastes  of

viewers.  So  we will bear in mind the suggestion  by

the  Member  for Anson and will endeavour to  produce

more  local programmes taking into consideration  the

various difficulties which I have just mentioned.

of  money for the payment of licences issued  by  the

Liquors  Licensing Board is that we require a licence

for  the restaurant at the Singapore Conference  Hall

for  sales of liquor to be issued in the name of  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, is

the  Government  running  this  restaurant  and  this

liquor establishment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> No, Mr Speaker. We are not

running  this  restaurant,  neither  are  we  selling

liquor.  This  restaurant occupies  a  space  in  the

Singapore Conference Hall and we rent out this  space

to the restaurant operator on the basis of tender. We

only require that the licence for sales of liquor  be

issued  in the name of the Singapore Conference  Hall

and not in the name of the restaurant operator. As  I

have  explained,  Sir, this is in order  to  exercise

better control over this restaurant.

<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): We pay the liquor

licence  but another person derives profit from  that

licence! Is that the Government's intention? Who pays

for  the licence and who makes money out of it?  That

is my question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this restaurant

operator pays for the licence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Then I would like to

know why this item is shown in the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> From the Parliamentary Secretary's

earlier answer, I think it is here because Government

pays the licence fee and because it wants the licence

in  its  name,  but  the money is recouped  from  the

operator  of  the  restaurant. Is that  correct,  Mr

Fong?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> No, Sir. The Member is asking

who  pays  for  the licence now.  I  say  it  is  the

operator  who pays for it now. But as from next  year

we will pay for it.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That cannot be correct, Mr Fong. The 1966 Estimates contains an entry of $720 as well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, the position now is that

the  licence is issued to the owner of the restaurant

and he pays the licence fee. As I have explained,  in

order  to  have  better  control  over  the  bar  and

restaurant as from 1967, the Liquors Licensing  Board

Licence  will  be  in the name of the Superintendent,

Singapore  Conference  Hall.  And  we  pay  for   the

licence, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

understand  what is the meaning of this -  a  licence

paid   by  the  Government  but  on  behalf  of   the

restaurant  operator! Whether the towkay accepts  the

money,   we  do  not  know.  But  this  I   want   to

know - whether it is utilised for that purpose or is it

in the reserve fund?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  may  I inquire whether this is a new Government

policy in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



regard  to the issue of liquor licences in Government

premises?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, the space is rented out to

the  restaurant at a monthly rental of $1,200,  which

is  inclusive of water and other service charges.  We

consider  this to be on the very cheap  side,  taking

into  consideration the surrounding area. And we  are

looking into the matter with a view to increasing the

rental.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the query by the Member for River

Valley, I am not in a position to say whether  it  is

the  policy  of the Government to have a licence  for

the  sale of liquor to be issued in the name  of  the

Government, but the existing practice in the case  of

the Superintendent, Victoria Theatre, is to issue the

liquor  licence in his name. This has been  in  force

for several years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

satisfied  with the reply. In spite of  that,  I  beg

leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment, No. (9) , stood in the name

of Mr Tang See Chim -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1002 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3523.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (9) , Mr Tang See Chim.

He is not here.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 1002 be

reduced by $l00.*



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Inche Rahamat bin Kenap, Mr S. V. Lingam, Inche Mahmud Awang and Mr Sim Boon Woo.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Dewan Bahasa has been established

some time ago and it has a staff of five - an editor,

a  research  officer, a general clerical  officer,  a

typist  and  an  office boy. What are the  duties  of

these  five  officers  of  the  Dewan  Bahasa?   What

progress  has been achieved? What efforts  are  being

made,  apart from the national language campaign,  to

popularise the use of the national language?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I believe that the aim of television,

apart from education and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



giving  information, is to provide entertainment  for

its  viewers  who  pay  $36 for  a  licence  a  year.

Whenever  viewers see a programme on T.V.  Singapura,

there  are always interruptions by advertisements.  I

know that advertisements provide a lot of revenue  to

the  Ministry to help defray the cost of  television.

But  the Ministry should not forget that T.V. viewers

like   good   programmes,   and   interruptions    by

advertisements in the middle of a programme will  not

make them happy, because they have got to take out  a

licence   every   year.   I   suggest   that    these

advertisements  be  screened  before   or   after   a

programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more point about T.V. programmes, Mr Speaker,

is that there is also a programme on golf which lasts

about  one  hour. Surely we do not have many  golfers

and  golf  enthusiasts. I do not know if the Minister

himself plays golf, but I know a number of Ministers,

including the Minister for Finance, who play golf.  I

believe  there  are more football,  badminton,  sepak

raga, even a-go-go enthusiasts among our people.  But

we  have  very few football films shown on T.V.  T.V.

Singapura  should have more programmes  on  football,

sepak  raga,  etc, for the enthusiasts. Singapore  is

now  known  throughout the world as an orchid-growing

country and the number of people who grow orchids  is

increasing  day by day. Therefore, we should  have  a

programme on orchid-growing on T.V.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): As a young and

independent nation, we feel it is necessary  to  look

after  our  security  and prosperity  so  that  every

citizen  will  get  the benefit of  independence  and

freedom given by the Government. Co-operation between

one  another  is necessary, especially in  the  local

Press. The Press can contribute constructively to our

multi-racial society. But we must beware  of  foreign

political   publications   which   can   damage   our

solidarity.  Also  the  publications  of  a   foreign

Government,   which   is  carrying   out   propaganda

activities, are very much at large in our country.  I

feel it is necessary to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>



mention  here  the names of these publications.  They

are  the Malaya Merdeka and Suara Malaysia issued  by

the Malaysian Government. The aim of these two papers

is  to influence and confuse the people of Singapore,

particularly  among the Malays. This is entirely  for

the  political benefit of their country. We have  not

forgotten  how  the Malaysian Government  banned  the

Petir  from Singapore and also the Chermin issued  by

the  Ministry of Culture. They have been banned  from

circulation  in Malaysia. If the people of  Singapore

can  be  treated  in such a manner by  the  Malaysian

Government, is that not a challenge to the  Singapore

Government? It is because too much democracy is given

by  the  Government  of  Singapore  that  the  Malaya

Merdeka is circulating freely in Singapore. A foreign

Government  can take advantage of us for the  benefit

of  their  own  country.  As this  may  cause  racial

conflict  between the various communities, I  suggest

that  the Government should ban these two papers from

circulating in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a multi-racial nation, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

believe  Television Singapura should be  improved  to

adjust itself to such a policy. Malay programmes  are

very  few.  Apart from the Pak Awang Temberang  show,

there  is  no  other  Malay programme  which  can  be

considered  constructive.  As  we  are  now  a   fast

developing   nation,   T.V. programmes   should   be

constructive.  For example, there  should  be  dramas

which could be an example to our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the news coverage by Radio Singapore

and  Television  Singapura, apart from  giving  local

news,  there  is also a wide range of  foreign  news,

including   Malaysian  news.  In  this   way,   Radio

Singapore  and  Television Singapura have  played  an

important  role.  They are making a  contribution  to

Malaysia by making it known to foreign countries. The

Malaysian  Government should thank  the  Ministry  of

Culture  of Singapore for announcing Malaysian  news.

This shows that Singapore is very compromising in its

attitude  and  does  not consider  Malaysia  and  its

neighbours   as   its  enemies.  But  the   Malaysian

Government does not appreciate it. Radio



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>



and Television Malaysia have never broadcast

Singapore news. They prefer to broadcast news from

other countries.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I would

like  to  speak on the National Library. This Library

was  erected with air-conditioning supplied. I  would

like  to  know why, although the building was erected

with    air-conditioning   facilities,    the    air-conditioners  are not working in several  places.  In

some places, there is no air-conditioning at all.  In

other  places,  it  is not cold enough.  The  Library

needs  cool air, because when people read to  acquire

more  knowledge,  they need a cool  temperature.  The

officers  in  this Library work in warm surroundings,

and  when  they have a meeting it is held in  a  warm

place. At times they have to open the windows and use

fans.  In the places where children and adults  read,

the  air-conditioners are not as satisfactory as what

we  have here now. I feel that it would be better  if

the air-conditioning in this Library is improved,  so

that with improved air-conditioning, the minds of the

readers in the Library will be refreshed.

Sir, I rise to query the Minister for Culture whether

he  is in receipt of a copy of a letter addressed  to

the  Editor  of the Straits Times from the  Singapore

National Union of Journalists. It appears that Mr D.

R.  H.  Brown, Secretary of the Singapore Turf  Club,

made   certain  statements  on  12th  December  about

profits from the first Singapore Sweep,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



which statements he clarified in the Straits Times on

the following day. In his so-called clarification, he

blamed  a  Straits Times reporter for an error  which

was,  according  to the S.N.U.J.,  Mr  Brown's.  The

Straits  Times,  which has contracted  to  print  the

Singapore  sweep  tickets,  has  not  published   the

S.N.U.J.'s letter, even though Mr Brown's  so-called

clarification statement has damaged the reputation of

a local journalist. Will the Minister give this House

an  assurance that Press and public relations for the

Singapore sweep will be properly handled in future by

the Turf Club?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  would  like to touch on cultural  activities

under   this   vote.  Generally  speaking,   cultural

activities have flourished in this country, in  spite

of  the  fact  that  there have also  been  unhealthy

cultural activities which have influenced our  people

adversely,  as  I mentioned on 5th December  in  this

House.  But the Ministry of Culture's efforts in  the

promotion  of healthy cultural activities  cannot  be

denied.   Moreover,   the  efforts   of   our   civic

organisations to promote healthy culture should  also

be   commended.  There  have  been  achievements  and

manifestations   of  our  cultural  activities.   For

instance,  recently  a Hong Kong All-Star  troupe  of

singing artistes visited Singapore. There was also  a

Japanese cultural mission to Singapore recently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Locally, there have also been a number of concerts,

choirs, dramas and other healthy cultural activities.

Undoubtedly the performance given by foreign as  well

as  local  organisations will  help  to  promote  the

interchange of cultures in South-East Asia and enrich

our cultural life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point which needs to be mentioned is

that  the Ministry of Culture some time ago organised

a  mission which performed in Seremban, Malacca,  and

elsewhere  in  West Malaysia. That was  part  of  our

cultural    activities.   Cultural   magazines    and

publications have also published those items. Let  me ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, I was the Secretary to that

mission. But in order to refresh my memory, could the

Member  please  quote  the  name  and  date  of   the

publication?













<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The  Chairman (Mr Lim Cheng Lock)</b>: Mr Teong, could you?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): At the moment, I

do  not  have the exact date of the magazine, but  it

was   something  like  a  souvenir  magazine  of  the

mission.  When I have the opportunity  in  future,  I

will certainly give him the information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first point, about the promotion of Malaysian

culture,  I  will  change  it  to  the  promotion  of

Singapore  culture.  That is the main  emphasis.  The

second  point is the promotion of the interchange  of

the  various  cultures. Thirdly, the promotion  of  a

healthy culture. The next point is the promotion of a

sense    of    loyalty,   patriotism   and   national

consciousness  among those taking  part  in  cultural

activities in order to build our Singapore - at  that

time  they  used  Malaysia;  I  think  I  should  use

Singapore  now - and the promotion of the  cultural

activities of our civic organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that these four objectives enumerated in

the  magazine  should  also be encouraged.  They  are

still  valid  because we should  know  our  task  and

objectives  at  the present juncture in  relation  to

cultural  activities. They are, firstly,  to  promote

healthy cultural activities; secondly, to promote the

interchange  of  the cultures of the  various  races;

thirdly, to promote goodwill and understanding  among

the   various   races;  fourthly,   to   promote   an

understanding of cultural activities and to encourage

people  to  devote themselves to cultural  activities

and  nation-building; fifthly, to raise the  standard

of cultural activities, be they singing, exhibitions,

concerts, dramas or playwriting, etc.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contents should be in the nature of promoting

love   and  patriotism  towards  one's  country   and

instilling in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>



the   minds  of  the  people  a  sense  of   national

consciousness and loyalty to our country.  Therefore,

the one important task facing the Ministry of Culture

is  to  formulate a complete policy  on  culture  and

cultural  activities,  to  promote  healthy  cultural

activities,  and to help various civic  and  cultural

organisations  in this respect. It should  also  curb

all  unhealthy  and pornographic cultural  activities

which  are  poisonous and will endanger  our  nation-building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our industrialisation and economic progress has

been  described  as  very  encouraging.  I  can  also

mention  housing  construction.  On  this  I   should

congratulate    the    Minister   concerned.    These

achievements have contributed greatly to our national

well-being.  I  also  hope that  cultural  activities

under the guidance of our Ministers can also flourish

and  bring  us  a  step further to  be  more  culture

conscious  so that we can show our culture throughout

the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now congratulate the Ministry of Culture on

its  efforts, achievements and work in the  promotion

of  the  national language during the Language Month,

which  has  also  received the warm  support  of  the

people.  But  one matter for regret is  that  certain

political  parties  such  as  U.M.N.O.,  the  Barisan

Sosialis and the Alliance have adopted an attitude of

indifference to this campaign. This has  enabled  the

people  to see through them. Their so-called  support

for  the  National Language campaign  is  entirely  a

deception trying to fool the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to

give  an  answer to what I raised on the 5th of  this

month   when  I  was  making  an  adjournment  speech

touching on various points on cultural activities and

cultural construction.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Devan Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Devan Nair</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Sir, we hear pop and

undesirable songs in the programmes of T.V. Singapura

in   all  languages.  The  children  are  very   much

attracted to them, and because of that, they tend  to

go the wrong way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>



Does the Minister intend to change this attitude?  If

not, can he look into that in future?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there are undesirable scenes in pictures

featuring James Bond. These scenes also attract young

people  and  spoil  them. Why  do  we  not  ban  such

pictures?  Even if we do not ban them, we can  censor

the  undesirable  scenes. I  hope  the  Minister  for

Culture and Social Affairs will take action on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, when there are good programmes on T.V.

Singapura,  these  are stopped when  they  reach  the

exciting parts, and advertisements are shown.  People

who  are  interested in the programmes are  disgusted

because  of this. As a result, the advertisements  do

not  get  into  their  minds.  So  the  aims  of  the

advertisements are lost. Can the Minister  stop  such

advertisements which do not benefit anyone?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, as far as the programmes are concerned,

they  should  be  of  a  good standard.  It  is  very

important. In addition to that, they should be  heard

by the public properly. In this connection, I wish to

touch on Tamil programmes. I do not want to touch  on

the standard of Tamil programmes over the radio. They

are  not closely listened to by the people. Recently,

the   radio   wave-length  was  changed   for   Tamil

programmes. Whatever changes are brought about by the

Government  should  be for the better.  But  in  this

.case, it has produced the reverse effect. There  are

a  lot of disturbances in the broadcasts. At times we

can hear everything except Tamil programmes over this

wave-length. Can this pitiful situation be  improved?

Can the Minister for Culture take action?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

I  will avail myself of this opportunity to give some

comments as well as ask some queries. First  of  all,

let me say that my views may not be the same as those

of the Members who have already spoken. For instance,

the   Member  for  Kampong  Kembangan  has  requested

various  popular  sports to  be  introduced  in  T.V.

pictures instead of golf and has made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>



several suggestions. These suggestions are tantamount

to  requesting the introduction into films of animals

other than rare wild animal life, such as tigers  and

lions. Generally speaking, the vote for the whole  of

the Culture Ministry is still very small. I feel that

the  Government has not allotted sufficient funds  to

it  to  carry  out cultural activities, although  the

Minister  has explained in a roundabout-way that  the

other  Ministries have been allotted  funds  for  the

carrying out of activities relevant to culture.  Some

time  ago  I  read  certain  news  items  about   our

Government's  intention  to  organise  an  Afro-Asian

cultural  festival. But there is no such  vote  under

this  Ministry. Also the expenditure as  allotted  at

present  is  not  enough to meet other  expenses.  If

there  are  not enough funds available, how  can  the

Ministry  carry out such activities? If the water  in

the  tank  is  so very shallow, how is  the  Minister

going  to swim freely in it? How is he able  to  make

use  of  the  limited  funds to  carry  out  cultural

activities?  That is one query I would  like  him  to

answer.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

sorry for that.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): He spoke

without  guts. For instance, he kicked  somebody  and

then  he said sorry to that person. That shows he  is

gutless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today we are talking about culture. Everybody

knows that culture and art are part and parcel of the

spiritual   life  of  the  people,  especially   when

Singapore  is  now a newly-independent  country  with

full sovereignty, and when the thinking and the sense

of  patriotism of the people need to be  fostered  in

addition to being achieved through education.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.26 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These objectives are to be achieved both through

education  and  cultural activities. At  the  present

stage  of  our independence, if we do not  have  good

cultural  programmes which can  lead  the  people  to

march forward in the right direction, but allow  them

to have filthy ideas and thoughts emanating from evil

and  yellow culture, then it would be detrimental  to

their well-being and they would not be encouraged  to

seek   advancement  and  progress.  Without   healthy

cultural programmes, the people will not be  able  to

march  forward to progress. On the other  hand,  they

will  be  indulging themselves in filthy, yellow  and

cheap entertainment. Therefore, we feel that at  this

juncture it is necessary for us to educate the people

and  also carry out cultural activities to guide them

towards  nation-building, and  in  this  respect  the

Ministry of Culture has a great role to play. We have

to   unite  the  various  races  together  into   one

community and the cultures of the various races  into

one national culture. But when we look around we find

that filthy cultures and activities outnumber healthy

cultural activities. Everywhere in the State  we  can

find  yellow culture in the form of books, magazines,

mosquito newspapers, advertisements, etc., which  are

rampant.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also a great number of pornographic

publications.  The  Ministry has  also  taken  action

against such publications, but is this tanta-mount to

the   complete  eradication  of  yellow  and   filthy

cultural activities? The answer is `No'. The sex  and

yellow  culture  mongers are capable of  infiltrating

into  every  nook and corner of our society.  In  the

past,  our  anti-yellow culture campaign was  carried

out vigorously. But due to subsequent relaxation, the

yellow culture mongers have again raised their heads.

If we look at certain advertisements in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>



newspapers  or the walls of lavatories, we  will  see

vulgar and filthy pictures and drawings which are the

work of corrupted minds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that half of our present population

consist  of youths. The type of education  that  they

receive at their formative age is very important.  At

such   an  age,  they  are  susceptible  and   easily

influenced,  and  if  they are subject  to  the  evil

influence  of  yellow culture,  what  will  be  their

future  and what will become of our country?  Members

of  Parliament have stressed the seriousness of  this

problem  and  have  put forward  suggestions  to  the

Minister. But what do we get in return? The  Minister

turns  a deaf ear to our suggestions which have  been

made in all earnestness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we see when we look at advertisements in the

newspapers?  They  try to induce  people  to  go  for

abortion  and  encourage them to go  and  see  filthy

pictures.  Such advertisements and publications  will

cause  our  youths  to  deteriorate  in  their  moral

standards. How can we then build up our country  with

the  contribution and dedication of youths  who  have

swallowed  the poison from filthy publications'?  How

can  we  expect them to fulfil their role in  nation-building? Today we are short of spiritual food and it

is  the  sacred  task of the Ministry of  Culture  to

cater  for the spiritual needs of the people  and  to

promote  healthy  cultural activities,  such  as  the

establishment  of  a  Cultural Advisory  Council,  as

suggested  by  the  Member for Sembawang,  to  enable

representatives of various sections of the people  to

contribute  their ideas for the promotion of  healthy

culture,  so  that our youths will have  cleaner  and

healthier minds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I would like to clarify one point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta said that I spoke without guts.

I  cannot  remember when I spoke like that.  I  would

like  to  say  that  I have been  quite  fair  in  my

remarks.   If  the  Ministry  of  Culture  has   done

excellent  work in the promotion of healthy  culture,

and if any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>



organisation has done anything worthy in the cultural

field, of course, I will praise them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Member to clarify her statement

that I spoke without guts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like the Minister to reply to the ten

suggestions made by me on 5th December.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, many

Members have spoken and I too would like to add a few

words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been talking at length about culture for the

last  three  years.  The culture  that  one  sees  in

Singapore comes mostly from the West. We have to look

into  the possibility of altering it to our own  use.

This is what the Minister should do. We go on talking

about culture instead of adapting Western culture  to

our own needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta spoke of activities which

hamper  the advancement of our youngsters. I  suggest

that  we should appoint a Committee to look into  the

possibility of leading our youths on the proper  path

in  order  to make them good citizens in the  future.

Most of the cultural material imported into Singapore

has  been  modified  to  our  own  purpose.  Although

textiles  are cheap, clothes are getting shorter  and

shorter,  so  much so that the human  body  is  being

revealed more and more. If this goes on and we cannot

adapt  imported cultural modes to our  own  use,  our

people  will look different. As a democratic country,

we  cannot stop these activities, but we must try  to

adapt them to our own use.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, frankly I do

not see how this has anything to do with culture.  It

does  not come within the purview of the Ministry  of

Culture. It is a police matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No, Mr Fong. I am sure that the

tendencies of youths are matters for the Ministry  of

Culture.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> On a point of order, Sir. There

is no law to stipulate how men and women should dress

themselves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Fong, the Member is within the

rules ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, I am just

mentioning whether it is not possible ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Let me deal with the point of order,

please. I think Mr Govindaswamy is perfectly in

order. If what he says carries weight, then you go

along with him and prohibit short skirts! Mr

Govindaswamy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): The Parliamentary

Secretary  is  losing his temper. I am not  attacking

him.  I  am  only  trying to see how the  morals  and

behaviour of the people can be improved. I know  that

there are certain things which we cannot do, but I am

only   suggesting  that  we  should  look  into   the

possibility  of setting up a Committee to  study  the

matter.  I  realise that Singapore  is  a  democratic

country and that there is a limit to what we can  do,

but  we must look into the possibility of seeing what

can be done and the manner in which it can be carried

out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the case of the students. If we can instil good

habits  in  them when they are young, they  will  not

easily  change  these  habits.  This  is  what  I  am

suggesting. We only talk about culture,  but  we  are

not  looking into the possibility of adapting foreign

culture to our own conditions. We have accepted  four

different languages as our official languages. So  we

must  see what plays and dramas can be introduced  in

these  languages. In the same way, we must  also  see

how we can adapt imported cultural activities for our

own benefit. It is no use turning round and asking us

how  to  do it. We have given you the power  and  the

salary,  and  it  is  up  to you  to  look  into  the

possibility  of  adapting these  activities  for  the

benefit of the people. When we talk about culture, we

must think seriously and see how we can adapt foreign

cultural  activities for our own benefit. I  ask  the

Ministry  to look into the various means of achieving

this  end.  But you must not ignore whatever  Members

speak.  You  must  listen to us  and  look  into  the

possibility  of setting up a committee to  study  the

matter. You must.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>



consider  that  what  we are  saying  is  proper  and

appropriate so that by the next Budget sittings,  you

will  have  been  able to set up  such  a  committee,

instead  of  perennially talking  about  culture  and

cultural activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next subject I wish to speak on is Radio and

T.V. which  was  also touched on by the  Member  for

Moulmein.  Yesterday, a nice film was shown  on  T.V.

for  55  minutes, but 10 to 15 minutes of this period

was  taken up by advertisements which interrupted the

film  show.  I  agree that we must get  revenue  from

advertisements on T.V. In the theatre, advertisements

are  put  on at the beginning and during the interval

of  the film show. Why cannot the same thing be  done

on T.V.? Any number of advertisements can be shown at

the  beginning and at the end of a picture show,  but

they  should  not  appear time  and  again  during  a

picture show.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been a lot of complaints about the wave-length used for Tamil programmes. The reception for

programmes  in  English, Chinese and  Malay  is  very

clear,  but  not for Indian programmes, because  this

particular  wave-length  is apparently  a  weak  one.

Perhaps  the  authorities  think  that  nobody   will

complain. The people tune in to this particular wave-length, but they do not get any response and they are

helpless   to  complain.  The  listeners   to   Tamil

programmes  also pay the same licence fees  as  those

listening  to other programmes. I suggest  that  this

wavelength  should  be changed. In  this  respect,  I

support the Member for Moulmein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to touch on what the Member for

Sembawang  said.  I  repeat  that  we  must  have  an

advisory  committee  to look into matters  concerning

culture  instead of continually talking  about  them.

Therefore,  I  repeat that the Minister  should  form

such a committee.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I feel

that  when we talk about the problems of culture,  we

must have a principle to follow in the first



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



instance.   Instead   of   talking   about    culture

negatively,  we  must talk about  it  positively  and

constructively. When we talk about yellow culture and

pornography  on the one hand, we must, on  the  other

hand,  realise  that  there  is  a  principle  behind

culture. Negative measures to wipe out yellow culture

or  contain  it  are useless. We must  take  positive

steps  to promote healthy cultural activities in  all

ways  so  that  when  yellow  culture  is  beating  a

retreat, the vacuum will then be filled with  healthy

culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now look at what the Government is doing in

respect  of  the vote to be given to the Ministry  of

Culture. I feel that the vote is too little. Whatever

explanation  is  given,  I  feel  that   when   these

Estimates are framed, certain defects will be noticed

because  the Budget is unable to show us the  various

types  of  cultural activities that will  be  carried

out.  Although the Minister for Finance has said that

a lot of money has been spent on cultural activities,

the  expenditure is not broken down and analysed  for

discussion in the Committee of Supply. So I hope that

in  future  all  expenditure in respect  of  cultural

activities  will be listed in the Estimates  so  that

when we are in Committee of Supply we are able to  go

through this matter item by item. That is my view.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very

good  to  have  such an enthusiastic  debate  on  the

development  of culture. I will deal first  with  the

comments  made  by the Member for Kampong  Kembangan.

The  first  point  he has raised is about  the  Dewan

Bahasa and what its achievements are. It is difficult

to  give  full details of its achievements,  but  the

fact  that  the national language is popular  in  the

City  State, where 75 per cent of the population  are

Chinese,  is enough to show that at least  the  Dewan

Bahasa  is doing its best to encourage the  study  of

the   national  language.  We  are  now   considering

expanding this organisation into a Research Institute

into  Languages and Culture. When this  is  done,  it

will   not  only  deal  with  publications  but  also

research  into the various languages and cultures  of

our people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On T.V. advertisements, the Member was not the only

one to raise it. Of course, to the viewers it may  be

annoying  to  see  an advertisement  popping  out  in

between very exciting moments of a film. But from the

business  man's  point of view, that is  exactly  the

time  you hope to catch the attention of the viewers.

Anyway,  as we have explained many times, we have  to

include advertisements to help defray the expenses of

running the radio and T.V. From radio and T.V. alone

in  1966  we got $4,629,000, and from this  money  we

were  able  to  get better programmes  for  T.V. and

radio.  By next year we may get more than $5  million

from advertisements. I can assure you, Sir, that much

of  the money received will be used to acquire better

quality films as well as programmes for our viewers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan has also mentioned

about  programmes for golf players, and asked why  we

should  have them. I have to enlighten him by  saying

that  the programme on golf and bowling is introduced

on  T.V. and  over the radio to cater for  a  cross-section  of our viewers. We must not forget  that  we

are  a  multi-racial, multi-cultural, as  well  as  a

multi-religious population, and we  have  to  give  a

chance  to every section. There are only three  films

on   bowling.  Whenever  programmes  on   sport   are

included,  the popularity of the sport is taken  into

consideration. For instance, there have been films on

the  World  Cup  soccer matches,  wrestling,  boxing,

etc.,  and  whenever possible good matches  of  local

sport, such as soccer, badminton, and sepak raga  are

covered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to orchid-growing, sometime back in the

series of Woman's World, there were talks on orchids:

for  example, how to recognise the different species,

and  how they are grafted. Also the production  of  a

programme on orchids will take time. However, we will

look  into the suggestions put forward by the  Member

for Kampong Kembangan and other Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai raised the question of

foreign  publications, and he specifically  mentioned

Suara Malaysia and Merdeka. He advocated their banning.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>



The  Singapore Government is  aware  of  these

publications.   We  are  adopting  a  very   generous

attitude towards these publications. We believe in an

open   society  and  we  are  not  afraid  to   allow

publications  like those mentioned by the  Member  to

compete in the market-place of ideas and thoughts  in

our society. We are sure that our people will be able

to  differentiate between what is right and  what  is

wrong.  However,  we also hope that the  same  spirit

will  be  reciprocated from across  the  Causeway.  I

assure  the Member for Geylang Serai that action  has

already been taken on his suggestion by the Singapore

High Commission in Kuala Lumpur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Malay films and films in general, it is a

question of staff. We are very short of staff who are

able  to  produce  programmes,  particularly  in  the

national  language. There is only one Malay  producer

for the radio, and he is now mobilised into the Army.

For  television,  we have three producers.  With  the

removal to the new Television Centre, we have two big

and  two small studios as compared with one temporary

studio  in  the  old Broadcasting House.  With  these

facilities and with more staff, we hope to be able to

improve the production of Malay programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for news from Radio Malaysia and T.V. Malaysia, I

think that those who have been listening to the  news

from T.V. Malaysia will agree that, in fact, there is

no  news  at all about Singapore. But this is  beyond

our  control. It does not mean that we have to follow

the  same  narrow-minded policy of  not  letting  our

viewers  know what is happening in this part  of  the

world, including Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kapor has mentioned about air-conditioning the National Library. In fact, this

suggestion has been put forward by us since 1962. But

owing  to the high recurrent cost, the matter has  to

he  shelved. Everybody will welcome more  comfort  in

the  National Library, not only for workers  but  for

children and other sections of the population. But we

have  to  bear  in mind the financial burden  of  the

Government. On the other hand,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>



comparatively  speaking, the standard  of  living  in

Singapore can be considered to he very high:  if  not

the highest, then the second highest in this part  of

the  world.  And at this time of nation-building, we

should  not make the people too comfortable, or  they

will  become too soft, such as going to the  National

Library  to read in an air-conditioned room. If  this

is  the type of population we are producing, I do not

think our nation can survive very long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, coming to the point raised by the

Member  for Telok Blangah on public relations between

the  Secretary  of the Singapore Turf  Club  and  the

Straits  Times, I am afraid the relationship  between

the  Secretary of the S.T.C. and the reporters of the

Straits  Times  is  not  our  concern.  We  have  not

received  a copy of the complaint, but if we  receive

it,  we  will  look  into it, But  I  am  afraid  the

Ministry of Culture cannot interfere too much in  the

relationship between other people and the Press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the comments by other Members, generally

speaking, the Member for Sembawang wanted me to reply

to  his ten points, and the Member for Moulmein spoke

about  James Bond and other matters. I think  I  will

cover all their points at one time. Mr Speaker, Sir,

it is good to hear Members - for instance, the Member

for Bukit Merah - asking for more funds to be allocated

to  the  Ministry  of Culture for  the  promotion  of

culture. Normally a Ministry is criticised for  over-spending or wasting public funds. Any Ministry would,

of  course,  welcome more funds,  because  with  more

money you can have more results.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have to appreciate that there is such a

thing  as  priority in the allocation  of  Government

funds.  This  Government has to look after  the  rice

bowl  of  the  people,  housing, education,  health,

welfare  and the rest. Without the basic requirements

-  a  full  stomach,  a roof over  one's  head,  good

health,  a  basic education - one will not have  much

time or energy to participate in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>



cultural  activities. That is why the Government  has

to  pay  more  attention to these basic  requirements

first.   Notwithstanding  the  small  sum  of   money

available for the promotion of culture, the  Ministry

has  done  its  best  to encourage  healthy  cultural

activities  and to promote a cultural interchange  in

our multi-racial society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1959, regular performances of Aneka Ragam

Rakyat  - the people's concert - in the city as  well

as  the  rural  areas  have brought  about  a  better

understanding  and appreciation of  our  multi-racial

cultures.  In 1963 we even went one step  further  by

organising  the  South-East  Asia  Cultural  Festival

which,  to a certain extent, helped to promote better

cultural  understanding among the various  people  of

this region. The promotion of culture and the task of

shaping  a  national culture out of  a  diversity  of

cultures  is  not  the  sole  responsibility   of   a

Ministry,  in a democratic society like ours,  it  is

the  people  - when we say the people,  we  mean  the

multi-racial,   multi-religious,  and  multi-cultural

citizens o Singapore and in particular the artistes -

who can shape the national destiny of our nation. The

function of Government is just to guide them, to give

them  encouragement, morally if not  financially.  In

this  respect, cultural organisations have since 1959

responded very well to our call for a healthy culture

and  for  a cultural interchange. The marked increase

in the number of cultural performances, as the Member

for  Sembawang  has  agreed and has  also  mentioned,

exhibitions  and plays performed during  this  period

compared  to-those of the pre-P.A.P, days  speak  for

themselves.  Although  there  was  vitality  in   the

cultural  field in the past few years,  I  must  say,

however, that there was a lack of concerted effort in

the  field  of  creative art; I mean the  meeting  of

minds among the leaders of different cultural streams

to  study the problem of cultural integration and the

development  of  a  national  culture.  Most  of  the

performances,  whether in the  field  of  music,  the

dance  or drama, were still foreign-inspired and  did

not   reflect  local  conditions,  the   spirit   and

aspirations of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>



own  people. Although there were encouraging attempts

at  local  composition, there was  no  concerted  and

organised   effort.  This  aspect  of  our   cultural

development   was  hampered  by  the  unsettled   and

unstable  political situation which prevailed  during

the  two-year  "romance" of one but now two  nations.

When  the  life or death of a nation and  its  people

looms  over  the political horizon, very little  time

and  energy can be spared on the promotion of culture

or  the  finer side of life. Now that there is better

political  stability,  we can devote  more  time  and

energy to the cultural aspect of our national life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1967 we will enter a new phase in cultural

development.  Next  year the  Arts  Council  will  be

formed  to  assist in the promotion of  the  creative

arts,  such as music, the dance, drama, painting  and

sculpture.  The  Arts Council will comprise  cultural

experts  and leaders from the four cultural  streams.

The establishment of this Arts Council, we hope, will

capture  the  imagination and  satisfy  some  of  the

aspirations of our people. The Council will  help  to

tap  the  cultural resources and cultural talents  of

our young nation for the purpose of nation-building.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are approaching guillotine time.

You have about three minutes more, Mr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> National construction is not

only  confined  to providing housing,  education  and

jobs  for our people. We have also to look after  the

spirit  of the people. We have inherited in a  multi-racial   and  multi-cultural  nation,  the   cultural

heritages of four great civilisations -Malay, Indian,

Chinese  and European. But as a nation and a  people,

we  should not live in separate cultural compartments

forever.  Out of the four cultural streams we  should

try  to mould something characteristic of our nation.

Our  music, dancing, drama, painting and other  forms

of  art should reflect the spirit and aspirations  of

our  people and our time. This may take time,  but  a

start has to be made. The proposed Arts Council  will

help to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



gather forces towards this end. To enable the Council

to  fulfil  this  task, the question of  promoting  a

national  cultural  fund  is also  being  considered.

Meanwhile,  an interim cultural workshop,  comprising

prominent   local   composers,   choreographers   and

artistes,  is  busily hammering out a  programme  for

next  year's music and dance festival. This festival,

the  first of its kind ever to be sponsored  by  this

Ministry  to perform locally, will compose music  and

dancing  depicting the life, history and  aspirations

of  our people and our young but dynamic Republic. We

have   also  several  other  sub-committees   dealing

separately with the promotion of drama, art and other

subjects. The activities of all these committees will

come under the umbrella of the proposed Arts Council.

The  Government  has all along been  encouraging  the

promotion of healthy culture. We have not at any time

encouraged  yellow culture, if yellow  culture  means

things obscene or vulgar. But it is quite a different

thing   to  restrict  the  activities  of  a  private

individual; for instance, the call to ban. A-Go-Go or

asking people to cut their long hair.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lee, I must ask you to wind up in

about half a minute.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> The question is a question of

yardstick.  We are against anything that  is  obscene

and  vulgar. But we have to emphasise that the  right

to  differ is the essence of democracy. The moment  a

person  or  the Government demands the  privilege  of

shaping  others  to its image, taste,  its  likes  or

dislikes,  then  the whole essence  of  democracy  is

gone.  Our approach to cultural progress is  positive

and  not  negative. We intend to promote culture  and

accept  the challenge put forward by the other  side,

the so-called yellow culture.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 1003 be

reduced by $100.*



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Tang See Chim.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have two questions to raise under this head.

The  first  question is in connection with those  who

are  getting  public assistance. Once they  have  odd

jobs  or temporary jobs, at a piece rate or an hourly

rate,  will  their  public  assistance  allowance  be

reduced?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is, what is the total amount

allocated  for  public assistance, and  how  much  is

derived from public donations?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tang See Chim is not present.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> The present rate of public

assistance allowances is based on the means test and

takes  into  consideration any income earned  by  the

recipient. Where the income earned does not exceed  a

certain figure in certain circumstances, no deduction

will  be  made from the public assistance  allowance.

The following are the maximum



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>



incomes  allowed for public assistance recipients  in

various circumstances. Single person; maximum  income

allowed per month without reduction is $10 per month.

Recipient   with  one  dependant,  $15   per   month;

recipient  with not more than four dependants,  about

$20   per  month;  recipients  with  more  than  five

dependants,  $25 per month. Thus, in the  case  of  a

recipient who has five or more dependants, he will be

allowed  to earn about $25 per month in any part-time

job  or  odd job without having his public assistance

allowance  deducted.  There may,  however,  be  cases

where  special considerations apply and where it  may

be  possible  to  assist  the recipients  with  other

assistance outside the ambit of the public assistance

scheme.  For  example, a special grant may  be  given

from  the  Silver Jubilee Fund which  is  also  being

administered by the Social Welfare Department.  Every

such  case,  however, will be considered strictly  on

its  merits, and if the Member will refer such  cases

to me, they will be given due consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point, Sir, the Member wishes to know

the  amount of money from public donations for public

assistance.  I  am sorry I have not got  the  figures

available, but from last month's figures, the sum  of

money spent on public assistance is far less than  $1

million a month. I think it is slightly over $700,000

a month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why has so much money been allocated to this

and  firemen's quarters. Every attempt has been  made

to  cut  down  this item of expenditure  as  much  as

possible.  But it has been found that the expenditure

has  been  in the region of some $120,000 yearly.  In

1965  the expenditure was $126,000. Figures available

up  to  the  end  of October this year indicate  that

$119,000  has  already  been spent.  The  Chief  Fire

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Parks and Recreation Department

has  been  in existence since the colonial days.  Now

there  are  parks and recreation places  which  still

follow  the former policy, but these former  policies

cannot  be followed any more. The places I  refer  to

are  playgrounds in which many people gather to watch

games  or  sports,  or  for  the  purpose  of  seeing

television.  At  these places there  are  swings  and

seesaws,  and  accidents could occur.  The  reason  I

bring up this point is that the people of the Kampong

Kapor  Community  Centre have been bringing  up  this

matter  since  1964,  with a view  to  improving  the

facilities  at  the places and doing  away  with  the

swings  and seesaws, so that accidents can be reduced

and  the  children of these people who  watch  games,

sports  or  television  there  will  be  saved   from

accidents when playing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



on  the swings and seesaws. When these accidents

happen,   they  could  bring  about  misunderstanding

between  the parties concerned. So in order to  avoid

this,  the  swings  and  seesaws  should  be  removed

entirely.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, if the swings and seesaws are

a  source  of danger to the public, particularly  the

children,  I will direct the Chief Parks  Officer  to

look into the matter. If there is need for them to be

removed  from  the  children's  playground  near  the

Kampong Kapor Community Centre, we will move them  to

other children's playgrounds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have a Legal Aid Bureau which

is meant to give assistance to workers and people who

are in need of such aid. Before the establishment of

this Bureau, such people if they wanted to seek aid

from lawyers in legal matters, had to spend at least

several hundred dollars. At present, they need only

pay $1 to get legal advice from the Legal Aid Bureau.

This is one example of the Government's achievements

in helping our people. The achievements of the Legal

Aid Bureau have aroused great interest among the

people in South-East Asia. Certain legal officers

from Hong Kong came to Singapore recently to study

the achievements and administration of the Legal Aid

Bureau in order to learn from us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have received some complaints from people who

seek legal aid. They complain that sometimes the

Legal Aid Bureau does not do their work fast enough.

Sometimes people have to wait for more than eight

months before their complaints or cases can be dealt

with. So I would like to ask the Minister whether he

is aware of this situation and why this is so. Is it

because the Bureau is short-staffed? How many lawyers

are serving on this Bureau?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 1101 be

reduced by $100.*



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* See footnote at cols. 919-20)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for Law

whether  he  is  aware  that certain  disputes  arise

between tenants and developers in respect of rent and

whether  he intends to amend the present Rent Control

Ordinance  to  deal with the situation,  because  the

Government is at present encouraging the construction

of more houses by developers. He should be aware that

within  the purview of this law, removals  have  been

enforced  in  cases of disputes between  tenants  and

developers.  The  developers are  selling  houses  at

higher  prices,  and  so the tenants  want  a  higher

compensation.  Can  the  Ministry  institute   better

measures  to  deal with the situation? For  instance,

certain  tenants who have been asked to  remove  have

requested several hundreds of thousands of dollars as

compensation.  In  fact, this  is  only  a  one-sided

picture as presented by a certain section



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



of  the people. But, in fact, certain capitalists  or

land-owners make use of the procedure under  the  law

to  demolish houses without the payment of  a  single

cent to the tenants. There is a provision in the Rent

Control  Ordinance which says that all  houses  built

after  7th  September, 1947, will not be  subject  to

rent control and that those built before this date  -

but   not  in  cases  where  such  houses  have  been

demolished and re-built - will be protected  by  this

Ordinance.  So the developers usually resort  to  the

provisions in the Rent Control Ordinance to  put  the

tenants in an awkward position. Of course, there  are

some  cases  where the tenants request  an  excessive

amount  of money as compensation before they  remove.

All  these things contribute to the higher prices  of

houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that under the present Rent Control

Ordinance,  it  is  not  possible  to  settle   these

disputes because the tenants who are protected  under

this  Ordinance  take advantage of the  situation  by

asking  for excessive amounts of compensation  before

they  remove. On the other hand, those  who  are  not

protected under the law cannot get even a single cent

before they are forced Out of their homes. Therefore,

many  unpleasant events take place. I feel this is  a

very  grave social problem facing us. I do  not  know

whether  the  Minister  for  Law  can  formulate  any

legislation to prevent such events from taking place.

I  will go a step further and suggest - this has also

been  suggested by the Member for Choa Chu Kang  that

if  the Minister could set up an arbitration court on

rent  and land matters, I feel that the tenants  will

get  proper  and  adequate compensation.  The  Review

Board  can  look  into  rent  conciliation  and   the

problems  of  land resettlement. If the  Minister  is

agreeable  to  the  setting up of  such  a  Board  or

Committee,  a  Judge can be asked to be its  Chairman

and  the  members can consist of the Commissioner  of

Lands,  a  lawyer,  an architect, an  assessor  or  a

valuer.  Such a Board or Committee will  be  able  to

resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.  When

the parties concerned cannot come to a settlement,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



this  Board or Committee should be the final Tribunal

of  Appeal  and the parties concerned  will  have  to

abide  by its decision. Both parties should have  the

right  to  be legally represented before the Tribunal

and   the  developer  or  landlord  should  meet  any

expenses   for  survey  of  the  land.  The   housing

developers  should not be allowed to  chase  out  any

tenants before a decision is made by the Tribunal  or

before  the land is approved for development  by  the

authorities. I feel that it will be able to speed  up

development  and  contribute  towards  the   economic

development of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On matters relating to national development, I will

touch on them later.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head 1101

<br><br>Mr Tang See Chim is not here. Inche Mahmud.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wish  to  speak  on housing. I feel  that  Head  1108 - National  Development Division - has  no  connection

with  housing,  and that is why my amendment  appears

under Head 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if applicants apply for one-room

fiats, or if they want alternative flats, or if  they

want   flats  to  be  provided  earlier,  and   these

applications cannot be met, is there a directive from

the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary that they

should  be given two-room flats instead? A number  of

such incidents have been reported to me. A person who

needed  a  one-room unit was given  a  two-room  unit

instead.  An  applicant for an alternative  flat  was

given a two-room unit instead. I feel that this is  a

wrong procedure.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir.  The  hon. Member for Kampong Kapor  is  talking

about a problem that concerns the Housing Board. This

does  not  come under the Head we are now discussing.

Perhaps he can bring this matter up when we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>



come to the Head National Development Division.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Member did explain that he

found no Head for housing under National Development.

Actually  all  matters relating to the Housing  Board

should  properly come under the vote for  Subsidy  to

Housing  and  Development Board in  the  Ministry  of

Finance.  I  do not want to shut out discussion,  but

Ministers  have  come prepared to meet  questions  on

certain  departments, and it will  be  difficult  for

them to answer matters not within their province  for

which they are not prepared for today's debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Inche Mahmud, I am afraid that if you are

speaking  on  housing, then very reluctantly  I  will

have to rule you out of order.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): May I relate the

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Minister only gives

general  directions to the Housing Board and  he  can

also  request  information from them. But  since  the

Government  is  not asking for any money  under  this

Head  to pay to the Housing Board, I am afraid I must

rule  you out of order, Inche Mahmud. In fact, I seem

to recall that at the last sitting, or the one before

where the vote for Subsidy to Housing and Development

Board was part of the Estimates, Members did speak on

the  Housing  Board and the Minister for Finance  did

answer  the  queries.  Perhaps you  could  take  your

matter  up-under some other device at a  later  date.

Mahmud Awang.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

merely wish to know whether or not I can relate  this

matter   to   the   pay  of  the  Minister   or   the

Parliamentary Secretary responsible for  the  Housing

and Development Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am afraid not, because the Minister

is  not  answerable for the Board. He can  only  give

them general directions under the Ordinance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>



and  he can also ask them to furnish information, but

he    is   not   responsible   for   the   day-to-day

administration or routine matters like allocation and

size  of flats. This should properly have come  under

the  vote  for  Subsidy  to Housing  and  Development

Board.  In other words, even if you succeed  in  your

vote here, the Minister will be unaffected because be

is not asking for any money for the Housing Board.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): That being the case,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will not  pursue  the  matter

further.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Ulu

Pandan has referred to disputes between landlords and

tenants.  He  has  referred to the  Control  of  Rent

Ordinance which protects tenants who occupy buildings

built  before  the 7th day of September,  1947,  and

which  does not protect tenants who occupy  buildings

built after that date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Members of this House will

remember  that  when this Government  first  came  to

power on the 31st of May. 1959, two provisions of the

Control  of  Rent  Ordinance were suspended,  namely,

section 15 (1) (i) and section 15 (1) (k) . Section 15

(1)  (i)  dealt with cases where the premises consist

in  whole or in part of a building or buildings of  a

temporary character, and the site thereof is required

by  the  landlord for the erection of a  building  or

buildings  of a permanent character for  which  plans

have  been  approved by the local authority;  or  the

site  thereof  is  required by the landlord  for  any

purpose which forms an essential part of any building

plan  or  project of a permanent character for  which

plans have been approved by the local authority.  The

next  paragraph  (k)  dealt  with  cases  where   the

landlord  of  any  premises intends to  demolish  the

premises  or  any  part thereof for  the  purpose  of

rebuilding on the site or part thereof, and the Court

is satisfied that such demolition is necessary in the

interests of public health or town improvement either

by  reason  of  the  condition  of  the  building  or

otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may repeat myself, both

paragraphs (i) and (k) have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>



been suspended. I have received many a representation

from  building developers saying that it is time  for

this  suspension to be lifted and to make  these  two

paragraphs   law   again.  I   have   also   received

representations from developers suggesting  that  the

Control  of Rent Ordinance should be limited  in  its

operation  to  certain specific areas  in  the  city,

namely,  the  town area. On the other  hand,  as  the

Member for Ulu Pandan has pointed out, where a tenant

is  not  protected by the Control of Rent  Ordinance,

the  landlord can evict him without any compensation.

This is one end of the stick. The other is where  the

tenant  is protected by the Control of Rent Ordinance

and holds the landlord to blackmail. I have heard  of

a case where a tenant occupying a small hut asked for

compensation  to  the  tune  of  $200,000  from   the

building developer who, of course, was not willing to

pay  that sum. The net result is that we are  at  the

moment considering the implications of the Control of

Rent  Ordinance. We are also considering the  setting

up  of  a  tribunal  to  look into  the  question  of

providing   adequate  compensation  for  tenants   or

squatters who are evicted whether or not the premises

are controlled premises or uncontrolled premises. Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  that deals with the  Member  for  Ulu

Pandan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kapor was a little worried

about two-room flats being offered to people who  ask

for  one-room flats. You have ruled him out of order,

Mr Speaker, but with your permission I would like to

say a few words in reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Barker, since I have ruled the

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, on the

estimates  for  the  Ministry  of  Law  and  National

Development  which is under discussion now,  I  would

like  to  take the opportunity to ask a few questions

of  the  Minister. Singapore is at the present moment

practising parliamentary democracy. Our nation is run

on  this  system,  and  so the  Ministry  of  Law  is

responsible  for  the satisfactory implementation  of

the democratic system. Not very long ago certain anti-national  elements tried to undermine our  democratic

system  in  Singapore. But I do not know whether  the

Minister  for Law has made any Ministerial  statement

to  explain the spirit in which Singapore is building

its  own  nation. This is, of course, regrettable.  I

also  know that in taking action against the  anti-national   elements,  our  Minister  of  Defence   is

directly  responsible. I appreciate this fact.  So  I

cannot  blame the Minister for Law too much  for  not

explaining  the  legal aspects of the  constitutional

position  under a democratic system. But at  least  I

believe that within the ambit of the law we can  take

legislative  action to allow our own people  to  show

their love for the nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that we have a national anthem in

Singapore.  When  it is played in some  cinemas,  for

example,   it  is  encouraging  to  note  that   many

spectators  of  their own accord stand at  attention.

But  there  are  still some who refuse  to  stand  at

attention when it is played. Worst of all, some anti-national elements do not bother to stand up  at  all.

When the national anthem is played, influence is  not

exerted  on the anti-national elements to  make  them

respect  the  anthem.  I  do not  know  whether  some

legislative measures can be taken to see that this is

done  so  that we may have patriotism all  round.  Of

course, I believe that we cannot create patriotism by

punishment, but, on the other hand,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>



we must not overlook the fact that we must have some

legal restrictions.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I find it difficult to see the

connection between your remarks and the Minister  for

appropriate  for the Ministry of Culture  for  having

failed to build that body of knowledge and patriotism

where the audience in the cinemas stands up when  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister

certain questions under this head. We have noted that

the land policy announced in the P.A.P, manifesto has

not  been  resolutely adhered to. In  the  past,  the

colonial  Government paid more attention to  the  big

landlords.  It  did not frame any definite  equitable

policy on land. When they drew up the Master Plan for

Singapore,  it  was  so drawn  up  that  the  general

interest of the public was sacrificed to satisfy  the

big  landlords. This unrealistic Master Plan has been

amended from time to time. But what is the extent  of

the  amendments that would make them more  beneficial

to  the general public? At the present moment, it  is

said  that  there  is  not enough  land  to  resettle

farmers,   or  to  allocate  land  for   some   other

construction  purposes. But I do not  understand  why

there  are  still vast areas of vacant land available

which  are  not  acquired by the Government  for  the

purposes I have mentioned. Some vacant plots of  land

are  used  as  play  grounds. Some are  reserved  for

unknown  purposes. I would like to ask  the  Minister

whether it is possible to make full and better use of

the  existing vacant lands for construction  purposes

or to resettle evicted persons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Delta

has   referred  to  the  P.A.P. manifesto,  and  has

condemned the colonial Government for supporting  big

landlords.  I  wonder whether she believes  that  the

P.A.P. today  is  supporting big landlords.  If  she

believes this, then I would refer her to the deletion

from  our  Constitution,  since  the  separation,  of

Article 13 of the Constitution of Malaysia which only

provided  for  acquisition of land  with  payment  of

adequate  compensation. I may say here that  we  have

deleted  Article  13  and we  have  no  intention  of

restoring it to the Constitution in its present  form

or in its amended form.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Master Plan, she says again that it was

drawn up to satisfy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



big landlords, that it has been amended from time to

time, but that the amendments have been few. I cannot

agree  that  the  Master Plan has been  drawn  up  to

satisfy the big landlords.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She refers to vast areas of lands which have been

somewhat  sterilised  for development.  This  is  the

green  belt. She asks why such lands are not acquired

for  resettlement or put to better use. Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  the  answer  is simple. In an urban  town  like

Singapore,  one  must have a green area  around.  One

must   reserve  land  for  future  development.   The

Government  is not looking five years  or  ten  years

ahead.  Being a responsible Government, we must  look

30  years or 40 years ahead, and when the time comes,

we  must have land available for the requirements  of

that  age.  When the Member for Delta says  that  the

declaration  of  land as a green belt sterilises  the

land,  this is not completely true. Green belt  lands

can  be  used  for farming. One cannot put  up  flats

there, but, besides farming, green belt lands can  be

used, as the Member has pointed out, for recreational

purposes or institutional purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarise then. Green belt lands serve the

following useful purposes. They are used or  reserved

for essential purposes, such as farming, recreational

and institutional purposes. The uses allowed in green

belt  lands are light type of uses and afford  relief

in  a  situation where development is not only  urban

but  intensively urban. Lastly, green belt lands hold

scarce lands in reserve for much more intensive  uses

should the future requirements of the Republic demand

this.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  agree with what the Minister has  said  just

now,  but as regards the questions I have asked  just

now   about  lands  which  are  reserved  for  future

purposes,  his  reply  is that these  lands  will  be

reserved for some future use. I agree to this, but  I

would  like to know whether he can answer me on  this

point. There are certain areas in Singapore which are

not  reserved  but are used as recreational  grounds.

These playgrounds are not under the control



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>



of the Government, such as a sports stadium. They are

under  private  control  for  private  benefit,   for

example, amusement parks. Why are they not under  the

control of Government and put to better use?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> This appears to be Question Time once

again!  The  acquisition of, say, the New World,  the

Great World, or the Gay World is surely not going  to

solve  our land problem in Singapore. These  are  not

green belt areas. What the Member is worried about is

this. She asks why certain lands are not acquired  by

the  Government  for  resettlement  of  farmers.  The

answer  is  this. We have enough land for farmers  as

long  as  these farmers are given not more  than  two

acres, and for the moment we do not find it necessary

to  acquire  more private lands for the  purposes  of

resettlement. I say for the moment only. We may  have

to acquire more land in the very near future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, motorists seem to be the worst hit

these days. I would like to inquire from the Minister

whether  there is a policy governing the  development

of  car  parks, whether the policy of the  Car  Parks

Division is to raise more revenue for the Government,

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>



whether  this  Division is to  regulate  the  use  of

parking places so that everyone can get a fair  share

in  using  the place and proper control is exercised.

Also, what is the policy governing the taking-over of

streets or roads to be marked out for car parks?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> As the Member for River Valley has put

it,  it is the motorists who are being hit today. But

I  wonder  whether he is referring to my Ministry  or

that  of  the Minister for Finance who has upped  the

licence fees and upped the road taxes that car owners

have  to pay. The Member wants to know whether  there

is  a policy for car parks. The answer is yes, and it

is  this. Our problem is that there are more and more

motor-cars,  motor-bikes,  motor-lorries  and   other

vehicles  on our roads. A situation has been  reached

where  it  is difficult to find car parking space  in

the  city. It is for this reason that the charges for

car  parking have been increased. Otherwise, it would

be difficult for motorists going into town to find  a

car  parking space. Our policy is not to make  money.

We  increase the fees not with that object  in  mind,

but  to  enable as many motorists as possible to  get

car parking spaces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two types of car parks. One in multi-storey buildings, like the Multi-storey Car Park, and

the  other  is  the Underground Car Park  at  Raffles

Place.  Both these car parks are about 100  per  cent

full  on  two  or  three days of  the  week,  namely,

Wednesdays and Saturdays, and about 90 per cent  full

on  other  days.  We hope to build  more  car  parks,

either  multi-storey or underground, and we  have  in

mind  Colombo Court behind City Hall. We hope to pull

down  the  old building there and put up  car  parks.

But, as is usual, we are meeting with resistance from

tenants  who  refuse to move. We also hope  to  build

more  car  parks in open spaces, and we have  one  in

mind along the "Golden Mile" at Nicoll Highway.

Many  a Parliamentarian has received complaints  from

car  parks in various areas in their constituency.  I

have had many of these complaints and I have directed

the  Superintendent of the Car Parks Division not  to

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not a

provision just in respect of temporary staff in  view

of  new  car parks being built. The fact is that  the

great majority of the staff in the Car Parks Division

are  employed on a temporary basis. In fact, all  the

car  parking attendants are not permanent. The reason

is  this. We feel that this is not a job which is the

beginning and the end of the particular employee.  We

created  the job and kept it temporary in order  that

the   employee  can  improve  himself,  probably   by

studying  at  night, and hope for  better  things  to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to inquire why is it

that the Director of Public Works is drawing less

money than that of the Deputy Director?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a good

explanation  for  this.  The  Estimates  are   rather

confusing  and today Members have moved  under  wrong

heads.  Here  the  Member  for  River  Valley  has  a

legitimate question. On the surface of the Estimates,

the  Director of Public Works appears to  be  drawing

only  $11,700 a year and his Deputy Director $21,240.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I am glad to say that the post  of

Director  of  Public Works brings to the  person  who

holds the post much more than $11,700. In fact,  much

more than $21,240. But, at the moment, we have no one

who  is  in  the  permanent position of  Director  of

Public Works and we do not expect that the post  will

be filled next year. So we have made no provision for

the  salary  of  the Director. What  appears  in  the

Estimates  is, in fact, the total sum  of  the  extra

emoluments  which will be paid to those  who  act  in

substantive positions. For example, today the  Deputy

Director  of  Public Works is acting as Director.  In

addition  to his salary of $21,240, he will  be  paid

the  difference  in basic salary between  his  acting

post  and  his  permanent post divided  by  two.  The

Director  of Public Works, in fact, is paid  a  basic

salary  of $1,950. The Deputy Director is paid $1,770

basic.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>



When the Deputy Director acts as Director, he is paid

the difference between those two sums divided by two,

roughly  $90 a month more. In the same way, when  the

Deputy  Director acts as Director, someone below  him

will be acting as the Deputy Director and he will  be

entitled  to an acting allowance. And it  goes  right

down.  The  sum  of $11,700 is to make provision  for

these acting allowances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Public Works Department has

carried  out  satisfactory work in  the  building  of

roads, bridges and sewerage projects in various parts

of Singapore. But some defects have appeared and I do

not  know  whether it is the fault of the Department.

Let me give some examples. Certain projects have, all

of a sudden, been stopped. Work on Ulu Sembawang Road

began  in  September and when I passed by that  place

one day - and it was not on a Sunday - I saw heaps of

rubbish piled up and no workers in sight. This  is  a

very   unsatisfactory  situation  because   it   will

obstruct the flow of traffic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also found that some parts of Sun Loong Road

in Sembawang, which was completed in October, are now -  a  period of a little over one month -  in  a  bad

state. I have already written to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>



Chairman  of  the Urban and Rural Services  Committee

requesting  him  to investigate the matter.  I  would

like  to  ask  the  Minister why so many  holes  have

appeared  in  the  road and why  certain  parts  have

collapsed after only a period of one month since  the

road  was  completed. Is this due to malpractices  on

the part of the contractors?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that certain projects have been

delayed  for some time. For instance, in some  areas,

including  Sembawang,  the  construction  of  certain

roads  was  approved but these projects were  started

only  one year after approval. From the point of view

of  our efficient Government, the rate of progress is

not  very  quick.  So I hope that the  Minister  will

instruct the department concerned to investigate  the

reasons  for this delay and take immediate  steps  to

remedy the situation in order that the department can

keep up its good work.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,

did  not  do  a good job of it. I can say  that  this

complaint  s now under investigation and  the  Public

Works  Department  will submit  a  report  after  the

proper action will be taken against this contractor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can inform the Member for Sembawang that in the

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I think the

Parliamentary   Secretary  did  not   understand   my

already  started and that they were stopped half-way.

That is quite different from work on certain projects

which was not started until one year after approval.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> I will speak in Mandarin. (In

approval of the projects, the engineers have to  plan

and   consider   what  materials  are  required   and

advertisements  are put out calling  for  tenders  to

build the projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the delay of one year, this is not a

frequent occurrence. If the Member for Sembawang  can

give   me   more  specific  information   about   the

construction of roads which has been delayed for more

than  one  year,  I  will be glad to  look  into  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have received several complaints about the

work carried out by the Building Survey Division, and

I  would  like  to bring them to the  notice  of  the

Minister.  For  instance, the  approval  of  building

plans  is  delayed for a long time.  A  Malay  in  my

constituency applied in March or April last year  for

a  permit  to  build  a house at  the  place  he  was

staying.  He has not received any reply  for  over  a

year  now, and the Building Survey Division  has  not

even  sent  anybody to inspect the site or  take  any

steps to deal with the application. I came to know of

this  when  I  toured my constituency in  April  this

year.  I  was  surprised  to  hear  this  from   this

particular Malay who complained to me. It  is  rather

surprising  and unexpected to know that the  approval

of  building plans can be delayed for more  than  one

year  by the Building Survey Division, which is under

the   control   and   management  of   an   efficient

Government!  On hearing this complaint, I immediately

contacted the head of the Division and found that  it

was  true.  He  told me that he would take  immediate

steps to send some people over to investigate. Two or

three weeks later, the application of this particular

Malay was approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the example given by me is only one of many

similar   cases  that  happen.  We  know  that   many

villagers are ignorant of the procedures with  regard

to  applications for building permits.  They  do  not

know  these  procedures unless they  are  advised  by

those  who  are in the know. So I hope  the  Minister

will   pay   attention  to  this  matter   and   take

appropriate steps to remedy the situation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been complaints by certain people

about  the arrogant and superior attitude adopted  by

building  inspectors  towards  them.  These  building

inspectors  sometimes purposely try to embarrass  the

people.  Could  this be because they want  to  obtain

extra benefit from their work? Now that is a very bad

sign  and  I  hope the Minister will take the  proper

steps to remedy the situation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Member for Sembawang has just now mentioned  the

delay  in  the  approval  of building  plans  by  the

Building  Survey Division. I think it is  necessary

to  give him a rough picture of the Division. In this

Division  there  are at present 18  officers  dealing

with  applications for the rebuilding of  houses  and

applications for temporary buildings. Twelve of  them

are  in  charge  of the rural areas and  six  are  in

from the rural areas. Therefore, each officer has  to

deal with about six applications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant has, first of all, to get a permit

from  the  landlord and, secondly, to submit  a  plan

showing  the nature of reconstruction as against  the

original  plan.  If these two requirements  are  met,

then  the  application will be approved very quickly.

Normally  rural  folks  do not quite  understand  the

procedure.  They  merely  submit  a  letter  to   the

officers  concerned, saying that they want to  repair

their houses, without even getting the consent of the

landlord. And in cases where they get the consent  of

the landlord, they do not submit plans. Sometimes the

plans  do not meet the specifications and, therefore,

the  officers concerned ask the applicants to  submit

amended  plans,  which is not done in  time  for  the

consideration  of the Division. Therefore,  there  is

inevitably  some delay in the process. Sometimes  the

addresses of the applicants are not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



clearly  written;  thus  building  inspectors  cannot

locate  the  addresses. Moreover  the  addresses,  if

given correctly, are found to be situated in far  out

of  the  way places and cannot be located. Therefore,

the officers want the applicants to appoint a time to

enable  the  officers to visit the places  concerned.

For  these  various reasons, delay is inevitable  and

naturally gives rise to complaints.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the particular case complained of, I feel

that  it  is  an isolated case, but I can assure  the

Member  that we have already instructed the  Building

Survey  Division  not to delay such applications  for

too  long  and that they should, as far as  possible,

speed  up  action  and  deal  with  the  applications

promptly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also raised the point

about   the   arrogant  attitude  of   the   building

inspectors towards the rural people. I feel that such

an  accusation  is rather general. However,  I  shall

instruct  the  Division to take  immediate  steps  to

remedy  the  situation. No doubt  there  may  be  com

plaints in the Sembawang Constituency, but the Member

for  Sembawang should have noted down the date,  time

and  place  of  the occurrence and, if possible,  the

names   of   the  officers  responsible.  With   such

information  available,  I can  then  look  into  the

matter,  and  if it is found that such an  occurrence

did   take   place,  then  our  Ministry  will   take

disciplinary action against those officers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  should  say  that the answer  given  by  the

Parliamentary   Secretary  is  only   60   per   cent

satisfactory, and the remaining part is  inconsistent

and  contradictory  in  nature.  About  the  arrogant

attitude  of the building inspectors, he has admitted

that the complaints have been quite general.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Point of clarification, Sir,I

distorting his answer. If he felt that the  complaint

was quite general, then why did he not take steps  to

investigate  it? So I feel that his answer  is  quite

contradictory in that respect. But, on the  whole,  I

am  quite  satisfied with his answer, and I therefore

would like to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1112 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 1112 be

reduced by $100.*



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr Tang See Chim and Inche Mahmud Awang.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the work of this Planning Department, if I am

not wrong, is based on the Singapore Master Plan.  We

know  that  the Master Plan has to be reviewed  every

five  years  in order to incorporate certain  changes

and  adjustments which are made to keep up  with  the

changing conditions. I feel that it is only right and

proper   to  do  so.  But  I  also  know  that   such

adjustments or reviews are mainly concerned with  the

major  aspects  of the- plan. For instance,  sometime

this  year - I cannot remember which month it  was  -

the  Master  Plan after a review was made public  for

the  people  to  inspect. But  this  review  was  not

publicised  as widely as possible so that  the  rural

folks  could  also come to inspect it. For  instance,

about  a few years ago certain marshy lands were  not

suitable  for use in the Master Plan, and  they  were

marked out as marshy lands. But after ten years  such

a  situation no longer holds true, because after  the

land owners and developers had developed the land, it

became housing estates. But this improvement was  not

noted in the plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land between the 13th and 15th mile of my

constituency  is a good example of this  improvement.

The  urban  land  between these  two  milestones  has

already  been developed, and yet it is still depicted

as marshy land in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>



Master Plan. This is ridiculous. And there are  other

places, similarly improved, which are depicted in the

Master Plan as green belt areas, which means that the

land cannot be used for development purposes. But, in

actual  fact, these lands have already been developed

as  housing  estates  and there  are  also  community

centres  set up in such areas, in spite of  the  fact

that  some of the houses are illegal structures,  and

have  been in existence for many years, and they  are

still  depicted  as green belt areas  in  the  Master

Plan.  And  when  some people apply  for  permits  to

develop  such  lands, they are told by  the  officers

that  these areas are green belt areas or barren land

and approval cannot be given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under these circumstances, I hope the Minister will

pay  more  attention to this matter and instruct  the

officers  to go to the spot to investigate  if  there

have  been  any changes. I would like to  advise  the

officers  to  go to the East Coast in  Kallang  Basin

just  to see what development has already taken place

there.  Former certain stretches of beaches have  now

been  developed  into  housing estates,  and  if  the

officers  do not go to the sites to make  an  on-the-spot  investigation,  they will  not  know  the  real

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Minister should pay attention to

what  I  have  suggested  and  try  to  improve   the

situation,  so  that applications for development  in

green  belt  areas and vacant land  can  be  approved

expeditiously.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I just want to

interpose  to  find out whether there is  any  yellow

culture  in this green belt area.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If the Member is

interested,  he  should go there to see  for  himself

whether or not there is any yellow culture.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> In reply to the Member for

Sembawang, I just want to remind him that my Minister

has just now given a very good answer about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



the green belts, open space and reserved space in the

Master  Plan. So there is no need for sue  to  repeat

it. It is true that in the Master Plan there is a new

town,  but  at  the  moment the  plan  has  not  been

implemented.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The

Parliamentary Secretary has not given me satisfactory

answers  to the questions I have asked. I  have  said

just  now  that  certain green belt areas  have  been

changed  into housing estates. I have also said  that

if  the officers concerned should go to the sites  to

make  on-the-spot investigations, they will find that

many  places  have been changed into housing  estates

and  not  as  depicted  in the Master  Plan.  If  the

Parliamentary Secretary is interested, I  will  bring

him round to see such places and he will know whether

what I say is true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what the

Member for Sembawang wishes to know is why green belt

areas can become housing estates and some green  belt

areas  cannot  be  developed. A green  belt  area  is

mainly  reserved for future development which  is  to

meet  our  increasing population in the years  ahead.

For  instance,  we reserve certain  areas  for  green

belt, so that in 10 or 20 years' time these areas may

be  developed  as  housing estates;  or  a  hospital,

school,  clinic and roads or some other projects  may

be  built  there.  So there is no  point  in  arguing

further  as  to  why  some green belt  areas  can  be

developed and some cannot.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  do  not mean to argue with the Parliamentary

Secretary on this matter. But it is my duty to  bring

this  situation to the notice of this House  so  that

the  Minister  will  pay attention  to  what  I  have

mentioned. For instance, take a certain area. Part of

it  is  green  belt which is made into a  development

area, and part of it is not approved as a development

area. This is not fair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I do not wish to prolong

unnecessarily the sitting today. There  are  only  25

minutes more. I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



been  listening  with patience.  Sir,  I  think  town

planning generally is a long-term policy which cannot

be realised in a short period of three to five years.

In deciding on the zoning of a certain area, the town

planner  must  take into consideration  the  possible

development  and the shape of things to come  in  the

next  10,  20  or even 30 years. It is not  possible,

once  you have decided on the zoning for a particular

area, to have it implemented forthwith. I should like

to  quote one example for the rural area, and another

example for the city area. If you look at the  island

map  of  the Master Plan, you will notice  there  are

four  types of maps - the island map, the  town  map,

the  central area map, and the central area programme

map.  If  you look at the island map, you  will  find

that certain parts of land are zoned as green belt or

open  space, and yet when you go down to  the  actual

site,  it is all occupied by either squatters,  or  a

portion  of  it may be even occupied by  one  or  two

permanent  structures. That does not mean  that  once

you  zone a piece of land as green belt, then all the

squatters   there   and   even   the   semi-permanent

structures  there must be demolished  forthwith,  and

the whole area turned into a green belt. The idea  is

to  reserve  that piece of land, as my colleague  has

pointed out earlier, for possible future development,

and  also  to  provide sufficient green area  in  the

Republic  to serve as lungs for the people.  That  is

why green belts and open spaces are demarcated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the town map, there are certain areas

which  are zoned as shopping areas, but when  you  go

down  to the actual site and carry out a survey, that

particular  piece of land may be full of  residential

houses.  The idea is that in the next 5 or 10  years,

in  the  event of urban renewal or if the land  owner

wishes  to demolish a block of buildings to  rebuild,

then  he must comply with the Master Plan provisions,

and  that  is  to  use that piece of  land  to  erect

premises for shopping purposes. As I have said,  town

planning  is  a  long-term  policy  which  cannot  be

achieved even in 20 years. I am not aware of areas in

the Master Plan zoned as swamps as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



suggested by the Member for Sembawang. I do  know  of

some  un-fixed  zoning and they are areas  which  are

shown  as  white in the Master Plan and are known  as

"undetermined use", but I am not aware  of  any  area

that is used for swamps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member has referred particularly to the

east  coast.  I take it that he is referring  to  the

Bedok  reclamation  area and the Kallang  Basin.  The

reclamation at Bedok and the Kallang Basin is carried

out with the full knowledge of Government. It is part

of  a  scheme by Government, in conjunction with  the

Planning Department, to reclaim land. This is totally

irrelevant  to  the  subject  under  discussion.  The

Member has said that a green belt area two years  ago

was so designated as a green belt area and now it  is

all filled with houses. The reason is that one of two

things might have happened. One, there must have been

a re-zoning of that particular area whereby they have

permitted  residential or other forms of  development

in  the  green belt area, or houses might  have  been

erected there without the approval of the Government.

If  that  is  the case, they are more  likely  to  be

squatters who have erected temporary structures.  But

it  is  not possible to have an area zoned as a green

belt  and then suddenly over a period of three  years

you find a new housing estate springing up there.  By

a  new housing estate, I take it that the Member  for

Sembawang  means permanent structures like  bungalows

or  semi-detached bungalows and terrace houses. It is

not possible, Mr Speaker, Sir. There is provision in

the Planning Ordinance - I think it is No. 12 of 1959

-  to  allow  the  Minister to waive  certain  zoning

requirements  for a certain piece of land;  in  other

words, to exempt the planning provision applicable to

this  piece of land. In short, if a piece of land  is

zoned  as a shopping area and if an application comes

in  for  the  erection of buildings  for  residential

purposes  and  if  the Minister, after  weighing  the

circumstances, decides that it is more beneficial  to

have   this  piece  of  land  for  the  erection   of

residential   premises,  then  he  will   waive   the

requirements under the Master Plan that this piece of

land



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>



must  be  used  for shopping purposes. So  there  are

sufficient  provisions  in the  law  to  enable  some

degree  of flexibility so as not to hamper the proper

and  justified  development for the  benefit  of  the

Republic  and  for the benefit of our economy.  I  am

surprised  the  Member  for  Sembawang  has  put   up

instances   like  that,  it  is  very  difficult   to

understand what exactly he has in his mind.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  think it is not necessary for  me  to  argue

further.  But  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the

Minister  for  Culture seems to be  overstepping  his

bounds  by  dealing with a matter which concerns  the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  National

Development.  Perhaps he was once an officer  in  the

Planning  Section and, therefore, is quite conversant

with the work in this division.
