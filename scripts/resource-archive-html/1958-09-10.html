<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  steps I propose to take will be precisely the same

as  those  I  am  taking now. The provision  of  public

housing  is  regulated  by the availability  of  funds,

staff and sites available for development. Taking these

factors



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



into  account,  the  production of  houses  for  public

accommodation  by the Singapore Improvement  Trust  has

proceeded as rapidly as possible. The intention of this

Government is to concentrate all the resources that can

be  spared into building housing accommodation only for

the  lower  income groups for which private  enterprise

will  not  provide.  Government is  spending,  Sir,  an

estimated total of $23 million on such housing in 1958.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Sir, is the Minister aware that the

number  of people on the waiting list for Trust  houses

is steadily increasing?

<div align="center"><b>RICE STOCKPILE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Request for Statement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr William Tan</b> asked the Minister for Commerce

and  Industry if he will make a statement regarding the

rice stockpile.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad to

avail myself of this opportunity to make a statement on

the rice stockpile though I am sure that most of what I

am going to say is already well known to hon. Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stockpile of rice is part of the Singapore

defence scheme and is maintained in the island to cover

an  emergency.  I am sure hon. Members will  appreciate

that  it is imperative that Government should be  in  a

position  to  issue  rice to  the  public  and  to  the

essential services in the event of any emergency either

here  or  in the rice producing countries which results

in  a  temporary shortage of rice. I might add here  in

passing  that  the Federation of Malaya  also  holds  a

similar stockpile.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic principle behind the stockpile is to ensure

that   adequate  supplies  of  fresh  rice  are  always

available. It is necessary therefore that the stockpile

be rotated and this is achieved by requiring



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>



importers  of  rice for local sale  to  purchase  a

certain  amount  from  the  stockpile  on  a  ratio

depending on the grade of rice. The ratio is two to

one  for imported whole-grain rice and three to one

for broken rice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be readily seen that the whole success of

this  stockpile  scheme  is  dependent  on  regular

rotation  of  the stockpile to ensure freshness  of

the rice. A new scheme has been introduced recently

which aims at a minimum off take from the stockpile

of  2,500 tons per month. This will operate  for  a

trial period of four months. Most importers of rice

have  individually  undertaken  to  draw  from  the

stockpile up to a total of 2,500 tons a month.  The

principal   association  of   rice   importers   in

Singapore  has  also collectively  guaranteed  that

offtake would not fall below the minimum figure  of

2,500  tons per month. This measure of co-operation

by  the  trade will assist both the trade  and  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a concession to those importers of whole grain

Thailand rice who have given this undertaking, they

will  be permitted to import up to three times  the

quantity  which  they have undertaken  to  purchase

from  the stockpile. Hon. Members will observe that

the  effect  of  this concession is  to  lower  the

stockpile obligations of the importers from two  to

one for whole grain and three to one for brokens to

a  flat  rate  of three to one. Additional  imports

from  Thailand  and  from  other  sources  will  be

subject to the normal stockpile requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should conclude here by repeating that the

stockpile  is operated strictly on a "no profit  no

loss" basis.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Sir, can the Minister give us

the  percentage  of rice which has deteriorated  in

the  stockpile? I was told that as some of the rice

could  not  be  moved  out, a very  large  quantity

deteriorated.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> As far as I know, there has

been  no  large  scale deterioration  of  rice  but

deterioration  could have set in if Government  had

not taken this action to keep the stockpile moving.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Can the Minister explain why

although  the  price of Chinese  rice  imported  is

cheaper  by  about  ten cents a  katty  it  is  not

included in the stockpile?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the preference of the

consumers  in  Singapore has always been  expressed

for  Thailand rice and Government has always bought

for  the  stockpile a bigger quantity  of  Thailand

rice.  In fact after I became Minister for Commerce

and  industry I tried to introduce other rice, that

is,  Burma rice and Saigon rice, and we had trouble

with  importers here who were forced  to  take  the

other  grades  of  rice.  However,  we  are  slowly

putting into the market rice besides Thailand  rice

but  still the greater bulk of rice that Government

holds  is  Thailand  rice  because  of  the  strong

consumer   preference.  China  has  only   recently

entered into the rice market and the quality of the

Chinese rice, I am afraid, is still unknown to  the

Government as to its keeping qualities, and  so  on

and  therefore Government has not thought of buying

China rice up to now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Siak Kew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Siak Kew:</b> Can the Minister inform us of

the quantity of the stockpile and the proportion of

Saigon  rice  to  Thailand  rice  taken  from  that

stockpile?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I have the figures of the

stockpile  holdings but I am afraid that  it  would

not  be  right for me to disclose those figures  as

stockpile   holdings  are  secret.   However,   the

quantity  of Saigon rice released in proportion  to

Thailand  rice depends on the quantity of  holdings

of Saigon rice by the Government stockpile. For the

moment, we have about 4,000 tons of Saigon rice and

since  it was of an earlier import date, we  wanted

to   release   this   quickly   before   it   could

deteriorate. However, we came to an agreement  with

the merchants only yesterday that they will get  80

per cent Saigon rice and 20 per cent Thailand rice,

only  for  such a period until the Saigon  rice  is

finished. I expect the Saigon rice will be finished

in the course of the next month or so and then they

will get mostly Thailand rice.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, though

Government welcomes investment in the industrial  field

from   individual  financiers  and  groups  with  large

capital  resources, Government feels that the time  has

come  when  the  people  as a  whole  should  not  only

directly  participate  in but  also  benefit  by  their

country's  industrial development. Government  realises

that  the working man and woman in Singapore has up  to

now  had  very  little  opportunity  or  incentive   to

actively participate in the ownership of industries and

to  benefit therefrom. Government therefore feels  that

it  is  not  only  necessary but also the  duty  of  an

elected  Socialist  Government to actively  assist  the

people in owning and opening some industries which  are

profitable  because they produce goods  needed  by  the

vast  majority of the population. Such ownership should

not  be  by  the  State with publie  funds  but  rather

directly by the people on an individual basis  so  that

every individual shareholder benefits directly from the

profits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve this purpose, Government proposes

to  set  up a People's Sector in industry, and some  of

the  industries which produce goods needed by the  vast

majority  of  the people and are therefore  a  portable

proposition will be reserved for this Sector  in  which

at  least  51  per  cent of the shares  shall  be  held

locally.  Holding of these shares is intended  for  the

working man and woman on an individual basis or for the

Government's Industrial Promotion Board. No large local

shareholding from this percentage will be allowed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to organize the working man and woman for

the  new  role  of  industrial  ownership,  a  People's

Investment  Corporation will be set up with  shares  at

$10  each  to  enable every working man  and  woman  to

participate by owning at least one $10 share. In  order

that the Corporation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



is really an organization of the people and is

not  monopolised by a few big shareholders,  no  person

shall be allowed to hold more than 50 shares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially, as the first target, it is proposed to

reserve  the further manufacture of cigarettes and  the

manufacture  of matches in Singapore for  the  People's

Sector,   and  as  soon  as  the  People's   Investment

Corporation has sufficient finances, it will be invited

by  the  Government's  Industrial  Promotion  Board  to

participate  in the setting up of a People's  Cigarette

Factory with an investment of 49 per cent. Government's

Industrial  Promotion Board will hold 2 per  cent,  and

outside  manufacturers of cigarettes  of  only  popular

brands would be invited to contribute up to 49 per cent

and  to  manufacture cigarettes of their popular brands

and  to  supply the technical know how. If such outside

manufacturers are not willing to join in the  proposal,

the  remaining shares in the People's Cigarette Factory

will  be  taken  up by the Industrial Promotion  Board.

Restriction will be placed on the import of  cigarettes



as soon as the factory starts production. It is not the

intention  of  Government to restrict the operation  of

existing  Singapore cigarette factories which  were  in

production on the 13th August, 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A People's Match Factory would be set up in which the

People's  Investment Corporation would  be  invited  to

invest  49  per  cent along with 51 per cent  from  the

Government's  Industrial Promotion Board. This  factory

will  be given a monopoly for manufacturing matches  in

Singapore and imports of matches will be prohibited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Promotion Board will start taking the

necessary  steps  right away towards  establishment  of

these factories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to encourage the people to invest in the

People's  Investment  Corporation,  a  mass  investment

campaign will be started by the Government as  soon  as

the  machinery  for setting up the People's  Investment

Corporation is ready.

<div align="center"><b>BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>10.26 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency the



Governor's consent to proceed with this Bill, and I beg

to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to assure hon. Members that

unless  radical changes in Government's economic policy

are  undertaken quickly, time is running out for us  in

Singapore  and soon we will be facing a situation  much

worse  than what we have recently seen, in the form  of

gangsterism, because of unemployment, and  other  anti-social activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members will recall that I outlined Government's

adoption of a policy of selective protection for  local

industries  in  this House on the 13th of  August  this

year, when this Bill had its First Reading that day.  I

stated  in  this connection that outside  manufacturers

wishing to manufacture their products here will,  as  a

general  rule,  be required to come to  an  arrangement

with   the   local  manufacturer  or  intending   local

manufacturer,  if any, of the same product  or  failing

which  with  interested Singapore citizens.  I  further

indicated that such an arrangement should either be  on

a  partnership basis with at least 49 per cent  of  the

shares  held by the local interest or on the  basis  of

the  local interest manufacturing under licence of  the

outside manufacturer. If after a reasonable time  there

is  a  lack of response from local interests or if such

an  arrangement cannot be made to my satisfaction,  the

outside manufacturer will be given permission to set up

his own undertaking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might well be asked why Government considers it

necessary  at  this stage to introduce  legislation  to

control  the manufacture of goods. The reason, Sir,  is

simple. It will be quite obvious that if protection  is

given,  some outside manufacturers who up to  now  have

enjoyed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  as  a  wide open market  may  suddenly  find

restrictions placed in their way. They would find  that

the local manufacturer who up to now was treated by the

Singapore Government as an orphan, would now  be  in  a

position to capture the Singapore market from them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also the operation of protection would act as an

inducement  to  local capital to invest boldly  in  new

industrial  enterprises because  they  could  now  hope

through  Government's intervention to get a fair  share

of  the  local market. Thus it is expected  that  large

sums  will  henceforth be invested by local capital  in

industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of all this would be that some of the

outside manufacturers who up to now have been satisfied

with  supplying Singapore from outside may either  have

to  gradually give up the Singapore market or be forced

to open a factory here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the strong consumer preference in Singapore for

imported  goods, these outside manufacturers opening  a

factory here and manufacturing their well known  brands

and  marketing them in Singapore again,  could  have  a

very  tragic effect on local investors. Local investors

who  might have in the meanwhile invested huge sums and

would just be getting on their feet could suddenly find

the  whole  ground cut from underneath  their  feet  by

these outside manufacturers and their investment vanish

into thin air.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no check was exercised to prevent this happening,

who would dare to take the risk and invest?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to now, Government has had no powers to check or

control outside operators, especially from the sterling

area,  from  opening factories here as  and  when  they

liked,  provided  they  did not  make  big  demands  on

immigration control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, is aimed at giving Government the

necessary powers to exercise such checks.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's aim at present is to ensure that all

and  sundry are carefully selected before they  are

allowed to come in. It is only equitable that where

a   local  industry  already  exists,  such   local

industry  should not be allowed to  be  swamped  by

outside  manufacturers of the  same  product  whose

sole reason for coming in at this stage would be to

"jump"  the protection. However, as I have  already

indicated, where there is no local industry and  no

local  interest in the manufacture  of  a  product,

then the outside manufacturer will be welcomed with

open arms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, control will be achieved by making

it  a  condition  that  no  person  may  set  up  a

manufacturing concern here after the  13th  August,

1958, without having first obtained a licence.  The

issue  of a licence will not of course absolve  the

licensee  from  complying with the requirements  of

any other written law in force. The licence will be

issued  on  payment of a nominal fee which  is  not

designed as a revenue measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As investment in a manufacturing process is

likely  to  be  considerable, it  is  necessary  to

provide  that  a licensee is not at  the  mercy  of

politicians more than is absolutely necessary. Thus

a  licence is made valid for 15 years and renewable

thereafter for further periods of 15 years  at  the

discretion of the Minister. Therefore, the licensee

has  a clear 15 years' run provided he fulfills the

conditions  laid down in the licence. The  Minister

will  have  the  power to refuse  the  issue  of  a

licence  or  to  issue a licence  subject  to  such

conditions as he deems fit. In case of such refusal

the applicant has no grounds to grumble, because he

has  not made his investment yet. However,  once  a

licence is issued it is Government's intention that

there  should be as little interference as possible

with  the  industry and the investor is assured  of

this  by  the fact that the licence is to be  valid

for 15 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is provision in the Bill for the Minister

to  revoke  a licence if the conditions  stipulated

therein by the Minister are not complied with,  but

in such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



cases  the licensee is safeguarded by the provision

that the Minister is obliged to inform the licensee

in  writing  of  such revocation  and  the  grounds

thereof and the licensee has the right of appeal to

the  High  Court  against the Minister's  decision.

Until   the  High  Court  makes  a  decision,   the



Minister's revocation cannot be enforced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be noticed that existing manufacturers on

the  13th  August,  1958, are exempted  as  regards

goods they have been manufacturing as on that date,

but  it  would  be in their interest to  apply  and

obtain a certificate to that effect under clause 12

(3)  so  that there could be no grounds for  doubts

later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other aspect of the Bill is that enabling the

Minister  to  grant  an exclusive  franchise  to  a

single manufacturer by restricting to him only  the

grant  of  a  licence for a particular manufacture.

Hon.  Members  will  appreciate  that  it  will  be



difficult to lay down hard and fast rules as to the

criteria to be applied before any manufacturer  may

be  considered for the grant of such  a  franchise.

Each  application for franchise rights will be most



carefully studied and must of necessity be  decided

on  its  individual merits. However, the underlying

basic principle that will be applied is whether the

manufacturer concerned will find it uneconomical to

operate  having regard to the amount of his initial

capital outlay and the size of the local market  if

a  competitor  were  also to come  into  the  field

intending to manufacture the same type of goods.  I

should  emphasise that the grant of a franchise  is

not  by  any means intended to restrict  or  stifle

local competition but is a measure which should  be

available for use very sparingly and selectively as

and  when  the  occasion arises. I can,  therefore,

assure  the  House that the granting  of  exclusive

franchise rights will be kept to a minimum and will

be subject to very close scrutiny.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, will also act as the instrument

through   which   Government  could   enforce   its

industrial policy from time to time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, getting away from the narrow confines of

the Bill to the broader policy announced recently by me

on  the  economic front, we have accepted the principle

of  protection for our industries. This is a  departure

from   the  timeworn,  shall  we  say,  half-truth   of

maintaining  the free port status of Singapore.  I  say

that it is a half-truth because it is a half-truth that

has  been  blown up by interested parties to an  extent

where  it  has  come to be believed in as  if  it  were

gospel  truth, but the fact is that Singapore  has  not

been  a perfectly free port, shall we say. We have  had

restrictions of all sorts. We have had restrictions  on

the  dollar  exchange.  We  have  had  restrictions  on

exports of certain goods to certain countries laid down

by  the United Nations, embargoes, and so on. An ideal

free port should be a trading community which would  be

occupied  only  in trade or in matters  allied  to  the

trading activities of the place or in services  to  the

community who are engaged in trade. An ideal free  port

should  have no restrictions whatsoever on immigration,

currency, imports and exports. That would be  an  ideal

free  port but we are far from that. In fact,  we  have

not been an ideal free port to quite an extent, but  we

have maintained some sort of a semblance to a free port

and  I  am  quite sure that if my policies are  applied

selectively on protection, we will continue to function

as  an entrepot trading centre without much loss to the

entrepot trade and, at the same time, we will  be  able

to   give  protection  and  thereby  bolster   up   our

industries. However, this policy of protection has  got

to  be administered very delicately and with a balanced

outlook  and there should be no fear of favouritism  in

the  carrying out of this policy. It is only then  that

the  policy  could work. In fact, since announcing  the

policy  and  setting up the panel, I have already  been

swamped by various manufacturers' associations who  now

feel  that  they have the right to ask why I  have  not

appointed  members  of manufacturers'  associations  to

represent the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



associations on the panel. I have stood up  against  it

and  told  them off that I am not going to  create  any

vested  interest on that panel. I want independent  men

capable  of  exercising independent judgment,  not  men

representing  manufacturers - otherwise the  Chambers  of

Commerce  will  come  forward and say,  "Where  is  our

interest?"  and  then  you have all  the  trade  unions

sitting  round a table and quarrelling with one another

and  you  will get nowhere. That is the thing that  the

Minister has got to fight against in the application of

this  policy and if the Minister does not fight against

that, then I can assure the House that the whole policy

may end in Singapore losing a lot of its trade. The key

to this policy is the application thereof.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturers' associations have come up to me and

blithely  suggested  that I should  exclude  just  five

words from clause 12 (2) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The provisions of this Ordinance shall not apply to

any  person who is engaged in the manufacture of  goods

on the 13th August, 1958, in respect of such goods."



<br><br>"in  respect  of  such goods" - five  words.  They  said,

"Please delete those words," and I said, "No." All they

want  is  that existing manufacturers should  be  given

carte  blanche  to manufacture anything  they  like.  A

cigarette  tins manufacturer could then  come  to  some

sort  of  an  understanding with an  outside  cigarette

manufacturer  and  manufacture cigarettes  and  torpedo

Government's  policy  which I have  just  announced.  I

said,  "No,  but  we  are  not  going  to  touch   your

investments in the field in which you have invested and

in  which  you are producing." And that is  a  cardinal

principle.  Do  not  touch  anybody  who  has   already

invested in some industry, but when it comes to  a  new

line  of production, he is as much new as anybody else.

That  is  the main thing, that political pressure  will



come to bear on the Minister, whoever the Minister  may

be.  Favours will be asked and the Minister has got  to

resist  it. If he resists it, then only will the policy

be a success.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Sir, today Singapore is in a difficult

position and yet the people of Singapore are not  aware

that  the  key to all their difficulties  lies  in  the

economic situation. Sometimes the newspapers use bigger

headlines about gangsterism than about a drastic change

in  the  economic policy, even though  according  to  a

certain  newspaper the protection of  industries  might

have  given rise to Sir Stamford Raffles turning  round

in   his  grave.  Headlines  about  gangsterism  appear

everyday in the papers - in the English papers at  least -but  it  is  time now that the people of Singapore  are

made  to realise that there must be drastic changes  in

our  economy,  and  unless those  drastic  changes  are

coming on quickly and without delay, we are heading for

a bad time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would appeal, Sir, to the Opposition that if they

have  got  good grounds for asking me to  consider  the

Bill going to Select Committee, I shall consider it but

I  am  not  prepared to give way to any  dilly-dallying

request. If there are good grounds, I shall be prepared

to consider committing the Bill to Select Committee. If

I have missed out certain important points, then I will

be  prepared to consider that, but if they are not very

important  points,  then I say let  us  take  the  Bill

through its Third Reading today and give the Government

the  necessary powers to enforce this policy as quickly

as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.44 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, it will be a great tragedy if

this  Bill is pushed through all stages today. I  would

suggest   that  this  Bill  be  committed   to   Select

Committee. The main reason is this, that this Bill is a

great departure from the free trade policy of Singapore

which  has been maintained throughout the last century.

The other reason is this. It would be better if such  a



measure  were  to come from a fully elected  Government

and  not from the present colonial Government.  I  must

define  why  I  say  it is a colonial  Government.  The

present Government runs under the Rendel



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



Constitution which is a colonial Constitution with  its

ex-officio   and  Nominated  Members.   Her   Majesty's

Government  has  granted  us reforms  which  cannot  be

pushed  off very long. They should be implemented  very

soon. Then, Sir, if that is so, it is for the masses in

their  own  interest  to  elect  a  Government  and  to

formulate an economic policy which they want for  their

own benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, coming to the free trade policy, the

Minister  has said that Singapore is not  a  free  port

with  its  immigration control and  other  regulations.

That may be so but it is a free port as far as trade is



concerned.  The  growing  unemployment  and  all  these

considerations have come about today after the  present

coalition  Government has come into power  since  April

1955.  Have  they  not  at heart the  interest  of  the

people - the  way  they are running  the  Government  and

their  heavy  travelling expenditure which  could  have

otherwise been saved for the masses!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the position has been that this novice

Government - I must call it "novice" - has experimented and

experimented and has reached nowhere today.  Now,  Sir,

they  want  to push through the Bill. The Minister  has

just  said  that  if valid grounds are given,  he  will

think  of  appointing  a  Select  Committee.  The  most

important  reason is its departure from the free  trade

policy and when you are taking this measure, it is  the

public  who  should give their views before the  Select

Committee,  such  as manufacturers, merchants,  traders

and consumers. It is for them to express their views so

that they can be considered by the Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of protection for goods, the

protection  for what type of articles is not  disclosed

in  this Bill at all. This might be disclosed when  the

Bill  comes  before the Select Committee and  then  the

public   can   give  their  views  very  freely.   Sir,

therefore,  I would suggest that Government should  not

force  this Bill through today but that it be committed

to Select Committee.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is with

considerable trepidation that I follow the Minister for

Commerce and Industry, and the gentleman who I think is

well  qualified  to  be  a  prospective  Minister   for

Commerce  and  Industry. I would  like  to  preface  my

remarks by saying that I would not like to say anything

today which would prejudice the merits of this Bill.  I

fully  agree with the Minister when he says that a  new

unencumbered  approach  to  our  economic  problems  is

necessary - an  approach  not  blinkered  by  catchwords,

slogans and phrases like "free port", "free trade",  in

a very quickly changing South-East Asia. But I would be

reluctant   to  pass  this  Bill  without  having   had

sufficient time not only for ourselves to consider  it,

but to consider the views and the opinions of those who

are more expert than ourselves on the repercussions  of

such a protection system.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> May I, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I think the Minister will have

ample  opportunity to reply. If he wishes  to  raise  a

point of order, I shall yield but if he just wishes  to

make  an  explanatory note of what he has said  in  his

speech, then, of course, I do not think it necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the hon. Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, Mr Jumabhoy.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I beg leave just to correct

him  because  I  think he has misunderstood  the  whole

thing.  This  Bill  has nothing to do with  protection.

Protection is enforced by administrative action.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I hasten to assure the Minister

that I know exactly what he has in mind, the mechanical

arrangements:  (1)  the right to manufacture;  (2)  the

using of the administrative powers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



under the various import licences to prevent the import

of goods of the kind which are being manufactured under

licence.  That  is fully understandable but  there  are

further repercussions arising out of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was going to say, my first impression on reading

the  Bill was that it was reminiscent of the great days

of  the East India Company when Queens granted to their

subjects  exclusive monopolies to exploit or  otherwise

enrich the nation by having an exclusive preserve of  a

certain part of the world. Since we only have a  little

island, then we can only grant little concessions  like

the  exclusive  right to manufacture cigarettes,  soap,

matches,  toothpaste, toothpowder and other  essentials

which people must buy. They are bound to give profit to

whoever manufactures them, particularly if you  have  a

benign  government  that  arranges  that  there  is  no

competition  with  imported  manufacture.  But  I   was

astounded to hear the Minister admit that he gave  only

a two-month period of consideration to this imaginative

departure  from  normal industrial  trade  policies  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Minister to consider this point. The

licence  that is to be granted is for 15 years with  an

optimistic renewal option clause of another  15  years.

Now,  in 30 years time, I may be a very old man, and  I



doubt  if I will be alive, whereas the system  that  we

see  existing  in  South-East Asia  and  the  State  of

Singapore  which is to come into being next  year  will

still be here, though I wonder if there will be such  a

person  known as the Minister for Commerce and Industry

in  the  State of Singapore. That is beside the  point.

The  present Government can only give manufacturers  an



insurance of seven months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said before that I do not want to have to say

anything  in  the  course of this  debate  which  would

challenge the merits of this Bill because the Bill  has

merits. But I do urge the Minister to send this Bill to

Select  Committee  in order that the full  implications

can  be  considered. There is no need to hurry at  this

last  moment in a radical departure of economic policy.

I would just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



like  to draw his attention to certain aspects  of  the

Bill  just  to  show him, since he  has  more  or  less

invited  us  to give reasons for it to be committed  to

Select  Committee, why he should do  so.  There  are  a

considerable number of provisions for which rules  must

be  made,  and he has provided for them in  an  omnibus

clause  in clause 11. For instance, in clause  6,  this

right  of  appeal, the Minister revoking a licence  and

giving grounds for his revocation and giving the  right

of  appeal to the aggrieved licensee to the High Court.

The rules will have to be prescribed: the procedure and



the  issues that will have to be placed before a  judge

on  whether  to  oppose  the policy  of  the  Minister,

whether  he  is  to  oppose or  revoke  the  Minister's

decision, the grounds on which these things have to  be

done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is most important though not provided for in

this  Bill, are provisions to ensure the employment  of

local people. Now, Sir, we all know that the purpose of

this  Bill  is  not  to create a thriving  industry  in

Singapore  to compete with Hongkong, Japan or  the  big

industrial countries in South-East Asia and  Asia.  The

purpose  is  to  provide some form of local  industries

even though it may not be competitive, and as efficient

as  those  in  Hongkong, Japan,  India  or  China.  The

essential goods listed by an economist today in one  of

the  English  newspapers  are  soap,  sweets,  matches,

cigarettes  and  all  the  other  non-elastic  consumer

goods. You can eat the best sweets in the world or  Tai

Hong sweets; it will come to the same. It does not make

any  difference. You can strike a match made in  Sweden

or strike a match made in Singapore. It really does not

matter.  But  unless  we are really competitive,  these

factors  cannot  become  a significant  factor  in  the

economic  life of South-East Asia because we  can  only

give  protection insofar as consumption by 1½  million

souls  in  Singapore  is  concerned.  We  cannot   give

protection for the consumption by 7 million  people  in

the   Federation,  over  1  million   in   the   Borneo

territories and 70 million in Indonesia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, all these factors must be carefully weighed and

considered, and I recommend to the Minister that if the

object  is  to  create employment, then there  must  be

sufficient  provision  in this  Bill  to  lay  down  an

employment  policy  because  the  object  is  to   give

employment  and nothing else. His answer  may  well  be

that there are sufficient immigration controls to bring

about the desired result without having it specifically

set up in this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these matters we will have to discuss. We want to

hear  all  these things and we can best  hear  them  in

Committee,  not a Committee of the whole House  because

then we will have to rush through the Bill today but in

a  Select  Committee. Sir, at the  end  of  the  Second

Reading,  I  hope to catch your eye to move  that  this

Bill  be  sent  to  Select Committee  and  I  hope  the

Minister   will   indicate  that  he  is   sufficiently

satisfied to make my motion unnecessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, I would also like

to  persuade  the  Hon, the Minister for  Commerce  and

Industry  not  to  push through the  Bill  through  the

remaining  stages  today but to let  it  go  to  Select

Committee. From what' he read out just now, it seems to

me  that  he is suggesting a great change in the  trade

policy  of  Singapore which I feel is a good thing  but

then  it is only his side of the story. We do not  know

the  other side of the story and in a major change like

this,  we need time to study the Bill carefully  before

we  pass  it. That is why I am asking him to accede  to

our request.



<br><br>10.58 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

seldom  that  I can agree with the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar but in this particular debate I am bound to agree

with  him on the major point especially that this  Bill

should  be committed to Select Committee. The  Minister

has  informed us that the persons selected on the panel

were  those  who had nothing to do with the  interested

parties. Therefore public opinion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



especially  that  of the interested parties  should  be

heard  in  Select Committee and maybe a policy  can  be

formulated  in  respect of the control of  manufactured

goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the lengthy and detailed statement made by

the Minister for Commerce and Industry - and we know that

he  is  able and hard-working - the most important  point

which  he has touched upon is the failure of the  local

industries which is only too obvious and now he  speaks

of  opening up new industries. I wish the Minister  for

Commerce  and Industry will inform this House how  many

established industries have been forced to close  down.

I  would  draw the attention of this House - and  I  have



said  this very often - that the most important thins  to

solve  is  the  economic instability of Singapore.  The

tariff   imposed  at  the  Johore  Bahru  causeway   is

detrimental to the development of local industries.  So

unless  Government can assure this House  that  a  Pan-Malayan  economic policy can be formulated  to  include

the  Federation  of Malaya Government  and  the  Borneo

Government  whereby our products can be  considered  as

their own, then our home market consisting of just  1½

million  people,  as the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  has

pointed out, is too small for the establishment of  any

new   industry.  Already  the  old  industries   cannot

maintain  themselves and now we are talking  about  new

industries.  Therefore I wish the Minister  can  assure

this  House  that this Pan-Malayan economic  policy  is

under way, otherwise this Bill is only just a scrap  of

paper.



<br><br>11.02 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Siak Kew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Siak Kew (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

must  say that I have the greatest respect for the Hon.

the Minister for Commerce and Industry for his grasp of



Singapore's  economy, and especially his enthusiasm  in

seeking  to  remedy  that situation.  I  think  he  has

already   appreciated  that  Singapore  is   too   much

dependent  on its entrepôt trade and, in  view  of  the

increasing population and the increase in unemployment,

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



the  years to come we must have something - that  is  the

development  of industries - to supplement that  economy.

This  Bill - the Control of Manufacture Bill -  is  one  of



the steps which he proposes to extend to something like

a  quantitative  import control and a  customs  tariff.

Although the Minister did say just now that it  is  not



to  protect,  I  see here in the explanatory  statement

that  it is "to protect the local manufacturer".  There

is  an  element of protection and no doubt the measures

of protection will come later and that, as the Minister

has  indicated,  will be in the form of a  quantitative

control or a customs tariff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, although the Minister has rightly diagnosed the

ill,  I think this is quite the wrong remedy and it  is

bound  to  do  more  harm than good  to  Singapore.  As

Singapore  now stands, the entrepôt trade is still  our

mainstay  and  it  still  feeds  us.  Any  measure   of

quantitative control or by a customs levy is  bound  to

have  repercussions  on  that entrepôt  trade.  We  are

bound,   for  instance,  to  antagonise  our   existing

customers   and   we  cannot  afford  to   have   their

retaliation  in whatever form later on. As the  Chinese

saying goes, I think this is a case of slashing off the

flesh  to  remove  a  minor sore.  Quantitative  import

control  or a customs levy is simply going to  take  it

out of somebody's already existing business in the hope

of  conferring some benefit on the other fellow who  is

in  industry and whose interests the Minister thinks he

can  protect.  Many  hon. Members have  mentioned  that

whatever we aim to protect is only for one and  a  half

million  persons.  You  cannot  even  protect  so  much

because there are bound to be people who would not like

to  buy,  for  instance, locally  produced  cigarettes.

There  is  only  a  very  small section  that  you  can



possibly  hope to protect and it would be, I  think,  a

wiser  policy  to  isolate that and  give  it  whatever

protection  it deserves without disturbing the  overall

freedom  of  this entrepôt trade. We know,  Sir,  that,

generally speaking, all sorts of controls will tend  to

breed  corruption and inefficiency and, as the Minister

has  mentioned, this Bill is so much dependent  on  the

Minister's application and honesty



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



himself that it is quite dangerous if the powers  which

the  Bill  proposes fall into less sincere  and  honest

hands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see in this Bill, as the Minister has admitted

himself,  in  clause 4 (1), it already  breaks  a  very

cherished  principle on which Singapore has  grown  and

thrived,  and that is the principle of free  trade  and

free enterprise. This clause reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every application for a licence shall be made to the

Minister  in  the prescribed form and the Minister  may

issue or refuse such licence."



<br><br>Now  I  think  the  object of the Bill  is  to  promote

industry and I do not know under what circumstances the

Minister is likely to refuse a licence to manufacture.



<br><br>Clause 5 (1) says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Minister may in issuing a licence impose such

conditions  as  he  may think fit to  impose  and  such

conditions shall be set out in the licence."



<br><br>Now  what sort of conditions does the Minister have  in

mind?  Is  it  the  suitability of  the  place  or  the

suitability  of  the manufacture? Under existing  laws,

these  are governed by other laws. Perhaps the Minister

has in mind that the licensee should manufacture up  to

a  certain quota and that he should use a certain  type

of machinery chosen for him by the Minister?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then clause 5 (2) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When issuing a licence to engage in the manufacture

of  any goods the Minister may undertake that for  such

period as he may determine no further licence shall  be

issued

for the manufacture of such goods."



<br><br>In other words, the Minister may decide on preferential

treatment or even create a monopoly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed in this Bill that those who have

already established business before 13th August,  1958,

are  to  be exempted. In other words, these people  who

have  already  had their business and who are  exempted

from  the  Bill  would  also not be  entitled  to  this

generosity of a franchise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have touched on controls this morning. We

have  also touched on the strategic stockpile of  rice.

This  strategic  stockpile is  everytime  running  into



difficulties, and in any case it is a burden



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



on the taxpayer. It is an alternate boon and woe to the

traders  concerned. So controls, if they are  not  very

necessary,  should hot be imposed at all, and  in  this

case  I  think they are not necessary because they  are

aimed at benefiting only a very small portion and  they

will,  if  imposed,  have great  repercussions  on  our

entrepôt trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Nanyang Siang Pau of the 25th August has

this to say. I quote excerpts:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Singapore hopes to have any success in its policy

of  protecting its industries without at the same  time

seriously   hurting  its  entrepôt  trade,  the   first

requisite  must  be  to have the  co-operation  of  the

Federation,  because Singapore's own  manufactures  and

its imported manufactures which it is proposed to limit

quantitatively or by a customs levy have  hitherto  all

depended  on  the  Federation as  its  chief  consuming

market.  If  Singapore cannot get the co-operation  and

support of the Federation whose consuming power is four

times that of Singapore itself, whatever measures taken

to  protect  its industries will just  be  a  waste  of

effort.  We  question whether with  only  the  causeway

separating and Federation industries having such a  big

consuming   market   compared  with   Singapore's   own

negligible consumption anyone seeking investment  would

not at once reject the latter and invest in the former?

Therefore, if the Federation would not regard our close

economic co-operation as being important because of our

propinquity and exempt Singapore industries from import

tax  or even concede a preferential treatment, we shall

find  it even hard to maintain our existing industries.

To  expect  new  industries in the circumstances  would



just   be   an  extravagant  hope.  If  the   Singapore

Government  do  not  first bend  their  efforts  toward

removing  this barrier and instead try to plan measures

which  are  bound  to more or less  harm  our  entrepôt

trade,  in  order  to protect industries,  it  is  just

abandoning the body and chasing the tail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Chief Economic Adviser to the Chief

Minister, Dr Benham's calculations, Singapore's import

of produce, foodstuffs, and industrial goods amounts to

between  three and four billion dollars a year. Roughly

one-fifth  of this is retained for own consumption.  As

much  as  two-fifths  of  this is  re-exported  to  the

Federation, and the remaining two-fifths is re-exported

to Indonesia and other neighbouring countries. In other

words,  the  Federation  takes from  Singapore  imports

yearly at least 1½ billion dollars. This amount  is  an

important factor in our entrepot trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore importers of foodstuffs and consumer goods

invariably   take  the  Federation's  and   Singapore's

consumption  together into calculation  in  determining

what  and  how much to buy from abroad. Of  these  they

estimate that the Federation will take 75 per cent to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>



Singapore's 25 per cent. If it happens that  there  are

intermittent demands from Indonesia, Thailand or  other

neighbouring countries, as is the experience for  quite

a number of years now, their usual method is to satisfy

these  demands from the stocks reserved for Singapore's

consumption  and  replace them  immediately  afterwards

from abroad. This is the usual pattern of their trade."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would like to remind the hon.

Member of Standing Order 30 (6) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A member shall not read his speech, but he may read

extracts  from  books  or  papers  in  support  of  his

argument,  and may refresh his memory by  reference  to

notes."



<br><br>I  read  in  the word "extracts" extracts and  not  the

whole  article, and if the hon. Member  can  assure  me

that what he is reading are, in fact, extracts, then he

can proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Siak Kew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Siak Kew:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir. It is not

the  whole  article which I am reading, but  these  are

very  relevant  points.  As  I  have  said,  these  are

excerpts from the article. To continue,

Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the intended protection of industries takes the

form  of  quantitative  limitation,  there  may  be   a

shortage   which   could  force  up  prices.   Hitherto

Singapore's  entrepot goods are not higher priced  than

the origin of production; at the same time they can  be

bought  in small or big lots and ready goods can always

be  supplied.  If  a  quantitative limit  were  imposed

leading   to  this  advantage  being  lost,  Federation

customers  of Singapore importers will seek  to  import

direct from origin suppliers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further if a custom's duty levy were imposed, goods

that are intended for the Federation must be considered

to be exempt; but the storage of these goods whether in

public   or  private  warehouses  would  present   such

difficulties in administrative control as to create all

sorts of problems resulting in an increase of cost  and

thus  lowering the chances of the Federation  customers

buying in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, Singapore has already lost quite

a  lot of entrepot business for quite a number of years

to Indonesia, Thailand and other neighbours, because of

these  countries' policy of trading direct with  origin

suppliers, and if before we get the co-operation of the

Federation we should pursue this protection policy with

its  very  doubtful  purpose  and  lose  this  big  and

reliable consuming outlet, it is in the ultimate simply

not a sensible step."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will also read to you extracts from the Sin

Chew Jit Poh of Monday, 8th September, 1958:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those who say that the entrepot is slipping is

talking   nonsense.  Our  biggest  entrepot   is   with

Indonesia. In 1955 the figure was 200,000,000. In  1956

it  increased  to 230,000,000. In 1957 260,000,000.  In

the  first five months of 1958 it has already  amounted

to 200,000,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sympathise with those who think we cannot entirely

depend on entrepot. But they must be very careful  when

they think of replacing the free status of this port by

a   protective  customs  tariff.  They  must  take   in

consideration the situation as a whole lest  they  have

both hands empty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of customs tariff can easily lead to

a  preponderant stress on treasury revenue and lose its

original   objective  of  protecting   industries.   By

whatever  method you use, the burden will fall  on  the

shoulders of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will give rise to lobbying by the various

industries  and  ultimately benefit a small  number  of

industrialists   and  victimise  the  whole   consuming

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A protective customs tariff is only one of the many

methods  to promote industries. In order to avoid  this

affecting  our  entrepot  trade  which  is  still   the

mainstay  of  Singapore, we must first  try  out  other

methods  by  giving direct or other indirect assistance

to the industries concerned. The cost will not be small

but  it  must  be recognised that revenue from  customs

tariff are also borne by the people ultimately -"



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hate interrupting the hon.

Member,  but I think I must rule that he is, in effect,

reading somebody else's speech. The hon. Member  could,

of  course,  read  extracts but he should  then  relate

those extracts to his own speech. As it is, all that we

have  heard during the last five minutes is, as I  have

said,  in  effect, the speech of somebody else  not  in

this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Siak Kew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Siak Kew:</b> Sir, this is in fact a translation

by  myself and not somebody else's speech. They are all

extracts  which  I think are relevant to  my  argument.

However,  I  am nearly finishing and if you will  allow



me,  I  will  just  proceed with  another  one  or  two

sentences:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"- and does not fall from the sky. From the

standpoint  of Singapore as a whole, any  other  method

would be better than a customs tariff in order that the

status of a free entrepot may not be shaken."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know, Sir, unfortunately, that the Federation is not

giving  us  any  preference or it has refused  to  give

preference



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



to  our  manufactures; but if we are  to  introduce

some  import  control, quantitative  or  otherwise,

then  the  articles just referred to like  matches,

soap  and  so on, we would eventually have  to  tax

those  which  are  coming out from the  Federation.

Whether that is desirable or not I do not know, but



I  think any customs control will have to encounter

some difficulty in Empire preference which is after

all  reciprocal,  and it is sure to  intensify  ill

will  against us and they could retaliate  in  more

ways than one. So is it really worth while that  we

should pursue this measure at all?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position is like this - somewhat similar to a

story  which I have just been told. The story  goes

like  this. There are two ladies travelling in  the

same  compartment of a train. The window was  open.

One   lady  said,  "The  window  must  be   closed,



otherwise  I will freeze to death." The other  lady

said, "You cannot close the window, because if  you

do,  I  will  suffocate to death.  In  fact,  I  am

equally sure of that and as a further precaution, I

will  demand  that the fan should also be  switched

on."  The  other  passengers said, "No,  thank  you

both.  We are quite comfortable as we are.  If  you

switch  on the fan it will be too cold, and if  you

close  the window it will be too hot." So  that  is

the  position - what to do? I think the Minister,  in

proposing  these protective measures, is  evidently

saying, "Close the window, because we have  got  to

protect  this  lady from freezing." Now  what  will

happen   to  the  other  lady  is  that  she   will

immediately be suffocated to death, not to  mention

the  extreme  discomfort to the  other  passengers.

Would  it  not be a more sensible thing to  isolate



the  freezing lady than attempt to protect  her  on

that spot?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, any industry in Singapore which needs this

kind  of protection cannot be big, because any  big

industry  cannot just depend on its local  turnover

to  survive.  Therefore, I think it  will  be  more

justifiable, if the industry is worthy of it, if  a

direct  subsidy  or direct protection  by  whatever

other  measures  could be given to it,  instead  of

jeopardising the entire entrepôt trade in the  hope

of  trying  to confer some benefit to just  a  very

small section of the people. As other hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



Members have suggested, I hope that this Bill  will

be  committed  to  a Select Committee  and  studied

further,  and I hope that eventually the Government

will  see  their way to withdrawing this  Bill,  as

they have already withdrawn the Luxury Tax Bill  on

similar objections.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I think there is some merit in this Bill. All of us

say  that  Singapore is dependent on  its  entrepot

trade,  but  must  we always be  dependent  on  our

entrepot  trade? Can we not take a second line  and

emulate the example of small island countries  like

Hongkong    and   embark   on   a   programme    of

industrialisation? I certainly feel, Sir,  that  if

there  is work to be done and if it can be done  by

the  people  of  Singapore,  then  the  people   of

Singapore  should be given a chance.  If  there  is

money  to  be made and the people of Singapore  can

make  it themselves, then we should allow Singapore

to  make such money. In this world, everything must

start  on  a small scale. In places like Japan  and

Hongkong  which  only  started manufacturing  early

this    century,   they   must   start   as   small

manufacturers.  They must first  supply  their  own

needs,  but because labour is cheap and because  of

other prevailing conditions they were able to start

not  only supplying themselves with the goods  they

needed  but  also exporting to countries  that  had

been  exporting to them. And today I think Hongkong

is  exporting to England the goods that England was

at one time exporting to Hongkong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, the merits of this Bill must be

balanced  with other points which we must  consider

very  seriously.  I feel that if we  can  keep  our

entrepot    trade    and    yet    go    on    with

industrialisation, then I will want the two  assets

instead  of  one, but we will have to  go  on  very

cautiously weighing every fact first before we make

such  a move. When I look at this Bill, I see there

are  quite  a  number of flaws and loopholes  which

must be plugged. It will involve the Government  in

a  great  deal  of work - licensing  new  factories,

exempting  many  people, and issuing  certificates.

Then I will be thousands of certificates to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>



issued, many licences for new factories. This  work

alone is going to be tremendous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point, Sir; when we talk about

manufactures  offered for sale to the public,  even

small  manufacturers come in. The man in the street

who probably manufactures a few bottles of sauce or

some sweets or toys on a very small scale will have

to  come  and get his licence or his exemption.  It

may cause him a great deal of inconvenience and  it

may  take  him a long time to understand  what  the

Government have in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is this, we want to keep our

entrepot trade and at the same time encourage local

manufacture. Let us take the example of cigarettes.

We  will say that all cigarettes which come in must



go  into  bond and be re-exported. Local cigarettes

can  be  manufactured and sold. But  you  must  not

forget, Sir, that Johore is so very near and though

local  cigarettes  are  on sale  some  people  here

prefer the brands that are imported. They might  go

over  to Johore to buy their requirements for their

own consumption. That is a loophole that we have to

look after.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government will consider seriously the

suggestion  that a Malayan customs union  would  be

the  best solution. I have heard it said that there

should  be a customs union not only for Malaya  and

Singapore  but also to include such territories  as

North  Borneo,  Sarawak  and  Kuching;  and  if  we

establish that, our markets will be bigger at least

when  we consider local consumption. That idea  was

mooted   during  the  last  Area  meeting  of   the

Commonwealth Parliamentary Association there and  I

think  it should deserve support from this Assembly

if ever such a move were made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly feel that the points raised both by

my  colleagues  and other speakers previous  to  me

deserve  deep  consideration, and  that  this  Bill

should  be sent to a Select Committee so  that  the

people  who will be greatly affected by  this  Bill

will be able to voice their opinions on it.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> In reply, Sir, It is

unfortunate, Sir, that not only are the Members  of

the  Opposition  not aware of our serious  economic

position  but  they  are  not  even  aware  of  the

implications  of  this Bill. The Member  for  Telok

Ayer  talked  about discussing in Select  Committee

the  principle  of  protection, when  there  is  no

reference  at  all  to  protection  in  this  Bill.

Protection  is  going  to be  carried  out  by  the



Government  by  Administrative action.  Quotas,  if

necessary, are going to be placed on imported goods

under  my  authority, the authority  which  I  have

under the Control of Imports and Exports Ordinance.

Customs  duties  are going to  be  imposed  by  the



Financial  Secretary under his authority  which  is

derived  from the Customs Ordinance. This Bill  has

nothing  to  do with protection as such.  The  only

thing this Bill seeks to do is to protect the local

manufacturer  from  being swamped  by  the  outside

manufacturer  of  well-known  brands,  because  the

outside  manufacturer is going to lose his  market.

Up to now, the outside manufacturer refuses to come



in  and wants to employ outside labour to sell  his

goods  to  the  people of Singapore.  He  has  been

cajoled,  he has been asked, he has been begged  by

us  to  come  in. We have given him  all  sorts  of

promises - pioneer industry status,  tax  exemptions,

this and that - but he says, "No, I do not trust the

people of Singapore and their politicians. I refuse

to   come  in."  Then  some  time  later  a   local

manufacturer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>



says, "Right, I dare to invest in this thing." He  puts

up  $500,000 and manufactures something here.  Then  he

says, "Now, will you give me protection?" And you  say,

"Imports  from  outside  are prohibited."  The  outside

manufacturer with Brand X, which is a well-known brand,

then  decides to come in and manufactures Brand X here,

and  the  local  man who has invested, half  a  million

dollars   loses  his  investment  because  the  outside

manufacturer  has  a  well-known  brand  and  Singapore

consumers run to buy that brand. That is all that  this

Bill  seeks  to  protect - nothing else.  In  the  Select

Committee, Sir, I am doubtful whether the principle  of

protection can be discussed, because there is  not  one

clause in this Bill which talks of tariff protection or

quantitative restriction protection. What have my  hon.

friends  from the Opposition side got to  show  to  the

public  about  their  knowledge  of  the  economics  of

Singapore? During election time they go to the  country

and  shout all sorts of things. Yet what are they going

to  do  for this country? Is what they have said  about

this  Bill,  which  is of vital importance,  all  their

knowledge?   The   reference  to  protection   in   the

explanatory statement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... It provides power to regulate the setting up

of  industries  on a planned basis and to  protect  the

local manufacturer."



<br><br>That  is  to  protect the local manufacturer  from  the

ravages  of  outsiders who come in  to  cash  in  on  a

protected  market - I see now some hon.  Members  walking

out of the House; they dare not listen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Labour Front in its "Principles and Aims"

says in paragraph 7:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To fulfill the urgent needs of the country's rapidly

growing  population  the Labour Front  stands  for  the

reorganisation of its economy now cast in the role of a

milching cow."



<br><br>The entrepot trade is not a milching cow, but servicing

by  outside  manufacturers in a wide open market  in  a

world  which has closed its doors everywhere by  tariff

protection  and quantitative restrictions - a  wide  open

place for every manufacturer to dump his goods - that  is

where  we are a milching cow. That is what we  seek  to

prevent by this Bill,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



and  hon.  Members  have not yet  understood  the  full

implications. "A departure from the free  trade  policy

maintained  for over a century," says the  hon.  Member

for  Telok  Ayer,  who is not in  the  room  now.  That

century-old policy cannot be applied today.  The  world

has  changed - the  fact  must be  realised - and  we  must

change with the world. If we do not, we are going to be

left  behind.  Do they realise that or not?  There  are

people  of the old generation who believe in  going  to

races,  drinking in high society, and so on,  and  they

say,  "Let us keep that century-old policy." The moment

you talk of a change, they are frightened, because they

believe in a conventional world, a world in which  they

have been brought up. They do not understand that which

the  hon.  Member  for Tanjong Pagar  understands  very

well,  and  that is the world has changed and  we  must

change with the world; if not, we are doomed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar says, "Why so

late?" Exactly. In my statement, Sir, last month to the

Assembly  I  said, "It is now approximately two  years,

Sir,  since  I gave an indication that some measure  of

protection  might  have  to be considered."  Sir,  this

policy  is  not a hasty one and the Member for  Tanjong

Pagar  misunderstood me this morning.  This  policy  of

protection has been under consideration for  two  solid

years,   and   I   say   again,  that   after   careful

consideration,  Government has come to  the  conclusion

that the principle of protection must be recognised for

our  industries and Government will therefore  commence

taking  immediately  all necessary steps  to  implement

this  policy, and reference of this Bill  to  a  Select

Committee  is not going to stop Government from  giving

protection  to industries. This Bill merely deals  with

one  aspect  of  it, and that is to protect  the  local

manufacturer   from  being  swamped  by   the   outside

manufacturer  because of his well-known brand.  Nothing

else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar misunderstood

me when he said that I answered him that the policy had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



been  under consideration for two months. That  was

in  respect of the statement I made this morning on

the  people's sector of industry, and for the  last

two  months I have been working pretty hard on  it.

However, I will come to it later. Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it would be best for me to answer the

Nominated  Member, Mr Tan Siak Kew, first  because

he  has  raised  the  most  points.  He  says  that

protection  by  quantitative  restriction   or   by

tariffs  will  mean  taking it from  one  hand  and

giving  it to somebody else. That is precisely  the

point, Sir. It will take the profits and the  wages

of  labour from the outside manufacturer  and  give

them to the man inside Singapore. It will also  cut

the  cost  of freight, because, for most  of  these

products, the raw materials are drawn from Asia and

they  are carted all the way to Europe and America.

Now  they  can  be carted to Asia and the  consumer



goods  will be produced here. So if any hon. Member

has  any  opposition to it, let  him  say  so  now,

including the Member for Tanjong Pagar, if  he  has

any, and I am sure he has not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Controls will tend to breed corruption and

inefficiency," Mr Tan Siak Kew says, "and it  will

be  dangerous  if  powers  fall  into  less  honest

hands."   The  answer  is  with  the  citizens   of

Singapore.   If   they  wish  to   elect   corrupt,

inefficient and less honest men to fill these Front

Benches, they are welcome to it. Let them have such

people.  Why should we bother about it? We  try  to

provide  laws  to  be  administered  by  efficient,

honest  and  incorruptible  Ministers  as  far   as

possible.   If  the  people  of  Singapore   choose

otherwise, they are welcome to their choice. It  is

not for us to judge.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Are not you people part of the

people?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> We are, and we will do our

best to see that they do not choose such, people!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the creation of monopolies or a franchise is

only  an  enabling  clause in the  Bill.  In  fact,

nothing  can  bind  a  successive  government  from

changing  its  mind. It is an enabling  clause  and

there is nothing to it. In fact, it is just one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



clause in between others. I think undue stress  has

been laid by the Opposition on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Siak Kew has quoted, Sir, the possible

conditions  under  clause 5 (1).  The  condition  I

think would be not on the amount of protection  but

rather that the local manufacturer should not  come

to  an arrangement with any foreign manufacturer in

which  he  holds less than 49 per cent.  Take,  for

example,  a  small  man  making,  say,  a  thousand

cigarettes a day. The foreign man comes in  because

he  cannot  bring his cigarettes in. And  he  says,

"Look  here,  I  will  pay $500  a  month.  Let  me

manufacture  cigarettes here." So the  foreign  man

"jumps"  the  protection, comes here to manufacture

his cigarettes and then tells the Government, "I do

not  care tuppence for you!" And that is where  the

restrictive  conditions will come in.  You  give  a

licence to the local man but he cannot come  to  an

understanding  with a foreign manufacturer  without

the  permission of the Minister, and  the  Minister

will  see that the local man gets a fair share  and

that  it  is not an eyewashing arrangement for  the

outside  man  to come in and "jump" the  protection

barrier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the articles in the Nanyang Siang Pau and

the  Sin Chew Jit Poh were quoted. I think  it  was

good  that they were quoted. I have read these  two

articles with interest and I do not think there  is

any  merit in both of them. "The Federation is  the

chief  consuming market - four times  the  market  of

Singapore."   That   is  not  correct,   Sir.   The

population of the Federation is four times that  of

Singapore, but the consuming power of Singapore  as

compared  to that of the Federation is  40  to  60,

because Singapore is an urban community and we have

a   higher  purchasing  power  in  Singapore.   The

Federation  is  mainly a rural community,  and  the

purchasing  power is less. Therefore the  consuming

ability   is  40  for  Singapore  to  60  for   the

Federation - not 20 to 80.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since Singapore is a negligible market, would it

not  be  that most investors would reject Singapore

and  go to the Federation?" That is precisely  what

has  happened. Factory owners who were about to  go

to the Federation stopped



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



in  their  tracks when I made the statement  about

protection last month. It has been going on  since

the  last one year. Factories have shifted to  the

Federation. They have had to close down because of

the   tariffs,  but  the  moment   I   made   this

announcement,  they  stopped  and   we   are   now

retaining  these  factories.  They  are   thinking

twice - and yet, Sir, we are told about century-old

policies and asked to think about it. By the  time

you  think about it, you will have lost  all  your

factories.  Nothing will have been  left  here  to

think about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Benham was quoted by the Nanyang Siang Pau - "two-fifths of the foodstuffs go to the

Federation."  Exactly,  Sir,  and  I  have  in  my

statement  made  it  very  clear  that  "under  no

circumstances will the operation of protection  be

allowed  to interfere in any way with the entrepôt

trade  in  produce, processed produce and textiles

or  raw  materials".  We are not  going  to  touch

foodstuffs and such things, Sir. We are only going

to touch consumer goods and it might interest hon.

Members of the Opposition to know this - if  at  all

they  study such things, which I do not think they

do,  because  most  of them,  especially  my  hon.

friend  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar, study  only

slogans to catch the political ears of the people.

But as to the economic aspect, I do not think they



have  an economic policy, because they have  never

announced it. Sir, about 70 to 75 per cent of  our

trade   is  in  these  items -  Arecanuts,   canned

pineapples, sago, sugar, raw coffee, tea,  cloves,

pepper,  cigarettes, copra, rubber, jelutong,  gum

dammar,  aviation spirit, kerosene,  liquid  fuel,

palm oil, coconut oil, tapioca flour, cotton piece

goods,  artificial  silk  piece  goods,  tin.   It

varies. In 1951 it was 86 per cent. In 1956 it was

74  per  cent. In 1957 it was 70 per cent.  Nearly

three-quarters of our entrepôt trade is not in the

consumer  goods which are going to be affected  by

protection.  It is in these produce  and  textiles

and  processed goods and therefore the  fear  that

our   entrepôt  trade  is  going  to  suffer,  and

foodstuffs - "two   fifths   of   it   go   to   the

Federation" - are going to suffer, is unfounded  and

due to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>



non-understanding on the part of the  persons  who

make these suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Storage may be a problem." Bonded warehouses

can  overcome  this problem. Other countries  have

done it. Why cannot we do it? Then the hon. Member

quotes again, "Singapore has lost business in  the

past  due  to  the  direct trading  activities  of

countries  like Indonesia and Thailand."  Exactly,

that is what I have been telling the House for the

last  two  years, and that is why we have  got  to

open our eyes and do something about it - so that we

will  have something to fall back on when we  lose

more  of  our entrepôt trade - and that  is  coming -

because in this present competitive age no country

can afford to go to a middleman if it can help it.

That means that if direct trade progresses, we are



going  to get less trade, which means that  unless

we  do  something on the industrial front  we  are

going  to  be  in  a jam. I give figures - the  hon.

Member's  figures were all for single months,  but

here are the comparisons. In 1955 our imports were

2,865,000,000 - it  is  not  just  the  increase  in

figures  we  have got to see, but  the  difference

between  imports  and  exports,  the  balance   of

payments. Our exports were 2,781,000,000. In  1956

there   was  a  jump  in  imports -  3,098,000,000;

exports remained almost the same at 2,732,000,000.

In  1957  imports were 3,277,000,000 - a jump  again



over  the  previous year; exports remained  almost

the   same - 2,773,000,000.  The  result  is  that

whereas  exports have remained stagnant at  around

2,700,000,000,  imports have kept  on  jumping  by

roughly  200  million  a year.  The  gap  from  84

million in 1955 went up to 365 million in 1956 and

504  million  in  1957; and  that  is  the  danger

signal.  As  the imports increase, it  shows  that

there  is  more consumption at home, and  even  if

employment is a criterion - and employment is a  big

criterion, I will admit - it should not be the  only

criterion.  We have got to produce more  at  home,

not  only just to find employment, but to cut down

on  our  imports, because very soon you will  find

that you will not have enough



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



money to import goods. Now our dollar is a dollar which

operates in a whole area, but supposing later on with a

Central  Bank in the Federation or something  else  you

find  that you have to rely on your own prestige,  your

own  economy - not  on one that is bolstered  up  by  the

economies of surrounding countries like Malaya, Borneo,

Sarawak - then you will find that your Singapore  dollar

will  start fluctuating, if this state of affairs  goes

on.  You have got to see that you import less and  make

what  you can at home. The same story continues  during

all  the  months  this  year, if hon.  Members  of  the

Opposition care to read the statistics, which  I  doubt

they do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another false argument, that is that the burden

will  fall  on the shoulders of the people. That  means

the  cost of living will go up. That is not so, because

most   of   the  goods  that  you  consume   here   are

manufactured in Europe or America, and labour there  is

as high as, if not higher than, in Singapore. Therefore

you save on the cost of labour because Singapore labour

is  cheaper.  You also save on freight. In many  cases,

you  save  on exorbitant profits made by these  outside

manufacturers because of their names.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it desirable to have a tax on articles coming from

the  Federation?  The  Federation  has  decided  it  is

desirable  to  have  a  tax  on  articles  coming  from

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I would like to ask the mercantile

mind how this really helps him in the argument. He says

labour  is cheaper here. Then we dispense with freight.

Therefore  the cost of living will go down. But  to  my



non-mercantile mind, it appears to me that if  that  is

in  fact  the argument, then protection is unnecessary,

because  we  would be able to compete with the  outside

commodity. Where am I wrong?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> The hon. Member is perfectly

right  and he is perfectly wrong. Where he is wrong  is

that  though  the people of Singapore can  shout  about

their  prejudices. They will buy English,  American  or

German  goods.  They will not touch  anything  made  in

Singapore -  that  is  where the hon.  Member  is  wrong - unless we force them to buy Singapore-made goods. Even

India  had  to  do it after independence, because  even

there  the people were prejudiced, because in a hundred

years  of  colonialism you have  been  brought  up  and

steeped  into that sort of thing. And you will not  get

out of it easily.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Mason -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Mason:</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Another false argument put up

was: is it worth while to have protection? Why not have

a  direct subsidy? Government will give, say, a  direct

subsidy  of $20 million to industry to keep  the  trade

open.   For   whose  benefit?  So  that   the   outside

manufacturer can push his goods in and make his profits

in  the  Singapore market; and the Government  collects

from  the taxpayer, through other methods, and gives  a

subsidy to local factories? Now, is that the right  way

of  doing things? You tax a local man, to pay  a  local

factory, and you let the outside man make his money  on

it. Is it not fairer for the outside man to be made  to

pay or to be stopped?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a customs union with the Federation would be a

very good idea, but I do not think it is practicable in

the  political field as yet. If we could  have  a  Pan-Malayan  economic  system,  that  would  be  the   most

desirable thing; but as hon. Members know, it  has  not

been  achieved.  Even  India, Sir,  has  this  sort  of

legislation  to  prevent  outside  manufacturers   from

opening factories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we now come to the hon. Member for Tanjong

Pagar. He has not got any really good argument why this

Bill  should  go to Select Committee. I  suspect,  Sir,

that he is trying to gain time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



because  he  is not aware of the implications  himself.

But  if the hon. Member, as he always professes to  be,



is  on  the  side of where the good of Singapore  lies,

then  I  say  he should not advocate any delay  in  the

passing of this Bill, because it is designed to  assist

the  Singapore man. And the reply I made earlier  about

two months' consideration did not apply to this Bill or

to  the protection policy, but only to the statement  I

made  this  morning. He drew attention to  one  or  two

clauses.  He  says the judge will have  to  approve  or

revoke the decision of the Minister on policy. That  is

not  true.  The judge will have to decide on  the  case

purely on factual grounds, whether the conditions  laid

down  by the Minister have been observed or not - not  on

the policy. The Minister can revoke a licence if he  is

satisfied that the conditions which he has imposed have

not been complied with, and the man can go to the Court

and  say, "I have complied with the conditions, but the

Minister is not satisfied and has revoked the licence."

The  judge  then  has  to  rule factually  whether  the

conditions have been complied with. It is a decision on

facts,  not  on  policy. Policy is  a  matter  for  the

Minister, not for the judge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provision to provide for employment" - you cannot

provide in any law provisions for so much employment to

be  given  and  that sort of thing.  That  is  a  fluid

matter. Some industries can give more employment;  some

can give less; but you cannot force anybody to give  so

much employment, because then it will not be a business

proposition.  But as I say, it is not  only  employment

that  I  have in mind, but also the creation of  wealth

here by additional productivity and the cutting down on

imports, and the retention of that portion of the value

of the goods consumed here which accrues to the outside

manufacturer  through the wages paid to labour.  It  is

true that we can give protection only for the Singapore

market, but an industry is like an infant - you have to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>



give  it  a helping hand when it first learns to  walk.

Once  it  can walk by itself, it can learn  to  run  by



itself.  If you can give an industry a helping hand  in

the  initial stages by giving it a market - even  though

it  may  be small - on which it can rely, then  you  will

give  it an opportunity of expanding later and entering

a  foreign market. But let me assure hon. Members this.

While  we are having compunctions about protection  and



putting  up  barriers here, other countries  have  gone

right  ahead. Sarawak has recently raised the  duty  on

soap,  and  when  the  local  manufacturers  wrote   to

Sarawak,  they said, "Sorry, that is our  policy."  And

here we are, thinking a hundred times about retaliatory

measures  against us. The Ottawa Agreement of 1932  set

up  preferential  treatment  between  the  Commonwealth

countries.  Is  that  not  the creation  of  protective

measures  for  countries in the  Commonwealth?  Anyhow,

Sir,  I  do not admit that any valid argument has  been

put  up for sending this Bill to Select Committee,  but

because  I do not want to come in the way of democratic

procedure, I have no objection if the Bill is  referred

to a Select Committee. But I would like hon. Members to

understand that I would like this measure to be  passed

as  quickly as possible - if possible by the next sitting

of  the Assembly. And, Sir, I would like a ruling  from

you  whether,  since this Bill makes  no  reference  to

tariffs  or  quotas or things like that,  such  matters

would be admissible in Select Committee?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have been asked to rule quite

hypothetically. My answer, of course, is  that  if  and

when  those matters come up in Select Committee, it  is

then that I will give my ruling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>12.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have His Excellency's consent to proceed with this Bill

and move, "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the White Paper on the Report of the

Committee  on Local Government (No. Cmd. 30  of  1956),

Government  indicated its agreement that the  Singapore

Improvement  Trust should cease to exist and  that  the

responsibility for public housing and the comprehensive

development and redevelopment for a variety of purposes

of  areas  of land designated by Government  should  be

laid  on  a  Singapore Development Board  appointed  by

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lines on which the operations of the Board should

be  financed  and thereby controlled by Government  was

indicated  in  a further White Paper, that  on  Housing

Subsidy  Policy, No. Cmd. 6 of 1957. I propose in  this

speech  merely  to  refer to the intention  behind  the

provisions of this Bill without reference to particular

clauses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is designed to be a small one of five

members  who  would  not  be representatives  of  other

bodies   or  authorities,  and  who  would   be   paid.

Membership  of  the  Legislative  Assembly  is  made  a



disqualification as is service with the Government or a

local  authority  within one year before  the  date  of

appointment. The purpose of these measures is to secure

an independent Board which could he responsible only to

Government  and would carry out public policy  as  laid

down by Government. For this purpose also, the Board is

required  to submit for approval all its proposals  and

also  to fix rents for housing accommodation only  with

the approval of the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is further empowered to give the Board directions of a general nature not inconsistent with

the provisions of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other usual methods of control are also prescribed in

the Bill, including the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>



requirement  for the Board to submit an  annual  budget

for  approval by the Minister, to seek the Governor  in

Council's   approval  for  loans  and  the  terms   for

repayment  of  such loans, and to submit  accounts  for

audit by an Auditor nominated by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to these controls, it is intended that the

Board  should  be free to run its own  affairs  and  to

carry  out  its projects in the manner it thinks  best.

The Board will be allowed to pursue its own operational



policy  and all questions regarding such policy  should

be   dealt   with  through  its  own  public  relations

organisation. The allocation of housing should not be a

political issue. The Board will have control of its own

financial  affairs,  subject to the  overall  financial

approval and the grant of an annual Government  housing

subsidy,  and it would be run on business  like  lines,

balancing  its  own income and expenditure  within  the

framework of an agreed subsidy policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended that the Board should be made the

competent  planning authority in new town areas  or  in

areas of comprehensive development so that it would not

be  subject to planning control by the local authority,

but  it would be required to observe the provisions  of

the  Master Plan. Local authority by-laws are also made

inapplicable  to  the  Board.  It  will  be  necessary,

however, for the Board, as at present, to retain proper

liaison,  consultation and agreement with other  bodies

in  order  to  enable  them to  gear  their  activities

accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present system will be continued whereby

Government   acquires  compulsorily  under   the   Land

Acquisition  Ordinance  any  land  required   for   its

projects,  which  it has power to  but  cannot  buy  by

private treaty. The Board is also given power, with the

approval  of  the Minister, to sell, lease,  surrender,

mortgage, exchange or otherwise deal with its land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will appoint a paid Chief Executive Officer

in   charge  of  various  departments  (administrative,

architectural,  engineering,  housing   valuation   and

finance).  The running of the Board could be  left,  by

delegation  of authority from the Board, to  the  Chief

Executive   Officer   and  other  executive   officials

wherever possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rent policy of the Board will be dictated by

that  laid  down in the Government White  Paper  on

Housing  Subsidies. The Authority  would  calculate

economic  rent  taking  into account,  among  other

matters,  the  cost of land, preparation  of  site,

legal  fees, administrative charges and fees, rates

and  taxes,  loan charges, repairs and maintenance.

Government  would  decide, as a matter  of  policy,



what  portion  of income could be appropriated  for

rent in the various income groups and the level  of

rents which should be charged for various types  of

accommodation in respect of each block of houses or

scheme, having regard to the type of person  likely

to occupy them. Government would then pay annually,

by  vote  in the Estimates, the difference  between

the economic rents and the rents derivable from the

implementation of Government policy, thus  enabling

the  Board to balance its housing account  annually

and retaining in the hands of the Assembly power to

control rents and vary the rate of subsidisation of

housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the control of rents exercised by

Government under the above policy, it is considered

unnecessary  that  the  2,000  pre-war   properties

should be subject any further to the protection  of

the  Control of Rent Ordinance. With regard to  any

suggestion of discrimination between the Trust  and

other  private landlords, it should be  noted  that

the   Trust   has  standards  of  supervision   and

maintenance which private landlords do not  attempt

to provide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial procedure of the Board is

determined also by the statement of policy set  out

in the White Paper on Housing Subsidies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government would supply funds at current

rates of interest and periods of repayment in  each

case,  i.e. 60 years for permanent buildings, less,

perhaps 20 years, for others. As at present,  funds

would be advanced in instalments as required on the

basis  of programmes approved by the Assembly.  The

arrangements  would  be purely  commercial  and  in

accordance with accepted practice in such matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be necessary, in order that information

on the financial position of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



the  Trust  may  be easily ascertainable,  for  the

Trust  to keep capital expenditure accounts  and  a

housing income and expenditure account which should

be  in  balance each year, with the annual  housing

subsidy providing the balancing factor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have stated the intentions of Government at

some length because it is necessary to explain  why

the Bill has been drawn up in its present form.  It

is  possible  that hon. Members may not  all  agree

that  these are quite the best provisions  for  the

organisation of the Housing and Development  Board,

and  in  matters of detail, the Government will  be

prepared to listen to any suggestions hon.  Members

may  wish  to bring forward. Indeed, I have  myself

already  received certain suggestions for amendment

which  I have accepted and included in a notice  of

amendment.  It is Government's intention  that  the

Bill  be  committed  to  a  Select  Committee   for

examination.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  Bill  to constitute a Housing and Development

Board,  and the following Bill to provide  for  the

planning and improvement of Singapore, put  an  end

to  a  very  anomalous position  whereby  a  public

body - the  Singapore Improvement Trust - created  for

the  purpose  of  building new  streets,  providing

backlanes and sewers and tearing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



down slums has taken unto itself the burden of building

houses  for  the public of Singapore, as  a  result  of

which it has found itself to be the biggest house-owner

in the whole island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was of course not by design but by necessity that

such  a  situation  has developed; our  population  has

doubled  itself in less than 20 years and  houses  have

been  so short that when the S.I.T. stepped out of  the

purpose  for which it was created and started  building

blocks  of  flats at Tiong Bahru, nobody objected,  and

the  situation  has  been allowed to  slide  until  the

present moment when it is being put on a regular basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two Bills will separate the duties of the

S.I.T. by creating a Housing and Development Board, and

a  planning department. The duties of the Board are set

out in clause 12 of the Bill, which clause reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Subject as hereinafter provided, it shall be the

function and duty of the Board -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to prepare and execute proposals, plans and

projects for -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the erection, conversion, improvement and

extension of housing or other accommodation;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the clearance and redevelopment of slum

areas;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the development or redevelopment of areas

designated by the Minister;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) the development of rural or agricultural

areas  approved  by  the  Minister  for   the

resettlement   of   persons   displaced    by

operations of the Board;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to manage all lands, houses and buildings or other

property vested in or belonging to the Board;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to carry out all investigations and surveys

necessary for the performance of the functions and

duties of the Board;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to do all such other matters and things as are

necessary for the exercise or performance  of  all

or any of the functions and duties of the Board."



<br><br>I  trust  that  by the separation of these  duties  the

Board will be able to concentrate on producing not only

more  houses,  but more houses for the same  amount  of

money  which has been spent in the past, and  that  the

programme will not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



break down as it had done during the past two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we see improvement in the urban areas from the

large number of flats that have been erected, there is

much room for development of the urban districts, which

has hardly begun. There is provision in the Master Plan

for  satellite towns at Serangoon, Woodlands and Bulim,

but  these satellite towns will take a long, long  time

to  build and put into operation, and it will cost such

a  tremendous amount of money which we cannot  see  how

Government is going to find in the foreseeable future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now heavy commitments due to the education

and  social  services. I would recommend to the  Board,

instead  of trying to build houses in these  areas,  to

acquire the land where these towns are situated, cut up

the   land  into  small  lots  after  providing  roads,

services  and sewers, and sell them to the  public,  so

that  this  land  can  either be developed  by  private

investors  or the houses can be built by the purchasers

of  the  land  according  to  their  needs.  It  is  an

impossible task for Government to try to put  up  three

satellite  towns - or even one or two satellite  towns - as

well as develop the houses planned in the City area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a much more urgent and vital duty the Board

can  now perform is to try to control and encourage the

development  of  areas which are  now  already  heavily

settled,  like villages in various parts of  Singapore.

These  areas can now be developed at a minimum  expense



and  can  be  done so rapidly that the  population  can

benefit  by  such development. Actually, in some  areas

the  position has entirely got out of hand. In some  of

these  villages,  so  many  houses  have  been  erected

without  submission of plans, or so  many  houses  have

been extended, one towards the other, that there is now

no room at all for any further planning or development.

The  houses  touch one another. There is no possibility



of  building roads without tearing apart some of  these

houses;  and  there is also a danger  of  fire  because

there   are  no  fire-lanes.  There  is  no  sanitation

whatever;  there are no drains and all the  sewage  and

water runs downhill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are other villages, quite a big number of

them,  where there is still land, sufficient  space  in

between the houses for development to be undertaken  by

the  Housing Trust - by the acquisition of these hundreds

of  acres  of  land straightaway and  having  a  proper

layout  made  so  that the roads and  services  can  be

provided - the plots can be sold to the owners of  houses

who are already on that land. I have gone through quite

a  number of villages. I have spoken to the people  and

they  say  they are very anxious to be able to  possess

the  land on which they live, and I know very well that

they can pay, not enormous sums because it will not  be

necessary.  Landlords,  many landlords,  are  only  too

anxious  to  get  rid of this land at  very  reasonable

prices because they know that at the present moment, in

this   present  era,  they  can  never  obtain   vacant

possession.  Here,  then,  is  a  chance  to  meet  the

desperate housing shortage in a very short time, and  I

would sincerely urge the Minister for Local Government,

Lands and Housing to consider this point of view



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will find it increasingly difficult to get

the  funds which the S.I.T. has obtained throughout the

past  years to build multi-storeyed flats, but I  think

this problem can partially be solved by a new approach.

This  morning, the Hon, the Minister said  that  he  is



considering the removal of protection under the Control

of  Rent Ordinance for prewar built flats, flats  built

by  the  S.I.T., such as the 2,500 flats in  the  Tiong

Bahru  area.  I  know this is going to create  quite  a

furore and that I am stepping on a hornets' nest, but I

think there is justification for this point of view. As

we  know,  much  of the Tiong Bahru  area  is  now  not

populated by the people for whom the S.I.T. was created

and  for whom these houses were intended. Through  good

fortune  and  hard work, many of the people  who  lived

there  pre-war are now either businessmen or  in  well-established  positions. Again, during  the  Occupation,

many  of the original tenants sold out and these  flats

are now occupied by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>



merchants  and, shall I say, fairly well-to-do  people.

And  this anyone can see by taking a drive through  the



crowded  streets at night when he can see  plush  cars,

very  valuable cars, jammed all along the footway. Sir,

I  would  make  a suggestion - instead of trying  to  in-crease  the rent of these flats, would it not be better

to  sell  these 2,500 flats to some of the tenants  who

can  afford  to buy them? For instance, if we  were  to

value  a  flat at $12,000, and that is a modest  figure

today  because  private estates are now offering  flats

built  in  the town for $24,000 each and it  will  only

cost  less  than one-quarter of the proposed flats  for

the  doctors  at Kandang Kerbau - when you  compare  with

these   figures,  it  is  very  reasonable  to   charge

$12,000 - $12,000  times 2,500 flats  means  $30,000,000.

There  you have your problem of financing this  housing



solved for the next year. If Government is prepared  to

accept  payment by instalments over four to five years,

I  am sure half of these flats would be sold in no time

because  they are well worth the value. And  there  you

have  a means of proceeding with housing, you will find

the means to fight the housing shortage, by disposal of

these flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons the Hon. the Minister says why he

had  to take away these flats from the Control of  Rent

Ordinance  is  because Government has to  pay  quite  a

considerable   sum   for   their   administration   and

maintenance. Actually at the present day, no owner of a

pre-war  built  house ever maintains the  house  as  it

costs  him three times pre-war to repair it;  you  will

never  get  him  to  do it. Under the circumstances,  I

think  my  suggestion is a very reasonable  one.  I  am

suggesting that the housing authority, instead of being

a landlord alone, which it is today, should also assume

the responsibility of selling flats and undertaking the

subdivision  of  land for sale in rural  areas  to  the

people who live in the villages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these few remarks which I hope will be

helpful  to  the  Housing  and  Development  Board   in

carrying out its arduous duties for the improvement  of

Singapore, I heartily support this Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the explanatory statement of this Bill begins by

saying:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The White Paper on the Report of the Committee

on  Local Government (No. Cmd. 30 of 1956) declared

Government's policy that the Singapore  Improvement

Trust   should   cease  to  exist  and   that   the

responsibility   for   public   housing   and   the

comprehensive development and redevelopment, for  a

variety  of purposes, should be laid on a Singapore

Development Board appointed by the Government."



<br><br>Sir, I think we can remember that when the Minister

for  Local Government, Lands and Housing tabled the

White  Paper, he met with the unanimous support  of

this  House.  It  is high time  not  only  for  the

Government  to  recognise that  the  S.I.T. should

cease to operate, but also to bear in mind to learn

a  bitter lesson from the S.I.T. As the Member  for

Paya  Lebar  just  mentioned, the S.I.T. flats  in

Tiong  Bahru  or  somewhere else only  benefit  the

middle  class or upper class, who are not only  car

owners  but also - and this is a well-known fact - find

it  the best place to keep their second wives. Sir,

that  is the S.I.T. policy and therefore it is high

time  for  the Government really to learn a  bitter

lesson from it. They must admit that the S.I.T. has

been negligent in the past of one responsibility as

stated - Public housing and comprehensive development

and redevelopment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I expect this Bill will be supported

unanimously   by  this  House,  I  wish   to   make

suggestions  to  the Government to  consider  about

land clearance which, as we have learnt, has become

a  really  hard  thing to overcome. The  Government

want  to carry out the policy but find it very hard

to remove the so-called squatters, who are actually

attap-house dwellers. So why do the Government  not

think out a policy to select a big piece of land in

their hands, say in Kranji, Lim Chu Kang, Chua  Chu

Kang  or Ayer Gumeroh, where there is still  plenty

of  land  possessed by Government, places  which  I

think Government will take a long time to think  of

developing?  Why  not  make one  such  place  as  a

settlement for attap-house dwellers, where they can

find a place to build their own homes as they wish?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>



Instead  of this, they just issue notices  to  quit

with  what  we  believe  to be  adequate  sums  for

compensation.  And where do they go to?  Where  can

they  go  to  find  another  piece  of  land?   The

Government  already find it hard to let attap-house

dwellers  settle  on  Government  land.  How  about

private  landowners? They are  also  aware  of  the

hardship  to  get  rid of them for  their  further

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I sincerely wish the Government will seriously

consider  this point. It is wise to have Government

land reserved for farmers and workers who intend to

build  their  own  attap  huts.  You  can  issue  a

Temporary Occupation Licence or anything  else  you

like to let them have a roof of their own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Labour Coalition Government is a so-called Socialistic Government; please prove it to

the people.



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  personally welcome the introduction of this Bill

and my opinion is that it is high time that the new

Board  should  take  over  the  functions  of   the

Singapore   Improvement  Trust  and  make   drastic

changes in the running of this new set-up. Look  at

the  record  of the S.I.T. for the last few  years.

What  have  they done? What I know is that  in  the



year  1955,  the  number of people  on  their  list

waiting  for  Trust accommodation  was  well  below

6,000.  Today,  the  list has increased  to  14,500

people waiting for Trust accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no use to talk. What the people need is

employment and a house where they can live.  It  is

not a question of just sending in an application to

the  S.I.T. because back will come the reply  that

they  are  unable to comply with the request.  They

have  adopted  this as a common  practice.  On  all

letters they will put, 'There is no possibility  in

the foreseeable future of offering assistance', and

the  applicant has to wait so many years, maybe the

next  few  years. That is the very common  sentence

used by the S.I.T. today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister said this morning, Sir, that the

waiting  list is due to the increase in population.

Do you not think, Sir, that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>



it is his duty to look or to probe into the workings of

the   S.I.T. instead  of  sitting  inside   his   air-conditioned office?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another factor is that today you know very well

the S.I.T. has spent the taxpayers' money, millions  of

them,   but  what  have  they  erected?  Multi-storeyed

buildings. Visitors from overseas who come to Singapore

look at our multi-storeyed buildings. Behind it is  the

spending of so many millions. If you were to give me so

many  millions,  I could produce far better  buildings.

And  besides  that, look at the Upper Pickering  Street



multi-storeyed flats they are so proud of. Besides them

they erected a row of garages to house the tuan besars,

the  "big shots", the bigwigs of the S.I.T. To  prevent

what? - so that their cars will not go rusty, or the rain

will  not  fall,  or the sun will not shine,  on  their

cars.  That is nonsense. I put my car outside,  in  the

open. And the garage itself is an eyesore. I invite the

hon. Members of this House to go to the Upper Pickering

Street flats. Look at the garages. They are an eyesore.

It  is  a disgrace to the S.I.T., and to the Government



as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another instance, Sir; only last month they

removed  four pillars in the garages behind  the  nine-storeyed  flats along Upper Pickering Street,  just  to

suit  the  convenience of the officers working  in  the

S.I.T. because there is one-way traffic and they had to

go  through Hokkien Street along South Bridge Road  and

Upper  Cross  Street back to their  homes  in  Tanglin,

where they have big houses and palatial homes. Just  to

suit  their  convenience,  they  removed  the  pillars.

Someone  protested.  They  put  the  pillars  back  but



eventually  they removed them. Three times the  pillars

were  removed  and  replaced. That cost  the  taxpayers

money.  I would remind the Minister to investigate  how

much money they have spent on removing the pillars  and

paving the ground behind the nine-storeyed building. It

is a shame all right!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the walls along the rows of nine-storeyed

buildings,  the  Nos.  3, 5, 7,  9,  11,  13  of  Upper

Pickering  Street.  The  other  day  I  saw  the  walls

crumbling  down and they were not made with cement  but

sand;  and  the S.I.T., I was told, spent thousands  of

dollars to patch



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



up the walls. What happened to the walls? Why could not

proper  supervision  be made of the  erection  of  this

building? Instead of cement for the walls, now we  have

sand and they crumble down!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I must remind the hon.

Member  that he is addressing the Chair; the  Chair  is

being intimidated!



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> The one thing I can say about the

S.I.T, is the "super duper" methods they use by issuing

notices  to quit to the tenants of the S.I.T. flats  in

Singapore today. If they were to owe rent for one week,

two  weeks, they will receive quit notices, and on  top

of that they will be made to pay the bill within the 14-day  period  and also pay a sum of over $10  for  stamp

duty;  a  shop has to pay over $30. As you  say,  these

people who live in S.I.T. houses are all moderately off

or  they are poor families. To make them pay $10 or $30

is  really  a hardship to these people. Some  of  these

families are really living from hand to mouth and I  do

not agree -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Point of

explanation, Sir. We were just informed a moment ago by

the  Liberal-Socialist Member for Paya Lebar  that  the

people who reside in S.I.T. houses, particularly in the

Tiong  Bahru  area,  have  big  cars  and  are  wealthy

persons. Now we are told by the Member for Tiong  Bahru

that  they are living from hand to month. Sir, we  must

get  these facts straight; two conflicting views coming

from the same Party is a bit odd.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> The People's Action Party want to

play to the Gallery. They talk about big cars and small

cars. My colleague just said there are rows of cars. If

you  go to any street in Singapore today, you will find

rows  of cars, whether big cars or small cars.  I  will

defy him; I am willing to spend time, even though it is

wasting time, to bring him along to any street of Tiong

Bahru,  and  I can show to him any family where  it  is

said  that  they own million-dollar cars. He should  be

ashamed of himself -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member may only speak if the Member

speaking will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> I am not going to give way. He can

have his say later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, they are very fond of issuing notices to

quit  and make the poor people pay more money on  stamp

duty.  The  thing  is  that the  S.I.T. make  periodic

investigations, that is, regular inspections, into  all

households. These have been spied on. It is worse  than

the  Kempetai; it is worse than the Gestapo, worse than

the  secret police. Why should they go and spy  on  the

houses?  Six  o'clock  in the morning,  seven  o'clock,

eight  o'clock and nine o'clock; they even  go  to  the

extent  of going to the house at eleven o'clock in  the

night  to check whether the families are staying  there

or  not! They have a system of checking but to knock at

the  tenants'  flats, to knock at the doors  at  eleven

o'clock  in the night - I am asking hon. Members of  this

House,  is  that not a shame? They are not thieves.  If

they  have any evidence that these people are  not  the

tenants,  they can issue them a notice or ask  them  to

clear  off. But instead, they are spying on them  every

moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am coming back to the S.I.T. You know, I think

all  the hon. Members of this House are aware that  the

Upper  Pickering Street flats have got the nickname  of

"suicide  flats".  When  these flats  were  built,  the

S.I.T. or  whoever run the office, refused to  put  up

wire-netting,  so  much so that  over  a  dozen  people

jumped  to their death. All these dead have dependants.

They  have  their  suffering. And after  over  a  dozen



deaths, the S.I.T. decided to put up wire-netting.  But

before  that,  look at the centre block  of  the  S.I.T.

flats  for  the  officers.  Displayed  on  top  of  the



buildings  is all wire-netting. Why? Because  the  tuan

besars are staying there, they have wire-netting.  That

means  they consider Asian lives very cheap.  The  tuan

besars  living  in the flats on top of these  offices

are  more  worthy. Is it because their lives  are  more

valuable than our lives? So much so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



that after so many deaths did the S.I.T. at last decide

to put wire-netting, and there is no more suicide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a very important Bill, and about the

five  members to be appointed on the Board I would urge

the  Minister  to appoint persons with experience,  not

those who have a sort of tendency to say 'yes' to every

move   the   Government  takes.   Besides   that,   the

appointment  is  for three years. We want  people  with

experience  to run or to control the functions  of  the

new Board, not to fill it up with 'yes-men'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am also glad the number of members of the new

Board  will  be  reduced  to five,  because  that  will

simplify matters to carry out the job more smoothly; as

we  know,  we have a saying, 'Too many cooks spoil  the

soup.' On the Trust, we have so many people running the

Department, so much so that they do not know  where  to

go  and  what to do, and with no experience  whatsoever

the whole Department actually was run by the expatriate

officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Sir, I will relate an incident

that  happened  in one of the S.I.T. offices  on  23rd

August.  I brought a school teacher from the  Kong  Wah

School,  Guillemard Road, to see one  of  the  officers

about  the  progress of her application made  in  1956.

This  case  was actually handled by the Hon.  Assistant



Minister,  Mr  M. P. D. Nair. When  I  went  into  the

office to interview -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I just want to indicate that a

Member  of this Assembly should not be referred  to  by

name.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> I went with the school teacher and

after  the  formal introduction I told the  officer  in

charge  that  this was a case handled by the  Assistant

Minister, Mr M. P. D. Nair



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. A Member must not be addressed by

his name.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Sorry, Sir, the Member for Seletar.

And  the officer of the S.I.T. told me straight  to  my



face  that  he could not care less who is the Minister,

Assistant Minister or Assemblyman.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Quite right!



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Sir, this was the attitude of an

official,  of  a  public official, particularly  in

front of a third witness! I went on to ask him  why

he  had  such  an  opinion, and  he  told  me  that

recently,  an  Assemblyman in  this  House  made  a

libelous  attack on the S.I.T. and since  then,  he

told  me,  he  had no faith in or respect  for  any

Assemblyman.  I  asked him,  'Well,  if  it  is  an

Assemblyman who attacked the S.I.T., it is  for  the

Minister who is in charge to reply to the charges',

and  he  replied that if the Minister did not  know

the  ins and outs of the affairs of the S.I.T., how

could  he,  the Minister, reply to the  charges?  I

told  him that if he did not like everyone  of  us,

the  best thing for him was to resign and quit  his

job,  to which he told me that he would do so  and,

as a matter of fact, he was considering it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are elected Members of the Assembly. If a

public  official or officer can speak like this  in

front  of  an  elected  representative,  what  will

happen to those people who have no official backing

who  go  to  make enquiries about the progress  of

their applications? They will be ignored or will be

driven   out  with  meagre  excuses  or  no  excuse

whatsoever! This is the present situation, Sir,  in

the S.I.T.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not like to go on and on about the

misdeeds  of  the  S.I.T. but I have  to  urge  the

Minister  when he comes to the appointment  of  the

five  members to the Board: he will carefully  make

his  selection of experienced people who  know  all

the  ins  and  outs, as the officer  said,  of  the

affairs of the S.I.T. So I earnestly urge him to be

very, very careful in selecting these five members.

I strongly support this Bill, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I like the idea of this Bill, the idea of improving

Singapore, the idea of making it into a more

beautiful place, the idea of giving more houses to

the people. Certainly, Sir, when we talk about slum

clearing, we are talking about the attap houses,

and we are talking about so many people living in

small cubicles. But I am certain, Sir, that nobody

likes to live in attap houses and nobody likes to

live in little cubicles. But why are there so many

attap houses and why are there so many people

living in little cubicles? There is only one

reason, and that reason is they have not got the

land on which to build their own houses. I am

certain, Sir, that if we find a dilapidated attap

house, it is not because the man cannot afford to

repair it, or likes it to be in that shape. In his

mind, he always thinks, 'No matter how I repair it,

or how beautiful I make it, sooner or later a quit

notice will come; sooner or later I will be asked

by the Government to give up my house and land.'

Where is the incentive for that man to add

improvements to his house?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the experience, Sir, of knowing a little

plot  of land built up with many huts by squatters.

These squatters came together; they put their money



together;  and  they  bought that  piece  of  land.

Immediately afterwards, they improved their houses,



and  I would say, Sir, that those attap houses were

not  at  all  bad dwelling places after  they  were

repaired properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attap houses built properly, with proper

sanitation  put in are definitely much better  than

the flats we have in town. At least they are cooler

and they can be very attractive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the hon. Member for Paya Lebar, has

put   this   idea  to  Government  and  asked   the

Government to buy land, show a lead and give  these

attap  house  dwellers a chance to  buy  their  own

land.  If  that  scheme  is pushed  forward,  I  am

certain that it will solve our housing problem to a

very  great  extent.  I  am also  certain  that  if

Government  can give those who live in  slum  areas

now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



plots  of  land on which to build their own  little

houses, they will certainly put in all they have to

make  the  place  they live in, decent,  clean  and

bright.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today in Singapore, I feel that it is time that

everybody  should  have a stake in  the  land  they

live.  It  would be a big step forward if everybody

owns  a  little  piece of land. I  am  certain  the

housing  problem  will be eased  to  a  very  great

extent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not let us make the people help themselves

instead  of  preventing  the  people  from  helping

themselves  and  waiting for  Government  to  build

S.I.T. flats?  After  all,  you  can  never  build

enough. After all, you can never catch up with  the

requirements. Let the people have a hand!

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, a Bill which is primarily

designed  to define the structure and functions  of

the new Housing and Development Board has given  us

the   opportunity   to  hear  a   debate   on   the

shortcomings  of  the  officers  of  the  Singapore

Improvement Trust, on general theories of property-owning  democracies, and on how to  make  everybody

else  have  a stake in the land, and generally,  to

befuddle  ourselves  with the  problems  that  this

Housing and Development Board will have to face. It

is  no use denigrating the S.I.T. and its officials

if  the Housing and Development Board and the  five

persons who are going to constitute it are going to

be  lifted  out from the S.I.T. and  put  into  the

Housing  and Development Board. Members will  still

be  constantly  bedeviled by the Member  for  Tiong

Bahru  regaling us with his unfortunate  encounters

with  Trust  officers and Housing  and  Development

Board  officers,  and the disrespectful  manner  in

which they deal with Assemblymen generally and with

Ministers in particular.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain problems stand out, and the only thing

that  this  Bill does is to sharpen the  instrument

which  has to be used in dealing with the problems.

The  problem is how, with the resources  available,



and   the   national  income  of   the   State   of

Singapore - the State to come - we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>



to  build  enough houses on the land available,  to

house  as  many as possible of the rapidly  growing

population. That problem will not be solved by this

theory  of selling flats to those who live in  them

and taking the money and building other flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is primarily a problem of raising the national

income of the Colony, or the State of Singapore  as

it  will be; of seeing that the national income  is

used  in  the interests of all the people  and  not

just of a wealthy few, and, what is most important,

of getting an efficient housing authority that will

be  able, with the limited resources that  will  be

available to it, to produce maximum results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S.I.T. is to be buried when this Bill comes

into   operation.  I  think  it  will   always   be

remembered for as long as the skyscrapers stand  in

Forfar House and the other multi-storeyed flats  in

Singapore. I do not believe they are all  going  to

crumble down as rapidly as was feared by the Member

for  Tiong  Bahru.  But the  S.I.T. will  also  be

remembered for a policy which was not suited to the

needs  of  this  island. I  had  the  advantage  of

starting  my professional career here,  sitting  in

the shadow of the legal adviser to the S.I.T. and I

used to meet these eminent gentlemen, very powerful

people, who from time to time foregathered  in  the

conference   room  of  their  legal   adviser   and

discussed  the  problems of the  City.  They  never

believed  they were going to solve them, but  their

predominant  intention was to make sure  that  what

they  built  did  not subsequently degenerate  into

slums. Well that is a worthy objective, but because

they did not understand the pressure that would  be

put  on  the Government when housing is short,  and

when   a  Government  is  susceptible  to  pressure

because  it is elected, they have left  in  fact  a

legacy  of  no-confidence in the housing  authority

which  they represented. This Bill does  not  solve

any  of these problems and the advice given by  the

Member   for   Paya  Lebar  to  the   Housing   and

Development Board which is to be created  will  not

solve the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, we have to ask ourselves whether or not

this  island can, with a population growing at  the

rate  of  4  per  cent  per annum,  and  an  annual

increase



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>



in the available working population of about 27,000

of the children who are growing up to reach 17, 18,

19  and  enter the labour market, be able  to  keep

pace with our economic development to maintain them

at  that  standard of living which  can  provide  a

decent semi permanent or permanent structure  of  a

house  to  live in. And if that is not possible  of

solution,  then all the clever schemes and  devices

suggested will not solve it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems have got to be faced at its root

bottom.  The  population  problem  has  got  to  be

tackled. Either we check it or we emigrate  to  the

wilds of the Federation to help open up the forests

there, either legally or illegally. Secondly,  such

as  do  remain here must be accommodated  into  the

economy  by  jobs. And then, lastly,  we  can  talk

about dividing the land and letting everybody own a

little  piece in order that he will find  it  worth

while  to build on it. Today I would like  just  to

remind the Member for Serangoon that people do  not

build houses, not because they do not own the land,

but  because  they have not got the wherewithal  to

buy  the building materials and the skilled  labour

necessary  to put up the houses. If they had,  they

would  build  them  whether it was  their  land  or

rented land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem goes down back finally to the

survival  of  this  island in a  changed  political

situation, not only Malaya vis-a-vis Singapore, but

in the whole of South-East Asia, and this Bill only

provides  us  with the instrument.  It  is  a  more

efficient instrument but I must not let  it  go  by

just  like  that. It has taken two  years  to  come

about.  Why it has taken two years I do  not  know,

and I would be sorry to hear that the Minister also

does not know what is going on. I hope that in  his

reply he will tell us why it has taken two years in

the  making,  and perhaps assure us that  the  time

spent in contemplating over the provisions of  this

Bill is time that was spent wisely and effectively,

in order that we will have a housing authority with

all  the  adequate powers to deal with the problems

of  (1)  slum clearance; (2) squatter resettlement;

and (3) problems of finance and building.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I was told this morning that this Bill would be

referred to a Select Committee and I had thought

that it would be best to speak on the Bill after

receiving the report of the Select Committee rather

than to refer to the Bill now. But after hearing

the points put forward by the Member for Tiong

Bahru, I am most particularly interested in clause

33 of the Bill, which clause reads in part:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) Upon the coming into operation of this

Ordinance,   every   officer   of   the   Singapore

Improvement Trust, not being an officer exclusively

engaged  in the planning functions of the Singapore

Improvement   Trust,  shall   be   deemed   to   be

transferred to the service of the Board at the same

rate  of  pay and, as near as may be, on  the  same

conditions  of service, as those on  which  he  was

employed by the Singapore Improvement Trust."



<br><br>We  have  heard from the Member for Tiong Bahru  of

the  attitude  and the manner of the officers,  how

they run the S.I.T., and if all those officers  now

on  the Trust shall be deemed to be transferred  to

the  Board, I wonder what difference it would  make

to  the Board. If the administration of the present

Trust  is  run by a set of officers whose  attitude

and  administration of the Trust is not  acceptable

to  this  Assembly,  I cannot understand  that  the

transfer of the same officers to this Board can  be

accepted by this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present administration of the Trust, as

everyone  knows, is top-secret. The points  system,

everyone  knows, is top-secret. As the  Member  for

Tiong Bahru rightly pointed out, the number on  the

waiting  list has increased to 14,000 but how  many

of  these  14,000 do know when they can  expect  to

have  allocation? The reply always  given  is  that

there  is  no possible assistance in the very  near

future. What difference would it make, I would like

to know; and I would like also the Minister to tell

us  the  actual difference it could  make  to  this

Board  if the complete setup of the S.I.T. officers

is to be transferred. I would suggest that when the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>



Board  comes  into  operation, all officers  should  be

subject  to  review  and should be  placed  before  the

Public  Service Commission before they are accepted  as

officers of the Board.

<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad to note

that  Members of the Opposition generally  support  the

Bill just now before the House, but unfortunately I  am

somewhat in disagreement with them with regard to their

criticisms  of  its officers and the  workings  of  the

Singapore  Improvement Trust, not because I agree  with

what is happening now in the offices of the S.I.T. but

because  I,  as  Minister for Housing  at  the  present

moment,  have  in fact no proper or no  direct  control

over  the  workings or over the Trustees of the  S.I.T.

and naturally I do not have the direct control over the



habits, or shall we say the inconsistencies if at  all,

that are now prevalent in the S.I.T.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I should like to answer some of the

points  raised by Members of the Opposition.  First,  I

would  take the Member for Paya Lebar. He has suggested

that  the  Government should buy up land  in  satellite

towns,  cut  it  up  and probably sell  it  to  private

investors, who would develop the land, build houses and

sell them to the public. Well, Sir, I disagree entirely

with this because I honestly and sincerely feel that it

is  the  duty of Government in the long run to  provide

the  necessary housing, particularly in what are called

new  towns  or satellite towns, as this is  within  the

scheme  which  the present Government has envisaged  in

the Master Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, there is now no restriction at all

being  placed  by Government on private development  in

Singapore.  As  a  matter of fact,  it  has  encouraged

private developers to build as many houses as possible,

but  unfortunately it has been the tendency in the past

for private developers to build houses costing probably

$15,000  or $20,000 or even more, which cater  not  for

the type of people which Government would like to help,

but purely for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



those who can afford either from their own pockets,  or

who  can  afford to borrow from building societies,  to

meet their needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to the question of selling flats in Tiong

Bahru; well, that is a wonderful idea. I think we  will

probably try to do something about it but, on the other

hand, Sir, the Member for Paya Lebar suggests that  the

sale of these houses would probably rake in a total  of

$13,000,000 and this would help to finance the  Housing

and  Development Board for the next few years. Well,  I

think he is a bit out because this year alone, Sir,  we

are  spending  more  than $23,000,000  on  our  housing

programme.  So $13,000,000 at this rate of  expenditure

would  probably  mean a six months' building  programme

for the Board. However, I shall look into it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Changi, he seems to think,

Sir,  that  Government has plenty of land in Singapore.

Well,  this is all nonsense because if he were to  read



this  year's  Estimates,  he  will  discover  that  the

Government of Singapore is spending millions of dollars

in  the  purchase  of  land  not  only  for  Government

schemes,  but also for S.I.T. buildings,  and  for  the

resettlement  of  farmers all  over  the  island.  This

latter  scheme is going on in full swing and we believe

millions more would be spent on this programme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Point of clarification, Sir,I

wish  the  Minister  to know that I named  places  like

Kranji  or  Ayer  Gemuroh. Do those  places  belong  to

Government  or not? I think certain people  staying  in

Kranji have received notices from S.I.T. to quit  after

they  had  put  up a certain amount of money  to  build

attap  houses and had stayed there for over two  years.

Now  the  S.I.T. say, 'No, you must quit.' Therefore  I



want  the  Minister to consider particular places  like

Ayer Gemuroh and Kranji.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Well, I was talking generally but

if  the Member for Changi has any particular pet scheme

I  will be only too willing to give him time to see  me

in my office.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> One of the points which I will not

accept - I think the Member for Changi said it - is that it

is  the policy of the S.I.T. to house second and  third

wives  of  millionaires. This is again another  of  the

nonsensical statements that have cropped up  from  time

to  time. It is not the policy of the S.I.T. to do  so;

it  is  the policy of the S.I.T. to build as many  low-cost  houses  as possible for the people of  Singapore,

and not to house second, third or fourth wives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Queenstown, Sir, he has

made  many  damaging remarks against employees  of  the

S.I.T. One question he did ask was, 'What is the record

of  the Singapore Improvement Trust? What has it done?'

Well, I will tell him this, Sir; the S.I.T. by the  end

of this year will -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Point of correction, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister has not given way.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> I made a mistake, I should not have

said the Member for Queenstown, Sir, but the Member for

Tiong Bahru. Well, he has asked the question and I will

tell  him this, that by the end of the year, the S.I.T.

will  have  completed  20,000  houses -  20,000  housing



units - and  in these 20,000 houses there will be  living

no   less  than  10  per  cent  of  the  population  of

Singapore. And I can tell you this, Sir, that very  few

countries  in  the world can boast of  such  a  record,

where  10 per cent of its population live in Government

subsidised houses.

<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>



have  His Excellency's consent to proceed with the Bill

and  I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill which is a companion to the previous

Bill,  the Housing and Development Board Bill, had  its

genesis  in the White Paper on Local Government  Policy

(No.  Cmd.  30  of 1956) which was published  following

upon  the  McNeice Report on Local Government.  In  its

statement of policy in paragraph 3 (2), pages 2  and  3

of  the  Paper, Government indicated that  it  did  not

accept  wholly  the McNeice Committee's recommendations

that  the administration of the planned use of  land,

involving control of development and the preparation of

detailed  plans  should  be the responsibility  of  the

local  authorities. It further stated as follows  if  I

may read, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government considers that for the time being a

Town  Planning Department should be set  up  under  the

Ministry  of  Local Government, Lands  and  Housing  to

advise  all  local  authorities  and  do  the  detailed

planning.  Local authorities should have full authority

to  make  decisions on plans submitted which  would  be

taken  after  receiving the advice (but not necessarily

be   in  conformity  with  it)  of  the  Town  Planning

Department.  An  appeal  can  be  made  direct  to  the

Minister   from  individuals  dissatisfied   with   the

decisions  of  the  local  authorities.  It   is   also

considered   that   in  due  course   of   time,   when

practicable, the Town Planning Department  should  hand

over  its  records to the local authorities, who  would

then  be  directly responsible for local planning,  due

regard being paid to the provisions of the Master Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also agreed that the Minister should have

powers of arbitration and direction in planning matters

and  that the administration of the Master Plan  should

be  administered  by Government. It is also  considered

that  the  Minister should be granted powers to  permit

him  to take independent advice in planning matters  at

the  five-yearly reviews of the Master Plan and at such

other  times as he considers necessary but without  any

obligation on his part to do so."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill now before this House merely attempts

to give flesh to the skeletal structure proposed in the

White   Paper   on  Local  Government.   The   Planning

organisation  may,  however,  still  not   be   readily

apparent  from  the  provisions of the  Planning  Bill.

Clause 3 of the Bill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



provides  merely  that such person or  persons  as  the

Governor  in-Council thinks fit may  be  appointed  the

Competent  Authority or the Competent  Authorities  for

the  operation of the Ordinance either generally or  in

relation to any particular section of the Ordinance.  I

should therefore explain that the administration of the

Planning  Bill will lie with several bodies -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first

of these bodies will be a

Government  Planning Department under the  Ministry  of

Local   Government,  Lands  and  Housing  which'   will

comprise  three  divisions  made  up  of  the   present

Singapore Improvement Trust divisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the Master Plan Division which will be

responsible  for the preparation and  revision  of

the Master Plan under its Planning Adviser;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the Replanning Division which will be responsible

for  interpretation and detailed planning  of  the

Master   Plan,   and   give   advice   to    local

authorities;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the Development Control Division which will be

responsible  for  controlling  development   under

plans  submitted  by  private  persons  and   will

advise local authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second of the bodies responsible for the

administration  of the Bill are the local  authorities,

who will be made Competent Authorities for the purposes

of  sections 8, 9 to 14 of the Planning Bill  in  their

respective local authority areas, except for new  towns

or  areas of comprehensive redevelopment which will  be

administered by the Housing and Development Board.  The

local  authority when appointed will have its authority

limited  to  the  following extent and manner.  In  the

preliminary  phase,  the local authority  will  act  in

accordance  with the advice of the Planning  Department

(Replanning  or  Development  Control  Division).  This

limitation  is  made to enable the local  authority  to

gain  experience and become familiar with the procedure

and  principles  of the control of development.  It  is

expected,  Sir, that in the case of the  City  Council,

the  preliminary phase will only last a few months.  In

the  second  phase,  the local authority  will  act  in

consultation with, but not necessarily in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



accordance  with  the  advice  of,  the   Planning

Department.   In  the  third  phase,   the   local

authority  will be solely responsible for  control

of  development. This third phase will be  reached

when  the records and such staff as may be agreed,

can  be  separated and transferred to  each  local

authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already indicated, Sir, that the Housing

and   Development  Board  will  be  the  Competent

Authority for the purposes of sections 9 to 14 in

respect  of  new towns and areas of  comprehensive

redevelopment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there will be my own Ministry, the

Ministry  of Local Government, Lands and  Housing,

assisted by a separate inspectorate, if necessary,

to  deal  with  appeals  to the  Minister  against

planning decisions and to give independent  advice

if required to the Minister on planning matters at

the  five-yearly reviews of the Master Plan or  at

such  other times as the Minister may consider  it

necessary. It has, I know, been a source  of  some

dissatisfaction  that  the Trust  has,  under  the

present  legislation, rather extensive powers  and

that  their  decisions are not subject to  appeal.

This  has  been necessary in the past  before  the



publication  of the Master Plan,  but  it  is  now

possible  to provide dissatisfied owners with  the

right  of  appeal against what they  may  consider

unreasonable decisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now touch upon one matter which has, no

doubt, exercised the minds of many owners, namely,

the  question  of  compensation  for  lands  which

suffer  depreciation in value as a result  of  the

restrictions  or  provisions of the  Master  Plan.

This  is  a  question  of considerable  difficulty



which  has not been solved satisfactorily  in  any

other  legislation. In the original United Kingdom

planning   legislation,  liability  for   payments

because  of  depreciation in values were  accepted

but   they  were  only  accepted  because  it  was

intended  to  recoup such payments by charges  for

betterment  of  lands  for  which  permission   to

develop  was given under the planning legislation.

It  has  now  been  found impracticable,  Sir,  to



recover  betterment charges which  have  therefore

had    to   be   dropped.   After   very   careful

consideration, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



Government  has decided that as there was  equally

no  practicable  way  of  collecting  charges  for

betterment  in  Singapore, it  cannot  accept  the

principle  of compensation. To owners who  may  be

disappointed by such a decision, I would point out

that none of the provisions of the Master Plan can

really be said to be of a permanent nature,  since

it would be subject to revision at the five-yearly

reviews  and it would also be open to  any  future

Government  to  alter  or even  scrap  the  Master

Plan - not  that  I  think this latter  decision  is

likely, as the Master Plan has been the result  of

considerable  survey and study. I would  say  also

that   the   principle  must  be   accepted   that

Government  is  not normally bound  to  compensate

parties who suffer incidental loss as a result  of

State  action  designed for  the  benefit  of  the

population  as a whole. A provision has,  however,

been  made  in clause 15, to require,  in  certain

limited  cases,  the Government to purchase  land.

This  is  intended  to  provide  that  where,  for



example, a developer has been required to  provide

an  open  space or school in a development  estate

and  has otherwise completed his development,  the

remaining public purpose areas should be acquired,

where  the land is required within five years  and

is not capable of reasonably beneficial use in its

existing state.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need say any more about the

Bill as the provisions will be clear from the full

Explanatory  Statement which  has  been  furnished

with  the Bill. I should add, however, that I have

given notice of certain amendments which are to be

made  in Select Committee to which this Bill  will

be committed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Sir, as this Bill

is  going to Select Committee, I do not propose to

say anything in detail. There are only two salient

features which I would like to point out  to  this

Assembly,  particularly  to  Members  who  may  be

chosen to sit on the Select Committee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One big feature in respect of the Singapore

Improvement  Trust  was  the complaint - bitter  in  many

cases - of  delays in the passing of plans some of  which

took  as  long  as  two years. The  Hon, the  Minister

mentioned that possibly the delay was partly due to the

Master  Plan. I hope that is true but in order to  meet

the  requirements of this town and to help  people  who

wish to develop Singapore and not be frustrated by long

delays of one or two years, it is imperative that plans

should  be  passed - especially  subdivision  plans  - for

development  within three months. One  very  disturbing

feature  is clause 14 (1) of this Bill which says  that

if permission to develop any land or subdivision of any

land is refused, and if he is aggrieved by the decision

of  the Competent Authority may appeal to the Minister.

Sir, no decision is given as to whether the appeal will



go   to   Government  officials  only  or  to  a  Board

consisting of architects and persons who are versed  in

the  planning  of  the  town.  This  is  a  very  vital

assurance which I hope the Minister will give us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also very considerable change in the period

under  which a plan has to be passed. Clause 9 (11)  on

page 8 of the Bill says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If within three months from the date of receipt by

the   Competent   Authority  of  an   application   for

permission  to  develop  or  subdivide  any  land   the

Competent  Authority  has neither granted  nor  refused

such permission the application shall be deemed to have

been  refused  and  the applicant  may  appeal  to  the

Minister  in accordance with the provisions or  section

14 of this Ordinance."



<br><br>Sir,  I am afraid that a new provision like this  is  a

total  departure  from  the  previous  section  in  the

Singapore Improvement Ordinance and instead of  helping

plans  to be passed rapidly, this may tend to get  some

of these plans forgotten altogether. Under the previous

section,  if a plan has not been approved within  three

months and if the Competent Authority has not seen  fit

to  make demands on the person submitting the plan  for

further  detail,  the  plan  is  deemed  to  have  been

approved.  I  think  that is a much  more  satisfactory

provision whereby if a plan is not re-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>



jected,   due  to  the  carelessness  of  the  Planning

Department,  then  it  should be deemed  to  have  been

approved  instead of it being deemed to be  disapproved

altogether. It would also mean throwing the  burden  on

the  person  submitting  the  plan  to  appeal  to  the

Minister,  and  no time is given in  this  Bill  as  to

within  what period an appeal may be heard. It  may  be

that  by  the time the plan is discovered or remembered

again  six  months have passed and then the appeal  may

take  another six months. In this way, two years  would

have  then  elapsed before anything was  done.  Sir,  I

think  that this new provision is not going to help  us

at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to bring before this

Assembly  is the question of survey fees as  stated  in

clause 9 (3) (b) on page 6 of the Bill which says  that

if  an  application  is  made  by  a  planner  "to  the

Collector and has deposited a sum sufficient  to  cover

the  fees for the survey of all lots comprised  in  the

permitted  subdivision", then the plans for subdivision

shall  be considered. Sir, I have been on this question

of  the  survey  fees  for quite  a  long  time.  I  am

concerned particularly where efforts are being made  to

sell  land  to small holders and people who are  to  be

resettled.  I  have one particular case  in  mind.  One

company  wanted to resettle squatters and offered  each

of  them an area near the place where they were  to  be

shifted  from - an area of about 10,000 square  feet  for

just about $500 or $600. The squatters thought it was a

very  generous gesture and were only too glad to accept

it  but  when the plan went to subdivision he was  told

that the fee for subdivision would be $112 which to  my

mind, Sir, is out of all proportion to what is intended

to  benefit  the poor man. After all, if  the  surveyor

does  the  actual work, we cannot complain but  in  the

majority  of cases - virtually in every case - the surveyor

does  not do the original survey. The survey has to  be

done  by a private surveyor who has got to go out  into

the field and peg Out the proper boundaries and then in

the fullness of time - it may be six months or it may  be

a year and I heard sometimes it may take three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



years  because  of  the backlog of work -  the  surveyor

comes round to check the survey and he wants $112 which

is  about  twice as much as the amount charged  by  the

private  surveyor who did the actual job. We have  been

appealing to Government on this point and we  have  had

no  result  for  the  past three  years;  we  have  got

nowhere.  I would ask Government to seriously  consider

this position.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as

one   who   has   been  familiar  with  the   Singapore

Improvement Ordinance for the last 20 years, I think  I

do  know  a lot of, shall we say, the mistakes of  this

Ordinance. The unfortunate part of it is that all these

mistakes are being repeated in this new Bill. In  fact,

in  many cases, it is worse than before. Overall powers

are asked by the Government in this Bill in respect  of

the  development of all land and such  powers  are  not

even found in the Singapore Improvement Ordinance or in

the  English Town Planning Act. I studied both of these

carefully  before  I  came  to  this  house.  Take  for

instance,  this  Bill wants to control even  the  wall,

fence,  platform, staging, gate, post, pillar,  paling,

frame,  hoarding, and so on. Does the Government intend

that  the public should ask permission for these  minor

works? All this control has already been vested in  the

local authorities either in the District Councils or in

the  City Council. I think it is really a waste of time

on the part of the public to ask for such approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are constantly being reminded in this House by the

Hon, the  Financial  Secretary  that  funds  are  very

limited  and  that it is possible that we may  have  to

reduce expenditure in the years to come. Housing  is  a

very  big  problem and, as the Minister  has  said,  no

country   can  provide  enough  houses.  In  order   to

encourage housing and other building activities  so  as

to  provide more employment to the local people,  every

encouragement  should  be given to  the  developers  of

factories,  offices, houses, and so on. When  we  asked

the  S.I.T. before why it took such a long time to pass

a  plan, the reply was, "Oh, we have to go through  all

sorts of enqui-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



ries. We are short of officers, and what not." We  have

spent  millions  of  dollars on the  Master  Plan.  The

Master   Plan   has  already  been  approved   by   the

Government. The Master Plan, we can safely say, is  the

bible of the Planning authorities. Every piece of  land

in  Singapore  is  marked on it. Land  for  residential

purposes,  density  per acre roads, road  widening  and

traffic circles are all marked there. The structure  of

this  new  Bill is different in that there is a  clause

which  says  that if permission is neither granted  nor

refused  within  three months, as the Member  for  Paya

Lebar said, the application is automatically deemed  to

have  been  disapproved. In the  former  Bill,  it  was

automatically  deemed to have been approved.  We  have,

Sir,  considered this Bill carefully and yet  we  think

for  the purposes of the Master Plan that there is,  in

fact,  no necessity for this provision of three months.

I  think  one  month  is more than  sufficient  because

anyone   who  can  read  the  Master  Plan   will   see

straightaway that land reserved for a residential area,

for  a main shopping area or for a local shopping area,

is  all  marked there. So where is the difficulty?  Why

does the Government want such a long time? As I say, if

you  want  people to develop land here, you  must  give

them  every  encouragement to do so instead of  saying,

"You must ask permission first for everything."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is this. We have heard a lot of

complaints and dissatisfaction about the working of the

S.I.T.  One main reason is that they never give us  the

reasons for disapproving a plan. Discussions have  been

going  on between the architects and the Government  on

this  matter  and we have been told more or  less  that

provision for this will be made in the new Bill. I  see

no  such  provision at all in this new Bill.  The  only

safeguard  is that if you have a plan disapproved,  you

can  always appeal to the Minister. When you appeal  to

the  Minister, then the SIT, must furnish  the  reasons

for  the disapproval. Does the Government think  it  is

right not to furnish the reasons for the disapproval of

a  plan?  The Government must satisfy those people  who

come and invest money here



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



and  see  that  they are given a  fair  deal.  They

should   not   just   say,  "Oh,   your   plan   is

disapproved." That kind of dictatorial attitude,  I

think, should not be adopted at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of the Competent Authority, clause

3 of the Bill reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Governor in Council may by notification in

the  Gazette appoint such person or persons  as  he

thinks  fit  to  be  the  Competent  Authority   or

Authorities responsible for the operation  of  this

Ordinance...".



<br><br>The  Government may appoint a person or persons  to

be   the   Competent  Authority   or   Authorities.

Accusations are made by the public as  well  as  in



this  House about certain persons employed  by  the

Singapore  Improvement Trust and  working  in  this

very   Department.  Although  no  proof  has   been

established, I am sure that Government is aware  of

the  true  position  and  is undertaking  extensive

enquiries  into  allegations  of  corruption  by

certain  officers.  I  understand  that  all  these

officers of the Planning Section have been taken on

and,  of  course, we must rely on the  Minister  to

appoint  the proper men and not to appoint  persons

who are suspected of corruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Singapore Improvement Ordinance, the

Government have no power to cancel approval whereas

in  this new Bill, the Government has. I do not say

that  I  am  against such cancellation as  I  think

Government  should in certain cases have  power  to

cancel  the approval if the circumstances  of  such

approval have changed since it was granted, but the

time factor of two years is rather short. It states

here  that  if notice of commencement  of  building

operations has not been given or if a building  has

not  been  completed within two years, the Minister

has the power to cancel such approval. We know very

well. Sir, on this question of development of  land

that  it  is not like buying anything or  something

like that. It takes a lot of time. Suppose you  get

a plan approved; then possibly you have to resettle

the  squatters, and you know how difficult that is.

Apart  from  this  difficulty  experienced  by  the



private owners, even the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



Improvement  Trust with all the  resources  at  its

disposal   to   give   these   people   alternative

accommodation are unable to clear them.  Take,  for

instance, Queenstown; there are still many of these

squatters  there.  I  think  that  to  cancel   the

approval in such a way is a bit too harsh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, according to the Bill, if work has started

on  a  building and it is not completed within two

years,  the  Minister has the power to  cancel  the

approval  given. Two years is a very  short  period

for  big developments. Of course, it may be  argued

that the Minister will definitely consider all  the

relevant conditions before making a decision but we

know  very  well that the Minister is a  very  busy

mail  and he has to take the advice of the Planning

authorities so that I think more safeguards  should

be  given  to  these developers. After  all,  these

people  are really the developers of land and  they

bring prosperity to Singapore. They are not a  gang

of hooligans whom we want to suppress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have explained earlier about the

erection  of  gates, posts, etc., we have  to  seek

permission from the Government to do so and it will

be  seen  from here that even if we are to  have  a

manhole  in the ground or lay electrical  equipment

on  the land, we have to seek permission to do  so.

These  powers, as I say, are vested  in  the  local



authorities.  So  why  should  there  be   such   a

repetition?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is stated in the Bill that an appeal can

be  made to the Minister if a plan is not approved.

I  understand  that  it  is the  intention  of  the



Government to appoint an Appeals Board to hear such

appeals.   There   is  nothing   said   about   the

composition of this Board. We have the  members  of

the  Appeals  Board  very  clearly  stated  in  our

Education   Bill   and  also   in   the   Singapore

Improvement  Ordinance. Why should  the  Government

not  state the composition of the Appeals Board  in

this  Bill  so that the people can be assured  that

they  will  receive  a proper hearing,  unlike  the

treatment   they   receive   from   the   Singapore

Improvement   Trust?   The  officers   there   have

discussed your case long before you go in and  when

you do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>



go  in  they just ask a few questions. They do  not

tell  you  anything  but they say  that  they  will

discuss  it  afterwards. That kind of procedure  is

most  unsatisfactory.  We know  that  some  of  the

officers  in  the  Planning Department  are  highly

corrupted.  When  I  say  that  they  are   "highly

corrupted",  I am not saying it without foundation.

The   Police  have  made  extensive  enquiries  and



although  no one has come forward to give  evidence

on  the  matter, I am sure the Police must come  to

the conclusion that there are grounds for suspicion

although  such allegations of corruption  have  not

been proved. The members of the Board are comprised

of  people who have admitted to me that they do not

know  much about the working of the Board.  I  have

interviewed   a   few   of  them,   including   the

representative of the P.A.P. They told me that they

were  entirely  ignorant of what  was  stated  down

there,  which  I think is no fault of theirs.  They

are  laymen  after  all.  In  fact,  the  so-called

Planning  Committee is entirely  dependent  on  the

opinion of one or two officers concerned. They  may

tell you, "Oh, this desk is too high and so on  and

so  on,"  but  there is no one to  argue  over  the

matter.  They will not tell you exactly  what  they

are  objecting to. Before you go in, they may  tell

the  Committee members all sorts of lies. They have

reason  to tell lies. So what is the use of appeal?

What is the use of the Planning Committee? It is  a

farce. The people are told, "Oh, yes, you are given

a  chance to appeal before the Planning Committee."

But  what chance have you? The verdict has  already

been  decided  before you go in.  So  I  think  the

Government should put down the names of the members

of this Appeals Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 17 of the Bill they want to provide

rules  to control the development of land.  Yes,  I

think  they  should.  The  control  of  density  of

buildings on land - they should have too. But clause 17 (2) (c):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"the regulation of the height, design, appearance

and siting of buildings;".



<br><br>Design,  Sir, is a most controversial  subject.  If

you  have  ten prominent architects,  it  is  quite

possible they may differ



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



entirely  as to the type of design which should  be

put  up.  For instance, the United Nations building

in  New  York.  The job was given to  a  number  of

architects  after  long  consideration  and   after

submission of a lot of designs from architects  all

over   the  world.  Yet  the  amount  of  criticism

received  from other architects who were not  doing

the  job  is  shocking. It is  the  same  with  the

R.I.B.A.   Headquarters  building  in   London.   I

remember  seeing designs for it in the competition.

Architects  from  all  over the  Commonwealth  were



invited  to  submit designs for the  building.  The

designs  ranged from ultramodern to full classical.

If  you look at the names of the architects who had



submitted  designs, you can never doubt  that  they

are men who have knowledge of building and who have

put  up  maybe hundreds and thousands of  buildings

all  over the world. Yet they differed to  a  great

extent    over   the   design   of   the   R.I.B.A.

Headquarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, do the Government really think they have

enough  men to decide the design of this place?  On

whom are they relying? If they say on a few of  the

architects  in the so-called Housing  Authority  or

Planning Authority, I think it is a great disgrace.

It   is  really  an  insult  to  the  architectural



profession of Singapore. A number of years ago, the

Government decided to sell the land in Shenton  Way

along  Robinson  Road. They  called  for  bids  for

auction. I remember very distinctly that one of the

conditions  is  that  you must follow  the  designs

entirely as shown in the drawings. You cannot build

higher or lower, and building throughout the  whole

of  Shenton  Way in Robinson Road must  be  in  one

horizontal line. That was submitted to very  severe

criticism  from  the  architectural  profession  of

Singapore.   Yet  the  Government,  through   their

advisers,  imposed  such conditions.  They  imposed

such conditions because they knew very well that no

one  dared  to say no to them. But today I  believe

that  sort of thing should never be allowed  to  be

repeated.  I think one of the reasons why  most  of

the land



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>



in  Shenton  Way  is  still vacant is  because  of  the

unreasonable conditions imposed by the Government.

I  have  raised will be considered there and amendments

<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> In reply, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir,

since this Bill is going to Select Committee, I do  not

think  I will take up much of the time of the Assembly;

but it would appear to me that the criticisms raised by

the Members for Paya Lebar and Pasir Panjang revolve on

one  theme, and that is the passing of plans. There  is

some  slight change in the present Bill before  us.  It

would be better, I think, to have the wording in clause

9 (11) as it is, that is to say, if within three months

of  the date of receipt by the Competent Authority  the

plans are not passed, then the application is deemed to

have been refused. This would be better than having  it

the  other  way round, because it would mean  that  the

plans have been approved by default.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point raised by the Member for

Pasir Panjang, and that is on corruption. Sir, this  is

going over old ground again, but I should like to  draw

the  attention of Members of this Assembly to the  type

of  co-operation  I  am getting from  Members  who  are

expected   to   give  their  fullest  co-operation   to

Government. You will remember. Sir, at the last sitting

of the Assembly that the Member for Queenstown raised a

similar  point  on  corruption  in  connection  with  a

certain house in Dorset



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



Road.  I  wrote  him a long letter the  day  after  the

Assembly sitting, and this is his reply:



<br><br>Dear Minister,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 17th July,

1958,   in  respect  of  the  speech  I  made  in   the

Legislative  Assembly meeting regarding the  allocation

of  properties  by the S.I.T. I fully  appreciate  your

responsibilities  and  interest in  having  the  matter

investigated  but  it  is  regretted  that  it  is  not

possible to have the complainant come forward  to  give

evidence.  Under the circumstances, I  am  prepared  to

drop the matter but assure you that if at any time I am

able  to  convince the complainant to come  forward,  I

will write to you once again."



<br><br>Sir, this is the type of co-operation I am getting.  It

has  always  been  like this - accusations  against  the

S.I.T. and its officers - but when we ask for proofs  and

evidence, nobody would dare to come forward and  nobody

would  want to come forward; so much so there are times

when  I  feel  that these accusations are  deliberately

made for purely personal reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is a consequence of local government

reorganisation   in  Singapore.  With   the   impending

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for the substitution of other

descriptions  which  will  be  inappropriate  when  the

District  Councils  come into  being,  such  as  "Rural

District",  "Rural  Board Health  Officer",  "Municipal

bring  the laws of the Colony in line with the  changes

in the local government of Singapore when the Ordinance

comes into operation, the date of which is intended  to

coincide  with  the  holding of elections.  Some  minor

amendments to .the Bill are necessary, for which I have

<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Acting Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Financial Secretary (Mr Oon Khye Kiang):</b>

Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to introduce a number of amendments to

the  Customs Ordinance which have been found  necessary

in  the  light of further experience of the working  of

the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to clause 2, it has been argued in the

Lower  Court  that if, for any reason, the  Comptroller

will  not accept duty on any particular consignment  of

dutiable goods, they will then cease to be dutiable  as

they  are not then subject to the payment of duty. This

argument is fallacious and it is proposed to revise the

definition of "dutiable





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>



goods"  in section 3 of the Ordinance to  make  the

meaning  perfectly clear. The definition of  "local

craft"  will  also  be revised to  ensure  that  it

covers  all types of marine craft of less  than  75

tons  and particularly those being used by  tobacco

smugglers.  The opportunity is taken to  remove  an

ambiguity in subsection (2).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to clause 3, doubts have been

expressed  as  to  the legality for  charging  duty

under  section 11 of the Customs Ordinance.  It  is

proposed to amend it so as to remove doubts  as  to

the  liability for payment of duty. This  liability

was imposed in express terms in the Tobacco Duties,

Petroleum  Revenue and Liquors Revenue  Ordinances,

but  when  these three Ordinances were consolidated

into  the  Customs  Ordinance, this  liability  was

imposed  in  language which has given rise  to  the

present   doubts.  It  is  proposed  that   express

provision should be made for the imposition of duty

in  terms  similar to those used  in  these  former

Ordinances to remove all doubts by relating it back

to  the  date  on which the Customs Ordinance  came

into operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of administrative convenience, it is

considered that the Comptroller should be  able  to

collect  the  heavy  oil  tax  at  staggered  dates

throughout  the year at the same time and  for  the

same  periods as the Registrar of Vehicles collects

motor  vehicle licence fees. Clause 4  proposes  to

amend  section 16 of the Customs Ordinance to  give

the Comptroller power to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to amend in clauses 5 and 6

sections  32  and  35 of the Customs  Ordinance  to

enable aircraft arriving in the Colony to be  dealt

with  in  the  same way as vessels  in  respect  of

dutiable stores.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some difficulties have been experienced in

dealing  with  goods liable to  forfeiture  in  the

Courts, and it is therefore proposed:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to amend in clause 7 of section 98 of the

Ordinance  to make it unnecessary for a summons  to

be  issued  to a person from whom goods  have  been

seized, if his identity is unknown.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to provide in clause 8 for the forfeiture of

prohibited goods, though the offences in respect of

such goods have been compounded under section 100

of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the better administration of the Ordinance,

it is proposed in clause 9 to provide for a penalty

for the storage, keeping or possession of dutiable

goods other than under customs control, and to

extend the presumption under subsection (2) of

section 104 of the Ordinance to cover the cases of

persons attempting or abetting offences under the

section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>It  was  by an unfortunate mistake that the period  one

month  was  put  in in this Bill at the time  when  the

draft  was  being  prepared, with a view  to  obtaining

rather  more  uniformity than was in  the  event  found

possible.  The  period of three months appears  in  the

present  Prisons Ordinance and, to be consistent,  that

period should be retained in this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> Sir, I move,

the case may be shall thereupon become void as from

such date but without prejudice to the validity of

anything previously done thereunder or to the making

of a new order."'.



<br><br>Sir,  unfortunately when this Bill was drafted,  yet  a

further  mistake was made, and in what  is  at  present

paragraph (b) of this part of the Schedule on  page  5,

some  words  were  used which had been considered  that

were  not, in the event, finally adopted. The amendment

that  I  now  propose will, in that respect,  keep  the

wording  consistent with the remaining  parts  of  this

Bill  and what we hope to see in future in the laws  of

the Colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, one other matter in which an error

has  crept  in  and  which may be  the  subject  of  an

amendment moved by another Member of the Assembly.

to  insert  the  words "which relates  to  a  class  of

persons".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment to the amendment handed in.



<br><br>Sir,  I move this drafting amendment with the agreement

of  my  hon. Friend the Attorney-General. This Bill  is

not  intended  to  make any changes in the  substantive

provisions of the Ordinances which it seeks  to  amend,

but  purely  procedural changes to bring the provisions

in  line with procedure in this House. In the amendment

moved  by the Attorney-General, there was unfortunately

omitted  from the draft these words which relate  to  a

class  of persons and which qualify the section  as  it

stands in the Ordinance at present.

<br><br>This  differs from the last amendment I moved, Sir,  in

that  in  the provisions of the Probation of  Offenders

Ordinance  at present, no period is mentioned  but  the

phrase  used  is "at the next meeting of the  Assembly"

after  the  laying of the rules. It is appropriate  and

period "one month", not "three months".

<br><br>This, Sir, is to correct a mistake in the drafting. The

amendment to this Ordinance which is already  shown  in

the  Bill deals with the section of the Ordinance which

relates  to  presentation of rules,  but  it  had  been

overlooked  that there is another section dealing  with

the  presentation of accounts which also uses the words

"laid   before",  which  should  now  be   changed   to

"presented to".

Force Bill, as contained in Sessional Paper No. L.A.  7

of 1958, be adopted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I stated in moving the Second Reading of the

Bill,  this  is primarily a consolidating measure,  and

although a number of amendments have been made  to  the

text of the Bill in Select Committee, these are largely

of  a formal or drafting character. The revised text of

the  Bill incorporating all the amendments made appears

at Appendix I of the Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the debate on the Bill, I mentioned that

certain   representations  had  been  made  by   police

inspectors in respect of clauses 20 and 28 of the  Bill

which  provide  for  the  discharge  and  dismissal  of

inspectors,  and  that  they  would  be  considered  in

Committee. Hon. Members will now see that clause 20 has

been  amended  by the Select Committee to provide  that

while  an inspector on probation, or a cadet inspector,

can  be  discharged  by the Commissioner,  a  confirmed

inspector can only be discharged by the Governor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 28, which deals with disciplinary offences by

inspectors, has similarly been amended to provide  that

an  inspector's services can only be terminated by  the

Governor,  whereas lesser penalties can be  imposed  by

the Commissioner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members will also note that the period  of  time

allowed for appeals under clauses 27 and 28 of the Bill

has been extended from 10 to 30 days, since 10 days was

considered inadequate for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>



police officers concerned to prepare an appeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 has also been amended to provide that

consent  to  an officer remaining a member of  a  trade

union should be given by the Minister instead of by the

Commissioner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Second Reading of the Bill, I also mentioned

the  intention  to  substitute the expression  "movable

property" for "goods and chattels" in clause 51,  which

is  new  clause 50 in the Bill, in order to enable  the

Deputy  Commissioner to deal with money in addition  to

goods  and  chattels  in  the administration  of  small

intestate estates. This amendment has also been made in

Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other amendments made in Select Committee

<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Acting Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Financial Secretary (Mr Oon Khye Kiang):</b>

Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (1) of

section 106 of the Income Tax Ordinance (Chapter  166),

resolves  that the Malayan Pineapple Industry Board  be

added to the First Schedule to the said Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an application has been received from the

Malayan  Pineapple Industry Board to be  exempted  from

income  tax, under section 13 (1) (e) of the  Ordinance

by  the inclusion of the Board in the First Schedule to

the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Board is a pan-Malayan body which has been set

up in accordance with the Pineapple Industry Ordinance,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>



1957,  enacted both in Singapore and in the  Federation

of  Malaya.  It has taken over and continued  the  work

previously  done  by  the  Pineapple  Joint  Industrial

Council  and  the  Registrars  constituted  under   the

Pineapple Industry Ordinance of 1951.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main functions of the Board are to administer the

Pineapple  Industry  Fund the resources  of  which  are

derived from cesses on exports of canned pineapple,  to

negotiate  agreements on prices and grades of pineapple

for  sale to canneries, to regulate production, grading

and  marketing  of  pineapple, and to conduct  research

into  the  cultivation and processing of pineapple  and

its   by-products,  and  to  deal  with  other  matters

affecting  the  industry.  Members  of  the  Board  are

appointed  by  the  two Governments  to  represent  the

various interests of the industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malayan Board of Income Tax has considered this

case and recommends that the Malayan Pineapple Industry

Board may properly be included in the First Schedule to

the  Ordinance with effect from 1st January, 1957,  and

Government accepts the recommendation of the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 106 of the Income Tax Ordinance gives powers

to  the  Legislative Assembly by resolution to add  to,

vary or revoke the whole or part of any Schedule to the

Ordinance.   The  First  Schedule  to   the   Ordinance

specifies  the  institutions, authorities,  persons  or

funds  whose income is exempted from income  tax  under

section 13 (1) (e) of the Income Tax Ordinance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the note on

penultimate paragraph reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, a total of $6,168 in surcharges and

overtime pay due to Chemists and Laboratory Attendants

in 1957, has been paid from the 1958 provision."



<br><br>Now, Sir, I would like an explanation from the Hon. the

Financial Secretary as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



to (1) the practice of paying 1957 surcharges from

1958 provisions; and (2) why it is that this amount

was not ascertained earlier.



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> The work was carried out in

1957  but the payment was not received until  1958;

50  it was not possible for the payment to be  made

to the officers of the Department until 1958.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Do I understand that these

chemists are not paid the 50 per cent surcharge for

work  done outside office hours, and the laboratory

assistants  are  not  paid  overtime,   until   the

shipping companies have paid for it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> The companies for which the

work  was done were billed for the amount and  when

the  payment  was received by the Government,  then

the fees and allowances were paid to the officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $20,200 for Head 10 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 11-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $10 for Head 11 ordered to stand part

of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 12-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $28,082 for Head 12 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, here again,

the last sentence of the note, on page 3, says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As only $108,360 was provided in the 1957

Estimates, supplementary provision of $28,082 is

required to enable payment of the balance to be

made to the Federation of Malaya this year."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, how was that figure of $108,360 arrived at,

and how is it that it is off the mark and not

discovered until September 1958?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Sir, I

think the answer to the hon. Member for Tanjong

Pagar as regards the figure of $108,360 is that

that figure would have been calculated on the

previous year's figure as being the appropriate

figure to insert for the year 1957. As regards the

delay in calculating the final figure for 1957, I

imagine



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



that that was due to the fact that the accounts

could not be finalised till after the fees which

were due up to 31st December, 1957 had been

collected. It would not, therefore, be possible to

arrive at the final figure due to the Federation

until those accounts had been finalised in 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $28,082 for Head 12 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 25-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Up to the 31st August this year detention

orders  under this Ordinance had been  issued against 372 persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) 244 of these persons have been released.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) 7 of these persons have been banished and

were  sent  to China. Banishment orders  have

been  made  against a further 47. Banishment

orders   do   not  specify   any   place   of

destination.  Unless  the  person   concerned

specifies any particular country to which he

has  a valid entry, he is put on a ship bound

for  the  country to which he  is  deemed  to

belong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not considered either proper or

desirable to publish the names of the persons

concerned.  The  future  intentions  of  the

Government   will  depend  on  the   security

situation.
