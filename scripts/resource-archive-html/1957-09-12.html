have His Excellency's authority to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of $903,821

shall  be supplied to the Government under the  heads

of  expenditure and for the services specified in the

Schedule contained in Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 34  of

1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the majority of the items in this Schedule

refer to revotes. They have all been explained in the

Schedule  and  I  shall  be  happy  to  amplify   the

explanations  if  hon. Members so require.  Before  I

move the motion, Sir, I should like to draw attention

to  a printing error which has crept into the Summary

of  Totals  on  page  12. There, Sir,  you  will  see

printed under Application Nos. 181 and 182, Head  47,

Raffles  Library  a  total of $240,000.  The  correct

total  should be $343 as will be seen if hon. Members

examine the two items to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2592</b></font><br><br>



which  I  have referred. What has happened,  Sir,  is

that  the  printers have inadvertently  repeated  the

figure  of  $240,000  printed  above.  Otherwise  the

Summary  is  correct.  The  total  of  $903,821  does

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Sir, may we have

further information on this Special Expenditure, item

174, appearing on page 1? It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Supplementary provision of $8,988 is required to

pay damages and costs awarded against the Crown in  a

civil  action  for  false imprisonment  in  the  High

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to know whether any offer for

compensation  was  made  which  would  have  made  it

unnecessary to go to court.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The case was put to the law officers, Sir,

and  they  advised  that  the petitioners  should  be

allowed  to pursue the matter in the High Court.  The

law  officers  did  not  think  that  there  was  any

justification  for  endeavouring  to  compromise  the

matter out of court. As



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2593</b></font><br><br>



it happened, the judgment went against us and we were

required to pay damages to the extent of $1,000 in

each case with costs of $6,000 odd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Could the Hon. the

Financial Secretary tells us why this expenditure has

to be incurred when normally the Public Works

Department could carry out this service?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Sir, I do not know whether the hon.

Member  was in the House or not on 17th July  when  I

dealt  with  this point. I did in my  speech  on  the

Architects  (Amendment) Ordinance explain that  there

was  a  need  for a survey of building standards  and

that  it was necessary to pay a professional  fee  to

this    officer   who   was   retiring   under    the

Malayanisation scheme and consequently was  available

for a short period to do the job. It is explained  in

the  notes here that the Public Works Department  has

no  spare  officer  at the moment.  Our  capacity  is

overtaxed already by the amount of work we have to do

in  ordinary building works and it seemed appropriate

to get a spare body to do the work which could not be

done by the Public Works Department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Do we understand then, Sir, that

what in fact happened was that an officer was paid

his compensation under the Malayanisation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2594</b></font><br><br>



scheme and he is then paid another $8,000 for one  or

two months to do an extra bit of job?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> It is perfectly correct that officers

who  retired under the Malayanisation scheme received

their  compensation as they are legally  entitled  to

do. That does not affect the fact that where you need

a job done and you have a man who is willing and able

to  do  it, he should be employed to do it. It  is  a

marked economy over bringing out some expert from the

United  Kingdom, Australia or India  and  paying  his

passage  and  a comparable fee as well, if  the  hon.

Member  wishes to suggest that this is an  ill-judged

decision,  I  think  he  might  consider  what  other

decisions   would   have   been   possible   in   the

circumstances.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Was no attempt made to appeal to

the  higher sense of responsibility and duty to  this

officer   that   he   should   retire   and   collect

compensation after he has done his job?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam (Pasir Panjang):</b> May I ask the

Minister  why  $8,000 is to be paid  to  the  officer

concerned  for two months' work whereas I  know  that

the officer concerned did not have anything like that

in salary?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> In my speech on 17th July, I said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I do not wish to prejudge in any way the findings

which may appear in his report, which I hope will  be

available  in  about  two  months - possibly  a  little

longer, not more than three months.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was impossible before he started work to say how

long  the  job would take. The fee was calculated  on

the basis that he might have to spend three months on

it and is a lump sum payment for a single job. To pay

him  month by month would of course open him  to  the

temptation of lingering on the work so as  to  go  on

drawing  the pay for an indefinite period of  months.

Consequently, the reasonable thing was to pay  him  a

professional fee for doing a professional job and  to

get the job done as quickly as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2596</b></font><br><br>



Federation of Malaya, be added to the First  Schedule

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This application has been received from the Rubber

Industry  (Anti-Inflationary Cess) Fund  Board  under

section  13  (1)  (e)  of the Income  Tax  Ordinance.

Exemption is effected by the inclusion of the name of

this  public  body  in  the  First  Schedule  to  the

Ordinance. The objects of the Rubber Industry  (Anti-Inflationary  Cess) Fund Board are,  inter  alia,  to

divide the monies of the Fund which are derived  from

cesses   charged  from  rubber  exported   from   the

Federation of Malaya between the owners of estates of

100  acres and over and small-holders. The monies  of

the  Fund are to be disbursed when the gazetted price

of   rubber  is  less  than  $1  per  lb, for  three

successive  weeks. The monies in the case of  estates

are   to   be  paid  over  in  four  equal  quarterly

instalments and in respect of smallholders the monies

are  to  be  paid into Fund B established  under  the

Rubber  Industry's Replanting Fund  Ordinance,  1952,

Federation  of  Malaya.  All  expenses  incurred   in

administering the Fund are chargeable to the  general

revenues of the Federation. The High Commissioner  in

Council  has  power  under the Ordinance  to  make  a

scheme  to  be  administered by  the  Board  for  the

disposal of the monies in the Fund when he may revoke

or vary any existing scheme. The Board has to prepare

annually  an estimate of costs, charges and  expenses

likely  to  be  incurred  in administering  the  Fund

during  each year commencing the 1st of January.  The

Malayan Board of Income Tax has considered this  case

and   considers  that  the  Rubber  Industry   (Anti-Inflationary  Cess)  Fund  Board  may   properly   be

included in the First Schedule to the Ordinance  with

effect  from the 1st of January, 1957 and  Government

accepts the recommendation of the Board.

uncompromisingly  anti-colonial  and  we  expect  the

colonial power to be uncompromisingly anti-P.A.P. But

we  cannot  understand  the  Labour  Front  Coalition

joining the colonial power in seeking to destroy  the

P.A.P. It is true we have little time or respect  for

many of the political rogues in the Labour Front but,

surely  there  must be some social democrats  in  the

Labour  Front who should be able to see  that  it  is

against  the  interest  of  democratic  socialism  to

attempt to destroy the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a closing down of the P.A.P is what the White

Paper  has  attempted to prepare the way for-a  White

Paper  presented  and published by the  Labour  Front

Government in conjunction with the colonial power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attempt, Sir, was made in two ways : - First: by

the deliberate suppression of certain facts so as  to

make  it  appear that the purge was intended to  save

the    P.A.P. from   capture   by   a    Communist

group - suppressio veri, suggestio falsi. It suppressed

the   truth  that  the  leaders  of  this  group  the

Government  have  arrested  were  on  the  point   of

capturing  the Trades Union Congress by the  22nd  of

August  and  so by inference suggested the  falsehood

that the purge was because the P.A.P. had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2598</b></font><br><br>



been  captured by the Communists. Second: by  falsely

making  it appear in the White Paper that the  P.A.P.

is  a  Communist  front organisation when  the  Chief

Minister knew as he admitted in his Press conference,

reported in the Press of the 25th of August, that  it

is a genuine political organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister exploited the temporary

difficulties  of  the P.A.P. We the  P.A.P. have  no

Special Branch. Whether a person is a Communist or  a

Communist agent, only he knows and God knows. Between

his  conscience  and God of course lies  the  Special

Branch  and it is up to them to show that  these  men

whom  they  have arrested are Communists or Communist

agents.  We  know some of these men  as  a  dissident

faction in the P.A.P. who tried to oppose and reverse

the policy of the last Central Executive Committee of

the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while we were engaged in a fight with this

dissident  faction,  the  Government  waded  in   and

arrested them and at the same time published a  White

Paper which made it appear that the Party was thereby

saved from penetration and capture by the Communists.

And so the Government tried to discredit us. But what

are  the  facts  which  this  White  Paper  does  not

disclose?  With  regard to the trade union  position,

the  White Paper ended on page 6 with a statement  in

the middle of the page saying:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On July 18th a meeting of representatives of the

S.T.U.W.C. [Singapore Trade Unions Working  Committee

was   held  at  Middle  Road  at  which  tactics  for

strengthening  its  organisation  and   for   gaining

control of the T.U.C. were discussed."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there the story ends. We are led to believe that

that  was the position when the purge began. Can  the

Government  deny that the leaders of this group  they

have  arrested  were on the point  of  capturing  the

T.U.C. by  the evening of the 22nd August  when  the

purge  began?  Why did the White Paper  not  disclose

that  for  some time since the return  of  the  Chief

Minister's  driver Mr Lee Yew Seng (who looks  after

the  T.U.C. for him) returned from his May Day  visit

to  Peking, where a photograph was taken of  him  and

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2599</b></font><br><br>



Chinese  Prime Minister Mr Chou En-lai,  this  group

had  been  making progress with him, that things  had

reached the point where on the night of the 22nd  the

so-called 32 unions led by this group were  about  to

be  accepted  into  the T.U.C. and  so  capture  it,

leaving  the Labour Front without their 'mass'  base?

Why  was  it not disclosed that on the night  of  the

22nd  itself when the Police surrounded the  premises

at  Middle  Road  the  so-called  32  unions  special

committee   was   holding  a  meeting   to   finalise

arrangements  for their joining in and  capturing  of

the T.U.C.?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it not because it would have been acutely

embarrassing for the Labour Front to confess that  it

acted to save the T.U.C.? And can the Government deny

that  it  was this same group that fought the  Labour

Front  candidate in the Cairnhill by-elections  where

they organised support for one Mr Goh Kong Beng  and

so  split  the  working class vote and  defeated  the

Labour  Front  candidate? Why was  this  episode  not

disclosed? Had this no bearing on what followed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no civil disturbances on the 22nd of

August, no obvious cause for a purge. So the conflict

in  the  P.A.P. was  exploited. The  Chief  Minister

thought  he  could hurt both groups  in  the  P.A.P.:

arresting  one  because  he  suspected   it   to   be

Communist,  and by the timing making it  appear  that

the  other  had precipitated the arrest.  To  achieve

this,  the  White Paper preoccupied itself  with  the

P.A.P. and the real reason that the T.U.C. was  then

in  imminent danger was concealed. Sir, it  is  clear

that  the  White Paper must have been prepared  quite

some  time ago for it to have been published  on  the

23rd of August, the day after the purge. But why,  it

may  be asked, was the purge not made earlier, at the

height  of  the  conflict in the  P.A.P.,  so  as  to

embarrass us even more? Was it not because there  was

an  Assembly sitting fixed for the 21st of August and

the  Government  disliked the prospect  of  an  early

debate  and  so  waited till the 22nd, the  following

day?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2600</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the Government's action was calculated

to  embarrass us. This purge and the White Paper were

in  the  making  quite some time  before  the  P.A.P.

annual conference fixed for the 4th of August. If the

Government  was as well informed as the  White  Paper

suggests, then they must have been forewarned that  a

conflict  was  likely  on  the  4th  of  August.  The

Government  waited for this to happen,  waited  until

the  T.U.C. was threatened, waited until the Assembly

sitting  of the 21st was over and then moved  in.  On

the  22nd of August 1957, V.I.P.'s from all over  the

world  were arriving for the Merdeka celebrations  in

Kuala  Lumpur - a most inopportune moment for a  purge,

for  if  the  mass arrests contemplated had  provoked

resistance  and  riots,  it  would  have  been   most

embarrassing  for the Government. Yet the  Government

had  to  move. I suggest the conclusion is  therefore

irresistible that the Government had to  accept  this

risk  because of a compelling reason - the  rescue  of

the   T.U.C.,  the  Government's  'mass'  base,  from

imminent  danger.  It is therefore dishonest  of  the

Government to have suppressed this vital fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the second way of trying to destroy the P.A.P.

was  even more dishonest. If the Chief Minister  knew

that  the P.A.P. was a genuine political Party,  then

why  did he not say so in the White Paper instead  of

making  it  appear that the P.A.P. is not  a  genuine

political  Party but a Communist front  organisation?

Why  say  in paragraphs 36 and 37 that the Communists

had  dominated the Party and would do  so  for  good?

Perhaps the Chief Minister has not read paragraphs 36

and 37. Paragraph 36 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"New leaders and organisers have taken the place of

those  removed.  As  each month  goes  by,  Communist

activities become more frequent and more blatant; and

the  power  of  persons known to be Communist  grows.

Once  again the aim is to bring about a united  front

of  workers,  farmers  and students  supported  by  a

favourable  press and by political sympathisers.  The

gravest developments have been amongst the workers. A

determined  and  successful bid for  controlling  the

P.A.P. has been the second feature of recent months.

Here the Communists have worked



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2601</b></font><br><br>



through  the  cultural,  educational  and  propaganda

groups  in the P.A.P. and through them have gone  far

to obtain domination of the whole Party organisation.

There   has   also  been  revived  activity   amongst

students, farmers, women and "cultural" groups."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 37 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is evident that once again a serious threat is

developing. Communists and their agents are  back  in

key  positions daily increasing their propaganda  and

their power, and steadily strengthening the extent of

their  control and thus again building  up  a  united

Communist  front.  If  the situation  is  allowed  to

deteriorate, it will become increasingly difficult to

check  the  threat,  and  decisive  action  will   be

resisted with consequent rioting and blood-shed. From

past  experience it is quite clear that there  is  no

prospect  at all that these legal organisations  will

be  able  to purge themselves of Communist  influence

and   conform   to   democratic  and   constitutional

practice."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why say in paragraphs 36 and 37 that we the P.A.P.

have  been dominated by the Communists and they would

do  so for good? Can it be that this White Paper  was

not  the  work of the Chief Minister but  of  someone

else  who had got it past the Chief Minister and  his

elected colleagues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government was as well informed as it claims

to   be,   it  must  have  known  that  the  P.A.P.'s

activities were perfectly legitimate and commendable.

We  do  not  pretend that our Party is impervious  to

Communist  penetration. No party is.  The  M.C.P. is

denied   political  existence  and  must  resort   to

clandestine   methods  to  enter  the  constitutional

political arena. Does the Labour Front deny that  its

organising  secretary, a confessed ex-member  of  the

Malayan  Communist Party, closed down several  Labour

Front branches because he thought some Communists had

gone in? Surely, the Government knew that some of the

blatant and crude tactics in disseminating propaganda

in  the P.A.P. of a kind foreign to our Party's  aims

and  objectives  was the work of a  few  individuals,

that the general membership were not parties to this,

that  the Party leadership was opposed to this,  that

they had consistently stamped out such activities and

that they had been consistently firm and resolute  in

their non-Communist stand.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2602</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the White Paper tried to make it appear that the

Party leadership was weak, effete and ineffective and

unable  to  resist penetration and so the  Government

had  to step in. It says in paragraph 37 and I  quote

it again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From past experience it is quite clear that there

is  no prospect at all that these legal organisations

will   be  able  to  purge  themselves  of  Communist

influence    and    conform   to    democratic    and

constitutional practice."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell the Government this, that we in the

P.A.P. are quite capable of looking after  ourselves

and  the P.A.P. Perhaps it may be different with  the

T.U.C. It is the P.A.P. and the P.A.P. only which can

settle its own internal problems and the Government's

action  particularly in publishing this  White  Paper

was calculated to harass and hinder the P.A.P. in its

work.  Does the Government believe that by this purge

they have saved the T.U.C. for ever more? Or does the

Government  propose to purge again if the  T.U.C. is

again threatened? But next time, there may not  be  a

conflict  in the P.A.P. to be used as a pretext.  The

effective way of checking peaceful penetration is by

peaceful resistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has chosen to act in the way it did.

Now  it  is  up to them to explain their actions  and

what  is  more important to show that they have  not

arrested  innocent  people. If the Government  thinks

that because some of these men arrested have opposed

us  in  the past we are not going to fight for  their

rights under the law, they are mistaken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But surely the biggest inaccuracy which is just a

parliamentary way of saying falsehood  in  the  White

Paper is in paragraph 36:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A determined and successful bid for controlling the

P.A.P. has been the second feature of recent months....

have  gone far to obtain domination of  the  whole

Party organisation."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists have not made a successful bid for

controlling   the  Party.  They  have  not   obtained

domination   of'   the   Party.   The   non-Communist

leadership  of  the Party had not  been  ousted.  The

Government's own action in not arresting seven out of

the twelve Central Executive Committee members of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2603</b></font><br><br>



the Party is an admission that at its highest even if

the  Government can prove that every one of the  five

arrested   are  Communists  or  their   agents,   the

Communists are still not in the majority and  not  in

control  of  the  Party. To say as  the  White  Paper

states  in  paragraph  36  that  the  Communists  had

obtained  domination of the whole Party is manifestly

untrue.  It  was a fabrication by the  Government  to

justify  their action. I challenge the Government  to

deny  that they would have carried out this purge  in

any case because of the threat to the T.U.C. and that

they  used the so-called Communist domination of  the

P.A.P. as a mere pretext.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Front Coalition may try to discredit the

P.A.P. but they will never succeed in destroying  the

P.A.P.  We  are  a  virile and  a  genuine  political

organisation.  We  shall always remain  so.  No  one,

neither  the  Labour Front Coalition nor the  M.C.P.,

can discredit or destroy us. The Government may close

us   down   but  our  movement  goes  on.  We   stand

uncompromisingly for an independent, democratic, non-Communist,   socialist  Malaya  by   democratic   and

constitutional means and we shall not waver from this

stand.  We  believe  that by  only  free  competition

within the non-Communist democratic system can such a

socialist society be achieved in Malaya; that  it  is

not  possible in Malaya to achieve Socialism  by  the

Communist  one-party dictatorship.  In  multi-racial

Malaya  with  three major races - Malays,  Chinese  and

Indians -  all with differing cultural and  linguistic

backgrounds, and even more important, with  different

political  traditions and concepts, the  dictatorship

of  any  one  party may lead to racial  conflict  and

disaster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not afraid to fight for what we believe in.

Our  Party policy is fundamentally correct.  We  have

proved it in the past and shall prove it again in the

future.  The  P.A.P. can only be  destroyed  by  the

P.A.P. by deviating from our correct stand. Our stand

is clear, consistent and unwavering. Our  tactics may

change  according  to  changes  in  the  political

situation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2604</b></font><br><br>



It  may  be  adjusted to fit each phase of the  anti-colonial  struggle.  But we  are  clear,  honest  and

undeviating  in our objectives. And we  will  not  be

deterred from these objectives either by threats from

the  colonial  power or from the Communists  or  from

anybody  else. The Straits Times, voice  of  colonial

vested  interest, will not shift us into a hysterical

anti-Communist  stand. For Malaya  to  join  the  mad

crusade  of  Formosa and South Korea in  "liberating"

Asia from the Communists will only add grave problems

for  ourselves. Nor, may I add, will  we  fulfil  the

hope  of Freedom News, voice of the Malayan Communist

Party,  that - I  quote the White  Paper  which  quotes

Freedom News - "P.A.P. inclinations can be changed." We

are  firm in our belief that the democratic  road  is

the  only road possible to a Socialist Malaya and  we

shall  fight  to prevent the democratic  system  from

being destroyed in Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We admit, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it is a difficult

role  to  play. If you do not accept the  embrace  of

colonialists, then the colonialists charge  you  with

being  pro-Communists. If you reject the advances  of

the  Communists,  they charge  you  with  being  pro-colonialists. We have not the slightest intention  of

being  embraced by or being dependent  on  either  of

them.  We  will  pursue our democratic, non-Communist

Socialist  objectives without regard  to  whether  we

please   the  pro-Communists  or  the  anti-Communist

group.  We  shall fight both to the extent  to  which

they  stand  in  the  way  of  our  objectives.   Our

intention  is  to  build  up  our  strength  and  our

following of people who believe in our ideals and who

will  be prepared to fight for these ideals.  But  in

this  fight we shall not make the mistake of  allying

ourselves with so-called anti-Communist forces  which

are often cloaks to hide reactionary elements ranging

from   colonial  vested  interests  to   enemies   of

democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now with an independent Federation of Malaya and

a  new constitution for internal self-government next

year  for Singapore, a new phase opens in the  battle

for the future of Malaya. Now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2605</b></font><br><br>



the  time  has  come to state precisely what  kind  of

system  of  government our independent Malaya  is  to

have  and  what  we wish to do with  our  independent

Malaya.  That was why we took the Tanjong  Pagar  by-elections  as  the  opportunity to  clarify  and  re-emphasise  our  long term objectives-an  independent,

democratic, non-Communist Socialist Malaya. That  the

P.A.P. defended the constitutional proposals in  the

Tanjong Pagar by-elections, that we were resolute  in

honouring our agreement in the All-Party conference

All-Party  conference  agreement  and  all  this  was

conveniently  not  mentioned  in  the  White   Paper.

Instead  the  Labour  Front had the  impertinence  to

pinch our Tanjong Pagar by-election platform without

acknowledgment or so much as if you please. They  say

in paragraph 38:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2606</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The present government stand for the complete

internal  self-government of the people of  Singapore

and independence through merger with the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why did not the Labour Front candidate for the

Cairnhill by-elections put this over on his platform?

Why  was it not in his election manifestos which were

sent  to  me  at 38 Oxley Road where I  live  in  his

constituency?  Of  course, we are flattered  to  know

that the Labour Front has seen the P.A.P. light.  But

is it not a stupid thing to try and bankrupt us while

at the same time borrowing from our political credit?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This White Paper seeks to indict the P.A.P. We are

proud of what we have done. If the Communists or anti-Communists misunderstand us and want to make  use  of

the Party for their own ends that is their own folly.

We  know  that our cause will win in the end  because

our basic policy is correct. Those who fought with us

on  the  agreed Party policy we stand  by.  But  even

those  in our Party who tried to undermine our policy

we do not abandon. It is up to the Government to show

that  they are Communists or Communist agents.  Until

then, we shall press for their rights under the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I deplore the inaccurate representation of

facts  in this White Paper. I deplore the attempt  to

smear us in the same stroke with which the Government

struck down those it considered Communists. I deplore

the deliberate suppression of the truth.

members and some journalists? The White Paper has not

told us the real motive behind the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2607</b></font><br><br>



purge. Is the Government trying to impress the public

of  Singapore that the purge was carried out to  save

the  P.A.P. which the Chief Minister admitted  is  a

genuine  political  organisation from  going  to  the

dogs?  Any  political  party  has  its  own  internal

problems and we frankly admit that the P.A.P. has its

own  internal  problems.  The  P.A.P.,  Sir,  is   an

organisation  based on democratic principles  and  we

shall solve our problems in a democratic way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the real reason for the purge is this. On the

night  of  the purge, the T.U.C. was on the point  of

changing  ownership  and everybody  in  this  country

understands what the T.U.C. means to the Labour Front

Government. The internal problems of the P.A.P., Sir,

can  be solved only by ourselves. We are a democratic

Party and our general membership is confident of  its

own capacity to solve our internal problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said in this House that there are three

forces in the fight for Malaya: the colonialists, the

Communists and the nationalists. Due to the fact that

the  P.A.P. is the most anti-colonial Party in Malaya

today,  it will be strange if the struggle  of  these

three forces is not reflected in our Party. But where

does  the Labour Front Government stand? We know from

its  action since the days of Mr Marshall  that  the

Labour Front is not pro-Communist. Then is it a  pro-colonialist  party or is it a nationalist  party?  If

the  Labour Front is a nationalist party, I am  at  a

loss to see why no mention is being made in the White

Paper  of  the agents of colonialism that we  believe

have  also in great numbers subverted our Party.  The

Labour  Front Coalition Government has been in  power

for nearly three years and in those three years may I

ask,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, what has it done to  capture

the hearts and the minds of the people?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have my doubts as to whether

the  hon. Member can ask that question. It is  to  my

mind  irrelevant  to  the motion  before  the  House.

Perhaps  if the hon. Member can indicate  how  it  is

relevant, I might allow him to continue.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> The White Paper, Sir, condemned

the  Jurong  branch of the P.A.P. for  organising  a

literary  class. Let me say this, Sir: this  literary

class  is  run by an U.M.N.O. member and  he  teaches

Malay to Chinese members of the Party. Is this not  a

contribution to the fostering of racial goodwill  and

the building of a Malayan nation? What has the Labour

Front   Government  done  in  this   connection?   In

Singapore,  Sir, the struggle against colonialism  is

reaching its climax. Never have the people been  more

united  and  determined to obtain the  freedom  which

they  deserve. Today in Singapore, our  Public  Enemy

No. 1 is still colonialism. All true nationalists and

genuine  democrats must unite themselves more solidly

than  ever  in  the  last lap of  the  fight  against

colonialism which is fast retreating from Asia and in

the building of an independent, united Malaya through

merger  with the Federation and then through  a  non-Communist democratic system we shall constitutionally

bring about a Socialist society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.54 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

motion  before  the  House  reads  that  this   House

"deplores".  The  White Paper  is  published  on  the

P.A.P. and  its activities. The mover of the  motion

has  given  an  account of his Party. He  seeks  the

support  of  the  Benches of the  Opposition  to  the

motion that this House "deplores". Now how can we who

are not members of the P.A.P. know anything about the

P.A.P. or what is going on in the P.A.P.? It is  only

the  members  of the P.A.P. and they can deplore.  On

the  other hand, the Government has published a White

Paper on its activities. I think it is the Government

which best knows their activities through the Special

Branch or other sources of information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the greatest respect for the

intelligence of the Member for Tanjong Pagar. We  may

or  we  may not have agreed on the principles of  his

Party  or he has not agreed on the principles of  our

Party but I do respect him in that he has always been

impersonal. Many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2609</b></font><br><br>



a  time  I have been asked, "Have you spoken anything

against what he said?" The main reason is this,  that

the  unity  should  be preserved  in  the  Opposition

Benches as far as possible to make the Government act

in  the right direction and that is one of the  chief

reasons  why we should not quarrel on the  Opposition

side.  But  now  he asks us to "deplore".  A  man  of

intelligence asking this is rather not understood  by

us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask the hon. mover of the motion two

questions? Is he attacking the Government  for  their

action   against  his  Party?  Has  he  also   before

protested against the arrests of the members  of  his

Party?  May  I ask who is keeping this Government  in

power? It is the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are a few words in this White Paper

which  to  me  are  of the greatest importance:  "the

elected  Government in the interest of  the  people".

Now  what  is an elected Government, may  I  ask?  An

elected government in a democratic country means  the

people's   elected  representatives  who   form   the

government with an elected majority. Out of 25  here,

there  are  ten  on the Government  side.  Is  it  an

elected majority Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is that relevant?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do appreciate that that

subject is near to the heart of the hon. Member but I

would  ask  him to indicate how that is  relevant  to

this motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Here is a Government speaking as an

elected Government and that is my reference to it. To

my  mind,  Sir, an elected Government should  be  the

majority   of   the  elected  Members   forming   the

Government.  Now, Sir, that is not so.  Then  how  do

they  exist?  Well, with the votes of  the  Nominated

Members plus the ex-officios; but they dare not  vote

all  the time with the Government on a non-confidence

motion  against them. They are kept by the P.A.P. in

power  all the time. Sir, I have said time and  again

during the Marshall Government before



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2610</b></font><br><br>



that  it  is the P.A.P. which supports it,  till  Mr

Marshall  honourably  retired.  Sir,  when  the   new

Government  was  formed, there were only  10  elected

Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I take it then that the hon.

Member  for  Telok  Ayer  is  supporting  the  motion

because   he   considers  that  the   term   "elected

Government" is an inaccuracy?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I have not indicated yet

whether  I  am supporting or opposing it. I  am  just

asking questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member cannot

satisfy the Chair as to how his remarks are relevant,

then he must desist.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Well, Sir, let me say this, that

this  motion is on the Coalition Government for  what

it  has done against the P.A.P., or the purge of  the

P.A.P.;   I   am  asking  the  question -  Does   this

Government exist because of P.A.P. support?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the remedy whether the Government should

exist  or not lies in the hands of the P.A.P. Perhaps

the P.A.P. has feared that the Liberal-Socialists might

form  a  Government  if the present  Government  were

overthrown,  but that is not so. The  people  on  our

side, who are always fighting for an elected majority

Government, will never form any government  and  have

not  even the idea of forming the government, without

an  elected  majority. Sir, the best  remedy,  may  I

suggest to the hon. Mover of the motion, is to  throw

out  this Government and have an all-Party Government

till the elections come. That will save a lot of cost

to  the public, if you can manage the Government till

election  time comes. I hope the mover of the  motion

will reply to this question I have asked: What is the

use  of  attacking  Government when  that  Government

exists on the P.A.P. vote?

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> What I say, Sir, is that an all-Party Government of this House should prepare for new

<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Well, Mr Speaker, this has been a

refreshing  interlude  in  an  at  other  times  more

serious debate; but I think we ought to return to the

main   subject  before  us,  after  this   diversion.

Usually,  Mr  Speaker,  the  People's  Action  Party

welcome  the limelight. In fact they press themselves

forward  to  get into it. But on this  occasion  they

find  the light thrown on them by the White Paper  is

one that shows up their spots and wrinkles, the parts

of  themselves which they hoped would not be exposed.

And  I  do well understand that the P.A.P. find  this

White  Paper  a bitter pill to swallow, because  they

have been guilty of the errors of judgment which  one

expects  from  young  men in a hurry.  I  have  great

respect  for  many  of  the members  of  the  P.A.P.,

including  indeed some of those who  are  at  present

enjoying the hospitality of Her Majesty in detention,

but  it  is most tragic to this country that  in  the

confidence  of youth and the inexperience  of  youth,

young  men  of ability and courage and fine qualities

should  allow themselves to be bewildered and bemused

by  slogans and catchwords, when they fail to  assess

reality  seriously, when they hasten  themselves  and

their  followers on to subject the whole  country  to

most dangerous and ill-advised courses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2612</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been in the past a considerable attitude

of  intellectual self-satisfaction in  the  P.A.P.  I

remember that in the very first speech which the hon.

Member  for Tanjong Pagar made in this House he  laid

stress  on  the  extent to which  the  P.A.P. thinks

thoroughly  and carefully and weighs its  words  well

before  it makes any pronouncement. And of course  in

the  speech he just made this morning, the same thing

again - he drew attention to the need to be precise and

clear  in what he was saying. That is a very laudable

and admirable attitude in a political leader and in a

political Party, but it is not in itself a sufficient

attitude unless the precise decisions are based on  a

thorough analysis of the real situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears to me that the P.A.P. thought that they

could  ride on the shoulders of the Communists  to  a

nationalistic  victory. And  I  might,  Mr  Speaker,

quote  not  my  own  views but  those  of  Mr  Habib

Bourghuiba, the founder of the Neo-Destour  Party  in

Tunisia  and  now its Prime Minister and Minister  of

Foreign  Affairs, and the President of the  Tunisian

National  Assembly, because he has some very sensible

things   to  say  on  this  problem.  He  writes   on

"Nationalism  the  antidote to  Communism".  He  says

this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One of my earliest companions in the struggle for

independence  is  a case in point. As  a  student  in

Paris,  at  a time when French rule seemed absolutely

unalterable   and   the  original  Destour   movement

standing  still,  he became a member  of  the  French

Communist Party, but after he had returned to Tunisia

he realised that Communism was a false substitute for

his patriotic ideals and he joined me in founding the

Neo-Destour Party to fight actively for independence.

Today he laughs at his youthful error and finds  that

his concern for social justice is fully satisfied  by

the struggle to develop his new country."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the people who have really done a fine

job  in  Tunisia and who have incidentally  kept  the

Tunisian Communist Party, the P.C.T., down to one per

cent   of  the  votes  actually  cast  in  the   last

elections. The Communist Party there sought, said Mr

Bourghuiba-

deplore inaccuracies in the White Paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Indeed, Sir, what I am seeking

to  arrive  at is related to the speech of  the  hon.

Member for Tanjong Pagar, and I think perhaps  I  had

better  refer  to  that and the irrelevance  will  be

cleared.  He said that "the P.A.P. are quite  capable

of   looking  after  ourselves".  He  admitted  quite

frankly that there were Communists in the P.A.P. and

that he had been engaged in a life and death struggle

with them. But he said, "We knew they had come in. We

knew  we could deal with them. There was no need  for

the  Government to intervene. We felt that  we  could

deal with them all right by ourselves."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of explanation, Sir, If

the  Hon. the Minister for Communications and  Works

wishes to have a copy of my speech I will provide him

said no such things.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I am not clear which thing the

hon. Member thinks I have misrepresented. I think  he

did clearly admit that he had Communists in the Party

and he was engaged in a struggle with them.

1955, that is two years ago, concerning Mr Yong  Kok

Kim,  of  whom  the hon. Member for Bukit  Timah  was

quoted in the Press as having said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I share the same beliefs and have the same aims as

Fong   Swee  Suan  and  Yong  Kok  Kim.  I  therefore

challenge the Government to arrest me too." - July  11, 1955.



<br><br>August 24, 1955, Mr Yong Kok Kim was convicted in an

open  court  of  law  and sentenced  to  five  years'

imprisonment for terrorist activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was one Communist ally whom the hon. Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar regarded as a dissident  faction,

not as a Communist danger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the point I was making, Mr Speaker, is a

little  further  in  Mr  Bourghuiba's  remarks.   He

referred   to   a  Singapore  journalist's   article,

"Nationalists  hatching Red  eggs",  published  in  a

Singapore newspaper in 1951, and he regarded it as  a

very  appropriate and intelligent comment on  certain

types of nationalists. And he goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If a country were to link its political or economic

fate  to  that of the Communists how long  could  its

civilisation endure? A unified philosophy, a  unified

way  of  life  are essential conditions  of  national

stability."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the P.A.P. has a dissident faction but feels it

has  not  got Communists. Well, that is a  matter  on

which  discussion is possible but I do not  think  it

can be accepted that they have managed to study their

Party  with  all  the care that they  ought  to  have

taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member sought to deal with inaccuracies in

the  White  Paper but what he really dealt with  were

omissions.   He  felt  that  the  White   Paper   was

"preoccupied with the P.A.P."- those were  his  words

and I wrote them down. I do not think it is like that

at  all. The P.A.P. is referred to a number of  times

but  what the White Paper is preoccupied with is  the

Communist  threat which is noted as having its  many-pronged  advance in its attack on the national  unity

and national freedom of this territory; and since the

P.A.P. was one of the vigorous, active organisations

in  the  nationalist front, of course the  Communists

sought  to  destroy them as well as any other  Party.

And with great



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2615</b></font><br><br>



respect to the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar, I  feel

that  we cannot stand by in this country, recognising

the   Communist  danger  and  yet  saying,  "We  will

surrender a Government duty to the public - the duty of

securing  public welfare - and leave it to the  leaders

of  a  political  Party  who  have  shown  themselves

capable  of serious errors - leave it to them to  purge

themselves." They have had a long run. Everyone  knew

before  the  elections in 1955 that there  were  what

would   become   dissident   factions   amongst   the

supporters  of the P.A.P. Everyone knew  during  1955

that  the  Member for Bukit Timah associated  himself

with  a  man  who was proved in open court  to  be  a

Communist. Everyone has known that ever since, except

the P.A.P. leaders themselves, or so they wish us  to

believe.  I have great sympathy with them  and  I  am

sure they have been doing their best, and that it  is

an  embarrassment and a difficulty to them  that  the

Government  has had to step in and say, "Well,  I  am

afraid  you are not winning your fight. It  does  not

look  as though you are doing well enough and we have

to  get you out of your difficulties." Not because we

want  to  help  the  P.A.P. or to  hinder  them,  but

because  the  country  is  more  important  than  any

particular Party or any particular individual. It  is

the country which has got to be thought of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I read this White Paper I did not say to

myself,  "Oh  dear,  oh dear,  there  is  the  P.A.P.

getting into a mess. We have got to lift them out  of

the  mess and give them a chance to start again." Nor

did I say, "Here are these terrible P.A.P. people who

have  got to be disgraced, degraded, put to shame  in

the  eyes  of  the public." Neither  of  those  lines

occurred to me. I was not thinking of them very much.

It  seemed to be inescapable that something had to be

done  and  what  was in my mind was  the  welfare  of

Singapore and of the people of Singapore, which is  a

matter  of real importance and the real objective  of

good government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2616</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member made the point that there were no

civil disturbances before this round-up. It seems  to

be  rather  a  dubious point to make.  We  cannot  be

expected  always to wait until there is going  to  be

rioting in the streets before people are arrested  if

necessary. Nobody doubts that when it suits them  the

Communist  Party in Malaya or Singapore  or  anywhere

else  in  the world will play a legal part. The  hon.

Member  for Tanjong Pagar knows as well as I do  what

Lenin wrote in his "Left-wing Communism, an infantile

disorder,"  in  which he said that the  revolutionary

spirit  of  young Communists is often  admirable  but

they have got to learn political sense; the time  for

the revolution was when the situation had ripened  to

the  extent that revolution could succeed, and  until

then the good Communist, the practical Communist, had

got  to  twist and turn and make allies  wherever  he

could, and play a legal part and even, in some cases,

appear  to  go against his principles. Because  that

was  a necessary step towards the ultimate objective

and  that was the real test of the Communist. It  was

not  his  willingness when the revolution had started

to go out in the streets and burn and fight and kill;

the  real test for the Communist, according to Lenin,

was  his  ability  to  sacrifice  that  revolutionary

ardour for a deeper purpose, a deeper ardour,  to  go

hand-in-hand  with his enemies, to lead  them  along,

sweetly smiling, until the time was ripe to stab them

in  the  back.  That I am sure the  hon.  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar and his fellow leaders in his Party are

now aware of. I doubt if they realised it and applied

to their own situation back in 1954 and 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I have always been aware of it, and for a

long  time it has been the basic danger in Singapore.

It  is  not that the Communists will come out in  the

open.  They know they will be beaten at once if  they

do.  They know the people are not on their side.  The

danger  is  of the dedicated right-wing Communists - no

adventurism,  nothing wild, the man  who  smiles  and

shakes your hand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2617</b></font><br><br>



and  co-operates  with  you at  every  stage  but  is

building up his own position for the time when he can

destroy democracy and destroy freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very difficult path for the Communists to

take. Very often they fail. The Communists' political

judgment,  Mr  Speaker, is  often  weak.  They  have

intense limitations. Their Marxist dialectic - which is

a  useful  tool  but  a dangerous  one - puts  them  in

blinkers  to the realities of the situation,  to  the

need  of  analysis of the thesis and the  anti-thesis

and  the synthesis. They see the developing situation

in  too  narrow terms and so they lead themselves  to

misjudge  the  situation and hasten into  ill-advised

and  dangerous action which in the end, too often for

their  happiness,  nullifies their best  efforts  and

their most well-plotted treacheries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we cannot, Mr Speaker, blind ourselves to the

very  real and permanent danger which this Government

has  to  face from the sustained Communist attack.  I

have   said   before  in  this  Assembly   that   the

concentration   of  attention  on  the  anti-colonial

struggle  was necessary in the past but  that  it  is

essential1y looking backwards and not forwards, and I

have  urged Members of this Assembly to look  forward

to  the  future. The Communists have been playing  up

the  anti-colonial struggle for their  own  interests

here,  and in Tunisia and in every other place  where

they  could  use that counter in the political  game,

not  because they are sincerely anti-colonialist  but

because   they   wish  to  substitute   a   Communist

imperialism  for  a capitalist imperialism.  And  the

young nationalist too easily falls for this Communist

facade of anti-colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Bourghuiba - I will refrain from further quoting him in case that is irrelevant - but it is in point

because  I feel the P.A.P. of Singapore has been  led

up  the same garden path to the same point of danger.

Imperialism, on Lenin's analysis, is the  last  stage

of  capitalist development. It is marked by  the  big

outflow  of  capital investment from the  imperialist

power  to the under-developed areas in which  it  has

its colonies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2618</b></font><br><br>



That outflow of capital has substantially ceased.  It

began to dry up before the last world war. Since  the

last  world  war, private capitalist  investment  has

been  dribbling  away and the imperialist  capitalist

system  has been withering on its stalk for  lack  of

sap  to  keep it going. And consequently anybody  who

has   seriously  studied  the  situation  has   said:

colonialism is going to end; it may be five years, it

may be 10, but the writing is on the wall. That is on

the  economic analysis of the situation, which  is  a

Marxist analysis if you like to take it like that; if

the  economic  substructure is  not  there  then  the

political  superstructure will collapse. And  if  the

economic   flow  of  capital  disappears,  then   the

political  superstructure of  colonialism  must  also

disappear. The situation has changed in its  economic

base  and  consequently the political structure  must

also change.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the excitable young nationalist fails to make

this analysis and, consequently, ties himself up with

the Communists instead of settling down seriously  to

say,  "What shall we do to make this into  a  country

fit  for our people when we have control of it?"  The

hon.  Member for Tanjong Pagar told us very  recently

in  this  House how one of his friends or  colleagues

now  in  Changi Prison had said to him, "I say,  man!

The  Federation is getting Merdeka! I  say,  we  must

think  about  this. Oh, I say, we'd better  tell  the

chaps  in  the  jungle to stop their armed  conflict.

This  is  getting dangerous. They're fighting against

the elected Government." Really, a man who is as slow

in  his  thought  as  that, who could  not  see  this

inevitable  development  over  the  last  few  years,

really hardly deserves to be taken seriously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Bukit Timah way back in

November 1955 said the Emergency has acted as a check

on   the   growth  of  the  activities  of  all   the

progressive  nationalist forces in this  country  and

has  meant the expenditure of large sums of money  to

exterminate  the Malayan Communist Party.  All  these

resources and money, he said, could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2619</b></font><br><br>



have  been  more profitably used for the  social  and

economic  development of this country. The  Emergency

has  wasted human life and material resources without

achieving  a  single beneficial result. And  that  is

what Communism has done for Malaya and Singapore,  to

waste  human  lives,  human resources,  and  material

wealth;  and  that is what it will do  unless  it  is

brought  under  control and the Communists  learn  by

bitter  experience that they are not going to  get  a

free chance to work treacherously for the destruction

of the prosperity and wealth of this country, for the

destruction  of  freedom,  for  the  destruction   of

national unity. That is perhaps the inaccuracy  which

the  hon.  Member might have picked on, in  that  the

White  Paper has not stressed that aspect - the  aspect

of  the ill-judgment, the errors of the non-Communist

members  of the P.A.P. who allowed themselves  to  be

led up the garden path.



<br><br>11.27 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  speak in support of the motion  before  this

House.  The  White Paper, as a political analysis  of

the current situation, is naive and immature, but  as

an  attempt at concealment and evasion it is quite  a

cunning   piece  after  months  of  tedious   labour.

However,  Sir,  it cannot conceal the inconsistencies

and  the inaccuracies of fact. It is unfortunate that

'he   trade  unions  in  this  island  are   divided,

primarily,   Sir,  because  of  different   political

affiliations. We all know once the T.U.C. is gone the

Labour  Front has no "mass" base. The office  of  the

Hon. the Chief Minister and consequently the  labour

Front becomes shaky. The White Paper did not tell  us

the  fact that were it not for this purge, the T.U.C.

may   have  changed  its  political  complexion   and

affiliations on the night of the purge. But purge  or

no purge, Sir, in the long run, the leadership of the

trade union movement can only be effectively achieved

and   consolidated   by  better  organisation,   more

unselfish work and more sacrifice.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2620</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation of Malaya has just won its freedom

but  the  struggle  for Merdeka in Singapore  through

merger  with the Federation still goes on. There  are

three main forces competing for political control  of

Singapore  and  Malaya after Merdeka.  They  are  the

forces  of reaction, the forces of democracy and  the

forces  of  Communism.  The  British,  knowing   that

colonialism is bound to go soon, naturally would want

a  Party  that represents the forces of  reaction  to

succeed them in the control of political power.  Sir,

most  of  the  moves and counter-moves by  the  three

major  forces  in  this island - and perhaps  by  other

minor forces - are reflected in the internal affairs of

the People's Action Party. The reason is very simple.

The P.A.P. is a mass Party and is in the vanguard  of

the  anti-colonial  movement.  The  White  Paper  has

openly  accused the P.A.P. of being a Communist-front

organisation. Why did the White Paper  not  call  the

P.A.P. a British colonial-front organisation? For  if

the  White Paper is true then there must be  as  many

Special   Branch  agents  as  Communists   who   have

infiltrated into the Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the attitude disclosed in the White Paper is

purely  negative.  It is sterile  to  be  just  anti-Communist.  Unless we are prepared to  work  for  the

people, to educate them and organise them, fill their

lives  with  a sense of purpose and fulfilment,  give

them  the  knowledge of reading, writing, of culture,

of joining in a worth-while movement to improve their

lives  and the lives of their fellow-men, to build  a

new,  cleaner  and more just society,  we  have  only

ourselves to blame if they are led away by those  who

are prepared to do these things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party, Sir, the P.A.P., is prepared to work and

join  and  lead  the people in their movement  for  a

better  life for themselves and a better  future  for

their  children.  So  long as we  do  that  there  is

nothing  the  Labour  Front, or the  British  or  the

Communists  can  do  to check  the  progress  of  our

movement. Whatever the White Paper is trying  to  do,

to  damage  us  by deliberately suppressing  and  the

dressing  up  of  the whole truth, we  know  we  will

succeed  in the end, on our own strength and  on  our

merits.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the hon. Mover of this motion has tried

to   make   out   that  the  Labour   Front-Coalition

Government was trying by the purge of 22nd August  to

destroy  the People's Action Party. I can assure  him

and  the  House that the Labour Front did nothing  of

that  kind. The Labour Front Government, if it wanted

to,  could,  by  a  stroke of the  pen,  destroy  the

P.A.P.,  but it did nothing of that kind, because  we

maintained - and still maintain - that the  P.A.P. is  a

legitimate political organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar referred to

paragraphs 36 and 37 of the White Paper. Now, he  did

not refer to paragraphs 26 and 27 of the White Paper,

nor  did he deny the facts as stated therein. I  will

read to him paragraph

26:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is established Communist policy to make use of

suitable  political  parties and to  exploit  popular

causes  such  as  independence, nationalism  and  the

rights  of  the  workers, - issues  which  enable   the

'masses  to  be  organised' and provide opportunities

for  trained  Communists to secure  political  power.

Known  Communists  supported  the  P.A.P. from   its

formation in 1954."



<br><br>I repeat, "Known Communists supported the P.A.P. from

its formation in 1954."-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good use was made of the general election in 1955

to  bring to the support of the P.A.P. the full power

of   the   underground  Communist   organisation   in

Singapore  and  to rally all who were sympathetic  or

potential  converts. Selected persons were manoeuvred

into  key  positions, and the P.A.P. was firmly  linked

with  the  trade unions in which the Communists  were

establishing   themselves.   Communist   sympathisers

previously engaged in secret Communist plotting  were

instructed   to   sever  all  connection   with   the

underground    organisation,    to    destroy     all

incriminating secret documents, and to concentrate on

overt and perfectly legitimate political work."



<br><br>Then paragraph 27:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government was reluctant to take action likely

to  affect  the  legitimate activities  of  a  lawful

political  party, but on October 2nd,  1956,  it  was

necessary to arrest under the Preservation of  Public

Security  Ordinance  a  central  executive  committee

member  of the P.A.P. in consequence of the Communist

Front challenge to lawful authority later in October,

no  less  than 14 office bearers and other prominent

members of the P.A.P. were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2622</b></font><br><br>



arrested  and  are  still  held  in  detention.  They

include  three  of  the  original  convenors  of  the

Party."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be unfortunate, Sir, that the White Paper

did not specify enough that some of the picnics, some

of  the  cultural  meetings were  held  to  inculcate

Communism  or  were  the pretexts for  indoctrinating

Communism   into  those  people  who  attended   such

cultural  meetings and picnics. Now I wish  to  point

out paragraph 30 of the White Paper, which states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In April [1957] the Kampong Kapor branch of the

P.A.P. held a picnic of about 300 persons at  Loyang

at  which  typical Communist behaviour was  observed.

And  on  April  14th another picnic was organised  at

Loyang  of about 1,000 persons, many of whom were  of

student   age.  Again  there  was  typical  Communist

behaviour;  and  a well-disciplined party  from  this

picnic  demonstrated  with slogans  and  songs  at  a

public  rally on the Padang that afternoon to welcome

back the Merdeka delegation from London.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is significant that the Member for Tanjong Pagar

did not deny this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to make out also that the Executive

Secretary of the Labour Front closed down several  of

the   Labour  Front  branches  because  of  Communist

influence.  I  can tell him that no such  thing  ever

happened, and I should know better than he  does.  He

has always stressed that the P.A.P. is striving for a

non-Communist, independent, Socialist Malaya; I would

like to hear him say that he is striving for an anti-Communist, independent, Socialist Malaya.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is indeed

a  strange  change of scene this morning.  Last  year

when  we  took  action  against subversive  elements,

there was the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar tabling a

motion  deploring the arrests and the action  of  the

Government  in  closing down a  number  of  Communist

Front  organisations. But what do we  see  today?  He

does   not   deplore  the  action  but   rather   the

inaccuracies which he alleges are in the White Paper.

Maybe  he  has come now to the realisation  that  his

Party is not as clean as he thought it was last year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2623</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he referred to the annual conference of his

Party  on  4th  August this year. Since  that  annual

conference  we  have  been treated  to  a  series  of

newspaper  reports about the conflict - which  he  does

not  deny - that has been going on in the newly elected

Central  Executive Committee, it was indeed  an  eye-opener to all of us and we became more acutely  aware

of  the  trial of strength in the P.A.P. between  the

genuine  democratic leaders and the  Communist  Front

leaders.  This trial of strength could no  longer  be

kept  within the Party. The Communist penetration  of

the P.A.P. can now no longer be disguised!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar and his group of

genuine democratic leaders had to surrender power  to

the  Communist group, and this leads us to ask:  Does

he  now  speak for his Party or only for himself  and

his  friends? Previously, Sir, he avoided any  public

comment on the Government's action by saying that  he

held  no  office and had no mandate from  his  Party.

Then  the new Secretary-General of the Party resigned

because of "ill-health". Perhaps, Sir, he has a  cold

in  his feet. Now, Sir, the hon. Member comes to life

and puts down this motion, and as I said, Sir, what a

motion! He does not seek to deplore the action of the

Government  but rather the inaccuracies contained  in

the  White  Paper in support of our  action.  What  a

change  of  front! What a change of front,  September

1957 compared with October 1956!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am indeed very sorry that the hon. Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar should be in this  plight  but  I

cannot  let my sympathy for him undermine my duty  to

the  public and to Singapore. The threat is real  and

must  not  be belittled. We have had enough of  riots

and  disturbances. We cannot sit  by  and  watch  the

Communist Front reorganise and corrupt the  minds  of

the  workers  and the simple people. If  the  genuine

democratic leaders of the P.A.P. will not  act,  then

we must, and we will.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2624</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of inaccuracies, Sir, the hon.. Member for

Tanjong  Pagar  is  of  course well  placed  to  know

exactly what goes on inside the various branches  and

committees of the P.A.P. And on many points of detail

he  may  well  be more accurately informed  than  the

Government,  but  minor  inaccuracies  on  points  of

detail do not affect the main conclusion of the White

Paper. The truth is - and the hon. Member knows  it  to

be  the truth - that the P.A.P. has been penetrated  by

Communists.  Control  of the  Party's  education  and

propaganda organisation has clearly passed  into  the

hands  of  those  who, knowingly or  recklessly,  are

working for the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no good the hon. Member trying to explain

away  the evidence, to dismiss it as exaggerated,  or

to  belittle the threat to Singapore. He himself, too

late, on 4th August, 1957, tried to check the control

of  the  Communists  and their  sympathisers  on  the

Party.  Sir,  why  has he allowed the  P.A.P. to  be

penetrated  in this way? He was in the best  position

to  purge the Party of those who would use it only to

destroy  freedom and genuine democracy in  Singapore.

As a genuine Socialist and a genuine democrat, he had

a  duty to fight Communism, but for two years now  he

has  preferred to try to ride a tiger. Why? Why? Why?

We all know the answer. We also know that he is being

used  by these people for their own ends and will  be

thrown  overboard as soon as they no  longer  require

him.  It  will  not surprise us to learn  that  these

people no longer now require him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Government, Sir, is not prepared to

sacrifice  the interests of Singapore for a temporary

political advantage. We will do our duty cost us what

it may. We will do our duty cost us what it may!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not maintain in the White Paper that all

actions of the P.A.P and its branches, or all members

of  the  P.A.P., are Communist. No. But  what  we  do

maintain  is  that  the  Party has  been  dangerously

penetrated  by  Communists and their  fellow-workers,

and  they are misleading and gaining control  of  the

Party. Seven out of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2625</b></font><br><br>



19  P.A.P. arrests  are identified  members  of  the

Communist secret organisation. Seven out of 19!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know when I faced the duty of checking the

Communist  threat  that  any  action  taken   against

members  of the P.A.P. will be criticised - as  it  has

been  criticised  by  the  hon.  Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar - as using the pretext of the public interest  to

damage   an  opposition  political  Party.  But   the

situation was so grave and the duty to act so  strong

that  my colleagues and I were prepared to face  that

criticism rather than shirk our duty. We are prepared

to  face  that criticism rather than shirk our  duty!

Our  conscience is clear. Is his conscience clear?  I

wonder!  We have set out the grounds for our  action,

We are content to be judged by Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am astonished and saddened that any

responsible person should suggest that the Government

should   allow  the  Communist  threat   to   develop

unchecked  until  it  is  able  to  challenge  lawful

authority by violence. We have had violence enough in

Singapore.  We have seen the technique of  those  who

seek  to  create conditions of chaos and the  violent

overthrow  of  a  democratic form  of  Government  in

Singapore.  We saw how they exploited  the  Hock  Lee

strike in 1955, how they attempted to awe the elected

Government  by  a general strike the  same  year.  We

witnessed with horror the days and nights of  rioting

in  October  last year. We should be failing  in  our

duty if we did not use the powers to prevent disorder

and  violence.  The Preservation of  Public  Security

Ordinance gives us the power of detention to  prevent

a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the

authority  of  Malaya  or the maintenance  of  public

order  therein. It is in the discharge of  that  duty

laid upon us by this Assembly that we have acted, and

the  general grounds of our action are given  in  the

White  Paper. The case, Sir, against each  individual

now   detained  will  be  considered  by  the  Appeal

Tribunal  under  the  law. Our duty  is  to  preserve

security  rather than to restore order  after  riots.

Our  duty, Sir, is to preserve public security rather

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar, Sir, can speak

about the T.U.C. The T.U.C. will be in a position  to

reply to all the allegations that he has made. It  is

not  the duty of the Government to reply, but I  will

say  this:  that  it  is not true  to  say  that  the

Government is taking this action in order to save the

T.U.C.  The T.U.C. will, in due course, let the  hon.

Member for Tanjong Pagar know what had been going  on

between  the  evil  forces  in  Singapore  and  their

democratic forces, and who were winning them.  It  is

not true to suggest that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar. Sir, tries to say

that  out  of  12  members in the  Central  Executive

Committee only five were Communists. 'Therefore there

are  still  seven  of  us who are  in  the  majority;

therefore  we  will win in the end; we will  win  the

fight.' This description of the P.A.P. as having been

penetrated  by Communists, and that the  leaders  of

the  P.A.P. were weak and were not able to  meet  the

threat  is  all  wrong because we were seven  against

five.  But I may point out to him, Sir, that  if  the

Secretary-General of the P.A.P., of that  group,  had

not  suddenly  got  cold feet  because  five  of  his

comrades had been taken in under the Preservation  of

Public  Security Ordinance, he might not have  seven;

he was having six against six.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government opposes the motion before the

House.



<br><br>11.52 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar asks us to deplore

the inaccuracies contained in the White Paper, and as

we  in the opposition Party are not in a position  to

know  the full facts of what is accurate and what  is

not  accurate, we have to rely on the statements made

by  the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar and by the Hon.

the Chief Minister in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the first time that I have seen the hon.

Member  for Tanjong Pagar break down in what must  be

the most important speech of his life. He has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2627</b></font><br><br>



always moved us with his eloquence, spirit and  warm-heartedness,  but  this morning he  was  surprisingly

cold.  Every  word of what he said this  morning  was

read from a prepared speech and -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot allow that. That is a

very serious reflection on the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> My humble apologies, Sir. Anyway,

the way he delivered his speech this morning has left

us,  particularly me, absolutely cold.  It  does  not

seem to have voiced his real thoughts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand the Chief Minister has moved me a

great  deal.  It  seemed to me he was  speaking  with

absolute sincerity for the concern of the public  and

the  peace  and  safety of all the  peoples  in  this

country. What he is doing is to prevent riots, not to

stop  them. His chief point is that he is  trying  to

prevent riots and disorders before they start, rather

than to stop them or have to meet them half-way;  and

we  all  agree  with  him that  we  have  had  enough

disorders  and  riots,  and all law-abiding  citizens

will  agree with me that any measure to prevent  such

disorders  at their inception should be  welcomed  by

all of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it must be a very painful job for the

Government or for anyone to have done what Government

has  done in trying to enforce law and order.  We  in

the  opposition, if we want the safety and the  peace

of our country not to be disturbed, then it is for us

to  stand by Government when it is prepared to do all

the  things which must be very distasteful to it  and

at the risk of its political future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I for one say that when there is a shooting

war in the Federation and a cold war in Singapore, it

is  for us, all law-abiding citizens, to support  the

Government in its stand to keep peace and security in

Singapore,  for without peace and security Singapore,

a trading centre, will cease to exist.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this morning the

Hon. the  Chief  Minister challenged my  credentials

when  he  enquired whether I spoke for  my  Party  or

whether I spoke for my friends in the Party. I  would

like to tell him and every other Member in this House

that  this motion and my speech in support of it were

the  decision of the Emergency Council of the Central

Executive Committee of the People's Action Party.  We

are the leadership of the Party. If for one moment  I

believed  I  no longer represented the  views  of  my

Party,  I - and  I have my colleagues' mandate  to  say

this, - they and I would not stay for one moment longer

than necessary in the Party or in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister has to make up his mind

what his line is - whether we are Communists or whether

we  are  a  genuine  political Party.  He  said  this

morning that of the 19 members of the Party arrested,

seven had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2629</b></font><br><br>



connections - I  have  forgotten  the  exact  words - but

seven out of the 19 had connections with the M.C.P. I

assume, therefore, that the other 12 are included  in

the category referred to in the last paragraph of the

White Paper, in the sentence:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those who recklessly and knowingly allow themselves

to  be  used  by the Communists, or uncritically  and

unwarily accept their easy and deceptive slogans,  or

deliberately create conditions which make easier  the

path of Communists to power, must be checked."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 10,000 members of the People's Action

Party. Does he say that these 10,000 members come in

that  category, or does he say only  19  out  of  the

10,000  come  within this category? Let me  tell  him

that  we  were elected at a Party conference  on  4th

August,  at  which we put the issues very fairly  and

squarely.  The Minister for Communications and  Works

challenged our wisdom, according to him, of riding on

the shoulders of the Communist Party to a nationalist

victory.  Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, one other Member  in

this  House  in  April this year  made  some  similar

foolish  accusations, We took him to  task.  We  went

back  to Tanjong Pagar and vindicated our stand,  and

that   Member  has  suffered  a  premature  political

demise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is my mandate, and I say that no other

Member  in this House has a more clear-cut or fresher

mandate  than myself, given on 29th June  this  year,

and I would like to tell this House what this mandate

is. This is from my election manifesto sent to 12,000

voters  in Tanjong Pagar in which my Party stand  was

clearly stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On 2nd April, 1955 you elected me as your

representative in the Legislative Assembly. This  by-election  is not a fight by me to get a seat  in  the

Assembly  as I could have stayed on in my seat.  This

by-election is to find out if you who elected  me  as

the P.A.P. candidate in April 1955 approve of the stand

that  I  as a member of the P.A.P. and of the  recent

constitutional mission to London took on two  issues,

which  are the constitutional proposals and the anti-subversion clause. If you agree with my stand and the

P.A.P.'s, methods  in fighting for  an  independent,

united  Malaya, then you can show your  approval  and

your trust in my Party by giving your vote for me,"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2630</b></font><br><br>



And in bold type what the P.A.P, believes in:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1. To end colonialism and establish an independent,

united Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To create a democratic, non-Communist Government

of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To abolish the unjust inequalities of wealth and

opportunity of the present social system, and provide

equal opportunities for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. To build a Malayan consciousness among the

people of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence we stand for an independent and

democratic Malaya. This means that we must first  get

rid  of colonialism by non-violent and constitutional

means."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again in bold type:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the most effective and practical way of

fighting   against   colonialism?   We   must   crush

colonialism, British colonialism, strong and cunning.

We  need several rounds to knock them out. The  first

round is to expose the Rendel Constitution."



<br><br>And  let the Hon. the Minister for Communications and

Works  remember that in 1954 Mr C. C. Tan, and  even

the  Hon. the Chief Minister, proposed a constitution

which,  according to Mr C. C. Tan, should  last  for

eight  years. We are not ashamed of the fact that  we

mobilised  the people in opposition against  what  we

considered a lousy and a rotten constitution.  It  is

our  work that brought about a change in the attitude

of  the  British Government in 1956-57. This we  have

done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second round is to fight for a constitution

which  will  give Singapore internal self-government,

This  we  have  in the new constitutional  proposals.

This is not Merdeka; this is not independence. I have

honestly  and sincerely told the people of  Singapore

each   time   before  I  went  to  London   for   the

constitutional negotiations with the Colonial  Office

that we are demanding 75 per cent Merdeka. The island

of   Singapore,   with  its  one-and-a-half   million

inhabitants  cannot become an independent  nation  by

itself.  We  can only attain independence  through  a

merger  with  the  Federation. 'Independence  through

merger' - that  is  our battle-cry in the  third  round

with British colonialism."



<br><br>That,  Sir, is the P.A.P. mandate on 29th  June  this

year  which, I am glad to note from the White  Paper,

has been adopted by the Labour Front.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2631</b></font><br><br>



I would like now to answer two important points which

have been raised in the course of this debate. Now it

has  been  suggested by the Hon. the  Chief  Minister

that  we have not been consistent. Last year we  were

ferocious,  we  were  brave  in  opposition  to   the

Government; this year we have become mild  and  timid

and  timorous.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, genuine  political

leaders  do  not  get  cold feet.  In  an  emergency,

courage  is  what we show and our policy is  dictated

not because we have got cold feet, not because we are

afraid to be locked up by the Hon. the Chief Minister

and  his colleagues, but because of our principle and

our  policy. We say quite clearly, and I said it this

morning  at  the  end of my speech,  that  those  who

fought  with us on the agreed Party policy  we  stand

by;  but  even  those  in  our  Party  who  tried  to

undermine our policy we do not abandon. It is  up  to

the  Government to show that they are  Communists  or

Communist agents. Until then we shall press for their

rights under the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, the position this year is well

known  to  anybody  who has been following  political

trends  in Singapore. I would like to read an excerpt

from  the  annual report of my Party which  the  last

Central  Executive Committee presented to  an  annual

conference.  And  this will explain the  consistency,

the  honesty of our stand. We said, on page 5 of this

report:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1957 Merdeka Mission: In March this year, an all-Party delegation left for London to reopen talks for

a   constitution  giving  Singapore  internal   self-government. Our Party delegate was Mr Lee Kuan  Yew.

The  delegation was charged with a mandate agreed  to

previously  at an all-Party convention.  The  minimum

demands  were  agreed to unanimously by  the  Central

Executive Committee at the end of February 1957.  One

of  the  decisions  made unanimously  by the  Central

Executive  Committee at the meeting on Saturday,  2nd

March, was to postpone the fresh elections under  the

new  constitution from the target date of August 1957

in order to allow time for the new Singapore citizens

to  be registered and given the right to vote at  the

elections.  The  length  of  the  postponement  would

depend  on the period set aside for registration.  It

was  estimated that for a registration period of  six

months, a years delay was probable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2632</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tanjong Pagar By-election: When the Party delegate

was  in  London, certain trade union officials joined

Mr  David  Marshall in attacking the Party  for  the

decision to postpone the elections until registration

of new Singapore citizens and attempted to coerce the

Party into reversing its decision. The Party delegate

returned with the all-Party Delegation on 14th April,

These  attacks on the Party continued.  The  proposed

agreed   constitution  giving  only  internal   self-government was also attacked by Mr Marshall and this

group.  In the debate in the Legislative Assembly  on

the constitutional talks, these attacks culminated in

a challenge by Mr Marshall to the Party Secretary to

resign  and  fight  him in a by-election  in  Tanjong

Pagar.  Three days later Mr Marshall announced  that

he  had  retired from politics and did not intend  to

contest  the  by-election. In view of  the  malicious

attack  made  on  the  Party, the  Central  Executive

Committee  decided  to  place  our  record  for   the

judgment of the electorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues we placed before the electorate were:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediate: 1. Accept internal self-government in the

new constitutional proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Reject clause 30 banning subversive elements from

taking part in the first general elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-term: 1. To end colonialism and establish an

independent, united Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To create a democratic non-communist government

of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To abolish the unjust inequalities of wealth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Malayan consciousness."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, this year the position is

quite  simple.  The  first attempt - and  this  is  for

political  innocents in this House who have  not,  or

who are unable to read between the lines of political

events - the  first  attempt  to  undermine  the  Party

policy was in March this year. On 2nd March, 1957, at

a full meeting of the Central Executive Committee, we

decided  unanimously to have registration of the  new

Singapore citizens first, and then elections for  the

Legislative Assembly under the new constitution.  The

White  Paper  giving  the mandate  to  the  all-Party

Delegation  for the London Constitutional  Talks  was

also  agreed. The shortcomings of the constitution

giving   only  internal  self-government  was   fully

appreciated by everyone. On Sunday, 3rd March,  these

decisions  of  the  Party, my Party,  were  announced

publicly at our Paya Lebar Branch conference. On  the

6th  our  Party  Assemblymen voted for the  all-Party

White Paper on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2633</b></font><br><br>



the  Legislative Assembly debate. On Friday,  8th,  I

left for London.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was in London attending the constitutional

talks,  a  group  in Singapore, which  included  some

political adventurers in the Party, started agitation

for  registration for new citizens after, not before,

elections.  This group made use of the  names  of  19

unions,  and  statements were issued  condemning  the

decision  to  register new Singapore citizens  before

general elections. But the firm and resolute stand of

the  Central  Executive Committee, supported  by  the

majority  of  our Party members, foiled the  plot  of

this  group. They stood by the mandate to  the  Party

delegate and the plot to have him disavowed, to  have

me  disavowed while I was away at the talks,  failed.

This  was  the  first  act in a series  of  left-wing

adventurism of this dissident Party faction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, having failed from within the Party, they tried

to  coerce the Party from without, and they exploited

the  personal and political weaknesses of  Mr  David

Marshall  and instigated him to challenge  the  Party

stand. Mr Speaker, Sir, in April this year I do  not

think many Members in this House understood what  was

going  on  because they are only concerned  with  the

superficialities of political cross-talk. But we were

not concerned with the personal likes and dislikes of

Mr David Marshall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when our stand was challenged and when Mr

Marshall  happened to be the tool, the agent  through

which the challenge was made, we had no choice but to

accept  the  challenge. On 28th April, Mr  Marshall,

taking  the  line of this group, attacked the  Party,

attacked the new constitution, asked for registration

of  new  citizens  after general elections,  proposed

some  fantastic  scheme  of registration  by  way  of

Identity  Cards.  But  after  we  had  accepted   the

challenge this group of adventurers backed  down  and

Mr  Marshall announced his retirement from politics.

But  we  went  on with the by-elections and  put  the

issues  fairly  before the people. We  won  that  by-election by a decisive majority against both



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2634</b></font><br><br>



the Liberal-Socialist and an Independent, one Mr  C.

H. Koh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But several issues arose out of the by-elections in

Tanjong  Pagar and Cairnhill. This group  opposed  my

Party's  stand  on Merdeka through  merger  with  the

Federation.  They  wanted immediate independence  for

Singapore  alone. In Cairnhill, this group  organised

support  for  Mr  Goh  Kong  Beng,  the  Independent

candidate, who was to have formed a Party with Mr C.

H.  Koh,  who  was contesting against us  in  Tanjong

Pagar.  We issued a directive to all branches of  the

P.A.P. not to interfere in the Cairnhill by-election

by   supporting   any  candidate  but   this   group,

principally non-P.A..P. members, went on. The  result

was  the  victory of the Liberal-Socialist candidate;

the  result  was our new Member for Cairnhill.  Those

are the hard facts of life and we had better know how

things came to be what they came to be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say we who have stood by the principles and

objectives  of  our Party cannot be  responsible  for

those  who have sought to undermine the authority  of

the  Party,  harnessing it towards  ends  unconnected

with  the aims and spirit of the Party. We know  that

they  are  a dissident faction but on this  we  stand

firm:  that  their  rights  under  the  law  must  be

respected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Labour Front today spend some

time to show what they were doing for the cause of an

independent, democratic Malaya. Let me tell them that

a purely negative approach cannot succeed. If you are

unable to make democratic socialism a living reality,

if  it  remains only an empty slogan, it is  unlikely

ever  to  enthral the hearts and minds of the people.

To  be  able to make it work one must be prepared  to

work and to organise. That is what we have been doing

in the P.A.P. and we are not ashamed of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to remind the Labour Front Government

that  democracy  and  political stability  cannot  be

brought  about  just  by  periodic  mass  arrests.  A

government which relies only on purges



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2635</b></font><br><br>



and  has no positive programme with which to win over

the  people  to  the democratic cause  is  doomed  to

failure.  People  will  not  support  democracy  just

because  a  government is content  to  mouth  slogans

about  the  superiority  and desirability  of  it.  A

Socialist  government which can convince  the  people

that  under its rule things are getting better,  will

get even better, will be in a position, should be  in

a  position, to bring the masses round to their point

of view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the activities of my Party have been

challenged  in  the  White  Paper,  particularly   in

paragraph  30 which has been raised by the  Hon. the

Minister  for  Education, I think it is dishonest  of

the  Government not to disclose at the same time that

we  castigated those who, against our policy, decided

to  make  use of that occasion to humiliate the  hon.

Member  for  Whampoa. If our policy had  been  wrong,

then  I  say  we  deserve to be castigated.  But  our

policy  has been consistently correct. For the Labour

Front Government to try openly to implicate the whole

Party in all the zigzags of tactics for which we were

not responsible is, in my opinion, downright unworthy

tactics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Labour Front Government is as well informed

as a government should be, as it has claimed to be in

this  White  Paper,  then  why  has  there  been   no

presentation of the whole truth; why just parts of  a

whole? Why has there been no denial this morning that

on  the  night of the 22nd at the time the  raid  was

made  on the Middle Road premises there was a meeting

going on to finalise arrangements to join the T.U.C.?

Or  was the Hon. the Chief Minister not aware of  it?

Does the Minister for Education deny that he did know

how Mr Keng Ban Ee was defeated in Cairnhill? Can he

deny that that did not come into the calculations  of

the  Government's final decision of  what  to  do  in

regard  to  this situation? Why was that  denial  not

made  this  morning?  Why was the  onus  put  on  the

P.A.P.?  The whole of the White Paper is designed  to

discredit us. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2636</b></font><br><br>



whole of this attack this morning is - designed to  say

that 'we have weakened,' that 'we are afraid'. Let me

tell  the Hon. the Chief Minister this: but  for  the

facts we have recited we would have no hesitation  in

attacking  the  Government.  We  take  our  stand  on

principle  because  of what happened  in  the  London

constitutional  talks, because of  what  happened  in

this  Assembly,  because of  the  Tanjong  Pagar  by-elections. That is the reason for our stand  on  this

White Paper.

against the Malayan currency for payments due to them

banking  channels, and, since  China  is  not  a

scheduled  territory, require  the  approval  of

the Controller of Foreign Exchange. Payments  to
