   <b>SINGAPORE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS AND JURONG BIRD PARK</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Special discounts on admission charges for 3-tier families)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To ask the Minister for Finance, in view of the Government's promotion of family values and 3-tier families, whether he will consider giving special discounts on admission charges to the Singapore Zoological Gardens and the Jurong Bird Park to 3-tier families visiting these public attractions.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San GRC):</b> Question No. 1, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for Finance (RAdm Teo Chee Hean) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, both the Jurong Bird Park and the Singapore Zoological Gardens recognise the role that they can play in promoting family values. They have admission packages that encourage visitors to the Bird Park or the Zoo to come as families. For example, the Bird Park has a family package which gives free admission for up to three children for every two paying adults visiting the Bird Park. Both organisations also have subscription schemes, namely, the Friends of the Zoo and Friends of the Birds, which allow subscribers to make an unlimited number of visits to these establishments during the year. The subscriber can bring a family of two adults and three children for each visit. The subscription rate is $60 a year for the Zoo and $50 a year for the Bird Park.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to inform the Member that these organisations have recently introduced special admission packages for three-tier families.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandparents of subscribers of the Friends of the Zoo scheme are now allowed to take the place of any of the five family members for their admission to the Zoo under the scheme. However, if there are already five members in the visiting family, the grandparent will be allowed a 50% discount on the admission charge. This 50% discount will also be granted to accompanying grandparents of any three-tier family visiting the Zoo.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jurong Bird Park has also extended its Friends of the Birds scheme to cover three-tier families. For a subscription rate of $60 a year, a three-tier family comprising two grandparents, two parents and three children is allowed unlimited admission to the Bird Park during the year. In addition, the Jurong Bird Park has introduced a special three-tier family admission package. Under the package, a three-tier family, comprising two grandparents, two adults and three children, need only pay a total of $25 for admission into the Bird Park. This is a 37% discount from the normal rate of $39.60.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Can I ask the Minister how much are the Zoo and the Bird Park charging an adult and a child nowadays?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the Bird Park and the Zoo, the charges are reasonable. I do not have the numbers directly in front of me here, but for four adults and three children, the total amount is $39.60 for the Bird Park.

   <b>MODIFIED STREAMING SYSTEM</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Fine-tuning)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Mr Lew Syn Pau</b> asked the Minister for Education whether there is a need to fine-tune the modified streaming system after three years of experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Education (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the first streaming exercise under the modified streaming system was carried out at the end of 1991. Pupils joined one of three streams (EM1, EM2 or EM3) at Primary 5 in 1992. These pupils sat the modified Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) last year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present provision, pupils in all three streams follow the same syllabuses and take common PSLE papers in English language and mathematics. In practice, however, EM3 pupils, being the weakest, can only cope with the more basic aspects of the curriculum and answer the easier questions of the examination papers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has reviewed the system. It is of the view that some fine-tuning of the curriculum and examination in English language and mathematics for the EM3 stream is needed to better suit the abilities of the pupils.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is modifying the syllabuses and writing separate textbooks and workbooks in these two subjects for pupils in the EM3 stream. Consequently, EM3 pupils will sit for separate papers, to be called Foundation English and Foundation Mathematics, at the PSLE.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From next year (1995), EM3 pupils in Primary 5 will use the modified syllabuses. These pupils will sit for Foundation English and Foundation Mathematics, in addition to basic mother
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> tongue, in the PSLE in 1996. A new grading system (grades 1, 2, 3 and 4) will be adopted for the three subjects taken by EM3 pupils. Those who meet the requisite standards will proceed to secondary schools either in the Normal (Academic) or Normal (Technical) course.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fine-tuning will better serve the needs of less able pupils in the EM3 stream in Primary 5 and 6. It will enable teachers to focus on the teaching of core content areas and prepare the pupils for the Normal course, in particular the Normal (Technical) course, in secondary school.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Tanglin):</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister, under the modified streaming system, how would the late developers at the PSLE examination be given an opportunity to move back into the main stream since the examination and gradings are now different and not quite comparable to the examination which the other PSLE students take. How would they be compared with the normal examination grades?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a fine-tuning. Under the present system, the weaker pupils in EM3 are supposed to follow the same syllabus and take the same examination papers. But, in practice, because they are slower, they are only able to cope with the more basic elements. So the purpose of this change is to focus the teaching and learning on areas where they are able to cope. But at the Primary 4 streaming, parents will still have the option of putting the pupils in the stream that they want. However, in Primary 6, if the pupils are unable to perform, they will have to go back to the EM3 stream. Subsequently, when they move on to secondary school, there will still be possibilities for them to cross streams, depending on their abilities. For example, some of the EM3 pupils do very well and they are allowed to go on to the Normal (Academic) stream. There will be remedial lessons for the weaker pupils.

   <b>(Reduction in administrative workload)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lau Ping Sum -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Mr Lau Ping Sum</b> asked the Minister for Education what steps will be taken to reduce the administrative workload of teachers, such as that of computer data entry.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Aline K. Wong (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Aline K. Wong) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Sir, my Ministry recognises the need to alleviate the administrative workload of teachers so that they can devote their time to teaching duties.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever possible, the Ministry has introduced computerisation and office automation in schools. While computerisation may have resulted in data-entry work for some teachers, the overall benefits gained from computerisation outweigh the efforts required. For example, in using the computer to process examination results, the system automates calculations of marks, printing of results, analysis and generation of tables to provide up-to-date information on individual pupil's academic performance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has also provided labour-saving equipment to schools, such as scan-printers, and as I said, computers, and better quality photocopiers. It is also studying other possibilities. Two machines currently being evaluated are the stapling-collating machines and the optical mark readers which have been provided to 14 junior colleges and 10 primary schools respectively. The optical mark readers can be used to automate the marking of examination scripts as well as the capturing of data for computer processing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has also allocated $5,000 per year to each primary school and junior college and allowed secondary schools to tap part of their Edusave grants (up to 20%) for the purchase of administrative support and ancillary services. The Ministry is working with the Singapore Teachers' Union to help schools source for such services. However, the basic problem is the shortage of manpower in Singapore.

  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether he will consider allowing the expressway speed limit for light goods vehicles such as vans and pick-ups to be increased from 50 km/h to 70 km/h.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, the Public Works Department, together with the Registry of Vehicles and the Traffic Police, regularly reviews the speed limits of the various categories of vehicles on our roads. They have found no reason to change these limits.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present 50 km per hour speed limit for light goods vehicles is imposed for safety reasons. Light goods vehicles are heavier and usually longer than ordinary class 3 vehicles. Given their weight and size, the potential damage and danger caused by these vehicles in the event of an accident would be greater. They would also require a longer distance to stop. Both for the safety of the drivers as well as other roadusers, it is necessary to impose a lower speed limit on such vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be cautious about increasing the speed limit for such vehicles. Research in the United States has shown that increasing the speed limit on the expressways would lead to more road casualties.

  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for Health if he will report on the progress of the Medifund scheme and the profiles of the people who have been assisted under the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Health (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Sir, in the first year of operation, 18,536 applications for assistaance from Medifund were received. 99.6% or 18,454 of the applications were approved. 5,371 of the approved applications were from subsidised inpatients. This made up about 3.3% of all Class B2/C
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> inpatients. The remaining 13,000-plus of the approved applications were from subsidised outpatients. This constitutes about 1.2% of all subsidised attendances.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total amount of Medifund approved was $4.8 million. $3.92 million or 82% of the total Medifund approved was used to help subsidised inpatients. The remaining $0.84 million was for subsidised outpatients. The average amount of Medifund help per application was $730 for a subsidised inpatient and $65 for a subsidised outpatient.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those who were assisted by Medifund, 83% were patients with low income and who have been regular contributors to Medisave and were covered by MediShield. 14.5% were patients who were born in or before 1940 for whom Medisave was introduced too late.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar GRC):</b> Sir, is there a review of those who have been turned down to see whether they are really in a pressing need and whether their cases have been considered?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, as I mentioned earlier, only 0.4% of applications were turned down. The numbers are very few and if these are deserving cases, we will surely review them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether there is a good system in place to identify and assist people who are in need of support in the restructured hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Every restructured hospital has its own Medifund committee. We have decentralised it so that the processing of applications is done at a level which is very close to those who are in need of such funds. I am satisfied that we have got good working systems and sufficient safeguards.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, would the Minister give the rationale for Medifund giving less preference to a housewife whose husband contributes irregularly to Medisave compared to another housewife whose
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> husband is a regular contributor to Medisave? This was said by the former Minister for Health in Parliament in May 1993.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, I am not familiar with this particular detail of Medifund. The broad guidelines have already been given to the public as to the constraints within which hospital Medifund committees should operate. If the Nominated Member of Parliament were to submit a Question on this particular case, I would be very happy to answer.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, would the Minister publish the detailed guidelines or criteria for Medifund eligibility? What are the bases for allocations and approval of applications?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, early last year, the Health Ministry issued a press statement on the guidelines for Medifund eligibility. We have deliberately given the powers to approve specific cases down to the hospitals so that at their level they can make judgments as to whether particular individuals are deserving. I think it is better to do it at that level than to have detailed conditions prescribed at the level of the Health Ministry. It has worked well. Most applications are approved. I do not see a reason for a review of the present system of approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, does the Minister agree that by publishing the details, at least the public can assess an application which was rejected, whether the judgment of the specific case was really fair and based on a set of guidelines, rather than based on the judgment of the committee?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we ought not to be too theoretical about this. As I mentioned earlier, only 0.4% of cases get turned down. If any Member of Parliament or any member of the public were to write to me about why those very few cases which were rejected ought to be reconsidered, I will certainly reconsider them at the Health Ministry level.

  <!-- Mr Lau Ping Sum -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.
  <b>Mr Lau Ping Sum</b> asked the Minister for Health whether a uniform pricing will be adopted for the sale of cyclosporin to all kidney transplant patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, only patients who had their kidney transplants done in the restructured hospitals and who are followed up as subsidised patients are subsidised for the cyclosporin prescribed to them to reduce the risk of organ rejection. Private patients who had their transplants done in the restructured hospitals as well as private hospitals are not eligible for the subsidy on cyclosporin.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all other medical services, the subsidy on cyclosporin is extended only to subsidised patients. There is no reason to extend the same subsidy to private patients who can afford to pay for the full cost of the kidney transplant either locally or overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> Sir, my question is: why is there a distinction in Government policy in not subsidising people who have gone overseas for kidney transplants? It could be a case of hardship. Or they could have borrowed money and went for operation overseas and they came back. Why is there a distinction of not granting them subsidised cyclosporin?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, as I said earlier, if you are a private patient, whether in Singapore or overseas, then it is difficult for the Health Ministry to subsidise such patients. There is also a further reason why we do not encourage Singaporean patients to go overseas for kidney transplants. It is because there is a high risk involved. It is a known risk. For some of them, the operation goes bad. Some have died as a result. There is also HIV risk. And in many cases, we do not even know what are the sources of these kidneys. For this reason, it is not Government policy to encourage Singaporeans to go overseas to get kidney transplants done.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lau Ping Sum -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lau Ping Sum (Ang Mo Kio GRC):</b> Sir, would the Minister agree that in some
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> cases, the waiting period for transplants for dialysis patients is so long that they have very little choice but to go overseas? And in some cases, they have exhausted their savings in getting the overseas transplants. Would the Minister consider their application for subsidy more favourably?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> We have considered whether or not we should encourage Singaporean patients who are still waiting for kidney transplants to go overseas. But, on balance, we decided at the Health Ministry level that it is unwise to encourage Singaporeans to go overseas for such transplants, for reasons I have stated earlier. As for patients who could afford to go for overseas transplants and who come back and for reasons of life's fortunes are suddenly unable to pay for the unsubsidised cyclosporin, then they can always appeal for Medifund assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister what is the number of persons on the waiting list for subsidised kidney transplants?

  <br>
  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, I do not have the number here. But if the Member were to table a Question, I will surely answer him.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, may I presume that there is more than one person waiting, which means that not all people with kidney problems who want a transplant can get a transplant at subsidised levels. This means that some of them are forced to go to non-subsidised places. In such cases, may I ask the Minister to reconsider the policy of subsidy on cyclosporin?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, I think all over the world, in every country and in every society, there is a shortage in the supply of kidneys which are needed by renal patients. If we encourage Singaporeans to go overseas, say, to India or China or other countries, to get those kidneys, then obviously those kidneys are somehow diverted from their own societies to be given to Singaporeans. One can reasonably ask how such kidneys are obtained in the first place, because no

  <b>The Minister for Labour (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under the Minimum Sum Scheme, a CPF member who owns an HDB flat is allowed to pledge his flat in lieu of setting aside the Minimum Sum in cash. The maximum amount that the member can pledge is the value of the flat less any HDB outstanding loan at the time of the pledge. Should the CPF member subsequently take out a bank loan, the CPF Board will lodge a charge on the property to secure the Minimum Sum. In the event of a sale, the proceeds will first be used to pay HDB and the CPF Board before paying the bank, as the CPF charge ranks before the bank's charge.

Many employers, including employers of foreign domestic workers, depend on employment agencies to undertake the recruitment of foreign workers on their behalf. The licensing of employment agencies is to ensure that persons who provide such service understand and comply with the terms and conditions for the entry of foreigners to work in Singapore under the Work Permit Scheme. Licensing employment agencies
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> is also a means of ensuring that agencies do not conduct their business in a manner likely to be detrimental to their clients, who may include Singaporeans seeking job placement assistance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a person wishing to operate an employment agency in Singapore can apply to my Ministry. In assessing the application, we will consider the applicant's educational background and other criteria. Prospective employment agents should have a minimum education of five "O" levels, or suitable working experience in recruitment and placement work. They should be the registered proprietor or partner, as well as the manager of the employment agency if it is a firm, or a shareholder and director if it is an incorporated company. They must also undertake to work full-time in the proposed agency. In addition, the proposed employment agency must be located in commercial premises. Successful applicants are required to furnish a security bond of $20,000 to ensure that they comply with the Employment Agencies Act, rules, and licence conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, firstly, does this mean that those with higher education are considered less likely to be detrimental to their clients than those with lower educational status? Has the Minister not heard of the saying that a smarter crooked person making a smarter crook?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, does this mean that education is now so important that those less educated but with an entrepreneurial bent are denied of an opportunity of venturing into this business? In addition to this, what about those who are late developers, with 10 to 20 years of working experience, although they may not directly be relevant? Also, may I know what other businesses the Government now wishes to control in this manner, ie, based on education?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, may I also ask the Minister why a person without the necessary educational qualifications, but with adequate capital and can employ others with the appropriate educational qualifications in its management team, should be denied
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> a licence? Does this not imply that, based solely on educational status, such a person is considered to be more likely to be detrimental to their clients' interest? Surely those with lesser educational status should reject such an implication.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, the requirement to have a basic educational qualification in order to qualify for an employment agency licence is simply to ensure that those who want to operate the business of employment agencies are able to fully understand the requirements under the Employment of Foreign Workers Act, the Employment Agencies Act and the various regulations governing the operation of such employment agencies. It is not so much a measure of who is more responsible: whether the man with five "O" levels will be more responsible than a man with less than five "O" levels? It is to ensure that, having given this man a licence to conduct a certain business, we should be reassured that the man is able to understand all that is required for him to conduct this business by way of regulations which do change from time to time. The conditions that are required before he can bring in foreign workers from Singapore change from time to time and we do send out notifications to various employers. So the requirement of five "O" levels is in no way an onerous requirement considering that the vast majority of Singaporeans today, and particularly the young Singaporeans, would have this requirement. Furthermore, there is also, as I said in my main answer, a provision to cater for those who lack the educational qualification. If they have the actual working experience in recruitment and placement work, we will consider this experience in support of their application for the employment agency licence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is education more important than the entrepreneurial spirit or ability of the applicant? That is not for us to judge. What we are concerned with is that, having given the licence to the man, we are assured that the man is able to understand the terms and conditions that we attach to the licence and will operate the business in such a way as not to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> contravene the terms and conditions of the licence and will look after the interest of his clients, both the foreign workers and Singaporeans, who are seeking his service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can a man who lacks the educational qualification apply for the licence and then employ others who will do the job for him? Many employment agencies are sole proprietor-type of business. We want to hold somebody responsible. From time to time, we have so many complaints about an employment agency not fulfilling its duties and responsibilities to its customers. There are constant conflicts between customers and employment agencies. So we want to ensure that the man to whom we give the licence, the man who puts the $20,000 security bond with us, is the man in full control of the business. Only then can we in fact forfeit the bond. That he is the man we have given the licence to, he is in control of the business, and he runs the business. If something goes wrong, and if he is found to have cheated a client, we forfeit the bond. But if the licence is given to Mr Tan who employs a Mr Ng who meets the educational qualification, then he may well argue that the mistake was made by Mr Ng and we should not forfeit his bond. So I think in that sense we will enter into a very complicated argument with the licensee. We have decided that all licensees should be directly in charge of the business. You run the business and we give you the licence. If you meet our criteria we give you the licence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of whether Government is going to license other businesses or not is irrelevant to this discussion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, based on what the Minister said about the regulations and the complaints, may I ask whether he considers those with lesser educational qualifications less responsible, in the sense that they cannot take responsibility for their businesses?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of responsibility, may I also ask whether the Prime Minister, though first among equals in the Cabinet, is also responsible for the whole Government regardless of what his other
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Ministers or Ministries may do, although he may not actually be doing the work himself?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, may I ask, with such regulations, would a man such as the late Goh Tjoei Kok be able to start a bank called the Tat Lee Bank, because he had only a few years of Hokkien education in Fujian before coming to Singapore?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, let us not deviate from the discussion at hand, ie, whether we should license employment agents, ie, people who want to get into the business of offering job placement service or assistance to Singaporeans who need to recruit foreign workers. The question is whether setting a minimum educational criterion is relevant. As I have explained, it is relevant in the sense that many of these employment agents have to operate their business to meet the requirements of the customers and they have to understand the legal framework under which they operate, and the legal framework is not something that is fixed permanently. It does change from time to time. Regulations do change from time to time. Procedures for applications do change from time to time. We are even moving into the area of computerised applications. So the people who want to run this business on a personal basis as a licensee have to have the ability to make these changes. It is only fair that we set a minimum educational criterion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think this requirement, let me reiterate, is an onerous requirement. Many people who apply for these licences do in fact meet the educational criterion. In fact, there is no difficulty with those who want to set up such a business. There are many people who meet the criteria by way of education and actual working experiences. If, in fact, the Member thinks that he has a specific case and he wants to argue the case, my Ministry is prepared to meet with him to discuss the specific case that he has in mind. If that person can show us that although he cannot meet our educational criterion, he has the relevant working experience, we will be more than happy to accommodate him, as I have said earlier on in my answer.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, with your indulgence, one last question. I will take up the Minister's offer. But I would like the Minister to say whether he agrees that such a policy actually condemns a person without the necessary educational qualification, without even giving the person a chance to show whether he can do the job or not.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I do not use such strong words as to condemn people. I think it is the Member himself who tries to condemn others. But let me say once again that we are not passing such a judgment on the ability of those who have no five "O" levels. All we are saying is that if you do not have the educational qualification, show us that you have the working experience. If you do not have that, then maybe somebody else is more suitable for running this particular business. I do not see that as being an onerous requirement. We have to safeguard the interest of Singaporeans who are seeking such service. We have to safeguard the interest of foreigners who are depending on these employment agents to place them with suitable employers. Employment agents are also in discussion with foreign government authorities. If the Member had been reading the Straits Times, he would have known that in the last few days the Singapore employment agents have been in discussion with the Philippine Government authorities to negotiate certain terms and conditions for bringing in foreign domestic workers from the Philippines. If a person is not able to conduct such negotiations, I think he is not going to serve the customer well.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen (Nee Soon Central):</b> Sir, can the Minister tell this House, up to date, how many licences have been issued to these employment agencies?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I do not have the exact number of how many employment agents there are in Singapore, but I think the numbers are quite large. What I do know is that in the last three years, of those who applied, at least a third of them have got their applications approved.

  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for Communications whether he will consider granting exemption from Certificates of Entitlement for vehicles used by voluntary welfare organisations which are providing direct welfare services.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government recognises the vital role played by voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) in helping the less fortunate members of our society, like the disabled, and the elderly sick.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, some VWOs are exempted from paying registration fee and Additional Registration Fee for their vehicles. However, they still need to bid for Certificates of Entitlement (COEs). In view of appeals from Members of Parliament and VWOs themselves, and in recognition of the social service that they provide, my Ministry has reviewed the scheme in consultation with the Ministry of Community Development and has decided to exempt the VWOs' vehicles from COEs as well.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only those vehicles which are directly involved in the provision of welfare services will qualify for this exemption. VWOs applying for vehicle tax and COE exemptions can submit their applications to the National Council of Social Service or to the Ministry of Community Development.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar GRC):</b> Could I ask the Minister whether he will also be extending the COE exemption to severely disabled persons who are recommended and supported by the voluntary welfare organisations themselves?
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font>

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, can the scheme be a bit more relaxed in the sense that those who are recommended by the voluntary welfare organisations themselves will get the assistance required?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I believe the scheme is already very generous in the sense that the criteria are rather generous ones, and any person who fulfils the criteria with, of course, the strong recommendation from the VWOs themselves will be entitled to these exemptions.

   <b>HAZE PROBLEM</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Dr John Chen Seow Phun -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. To ask the Minister for the Environment if he will give an update on the haze problem and how it will be dealt with in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Question No. 11, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the current haze problem is caused by smoke from massive forest fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan. Most of the time, the effect on our air quality has been moderate. In other words, the Pollutants Standard Index (PSI) readings have been between 50 and 100, which is considered acceptable.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our air quality deteriorated to PSI levels of between 100 and 200 on several days. This level is considered "unhealthful". It is a term which is coined by the experts who have set up the PSI index as being "unhealthful" as opposed to "unhealthy". Medical experts advise that normal activities can continue at this level of air quality although persons with heart and respiratory ailments need to observe some precautions such as reducing physical exertion and outdoor activity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case the PSI levels deteriorate further beyond the 200 level and go into a hazardous level, a Haze Task Force was set up to coordinate measures to help the public cope with such an eventuality. So far, there has been no indication that this situation will develop.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The haze situation has improved. We can expect the haze conditions to vary, thinning on some days and returning on other days until the onset of the north-east monsoon which comes normally in early November. The north-east monsoon will blow the haze away from Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans to control future occurrences of haze were discussed between Singapore and Indonesia in the last few weeks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia has identified the causes of the haze and has mapped out a series of preventive measures that they will take. The focus will be on implementing measures to prevent future forest fires in Kalimantan and Sumatra. The scale and nature of their forests is such that these fires, if they are allowed to start, will spread quickly, especially during the dry season, and will be very difficult to put out.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian Authority for Pollution Control (BAPEDAL) has been tasked with the prevention and control of forest fires and will coordinate implementation of control measures through the various agencies, including the Indonesian Ministries of Agriculture, Forestry and Transmigration.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will work with Indonesia by providing information from weather satellites on the location of forest fires. Such
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> information will be useful in early detection of fires and in the deployment of resources to fight the fires and prevent their spread.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of the forest fires is both complex and massive. While it is not possible to totally prevent forest fires in the short term, the measures described above, when implemented on a sustained basis, will help to minimise forest fires and their impact.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will cooperate closely with Indonesia on the haze as well as other environmental issues of common concern. In this regard, I will be meeting the Indonesian Minister for the Environment annually to review progress on these issues. The next meeting will be held in Indonesia early next year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the multilateral level, the ASEAN Ministers for the Environment had, at a recent meeting in Kuching, agreed on setting up a Regional Early Warning and Response System to enhance capabilities of member countries to cope with forest fires and the haze that is caused by such fires.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, does the Minister feel confident that Singapore has all the advanced equipment to detect pollution from forest fires, for example, the laser sensor photo technology-type of equipment?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> The equipment that the Member mentioned is currently available. But the Meteorological Service is currently sourcing for additional equipment which will enhance their capability to have a clearer idea of the specific location of the fires.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, what I would like to ask the Minister is not the location of fires but the detection of pollution in Singapore. Are we confident that we have the latest equipment to detect early pollution?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Yes, the answer is that we have equipment now located in various places around Singapore to detect pollution in our air. The air quality index, or the Pollutants Standard Index that I mentioned earlier, is a result of such
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> monitoring equipment. It monitors not only the particulates in the air which are the current cause of the haze but also other pollutants in the air, including sulphur dioxide, NOX emission, etc. So the PSI is actually a conglomerate of all these various other pollutants that are sensed by the equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the Minister said that stopping the forest fire is a complex problem in Sumatra and Kalimantan. Does it mean that the Minister does not know whether the forest fires were started accidentally, or otherwise?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I did not say that at all, Sir. I simply said that the forest fires are a complex issue. Whether they were started accidentally or not is a separate matter entirely. But having said that, I can tell the House that the Indonesian authorities have informed us about the various causes of the fire, including fires caused by land clearance, the practice of shifting cultivation, the so-called slash and burn method of cultivation, as well as by spontaneous ignition of coal and peat fields in those areas, and these are fires which have been smouldering for years in some cases. It is a combination, or a confluence, of all these various causes that have created the current haze problem plus the fact that the wind directions have resulted in a concentration of the haze in this area. But it is a complex issue and I do not wish to give a wrong impression that the fires can be prevented in the short term. And this is the reason why I caution Singaporeans not to expect that there will be a reprieve in the short term.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I say that it is complex? Based on the figures that the Indonesians have given us, some of the fires are burning over an area as large as 500,000 hectares of land. That is a lot of forest. As a matter of comparison, it is roughly about eight to 10 times the size of Singapore and this is why we have asked for further information and whether we could be allowed to give assistance in satellite photography and other means to help them to detect the fires.

  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister the extent of assistance which the Government will provide the Indonesian Government to tackle the problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, in so far as actual putting out of the fire is concerned, there is very little that we can do. We did agree that the best solution is to prevent the fire from starting in the first place. And it is in this area that Singapore feels that it can make a meaningful contribution, ie, in the area of providing information, in the area of setting up, together with our ASEAN partners, an early warning system and we will contribute our expertise in the meteorological services, in the satellite information technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, would the Minister consider financial assistance? Would that be accepted? Or does he think it is not a wise thing to offer financial assistance?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, it is not a question of money. If the measures to prevent the fires can be successful, I do not see any reason why not, and if they are implemented on a sustained basis, then the question of money does not come in at all.

  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.
  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Acting Minister for National Development whether he will consider implementing a scheme with varying income eligibility levels for applicants who wish to purchase Housing and Development Board flats, so that applicants with higher income ceilings can be eligible to purchase the non-subsidised HDB flats such as the 5-room and executive flats, and applicants with lower income ceilings can be eligible to purchase 3-room and 4-room flats which are subsidised.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Acting Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me first clarify that the HDB 5-room and Executive flats are subsidised. They are priced lower than market price. Most of them are, in fact, priced below total development cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has varying income eligibility levels for applicants who apply for different types of HDB flats. Under the Buy-Back of 3-Room Flats scheme, through which HDB buys back 3-room flats from the open market for subsidised resale to the lower-income group, only first-time applicants with household incomes not exceeding $1,000 are eligible for such flats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go further than this, and set varying income ceilings for different flat-types, as the hon. Member has proposed, would impair the current flexibility of the allocation system. This would deprive applicants for new flats of the choice they now have to select a flat that best meets their needs and affordability, within the overall income ceilings of $7,000 for a nuclear family and $11,000 for an extended family.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Thomson GRC):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether he is aware that, because of rising property prices, there is now an increasing pool of young professionals in the so-called "sandwich" class who cannot afford to buy private housing and, at the same time, are not allowed to buy HDB flats? Would the Minister not consider that it is fair to review the income ceiling levels so that those with higher incomes can be allowed to purchase the more expensive flats, like the Executive and 5-room flats, and those with lower incomes can be allowed to buy the smaller flats which are highly subsidised?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under the 1993 labour survey, 92% of Singapore households qualified under the existing rules. The income ceilings were last reviewed on 1st December 1992. We will review it again on 1st December 1994.

   <b>INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>1.37 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Law, in its Addendum to the President's Address at the opening of Parliament earlier this year, stated that the Ministry and the Attorney-General's Chambers would review our legislation to ensure adequate legal support for Singapore's regionalisation drive. In this regard, we stated that the adoption of international conventions and model laws which harmonise and facilitate international trade and dispute settlements would be considered.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will provide a legal framework to resolve international commercial disputes by arbitration and is part of this review.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will mainly implement the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration on an "opt-out" basis. This Model Law establishes a framework for the conduct of international commercial arbitrations, regulating such matters as:
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the composition and jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) conduct of the arbitral proceedings; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the making and setting aside of the award.
  <br>
  <br>It is crafted in such a way as to be acceptable to lawyers from both of the world's major legal systems, ie, the common law and civil law systems.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Model Law accords full liberty to parties in non-domestic arbitrations to choose laws and arbitrators to resolve their disputes with minimal intervention from domestic courts. Domestic arbitrations will continue to be governed by the existing Arbitration Act (Cap. 10) where a greater degree of judicial supervision is imposed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Model Law's adoption by the UN General Assembly in 1985, it has gained widespread acceptance. Many countries including Australia, Bermuda, Canada, Cyprus, Egypt, Hong Kong, Mexico and the USA have adopted it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1985 Economic Committee recommended that to develop into a centre for legal services, we should speed up the settlement of commercial disputes and set up an international commercial arbitration centre.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) commenced operations in 1991. This Bill will facilitate the settlement of commercial disputes in Singapore. As Singapore businessmen expand overseas, there will be greater contacts with foreign parties. Currently, foreign businessmen are uncomfortable with unfamiliar arbitration laws and excessive intervention from local courts if they select Singapore as the venue for arbitration. They will therefore welcome the application of the Model Law in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, international arbitration is a highly competitive business. Businessmen are able to choose from a variety of attractive international centres including Hong Kong, Hawaii, Kuala Lumpur, Melbourne and Vancouver. Currently, a glaring
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> disadvantage of the SIAC is the non-applicability of the Model Law in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Law Reform Commissions and Legislatures of Commonwealth countries which have adopted the Model Law have stated that the Law would assist the development of their respective international arbitration centres.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hong Kong experience suggests that the adoption of the Model Law will sharpen the competitive edge of the SIAC. Since 1990, when the Model Law was introduced in Hong Kong, a significantly higher number of cases have been referred to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre. From the initial nine cases in 1985, this number increased incrementally from 20 in 1986 to 45 in 1989. Thereafter, the number of cases increased significantly from 54 in 1990, ie, when the Model Law was introduced, to 185 in 1992.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provisions of the Model Law are explained in detail in the Explanatory Statement. Let me briefly take the House through the main parts of the Bill. Part II will give the Model Law, except for Chapter VIII, the force of law in Singapore. The Model Law is reproduced in the First Schedule. Part II also contains the modifications and clarifications we have made to clarify and improve the Model Law. This was done after studying the experiences of other countries and consulting the UNCITRAL Secretariat.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this approach is to let foreign businessmen and lawyers know at the outset the changes that have been made to the Model Law. This will facilitate their choice of Singapore as a venue for their cases.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from implementing the Model Law, Part II will introduce additional provisions which will facilitate arbitrations. These provide for the confidentiality of court proceedings arising from arbitrations, conciliation proceedings prior to arbitration, immunity of arbitrators for negligence and mistakes, invoking the assistance of the courts in enforcing interim orders or directions, allowing the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> arbitrators to adopt "inquisitorial processes" in the Civil Law tradition, awarding of interest and taxation of arbitration costs by the Registrar of the SIAC.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also consolidate all provisions on international arbitrations in a single Act by re-enacting substantially unchanged the Arbitration (Foreign Awards) Act (Cap. 10A) in Part III. The Arbitration (Foreign Awards) Act presently gives effect to the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 1958. This Convention which is set out in the Second Schedule allows arbitral awards made in one Convention country to be recognised and enforced in any of the other Convention countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was wide consultation in drafting this Bill. It was first prepared by a sub-committee of the Singapore Academy of Law Law Reform Committee comprising lawyers, some of whom are practising arbitrators from the private practice, the Law Faculty, the SIAC, foreign international law firms and the AG's Chambers. The Bill was then considered and adopted with amendments by the Academy's main Law Reform Committee. Both the SIAC and the Singapore Institute of Arbitrators support the implementation of the Model Law.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the reasons why Singapore should adopt the Model Law are as follows:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Model Law provides a sound and internationally accepted framework for international commercial arbitrations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the general approach of the Model Law will appeal to international businessmen and lawyers, especially those from Continental Europe, China, Indonesia, Japan and Vietnam who may be unfamiliar with English concepts of arbitration. This will work to Singapore's advantage as our businessmen expand overseas.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it will promote Singapore's role as a growing centre for international legal services and international arbitrations.
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Bedok GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that the Bill is a welcomed boost to the development of Singapore as an international centre for legal services.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Model Law has proven to be a practical and useful tool in jurisdictions which have adopted it. I share the view that its enactment will enhance the role of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC). Sir, we have been told that the Model Law is already operative in countries which compete with Singapore for international arbitration work. It is therefore timely that we give the SIAC this additional boost.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this Bill, business people overseas will not worry about encountering an unfamiliar element if they select Singapore as the place of arbitration. Foreign counterparts of Singapore investors, who are unfamiliar with the English law, on which the existing Arbitration Act is based, will find the Model Law more accessible. As I understand it, the Model Law is drafted in the six official UN languages, namely, Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish. It is also consistent with our drive towards regionalisation, as it will be easier to convince these foreign counterparts to agree to the SIAC as a venue to settle disputes that may arise. In this way, this essential term of a contract can be more easily settled.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision of an effective and mutually acceptable mechanism for settling disputes that may arise is an important element in any business transaction. As we strive to enhance Singapore's attractiveness as a total business centre, the Model Law will fill a gap. The Parliamentary Secretary has alluded to the success of the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre since the Model Law was introduced in 1990. We aim to match that success.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I welcome the Parliamentary Secretary's assurance that the Bill is the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> product of widespread consultation and has received good support from the legal fraternity. In this way, I am sure it will meet the needs of the business and legal community.

   <b>CHARITIES BILL</b>

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for Finance (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Charities Act came into force on 1st January 1983. It is based essentially on the United Kingdom Charities Act 1960. It provides for the registration and administration of charities as well as establishes the office of the Commissioner of Charities and confers upon him a range of powers over charities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner of Charities has accumulated a wealth of experience in the regulation and supervision of charities over the past 12 years. The provisions in the existing Charities Act have at times proven inadequate for the Commissioner to discharge his duties and responsibilities in the areas of registration, preparation of accounts, reports and returns, institution of inquiries, protection of charities and fund raising. For greater effectiveness, the Commissioner will have to be provided with more wide-ranging and better defined powers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before this House seeks to re-enact with amendments the existing Charities Act. It is based on the United Kingdom Charities Act 1992 and 1993, with modifications to suit circumstances in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose is to strengthen the regulatory role of the Commissioner of Charities, improve the system of supervision of charities and control fund raising activities. This will ensure the more effective use of charitable resources and enhance public confidence in the charitable sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to draw the attention of the House to the main clauses in the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends section 5 of the Act to allow the computerisation of the register of charities. The maintenance of the register in a form other than paper is to keep pace with modernisation and the electronic age.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 inserts a new section 7 to empower the Commissioner to give a direction requiring the name of a charity to be changed if it is the same or too similar to the name of another charity, is misleading or offensive, or gives the impression that the charity is connected with the Government when it is not.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Commissioner of Charities can institute inquiries for general or specific purposes. Inquiries can be conducted by the Commissioner himself or a person appointed by him. Clauses 8 and 9 will broaden the scope of his existing powers in sections 7 and 8 of the Act to institute inquiries and to obtain information and documents regarding the activities of charities. These enhanced powers will enable the Commissioner to better identify, investigate and remedy financial and other abuses by charities, including exempt ones.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new Part IV makes fresh provisions relating to the keeping and auditing of charity accounts. Under clauses 12 and 13, charity trustees are required to keep accounting records, prepare annual statements of accounts and preserve them for at least seven years. Clause 14 requires the accounts of a charity whose gross income or total expenditure in any financial year exceeds $250,000 to be audited by an approved company auditor. This improves upon the existing system whereby an external audit is only carried
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> out upon the instructions of the Commissioner during an investigation. The intention is to facilitate the proper accounting of funds and the more timely detection of irregularities. Under clause 16, charity trustees will be required to transmit to the Commissioner annual reports, together with the statement of accounts and auditor's report, within six months of the end of the financial year. Clause 17 requires charities to make their annual reports and other documents available for inspection by interested parties. This will enhance their accountability to their donors, recipients and beneficiaries as well as reassure these persons that the donations are being put to proper use.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new Part V has been introduced. Clause 19 allows certain small charities to transfer their property to other small charities when such transfers promote the more efficient use of charitable resources. Clause 20 eases the administrative burden of certain small charities by lifting the restrictions on the expenditure of capital.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 re-enacts section 11 of the Act which specifies the circumstances under which the doctrine of cy-pres can be applied so that an intention to benefit charity which cannot be literally fulfilled will be effectuated in a manner nearest to that indicated by the benefactor. Clause 22 amends section 12 to simplify the process by which charity property may be applied cy-pres.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 25 enhances the powers of the Commissioner of Charities under section 15 of the Act to act for the protection of a charity administration. The additional powers include restraining debtors of charities from parting with money owed to the charity, as well as appointing additional trustees, a receiver and a manager where the administration has broken down. Clause 27 will disqualify certain persons from acting as charity trustees. This will protect charities from undesirable trustees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new Part VII introduces fresh provisions to deal with fund raising on behalf of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> charities by professional fund raisers and commercial participators. Although the phenomenon of professional fund raisers and commercial participators is currently a rare one in Singapore, it is anticipated that their use by charities to raise funds on their behalf will increase over time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 34 makes it unlawful for professional fund raisers and commercial participators to raise funds or represent that charitable contributions are to be given to or applied for the benefit of a charity unless they do so in accordance with an agreement with the charity satisfying the prescribed requirements. A charity can restrain any contravention by way of an injunction.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 35 requires professional fund raisers and commercial participators to give details of the institutions for whom they are soliciting money or other property.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 36 enables a donor to serve a written notice entitling him to have payment exceeding the prescribed sum refunded to him and certain agreements to pay such sum cancelled. Clause 37 enables a charity to obtain an injunction to prevent unauthorised or objectionable fund raising on its behalf.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 39 makes it an offence for charities and other persons to raise funds without a permit from the Commissioner of Charities, unless they have been exempted from the requirement. The intention of this provision is to protect the interest of donors to various charitable activities. Unlike the provisions dealing with fund raising by professional fund raisers and commercial participators, the specific provisions to regulate fund raising by charities and other persons will be dealt with by way of Regulations to be enacted later.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at present, the intention is only to require a permit for fund raising for foreign charitable purposes. Fund raising for local charitable purposes will be exempted from this requirement. Front-end controls are necessary for fund raising for foreign charitable purposes. Local donors will not be able to check on
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> foreign charities to ensure that their donations are used for the intended purpose. Also, the Commissioner of Charities has no jurisdiction over foreign charities, and will not be able to bring them to task if he discovers subsequently that the donations are not being used for the declared purpose. This is unlike local charities where adequate safeguards will be in place. The Commissioner of Charities can exercise close supervision over, and institute inquiries into the affairs and accounts of, local charities should it be necessary. He can also prosecute them and impose severe penalties for offences committed under the Charities Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 40 concerns judicial review. It clarifies that the Courts cannot substitute their decisions for the Executive's decisions in matters relating to the grant of permits for fund raising activities unless it is on ground of non-compliance with any procedural requirements.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to exercise strict control over fund raising activities for charitable, philanthropic and benevolent purposes because people are much more willing and trusting when it comes to making donations for good causes. The problem is specially acute when it comes to fund raising for foreign charitable purposes. The Commissioner of Charities finds it difficult to verify the antecedents of foreign charities. We have no jurisdiction over their activities. We lack the means to determine whether the funds they raise in Singapore are utilised efficiently and effectively for the purposes they are intended.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect the interests of Singapore donors, the Government intends to restrict the grant of fund raising permits to local charities over which it has full jurisdiction as well as reputable international organisations such as UNICEF and the Red Cross which have well-established track records. Foreign charities without proven antecedents will be denied permits. Clause 40 will ensure that the merits of the decision cannot be reviewed. This is to avoid a situation where interested parties can through the Courts frustrate the Government's decision to reject an application for a fund raising permit.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, heavier penalties have been imposed for existing offences under the Act such as the alteration, suppression or destruction of documents. Penalties have also been introduced for several new offences. These offences include failure to transmit accounts for public inspection by the specified deadline. Both the heavier and new penalties will deter the commission of offences and the repetition of any offence by the same party. Clause 45 gives the Commissioner discretion to compound certain offences under the Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am puzzled by clauses 39 and 40 of this Bill. Clause 39 states that unless approved or granted an exemption by the Government, no one shall participate in or conduct any charitable fund-raising activity, otherwise he shall be liable to be fined not exceeding $10,000 or sentenced to imprisonment for not more than three years, upon conviction. Of course, the Minister of State stated just now that, for the time being, this provision is applicable only to foreign charitable organisations and local charitable organisations are exempted. But why is it that it is not clearly specified in the Bill that this is applicable only to foreign charitable organisations? Under what circumstances will the Government declare that this provision is also applicable to local charitable organisations? If the Government is to invoke the provisions of clause 39 on local charitable organisations, then my question is, first of all, why do we need to have such a broad prohibitive provision? The provisions in this Charities Bill and the Penal Code are already adequate to deal with those who are soliciting for funds on the pretext of charity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if this provision is subsequently made applicable to local charitable organisations, then does it not mean that any registered charitable organisation in Singapore which wants to raise funds will have to obtain the prior approval of the Government before it can do so? Will this not add on more administrative burden for these organisations?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, clause 39 of this Bill does not spell out who can legitimately raise funds for charitable organisations. Does it mean, in future, even the trustees and authorised representatives of these charitable organisations will have to get the approval of the Minister before they can raise funds for charity? If that is the case, does it mean that, in future, anyone who wants to do charitable work in Singapore will also need to have approval of the Government before he can do so?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 40 of this Bill even goes one step further to provide that any decision or action taken by the Government under clause 39 therein, whether it is fair or not, shall not be subjected to judicial review by any court of law. To seek redress from the court when one is subjected to unfair treatment is the fundamental right of every ordinary citizen. This Bill has not only deprived the ordinary citizen of his fundamental right but also enables the power of the Minister to surpass the authority of the court. It looks as though the power of our Minister is paramount and absolute, and even the court has no judicial right to interfere!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have stated, the intention, at present, is to exempt all local charities from the requirement to apply for a licence. So the concern that Mr Low has raised should not inhibit local charities from collecting and raising funds for local charitable purposes. The regulation being put in place is basically aimed at protecting Singapore donors from fund raisers who are raising funds for foreign charities. For local charities, there are sufficient safeguards in place in order to ensure that the local charities apply their funds appropriately. For that reason, local charities are being exempted for the time being. For foreign charities, no such safeguards are in place and the Commissioner of Charities has no powers to investigate them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked why there is a need to disallow judicial review of Ministerial decisions on the grant of a permit for fund raising purposes. The finality clause has been inserted to clarify

  <br>
  <br> that the courts cannot substitute their decisions for the Minister in matters pertaining to the grant of permits to conduct fund-raising activities unless it is on the ground of non-compliance with any procedural requirements. This is to prevent foreign charitable organisations, in particular, from going to court and substituting the finding of the court for the decision of the Government to deny such a purpose.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Can I seek clarification, Sir? If the Minister of State says that the sole intention of clause 39 is to apply only to foreign charities, then why is it not stated clearly in the Bill that it is only applicable to foreign charities and local charities are exempted? That is one clarification. Secondly, I understand from the Minister's speech that there is an intention, probably in the future, for the Government to apply this clause to local charities as well. Would the Minister please answer why it is necessary to have this clause if the Government has no intention to apply it to local charities one day? As regards clause 40, of course I can understand that if it is a foreign charity, it may be a problem in terms of judicial review. But if clause 39 should apply to local charities, then clause 40 would also apply to local charities. The question is: why? It is local charity.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already explained that the present intention is to exempt local charities. So the concern that the Member has raised should not arise. As I have said, the requirement is basically directed at ensuring that foreign charities, without proven antecedents, can be denied permits and that the merits of the decision cannot be reviewed. The purpose is not to limit local charities from carrying out fund raising for local charitable purposes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my question is whether the Government has any intention to apply clause 39 to local charities in future.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have already said twice this afternoon, there is no intention at present to apply clause 39 to local charities. I am unable
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to make an open-ended commitment for the future because it is uncertain what the circumstances may be in the future. But for the present, there is no intention to apply clause 39 to local charities.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a Bill before the House. If there is no intention, and the Minister of State cannot anticipate whether it is going to be applicable to local charities in the future, why not just state for the time being, that it is only intended for foreign charities? Or state in the sub-clause that local charities will be exempted from this clause until such time when the Government feels that there is a reason or need to control local charities for this purpose. Then we amend the Act at the appropriate time. Why have such a blanket provision?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the intention has already been stated very clearly, which is to exempt local charities for conducting fund raising for local charitable purposes from this clause. I am not sure how I can state this intention more clearly than I have done so three times already. But what the Member is asking for is an open-ended commitment for circumstances which may or may not arise in the future, and he is asking for a commitment on such circumstances which I myself may not be able to imagine for the future. There may be charities, for example, some of which operate partially locally, some of which operate partially foreign, and some of their funds may be collected for local purposes, while some may be diverted for foreign purposes, and there can be any mixture of these things.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next Bill in the Orders of the Day on the Order Paper is the Singapore Armed Forces (Amendment No. 2) Bill. There is a considerable overlap in some aspects of these two Bills. May I have your permission to explain the rationale for these overlapping amendments in speaking on the Enlistment (Amendment) Bill.
  <br>

  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Thank you, Sir. The Bill seeks to change the terms "reservist" and "reserve service" in the Enlistment Act, the Singapore Armed Forces Act, the Civil Defence Act and the Income Tax Act. Our "operationally ready national servicemen" formerly known as "reservists" prior to 1st January 1994 form an integral part of the Singapore Armed Forces. They make up 80% of the SAF troops' strength. They are our frontline troops to be mobilised immediately in the event of an external threat. They will fight shoulder-to-shoulder with the full-time national servicemen and regulars in the defence of Singapore. The terms "operationally ready national serviceman" and "operationally ready national service" more accurately describe the contributions made by these valiant young Singaporeans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 25th August 1994, the Deputy Prime Minister had already moved the Second Reading, and this House had agreed to the amendment to Article 128(2b)(ii), of the Constitution to change the terms "reservists" and "reserve service" to "operationally ready national servicemen" and "operationally ready national service" respectively. These terms in the Enlistment Act and the SAF Act will have to be similarly amended.

  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Defence (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have already addressed the aspect of the Bill concerning the nomenclature changes. I will now address the amendments to provide for the non-uniformed SAF scheme of service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The non-uniformed SAF scheme of service, otherwise known as NUSAF, was established for a large number of non-combat jobs in the SAF. These jobs require the incumbents to have good working knowledge of the organisation and operations of the military, but they do not need to serve in uniform. Furthermore, it is anticipated that in the long-term, Mindef would experience staffing difficulties. Mindef's ability to recruit uniformed military personnel would be affected by the shrinking labour pool resources.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NUSAF scheme of service enables Mindef to retain people in the SAF without requiring them to go through the military career path. It allows military personnel to convert to the non-uniformed scheme, thereby allowing them to serve in non-combat appointments in the SAF till the age of 60. This measure ensures that the SAF combat personnel are kept young and energetic. On the other hand, experience is maintained in the support units of Mindef and SAF.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, NUSAF personnel are enlisted under the Enlistment Act and governed by the SAF Act. Many provisions in the SAF Act are based on the structure of ranks and are therefore not applicable to NUSAF personnel. NUSAF personnel do not hold a rank. Thus, provisions must be included in the SAF to provide for them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed amendment will, first, define a non-uniformed serviceman or NUSAF serviceman as a regular serviceman whose terms of service do not require him to wear uniform. Secondly,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> modify provisions of the Act relating to disciplinary processes to enable them to cater for NUSAF servicemen. Lastly, enable the Armed Forces Council to make regulations giving effect to the NUSAF scheme of service and to exclude or vary the operation of the Act in relation to NUSAF servicemen.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new provisions in the SAF Act would take into account the differences between NUSAF and military schemes and would remain sufficiently similar to and consistent with the military system.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Third time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Select Committee on this Bill received eight written representations from concerned private individuals as well as public organisations and the Law Society. Four representors presented oral evidence. The process was beneficial as it threw up several useful suggestions, most of which have been accepted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the Select Committee was presented to this House on 22nd August 1994. The Bill is set out in Appendix I of the Report and also incorporates the amendments made by the Select Committee. The reasons for the amendments are set out in Appendix V of the Report.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that most of the changes are quite technical in nature.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the proceedings of the Select Committee, it is clear that the Bill was generally welcomed by entrepreneurs, investors and those engaged in R&amp;D and product development in Singapore. However, they wanted to clarify the ambit and content of certain provisions to make clear its scope and intended effect. Most of the issues dealt with concerned technical and procedural matters relating to the application process leading to the grant of a patent. Other representations dealt with some issues of policy which fell outside the terms of reference of the Select Committee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee's approach was to maintain a balanced patent protection scheme. In other words, to provide adequate protection and returns to patentable inventions and, at the same time, give due recognition to consumer and industry interests in having wider access to inventive products and services.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee took into account the fast-changing technology and the need for a patents regime which is responsive to technological change. Outdated legislation, of course, impedes economic growth. This is especially so as our economy is becoming increasingly service-oriented, where the creation, transmission and processing of information, especially in the field of R&amp;D and product development, is assuming greater importance. Modern patents legislation would also attract investments, particularly in the field of industrial science and technology.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Sir, that the Bill, as amended and improved by the Select Committee, will meet our objective of promoting Singapore as a regional and international centre for research and development.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not intend to deal with the details of provisions recommended by the Select Committee, as they are well set out in the Report.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several representors made suggestions relating to the recently-concluded Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, which will become effective in the year 2000. Although we have not accepted these proposals for the time being, as I explained and as set out
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> in the Report, this does not mean that their views have no merit. The Select Committee felt that the TRIPS Agreement had impact, not just on Patents legislation, but in other areas as well. To review this Patents Bill for compliance with TRIPS at this stage may be premature. Therefore, the Committee felt that it was better to review them later. Like other countries, Singapore intends to abide by the provisions of TRIPS. But we must understand that the TRIPS Agreement is quite an enormous undertaking involving not only patents but other areas like copyrights, trade marks, designs, integrated circuits and so on. Therefore, we will examine TRIPS to see how it impacts all these other various laws in Singapore. As TRIPS will come into force for Singapore some five years after ratification, we are really talking about the year 2000. In the interim, we intend to review our legislation on all the areas that I have mentioned as well as to learn from other countries their experiences in implementing TRIPS into their national legislation. For the time being, we feel that we should proceed with this legislation on patents which, if I may add, has been long awaited by the industry and should not be delayed further.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

   <b>COMPETITIVE SALARIES FOR COMPETENT AND HONEST GOVERNMENT</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Motion)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the Motion standing in my name,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this House endorses Paper Cmd. 13 of 1994 on "Competitive Salaries for Competent and Honest Government" as the basis for setting salaries of Ministers and senior public officers.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year, this House revised the salaries of Ministers and civil servants, to make them competitive with the market. During the debate, Senior Minister suggested that a formula be settled by the House so that future salary revisions could more promptly reflect changes in the market, without the House having to go through old grounds. This Motion is to debate the formula.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A competent, honest Government is essential to Singapore's prosperity and success. The Government has to create the conditions for Singaporeans to create wealth - political stability, racial harmony, law and order, good foreign relations, in particular, relations with our neighbours, excellent infrastructure, excellent industrial relations, worker productivity, educated workforce, right economic policies and attractive tax regime, sound economic management, good legal framework, good housing and free-flowing traffic. These are not all the factors that make Singapore competitive and a worthwhile place to work and live in. But they are the key ones.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Economic Forum in its 1994 Report ranked Singapore second most
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> competitive of the 41 most dynamic economies studied. We lost out to the US only because of one major weakness - the size of our country and our lack of natural resources. It is this competitiveness which enables us to attract investments and tourists, and sell our products and services, to become the 18th richest country in the world in terms of per capita income. We have overtaken New Zealand and are just behind UK and Australia.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did we do it? Without wanting to sound immodest, I would say the short answer is: good Government. This is not to downplay the role of the people themselves - their diligence, their emphasis on education, their high savings habit, their discipline and, above all, their responsiveness to public policies and support for the Government. But people, like an orchestra, can play good symphonies only under the hand of a maestro.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government comprises two groups of people: political leaders and civil servants. Whether the Government is good or bad, caring or ruthless, honest or corrupt, strong or weak, depends on the quality of the people in Government, in particular, the Ministers and Permanent Secretaries. If you have clever but dishonest people in charge, you will get a corrupt Government which will strip the country bare. If you have honest people but duds as your leaders, they will ruin the country despite their best effort. If the Government is both dishonest and incompetent, you will have three choices: suffer, jump ship or mutiny. Each one of these is not pleasant. But these three situations can be avoided.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key question I want to put before the House is: what kind of Government do you want? That is, what kind of people do you want to have as Ministers and top civil servants? In other words, what sort of people in the Government will best provide you stability, a healthy environment, good-paying jobs and bring you more prosperity? Do you want to have honest Ministers and officials? Do you want to have a fair share of the top talents and high performers in Government?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only after we answer these questions that we can decide on salary benchmarks for Ministers and civil servants. If you are prepared to live with a mediocre Government, and are happy with the average Ah Tan or Ahmad as your Minister or Permanent Secretary, then the salary benchmark can be pegged to the median income of all Singaporeans, about $1,500 per month. But if you think that your life is safer under competent hands, then the salary benchmark should be pegged to the top few hundred salary earners. These people earn at least $40,000 a month, or $1/2 million a year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have elected me as your Prime Minister. You have entrusted me with your future.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I owe you a duty to assemble the best team for Cabinet and the Administrative Service. I want people who are absolutely honest and will not cheat and lie to you. I want people of exceptional ability who can anticipate and solve problems, and see and create opportunities for you. I want people who are interested beyond their own families' welfare and are prepared to work their guts out for you. I can assemble such a team only if you give me the backing to recruit and retain the best team I can find.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take a pragmatic Singaporean approach - look for a solution that will work. Today's peaceful and prosperous Singapore and abundant opportunities in the region are in sharp contrast with yesterday's of poverty, political and communal strife, struggle for independence and survival, and regional hostility. Lee Kuan Yew and his old guards are legends. If there are younger Lee Kuan Yews, Goh Keng Swees, Eddie Barkers, Rajaratnams, Toh Chin Chyes, or Ong Pang Boons out there, please come forward. Then we can throw the White Paper away. But can we? We still have to decide how to pay our civil servants, in particular, the superscale officers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil servants' salaries should approximate what their peers of similar qualification, drive and competence can earn in the private sector, in other words, near market rates. This applies to all civil
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> servants - teachers, nurses, technicians, not just top Administrative Officers. It is not fair nor practical to ask them to take a financial sacrifice. I said near market rates, not market rates, because the public sector will follow, not lead the private sector in setting wages.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper is not just about setting benchmarks for Ministers and top civil servants. It is also to establish the principle that all civil servants must be paid as well as their counterparts in the private sector. We will use private sector salaries to benchmark public sector pay.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next decade will pose particularly difficult challenges for the public sector in personnel recruitment. Hitherto, it has to contend only with the booming private sector within Singapore. Now the whole region beckons our able and enterprising.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many public officers, especially those who speak Chinese, are plunging into China, xia hai as the Chinese call it. Despite the major salary revision in January this year, 10 Administrative Officers resigned soon after. Two more left under the Early Release Scheme. Is it surprising? I have led many business delegations overseas. We open doors and establish guan xi for them. They invest, buy, sell and make money. It will require a very altruistic public officer not to be tempted when he sees our businessmen seize the opportunities we help to create. The EDB, TDB and MTI officers can measure themselves against the businessmen and executives and know that what the businessmen do, they can do, and perhaps even better.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resignations of the 12 Administrative Officers completely cancelled out the annual recruitment into the Administrative Service. Worse, it comes on top of many years of high attrition from the Service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you another startling statistic. Two-thirds of the Administrative Officers who joined the Service in the late 1970s and early 1980s have resigned. For example, out of the 20 who joined the Service in 1978, only two remain. From the 1980 batch of 14, only one remains.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> This has severely depleted the Administrative Service ranks of those in the early and late 30s age group. It has caused serious problems in planning succession to the Permanent Secretary posts. We simply do not have enough officers with Permanent Secretary potential to succeed the present Permanent Secretaries. We also do not have enough promising junior officers, two levels down, whom we can groom to become Permanent Secretaries in four to five years' time. That is why the White Paper is necessary. We must move decisively to reinforce the Administrative Service, beef up recruitment and speed up promotions, to pre-empt and head off the problem of weak leadership in future years. Otherwise, the Administrative Service will be further stripped, and the administration will collapse.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to develop our own model for remunerating Ministers and public officers, by learning from the experience of others. In Britain, the tradition was for people of independent means to enter politics for token salaries. But this system is under strain in Britain itself. Not many present-day British MPs have independent means. As they are paid inadequately, many make up by becoming paid lobbyists for companies. The Economist of 24th September in an article "MPs for Hire: Time for Reform" wrote that some MPs peddle influence for money. More than 200 MPs (out of 651) are employed as parliamentary consultants to lobbying companies and other commercial organisations. Their duties include making supportive speeches, asking questions and lobbying government ministers. A single parliamentary consultancy can pay o10,000 or more a year, a third of an MP's salary. And as long as financial links are openly declared, "virtually any payment is permissible".
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July, the London Sunday Times tricked two British MPs into agreeing to table questions in Parliament. The MPs are now being investigated by the House of Commons Privileges Committee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few days, our newspapers have reported that the owner of Harrods,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Mohammed Al-Fayed, had paid thousands of pounds to a lobbying concern to get two other Conservative MPs to ask questions on his behalf. One of the MPs, named Tim Smith, who had subsequently been appointed a junior minister, immediately resigned his ministership. The other, Neil Hamilton, was a minister in charge of ethics in the Department of Trade and Industry. He first denied any wrongdoing. But, later, when evidence surfaced, Prime Minister John Major sacked him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the solution to this problem? John Grigg, a commentator in The Sunday Telegraph (23rd October 1994), offered this:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... Our MPs should be given every encouragement to resist financial temptations of an improper kind, and this must point to their being better paid for the work they are elected to do.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Ministers, too, should receive salaries that bear some relationship to those that top people in industry, the City and many professions command. It is absurd that Cabinet ministers, and even the Prime Minister should be paid less than senior civil servants, let alone leading figures in the world outside Westminster and Whitehall.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the US model be better for Singapore? The US, like the UK, has problems with low public sector wages. In 1989, the US Congress considered a proposal to increase the pay of top government officials, including Senators and Congressmen. Opponents made it a populist issue, organising radio talk shows, phone-ins and write-in campaigns to intimidate Senators and Congressmen. They were intimidated. As a result, the Senate and Congress were forced to vote against the pay increases, which they had originally hoped to pass without a vote. Later, they tried a second time and got a modified proposal through.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is politically difficult for Senators and Congressmen to vote for big pay increases for themselves, they make up for low pay by allowing themselves to retain fees for writing books, and in the past for making speeches. But when the American senior officials retire, they make speeches, write books, or set up lobbying and consultancy companies to capitalise
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> on their contacts and their public service. Officials often leave before the term of the Administration runs out, in order to make the most of contacts in high places before their friends leave office and their market value drops. In other words, if they have friends in high places, make use of them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because political salaries in America cannot be increased, some public sector salaries also get held down. The predictable result is that quality suffers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the US has difficulty finding good federal judges because federal judges are paid a fraction of what good lawyers in private practice earn. The US Congressional Research Service in September 1990 submitted a report to Congress on "The Pay Situation and Federal Judges". It observed that among the major losers in the February 1989 pay increase defeat were the federal judges and that the large gap between their pay and private sector lawyers' earnings was leading to an exodus from the federal bench.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote from the report:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In March 1989, Chief Justice William Rehnquist called the pay situation faced by the federal judiciary "the most serious threat to the future of the judiciary and its continued operation during my lifetime." ....
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One US District Court judge recently said: "It was once every lawyer's dream to become a judge. It is not that way now." '
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We faced a similar situation earlier. So we systematically raised salaries for Ministers, Judges and other public officers. We have less problem today in getting good private sector lawyers to become Judges and Judicial Commissioners because we raised the salaries of our Judges earlier.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan offers us a more positive model. The Japanese civil service enjoys high prestige. Entrance is highly competitive. Ezra Vogel described this very well in his book "Japan as Number One". Leading Japanese bureaucrats come from the best universities, like Tokyo University, and rise through the ranks in a carefully prescribed fashion. The top graduates enter the most prestigious ministries (Finance, International Trade and Industry, Foreign Affairs)
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and agencies (Economic Planning, Land, Environment), provided they pass the ministerial written examination and demonstrate poise, breadth and commitment in interviews. Ezra Vogel describes how the Japanese bureaucrats rise in seniority, but are paid less than their counterparts in private industry. However, "they (that is the Japanese bureaucrats) are fully aware that they are dealing with important problems, and they take pride in the successful handling of difficult issues."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elite-track bureaucrats advance by cohort. I quote Vogel:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`By the time ministry officials reach their thirties, they can identify those in their age group who are most likely to fill the top posts two decades later. At about age fifty, the top several in the age group advance to become chiefs of the most important divisions, and all others who entered the ministry the same year retire. Several years later, consensus begins to jell about who would make the best vice-minister in his age group, and the administrative vice-minister [equivalent to our Permanent Secretary] and the administrative vice-minister chooses his successor, who becomes the most powerful person in the ministry. All remaining peers resign, not because of an official rule but because of custom and because they will receive high positions in private firms or public corporations or will become politicians.'
  <br>
  <br>This practice of bureaucrats moving from top ministry posts to senior private sector positions is called "amakudari", which literally means "descent from heaven". You are dropped from heaven to important positions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can learn much from the Japanese model: the emphasis on recruiting the best candidates, its cohesion and mission, the systematic grooming of promising officers for senior positions, the high status enjoyed by bureaucrats in Japanese society, and the private sector positions for them when they retire from public service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Japanese model is not entirely applicable to us. First, we have to stress competitive salaries for the public service much more than the Japanese. We cannot rely on the prestige of public service to make up for lower pay. Singapore is a young society, not an established Japan with set traditions. Singaporeans, especially the young,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> talented and ambitious, gauge their status by material success and visible rewards. Our system must recognise this reality.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, our civil servants will not wait patiently, advancing gradually by cohort, until one becomes a Permanent Secretary and the rest retire. They need to be advanced on merit, once they prove themselves, with less emphasis on seniority. In the Singapore private sector, professionals reach the peaks of their careers in their 40s. For civil service careers to peak when officers are nearly 60 years old, just before they retire, is untenable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we cannot depend on amakudari to reward civil servants as the Japanese do, although we will often deploy top civil servants to statutory boards and GLCs. Firstly, many major companies in Singapore are MNCs. Secondly, in Singapore's environment, good officers expect rewards while they are serving, not after they retire.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, in Singapore, Ministers set the pace, not civil servants. In many countries, Ministers preside over their Ministries, which are really run by the civil servants. Ministers concentrate on political work, leaving the formulation and implementation of policies to bureaucrats. This is not so in Singapore, where Ministers master the details of their departmental briefs, and take the lead in developing new policies and arguing them in public. Therefore, our methods must ensure not only a good civil service, but also capable Ministers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are evolving our own model, based on stringent recruitment standards, competitive pay, rigorous testing out and developing of talent, and swift promotions on merit. We are looking for people who are doing or can do extremely well in the private sector. Such people will simply not come in if it means a large financial sacrifice.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present generation of school leavers enjoy many opportunities to pursue their careers. Returned PSC
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> scholars are the major source of Administrative Officers. 25 years ago, PSC scholarships were much sought after by students completing their Higher School Certificate. For many, the scholarships were the only way to go to university. They came from poor families with parents who could not afford to pay for their university education, much less send them overseas. Of the 15 present Permanent Secretaries, 11 went to university on Government scholarships.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, students have many alternatives to PSC scholarships. Many parents can easily afford to pay for their children to go to NUS or NTU. They can get other scholarships to go abroad - from banks, from foundations, even from overseas universities. Young people give a civil service career low priority. When offered scholarships, they immediately ask, "How long is the bond?"
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1992, the son of a seamstress declined an Overseas Merit (Teaching) scholarship to Cambridge, even though he had no other scholarship. In 1994, the son of a bus driver declined an Overseas Merit (Open) award to the UK to study engineering, as did the son of an electrician. Instead, they took other scholarships, one from Singapore Technologies Holdings, and the other from MAS.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many scholars do not serve out their bond period, but buy themselves out to join the private sector employers. Their new employers often help to pay off their bonds. In recent years, 30%, nearly one-third, of Administrative Officers left before their bonds expired.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the PSC has to recruit people for the Administrative Service after graduation, like other employers, instead of through PSC scholarships, it would get few people. Not that the PSC has not tried, but students who turned down scholarships before going to university are even more unlikely to join the civil service after graduating with good degrees. In the six years since 1989, the PSC has recruited only seven non-scholarship holders for the Administrative Service - just over one a year. Of these, two have already resigned.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay is not the only reason the Administrative Service is not attracting recruits. Job challenge, career structure and advancement rates also matter. Ambitious young people not only want to be paid what they feel they deserve. They also value prompt, visible symbols of their success. These are important aspects of personnel management practices. They are being urgently addressed, now that we have amended the Constitution to devolve PSC powers, and have put PSD under the Prime Minister's Office. Major changes are under way which will make the public sector approximate the private sector more closely.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the civil service will promote and reward as promptly as the private sector, so too it will assess and judge performance as rigorously. But unlike the private sector, the bottom line is not always measured in dollars. The civil service used to be an iron rice-bowl, but this has changed. It will give exceptional rewards only for excellent performance. As a corollary, those who do not measure up, for whatever reason, will have to make way for those who do. The civil service will do this systematically, being fair to individual officers and, at the same time, upholding the integrity of its personnel assessments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Administrative Service is not so prestigious as the Japanese that able Singaporeans will willingly accept lower pay for the privilege of serving the Government. That is why we have to adopt competitive pay.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no difficulty in justifying a market-related salary for civil servants. But for Ministers, politically, it is much more difficult. Some critics argue that Ministers should be different. They say politics is a noble calling and that Ministers should naturally make financial sacrifices to serve the people. I agree that Ministers should be different and that there should be some financial sacrifice. But how much sacrifice? That is the nub of the problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We face the same problem finding able Ministers as finding competent civil servants. We are drawing from the same
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> talent pool, from the same generation of career-minded professionals. The requirements for Ministers are even more stringent than for Permanent Secretaries. A good Minister will make a good Permanent Secretary. But a good Permanent Secretary will not necessarily make a good Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talented Singaporeans are even more reluctant to enter politics than they are to join the civil service. People know how daunting the job is, and how public their failure will be if they do not make the grade. So do their families, who must also be persuaded. Several civil servants I have approached to stand for elections preferred to remain as civil servants. While some are willing, their wives objected.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have previously described to this House how difficult it has been for me to assemble the present Cabinet. The task is getting more difficult, and more urgent. The Cabinet is getting older. The second generation leaders must in turn find and groom third and fourth generation leaders. Otherwise, we will fail in a most important responsibility - to leave Singapore in good hands after we ourselves have left the scene.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to find on average one new potential Minister a year, ie, four or five in every general election, just to keep up with the normal attrition of passing years. We have not succeeded in doing so in recent years. Unless we find several potential Ministers by the next general election, we will have a serious succession problem by the year 2000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we cannot even get enough Administrative Officers on competitive wages, how can we find enough Ministers paying non-competitive salaries? Let me state categorically that none of the present Ministers have asked for a salary increase or expected such revisions when they joined my Cabinet. But I have to deal realistically with the urgent problem of finding more new Ministers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some point out that many developed countries pay their Ministers less than ours. But that does not mean these countries are doing right, or doing well, only
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that their public opinion and the low standing of their politicians make it impossible for them to grasp the nettle of upping Ministers' salaries. Ministers from developed countries have told us privately how much they envy us, being able to bring the issue of Ministers' salaries out into the open and debate it rationally. They regret that in their political climate, they themselves cannot do that. Because if they do, they will be immediately attacked by their opposition.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must never let ourselves drift into such a grave predicament, where populist hypocrisy prevails and difficult sensitive issues cannot be publicly discussed and solved. It is like the present debate in the US on the question of genes and intelligence brought out in the book called The Bell Curve. How can they find rational solutions if they cannot discuss these things rationally?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salaries cannot be the motivation for becoming a Minister. Becoming a Minister is more than a job. It demands a sense of duty and public purpose, the desire to build a better nation and shape its future. People make many personal sacrifices when they enter politics. Most cannot be helped - the heavy demands on their time, the loss of privacy, the load on their families. But we can and must minimise the financial sacrifice involved in taking up political office. Otherwise, it becomes more difficult to find competent Ministers, and the country will pay dearly for sub-standard Ministers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One standard which is bound to fall when salaries become unrealistic is the integrity of the public service. However efficient the CPIB is, and however ruthlessly we enforce the laws against corruption, it is not possible to maintain a clean government if salaries are too low. A traffic policeman on highway patrol cannot resist the temptation to accept coffee money instead of issuing a speeding ticket if he cannot support himself and his family on his pay alone. It is vital for Singapore to maintain an incorruptible public service, from top to bottom, and not let standards slip. What a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> traffic policeman can take is "kacang" compared to the harm which a dishonest Permanent Secretary or Minister in charge of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of contracts can do. If the top level is corrupt, no enforcement will keep the lower levels straight. As a Chinese proverb says, shang liang bu zheng, xia liang wai [ ] (If the upper beam is not straight, the lower ones will go aslant.)
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asian Wall Street Journal recently carried an editorial "Gems in the Rough". The editorial was about the case of the Saudi Arabian jewels which disappeared in Thailand, but it quoted Singapore as an example. I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore, for all its preachiness, makes the point of using the bully pulpit to uphold standards of decent social behaviour. When he was criticised as prime minister for having among the highest salaries of any Head of State in Asia, Lee Kuan Yew could answer, with some justice if less diplomacy, that in fact he was probably the lowest paid leader in Asia.'
  <br>
  <br>In other words, the Asian Wall Street Journal reluctantly accepts our judgment that one good way to keep the system honest is to pay everyone, including Ministers, realistic salaries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asian Intelligence, a fortnightly Report on Asia Business and Politics published by a Hong Kong-based company tracked corruption in Asian countries for its clients, mainly investors, expatriate businessmen and managers. I did not know that corruption was being tracked and reports given to business people. So it plays a part in deciding where one should invest his capital.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a scale of zero to 10, Singapore was rated 0.6 and Hong Kong 1.6 in its April 1994 Report on "Corruption in Asia". A grade of zero is defined as a situation in which corruption does not exist, while a 10 represents a very serious corruption problem that greatly detracts from the business environment. The other countries reported on are: China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. As the Report is available only to subscribers, I should not read out the scores. But they ranged from 2.9 to 8.2. Singapore's score is 0.6.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corruption is not an affliction of developing countries alone. John Grigg whom I have quoted earlier also said in the same article:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... Among our continental neighbours, Spain and France, to say nothing of Italy, have reached a point where the entire state establishment is thought by many to be riddled with corruption.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper quoted the World Bank Report on The East Asian Miracle: Economic Growth and Public Policy. This Report studied the reasons why countries like Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand had such successful economies. It identified three principles for building a reputable civil service:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Recruitment and promotion must be merit-based and highly competitive;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Total compensation, including pay, perks and prestige, must be competitive with the private sector; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Those who make it to the top should be amply rewarded. This has been precisely Singapore's approach.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Bank Report noted:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In bureaucracies, as in nearly everything else, you get what you pay for.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In general, the more favourably the total public sector compensation package compares to compensation in the private sector, the better the quality of the bureaucracy.'
  <br>
  <br>It explicitly cited Singapore:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Not surprisingly, Singapore, which is widely perceived to have the region's most competent and upright bureaucracy, pays its bureaucrats best.'
  <br>
  <br>In other words, the World Bank sees Singapore as a model, and is encouraging other countries to follow our example.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, we have revised salaries every four to five years. Because revisions are infrequent, they have to be larger. People fail to realise that the large percentage revisions are to catch up with several years of private sector increases, and are not the typical increase Ministers enjoy every year. Each time, we debate from scratch the appropriate level of Ministers' salaries. It is therefore better for us to set benchmarks, based on private sector incomes, as declared in IRAS returns.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Then we can adjust salaries annually, in small steps, without re-arguing first principles over and over again.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper proposes the benchmarks. The details are a little complex, but the principles are simple and straightforward. We will compare Ministers' salaries with earnings of top earners in six professions - bankers, lawyers, accountants, engineers, MNC Chief Executive Officers, local manufacturers. We will choose the top four in each profession, and average over 24 people. It is appropriate to compare Ministers with the top of these professions, both because the Ministers have larger and more demanding responsibilities than those top professionals, and because we want Ministers of the calibre who would rise to the top if they were in the private sector. Ministers' salaries at Staff Grade I will then be set at two-thirds the private sector average. In my judgment, the difference of one-third is a fair sacrifice to ask of Ministers. To cater to the range of Ministers' jobs, which are not all the same size, and their different contributions, there will be two higher salary grades for Ministers in addition to the new Staff Grade I. These are the Staff Grade II plus 12%, which is the existing base grade, and Staff Grade IV.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outstanding Administrative Officers with potential to become Permanent Secretaries can expect to reach Superscale G by age 32. Not every Administrative Officer will make it by that age, but the plan, and the hope, is that one-third will. They will be among the best in their cohort both in the private and public sectors, but will not yet be at the top of their careers Hence we will compare Superscale G officers with top professionals, aged 32, in the same six professions. We will match their salaries not with the topmost earner, but with the 15th highest, in these professions. A good Administrative Officer will easily come among the top 15 of his cohort. No discount will be applied, unlike for the Ministers' benchmark. It is unfair and unrealistic to expect a young person to accept a pay cut to work in the public service.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have expressed surprise that the benchmark figures are so high. But the benchmarks are based on Income Tax Department returns and reflect what the private sector earns. IRAS analysed declared earnings of individuals who actually paid income tax based on these figures. In fact, the figures are conservative. Firstly, they are two years behind time. Secondly, many components of income in the private sector are hard to pin down in tax returns, such as benefits in kind, entertainment and travel privileges, even payments abroad.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> The benchmarks will be updated annually, and public sector salaries will be correspondingly revised. The Government will also review the salaries of all the other services, for which benchmarks have already been established. Salaries will be adjusted service by service, as and when they get out of line. Infrequent but large service wide salary revisions, in which all services automatically get a raise, will be a thing of the past.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, both Ministers' and civil servants' salaries are considerably below the benchmarks. Staff Grade I Ministers earn less than half (48% to be exact) the average of top private sector professionals, compared to the target of two-thirds. Superscale G officers earn 80% of their benchmark figure. We will revise salaries for civil servants, not overnight but progressively, to reach the benchmarks over three years. For Ministers, the adjustment will be even more gradual.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear in mind that even after the revision is complete, at two-thirds the private sector, there will still be about 100 people in the private sector earning more than a Staff Grade I Minister. These 100 are income-earners. They do not include entrepreneurs, owners of businesses, stockbrokers. If we include them, far more than 100 Singaporeans earn more than a Staff Grade I Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers vary in their ability, and in their private sector earning power. But I have no doubt that more than half of my Cabinet would have been among the top 100 salary earners, had they opted for a private sector career.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot truthfully say that all Ministers will get what they are being paid if they were in the private sector. But in politics, I need a balanced team, to reflect the political realities in Singapore. Though a Minister may not earn the same amount in the private sector, I must be satisfied that his responsibilities and performance as a Minister, in particular, his political contribution, justify his being made a Minister. So we do not appoint young MPs as Ministers rightaway. They have to prove themselves first. A few, when they were appointed as Minister of State or Parliamentary Secretary, did take a pay cut, like Dr Ker Sin Tze and Ho Peng Kee. There was real financial sacrifice.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need a team to run the country. $600,000 a year for a Minister will seem a lot to most Singaporeans. Even $300,000 will seem a lot to them. But see it from a bird's eye view, and not a worm's eye view. See it in perspective. The total cost this year for all the political office-holders, from Political Secretaries to Prime Minister, is $17 million a year. Weigh this against the GDP of $89,000 million. That is what we are responsible for.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am asking today for your endorsement of a formula to pay civil servants and Ministers. Judge the correctness of the formula by results, not by comparing what you are earning with the salaries of the Ministers and senior civil servants. You should ask yourself whether the Cabinet as a team is worth the $17 million today. Like durians, the proof is in the eating. You should get what you pay for.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My task is to achieve and sustain the highest standard of Government in terms of incorruptibility, integrity, and competence so that you will enjoy the highest standard of living possible. My Government must produce jobs, pay increases, homes, schools, social harmony, economic growth, the lot which gives you a better life. If we succeed, as we have done in the last five years, $22 million a year for my team under the new formula to be implemented over several years, is small beer.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measure the $22 million against the cost to you of having an incompetent and corrupt Government. Wrong policies and corruption could easily reduce Singapore's economic growth by a couple of percentage points - 2-3%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our GDP is $89 billion. A 1% growth is worth $890 million. A 3% reduction in growth as a result of mismanagement and corruption will cost Singapore $2,670 million. This is not a paper loss to the economy. It is an actual loss coming out of your wages and profits. It will be penny wise and pound foolish, if you deny me the means to get the best people into Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will not be the last occasion that the Government explains and justifies its policy for paying Ministers and top civil servants. But the White Paper will carry the debate forward, and save us from covering the same ground over and over again. The policy proposed in the White Paper is essential to maintain the quality of the Government over the next 15 to 20 years, when high growth in the region will make it more difficult than ever for us to recruit outstanding men and women to become civil servants and Ministers. We need to change the perception of an Administrative Service career among Singaporeans, and especially among ambitious young people who are leaving school, and choosing scholarships and professions. We also need more Singaporeans to come forward to serve as Ministers, to lead Singapore and maintain the prosperity and security we now take for granted. The White Paper, I hope, can help us to do that.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore ask this House to endorse the White Paper on "Competitive Salaries for Competent and Honest Government" as the basis for setting salaries of Ministers and senior public officers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>4.03 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Prime Minister's motion. First, let me deal with the principles set out in the White Paper. I endorse these principles.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first principle is "transparency of salaries". We should give Ministers and top civil servants clean and realistic salaries, and not like many other countries where the salaries of ministers and civil servants are deliberately kept down, but there are all kinds of perks and allowances to enhance their incomes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second principle is "high salaries to attract talents". I support the principle that the pay of Ministers and top civil servants should be linked to the private sector and relativity with it should be maintained. The reasons are very simple: in an age of high growth, high reward and high expectations, the public sector must adjust its salaries so as to be competitive with the private sector for the limited talents, as the Prime Minister mentioned just now. Regionalisation has also made this competition keener. The public sector should have a certain proportion of talents in order to maintain the policy of Government by the talented (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). Of course, salary is not the only way to attract talents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third principle is "benchmarking of salaries". I also endorse that benchmarks must be set for the salaries of Ministers and top civil servants in accordance with the fluctuations and adjustments in the private sector automatically. This is to avoid the controversy or even political issue that arises every time the salaries of Ministers and top civil servants are adjusted. We must, and we have the right to, create our own model.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remind ourselves that we are not talking about the salaries of a few Ministers and top civil servants. Our focus
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> should be on how "to attract the right talents and to maintain the integrity of the Government with high and proper salaries" (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). This is to ensure that we maintain a clean, upright and able Government, which is our precious asset. While many countries are practising money politics and suffering from malpractices and corruption, we should value and treasure this asset even more. This asset is one of the prerequisites for Singapore's survival.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the problems faced by the Prime Minister in attracting talents. I also know the feelings of the Prime Minister on this issue. But as the Chairman of the Feedback Unit, I must also sincerely tell him the feedback from the ground. The ground feedback is not very favourable. On 26th October, the Feedback Unit held a dialogue with 37 community leaders, union leaders and professionals on the White Paper. On 28th October, I wrote to the Prime Minister to brief him on the main points raised in the dialogue. All participants in this dialogue agreed that the Ministers should be well paid and many even suggested that after the Ministers have retired after successfully discharging their duties, they should be given better retirement benefits in addition to the pensions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But except for two, all the other participants were against or expressed their doubts about the two criteria of the benchmarking and the methodology of formulating the benchmark: why select only six professions? Why select only the top four of each profession as the benchmark of the starting salary of the Minister? Why select the 32-year old and the 15th position of the private sector's pay as the senior civil servant's benchmark?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The participants also expressed two views: first, the benchmark was based on incomes of the top four earners in 1992, but because of profits and losses, these top four earners may not be able to maintain their positions as the top four in future. That is to say, after some years, they could be replaced by others. But the Ministers' salaries are pegged to any top
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> four earners in each of the six selected professions, or the average earnings of the 24 top earners. This kind of calculation is upward biased, as it reduces the possibility of downward adjustment and the magnitude of decline of the Ministers' pay. The other view expressed by the participants was that if the pay of Ministers and top civil servants is to be pegged to the private sector, then to some extent they should also be tested by market forces. The salaries should reflect the job size and their performance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the White Paper has spent a lot of space in explaining the need and the criteria of the benchmarking, I feel that the White Paper is not very convincing, and in many places, the arguments are even subjective or even arbitrary. For example, if the local top executives, because of the nature of their work, are more comparable with that of the Ministers, then regardless of whether they are in local manufacturing, MNCs, oil companies or other companies, they should all be included for benchmarking. Another example is that architects, doctors, accountants, engineers and lawyers have all the time been regarded as professionals, but architects and doctors are excluded from the professions selected for benchmarking. The White Paper has pointed out that "a good architect does not necessarily make a good Minister, and vice versa". I agree with this view. However, this statement is equally applicable to bankers, accountants, engineers and lawyers. Outstanding Ministers for Finance, like Dr Goh Keng Swee, Mr Hon Sui Sen and Dr Richard Hu, were not bankers, and Dr Hu came from an oil company. The position of Minister for National Development need not be taken up by an architect, and similarly, the Minister for Health need not be a doctor. For benchmarking, the selection of jobs should be jobs which are more comparable or similar to the jobs of Ministers, which require general management skills, and not specific technical expertise or other special skills. In other words, the CEOs, the general managers, and top executives in the private sector should be more appropriate than professionals for benchmarking.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel that if only six professions and only four earners from each of the professions are selected for benchmarking, then the database will be too narrow, and this may also make the average salaries unstable and unreliable. Perhaps we should consider using more general occupations (occupations of general talents and not of expertise) and percentile for the benchmarking. Another proposal is to select all the local CEOs and top executives' pay and use their average income as benchmarking for the salary of Ministers. This way of calculation may be more acceptable to the people, and the database will be broader for comparison. Similarly, if we are concerned that the widening of income gap between professionals in the private sector and civil servants in the public sector will affect the career choice of school-leavers and reduce the number joining the public sector, then we should select even more professionals, including architects and doctors, as the basis for benchmarking top civil servants' pay in order to broaden the database. Moreover, these occupations and jobs for benchmarking civil servants' pay need not necessarily be similar to those selected for benchmarking the Ministers' pay. However, whatever the method of calculation, whether there is discount or not, we still have to position the pay of the top civil servants and the Ministers. The final question is whether the levels of the salaries will be acceptable to the people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the controversy is not so much on civil servants' pay but more on Ministers' pay. Each time, when adjustment of pay for Ministers is made, there will always be controversy. I ask myself why Ministerial salary should cause such controversy. I believe that there are three main reasons. The first reason is that some people feel that the Ministers' work and the work of the executives and professionals in the private sector are not the same in nature. They are not even comparable. Ministers have power and social status. The Ministers' collective or individual performance is not like those in the private sector who are assessed by profit and the bottom line. More importantly, Ministerial posts are
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> public service. Ministers are expected to have altruism and commitment. Many social workers, community leaders, town councillors and union leaders also sacrifice their time, their privacy and they serve the society and the people without a single cent. So they ask: what is the price for the spirit of commitment? They also ask: are we giving the wrong signal to accentuate the trends towards materialism? Many participants in the dialogue also felt that those who go into politics should have noble ideals and a high degree of commitment. Although 26 of the participants agreed that the pay of top civil servants and Ministers should be pegged to the private sector, only 11 agreed that this linkage should be made for the Ministers. Maybe some feel that these participants are too idealistic and even outmoded in their thinking and that they belong to the age of the dinosaurs. However, I feel that it is fortunate for our society that we have such people around. Like the late Dr Ee Peng Liang, we know that he never mentioned about his pay. He worked for the society. If we all think of our market value and our opportunity costs, what kind of society will we become?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason for the controversy is that some people, including most of the participants in the dialogue, agreed that Ministers should enjoy high pay because they carry very heavy responsibilities and times have changed. Times are different, as the Prime Minister also mentioned. It is only with high pay that we can attract talents to the governing team. However, they feel that some Ministers do not deserve such high pay. In other words, they separate "Ministerial posts" from "individuals". Singapore is a very small place. Every person knows what sort of pay certain Ministers are drawing before they joined politics. If their pay before they entered politics was lower than their current Ministers' pay, then it is very difficult to convince people that they are making any financial sacrifices after entering politics. Further, after the Ministers leave the entire administrative machinery, will they be able to earn as much outside?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason for the controversy is that inevitably, some would want to compare their own pay with the Ministers' pay. In addition, there are those with ulterior motives who would try to stir the ground and make this a sensitive and emotional issue. This year, many people are unhappy: housewives and retirees who have neither paid any tax before have to make adjustments for GST; civil servants are still grumbling about the changes in medical benefits, and those who aspire to own cars are complaining about high increases in COE prices. We cannot afford to ignore the feelings from the ground.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Objectively, in every economic system, salaries and wages are determined by demand and supply. If we are left with only one garbage collector, then his pay will certainly be higher than that of a lawyer. In China, some intellectuals lament that scientists who are able to make guided missiles (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) do not get as much as the hawkers who sell "tea-leaf" eggs (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). In every economic system, the structure of salaries and wages reflects the relative scarcity of jobs. On this basis, we aim to achieve "from each his best, to each his worth" (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). We must explain to the people this principle so that they have a sense of proportion in dealing with this issue. We must spend much time and effort to explain patiently the intention of the White Paper, and to convince them of the need to attract the right talent with high pay to run this country, and of the importance of maintaining a clean, upright and able government. We are in an age of rapid changes. If the Singapore economy is not properly planned and managed, then COE prices will no longer be a problem, instead, we will face more serious problems such as lowering of real income for the workers, the investors do not come in, widespread unemployment, and even problems which threaten the very survival of our country.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me summarise, Mr Speaker, Sir. On the whole, I support the basic principles of the White Paper. But from the feedback collected, I feel that we should not be rash
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> in setting benchmarks for Ministers' and top civil servants' pay. This is a very important issue with far-reaching effects. We should consider sending the White Paper to a Select Committee to collect more views and then make the necessary adjustments to the proposals in the White Paper. We should also allow the public time to digest the principles of the White Paper and accept the extra amount for Ministerial salaries as reasonable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me make one observation. In 1991, apart from Mr Ong Teng Cheong who became the Elected President, four resigned their Ministerial posts. I do not know and need not know why they left, but we can be sure that these Ministers have left not because of money. This gives us a lesson: high pay may reduce the difficulties of attracting talent into politics, but will not necessarily retain talents. Apart from salary, intangible factors such as challenges of the job, sense of participation in policy making, and the camaraderie among colleagues will also affect a person's decision to stay or leave. Talents are hard to seek, they are even harder to keep.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister seems to like the term xia hai, ( ) "going down to the ocean". On 3rd December last year, he mentioned that I resigned from a 22-year old University post to go into "the sea of commerce". Fortunately, I am not a female. I have already explained to the Prime Minister that in China, xia hai means you resign from public office to go into commerce. But for me, I am still spending at least half my working time in the constituency, in the Feedback Unit, in the Town Council and in other public duties. I left the university not because of money. If I had continued to stay in NUS and drawing the pay of Associate Professor and with the pay of my wife in a polytechnic plus our savings, we have enough to pay for our family expenditure and the overseas education of my two children. We lead a simple life, and our demands on material things are not very high. I left the university for reasons other than money. The main reason is that I will have the opportunity to lead my company to develop in China and other places. I get the returns on investments for my
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> company. At the same time, I hope through the enterprise, I will be able to achieve my task, carry out my wish, accomplish my mission, and also fulfil my promises to a friend (a former Minister of State) who entrusted me with a duty before he died. This kind of aspiration and sentiment cannot be understood by those who gauge people by dollars and cents (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;).
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is about to score another first. This time round, it is to peg the Ministers' salaries to that of the private sector. In fact, we should not be discussing the formula or benchmark upon which Ministers' salaries should be calculated, for the simple reason that the philosophy behind the increase is wrong in the first place.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the reasons why. First, while no one disagrees that Ministers should be paid well for the job they perform, most of us are disturbed as to the meaning of the word "well". How well? Before the salary increase, Ministers have been drawing salaries of $35,000 and upwards. Even by Singapore standards, this amount not only affords a family to live comfortably but also luxuriously. The pay increase will only mean that the Ministers want to live more luxuriously. The increase in pay will also mean that half of Singapore's working population would have to work for five years to make the same amount of money that a Minister would make in one month.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's argument is that Ministers should be paid salaries that are competitive with what top executives are making in the open market. This is the most warped argument, if ever there was one. Top corporate executives and CEOs compete with each other for their salaries, because there is competition amongst them. They are not political leaders, but administrative and managerial leaders. For example, a CEO of Citibank may compete with the CEO of Keppel Bank. They offer similar expertise and work experience.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who do our Ministers compete with? Comparing the type of expertise is entirely
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> a different matter. The job of Ministers is mostly as an overseer - to oversee a Ministry. They are backed up by the whole Government machinery. They have the Administrative Service to back them up in respect of running the administration and management. Even before they embark on a project, they can call upon international help and get experts from overseas. All these are within their resources. But if you compare a Minister with a CEO of a profit-oriented corporation, the CEO is engaged to increase the profit of the company. CEOs have limited resources. They have to depend solely on themselves, unlike Ministers who are backed by all the various Government departments to run the Ministry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of that, Ministers have all the powers, the prestige, travel, which a CEO does not have. Curiously enough, there are people in this world who have the idealism that they want power but they do not want so much remuneration. It is as simple as that. So you cannot have both. You cannot have power as well as remuneration to such an extent. Here I am not talking of a Minister who is underpaid. Bear with me. I am not talking of Ministers here who are underpaid. You cannot draw a comparison with the private sector for this reason.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers, after their term, would have an opportunity to get a job outside quite easily, simply because of their experience and the stature of being a Minister before. So they are in a win-and-win situation here, not the CEO anyway.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more suitable comparison would be the salaries of Ministers in ASEAN countries, and of course tied with the cost of living there and with certain knots up. I would imagine that would be the best comparison. You cannot compare political leaders with that of a corporate executive. As regards the salaries of Singapore Ministers, even when compared to politicians of a more advanced country, the intention to increase their salaries becomes quite incomprehensible. Even before the increment, our Ministers are considered the highest paid in the world. With the increase, our Prime Minister's income is four times that of the President
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of the United States and about five times that of John Major, the Prime Minister of England. Of course, it reminds me of the incident cited by our Prime Minister about MPs in UK. They were canvassing for all these things, not forgetting that the income of the Prime Minister of UK is only about $18,000 a month, and the MPs about $8,000 a month. It is unlike Singapore. If the Prime Minister of UK is paid $65,000 or $96,000, I do not think this thing will ever happen. So if you want to draw a comparison, you draw it that way. Similarly, for judges in the United Kingdom or the United States. If the President is being paid about $26,000 a month, I doubt very much the Federal judges will be paid more than $26,000 a month. There is no reason why they bemoan the fact that they are underpaid.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am saying is that - I repeat - no one begrudges the fact that Ministers should be well paid. But the question is: how well, and how much? Is that the yardstick to measure? It is wrong to compare with the private sector. I think our Prime Minister will recall, not very long ago, he accused the SDP of playing the politics of envy. By comparing the Ministers' salaries with what the private sector is earning, I think our Prime Minister is also playing the politics of envy now. He talks about the private sector earning so much money. Is that not also politics of envy?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can even go one step further to say that, besides playing the politics of envy, this is a very dangerous trend for the PAP to adopt in the sense that now they are encouraging the politics of greed. You start off with $96,000 and you want to ask for more. You start with the benchmark of the four highest earners, later on, three, two and one. It keeps on going up. Ultimately, you decide that you should be the highest paid in the land. The problem here is this. For the civil servants, the Government decides their benchmark. Who decides the benchmark for the Ministers? They decide themselves. Therefore, it is essential that they must
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> come back to Parliament every year, not just to peg it to that of the private sector but to decide how much they should be paid.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if we were to pay our Ministers the salary that they would get if they were not in politics, a survey would show that most of the Ministers were not getting the salary set by the benchmark. Most of them were not even getting $20,000 per month before they entered politics. How do you square out in that fashion? I can understand that if a Minister, before entering politics, was getting $30,000, but on entering politics he was getting $20,000, there is a sacrifice of $10,000. But as I stated earlier, most of the Ministers, before entering politics, were not even drawing between $15,000 and $20,000. After entering politics, they are now getting $65,000. Where is the sacrifice? It is a very peculiar situation here. In fact, with the pay increase, Ministers' pay is increased four to five times.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> How do you get four to five times?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> For example, before the last increment, the Prime Minister's salary was $30,000-odd, of course, with bonuses thrown in. Bonuses were variable. They were not sure whether they would get it or not. But now the Prime Minister is definitely sure of getting the bonus. It is not variable any more. It is fixed. So he is getting $96,000. Does the increase not come to 3 - 5 times?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government bemoans the fact that the low salary of the Ministers would not be able to attract people to the rank of Ministers. But I think all of you are aware of the fact that the attraction to politics is not merely salary alone. Similarly, you have Ministers and Administrative Officers who have left the service. I am quite sure they left the service not because of salary alone. There are other factors for them to decide to leave the service. I am quite sure that salary is not the only factor that decides why people leave.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the title of the White Paper - Competitive Salaries for Competent and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Honest Government. To me, it would suggest that only good salary would attract competent and honest Ministers. Look at countries around us - the United States, Japan - all their leaders were paid below $30,000 a month. Then you have the Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand - they were all paid below $20,000 a month. Yet at every election they attracted talented people to stand for election. Why? I do not think money is the only reason. Why do you have all the people coming back in spite of the low salary? In fact, the person most admired by Singapore was the former Prime Minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Why did she enter politics despite the fact that she was being paid about $18,000 a month? So it is quite obvious that it is not the money alone.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important factor is this. Everyone of you here, when you entered politics, you entered with your eyes open. You know what you would get by way of salary. You cannot now be heard to say, "Oh, I am not paid enough. I want to increase my salary." Imagine for a moment, if every employee in Singapore, after signing a contract, knowing the nature of his work, knowing how much he would be paid, he says, "Sorry, I am not paid enough. Please increase my salary." Can he be allowed to do that? He cannot, because he is an employee. But here we are faced with Ministers who are employers themselves. They decide for themselves. It is as simple as that.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other proposition would be this. If you think that you can make more money in the private sector, is there anything to prevent you from resigning and going over the other side and make more money? There is nothing to prevent anyone of you here from doing so. Why are you now coming to Parliament to tell us, "Oh, I am underpaid", and all these things, despite the fact that you get so much pay. Resign and go over the other side! Similarly, as has been said earlier, some of the Administrative Officers left the service because they feel they can get more money in the private sector. The Ministers can always follow suit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that while the Ministers are getting their pay increase, the people
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> get a pay decrease in the sense that everything has gone up. Radio licence fee has gone up, COE price has gone up, GST, and so on. Indirectly, their take-home pay is lower. On the one hand, you increase your salary but, on the other hand, the lower income group is getting less money. It is a myth that the present leadership is indispensable, and that no better leaders can be had. It is also sad that most of our leaders say that when they first joined politics they had an ideal, they had a conviction, they had a sense of mission and sacrifice. In mid-stream, they made a turn-about. Let us not desecrate this time-hallowed tradition of mission, of service and sacrifice to the nation. Remember what the late President Kennedy said: Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Bernard Chen (Brickworks GRC):</b> Sir, before I start, I want to dissociate myself from the comments of the previous Member. Obviously, he does not know what a CEO's job is and I do not think he knows what the Minister does either. I think I have the fortune of being in all three places. I can tell him that what the Prime Minister said about getting the best people is the first priority.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the business of Government, I think we all know, is getting very complex. With rapid economic and social development over the last two decades, we have covered all the easy things. We have done everything that we could do easily. Since about five years ago, we are encountering more and more difficulties, whether it is traffic control, COEs, rising health cost, or creating a second wing to get export markets and overseas investment opportunities. Just as in private corporations which need the best to manage them in times of difficulties, Singapore needs to be manned by the best Ministers and the civil servants we can get. There is no quarrel that there is a sound argument for Government's proposal to try to match the pay in the public sector to the comparable counterparts in the private sector because they are drawing from the same pool. We cannot fault the argument that running
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Singapore is any different from managing a large business enterprise. We need the best in both.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, one substantial difference that needs to be taken into account. In the private sector, accountability is direct. The Chief Executive's performance is measured directly by the level of profits he can achieve. Should profits decline or, worse, should losses be incurred, he can get the sack. He shoulders total responsibility for the corporation. Sometimes, tolerant directors may give him some time to redeem himself. More often than not, he may get the marching orders and has to look for another job. Unlike the public sector, there are very much less opportunities for transfer within the corporation. There is no safe haven for those who do not perform to be transferred to places where they cannot do any harm.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Chief Executive's remuneration package is often tied to the profitability of the corporation. In good times, he gets more. In bad times, he gets paid considerably less. This happens even when the corporation's decline in profits has nothing to do with him but takes place because of external factors completely outside his control. World recession is no excuse in having lower turnovers. Similarly, losses in investments in countries with wars are not to be blamed for business failures. The Chief Executive's remuneration, therefore, can fluctuate substantially as there are not that many corporations which can sustain their profitability over a long stretch of time. One can probably say that the top three earners in one year will not be the same in the following year. This is an important consideration. If we were to peg the civil service to the best in the private sector in any given year, we are in fact assuming that there are no downsides, which is not the real situation in the private sector as incomes of individuals fluctuate according to their fortunes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question before us therefore is if senior civil servants and Ministers are to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> be paid the same remuneration as the best in the private sector, should they also not be subjected to the same accountability? While we can accept that yardsticks for measuring performance in the public sector may not be as specific as those in the private sector, I believe that we should at least try to have an evaluation system that approximates the private sector practice as far as possible. As an example, when the salaries of certain grades are revised on a service wide basis, all officers in that grade enjoy the revision. In other words, individual performance is not taken into account. It is only during promotion exercises that the officer's performance becomes relevant. We should have a performance evaluation system that can take into account his performance for the year. If the officer's performance is outstanding, he should get more than average increase. Conversely, if he performs badly, he should take a pay cut. If he really makes a mess of it, he should be fired. This may sound extreme. But if we were to equate apples with apples, we should also match conditions in the public sector to those in the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the private sector, individual performance is set according to targets laid down by the board and this is the basis for assessing pay increases. This direct accountability puts considerable stress on those occupying senior positions. I can assure the House that this stress can be very substantial. Members will know that I sell cars in my part-time job. My managers have begun to call me COE, instead of CEO, especially on the 15th of each month when the COE prices are about to come up. This stress makes the officer's career a very dangerous one. The fear of not achieving budgeted targets and, worse, losing his job more often than not spurs him to work harder and smarter and that is what he is paid for.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector is more protected in this regard and I think the rice bowl is probably more metallic. Firing someone in the private sector is much easier than the public sector. Committees of inquiry have to be convened and they have to establish
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the cause for dismissal which may take months and, eventually, the cases may fizzle out.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would think that if we were to accord the same remuneration to the senior civil servants and Ministers, we will have to equalise the treatment in all respects. This should include a performance evaluation system that will reward the best performers. I am glad that the Prime Minister has commented that the civil service is now undergoing some changes and that Personnel Boards are being convened to look after the respective services. A very important part of the job of these Boards would be to assess who are the good performers and who are not the performers and make the promotion and revision of salary decisions accordingly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to ensure that the ablest people are put to run the Government and the civil service which means that those who do not measure up should be removed. In a speech to the civil servants at the Victoria Theatre on 26th October 1965, the then Prime Minister, Mr Lee, stressed the need to improve the efficiency of the civil service. He made the point that only the good performers should be rewarded with promotions. Automatic promotions were out and officers who thought they could get to the top without working for it, as he put it, should stop dreaming and get to work. It has been 30 years now and I think these admonitions still hold true. One may wonder how come nothing much was done in the last 30 years to address this issue. Perhaps, we should accelerate the process.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way we can uphold the efficiency of the civil service is to make sure that the best are chosen to run it. Passengers should be discarded as they not only give the service a bad name, but also affect those who work hard to earn their keeps. In this way, top officers in the public sector can justify their treatment on par with the best in the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in perfect tune with the Prime Minister in his impassionate plea to have the best to run the Cabinet and the civil
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> service. But we have to convince the public that we do have the best when we pay them, and that the not-so-best, or the bad ones, are in fact removed from the service. Only then can we drive home the message that we run the best civil service and the best Cabinet in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, President Kennedy said, "Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country". Today, we are in Parliament for exactly the opposite reason. The Ministers are not telling Singaporeans what they can do for them but are asking Singaporeans to pay them more money. It is not that long ago in this House, in January this year, that Ministers' salaries were revised upwards to about $64,000 per month and the Prime Minister's salary to about $96,000 per month. With that kind of salaries, most Singaporeans thought that the Prime Minister and the Ministers were already overpaid but apparently they thought otherwise. Now the Prime Minister and the Ministers want even more pay. Why do the Ministers want so much money for? People are already saying that to be appointed a Minister is like touching a lottery.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we compare our Ministers' salaries with those of the other developed countries listed in the table, which I have instructed the Clerk to distribute to Members, you will note that our Ministers earn about 2 1/2 times more than the President of the USA, 3 1/2 times more than the Australian Prime Minister, five times more than the Canadian Prime Minister, four times more than the Prime Minister of England, and nearly five times more than that of the Prime Minister of Sweden. If the Prime Ministers of those advanced countries can live on 1/5 to 1/4 of our Ministers' salaries, why should our Ministers ask for more pay?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can our Ministers justify their salaries when we take the American President's salary as a yardstick? The President of the USA is the Chief Executive of the country and is responsible for about 250 million people. Whereas a Minister in Singapore is not the Chief Executive of the country and there are only about 3 million
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> people in Singapore. Can we say that our Ministers shoulder more responsibility than that of the President of the USA, or they do more work? Surely not. Whatever way we look at it, it is just not right to pay our Ministers so much more than that of the President of the USA.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper says that Singapore needs to pay our Ministers high salaries to attract competent men, to compensate them for the loss of their privacy and to prevent them from becoming corrupt. These reasons are faulty.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that there are not enough competent men in Singapore who can qualify to be Ministers. The true position is that there are many good men out there who are of ministerial calibre. It is just that the PAP is unwilling to pick them for reasons of their own.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time, the High Court in Singapore was very short of Judges. There was a clamour to increase the appointment of more Judges. The Government gave the excuse that it was difficult to find suitable candidates from amongst practising lawyers to sit on the bench. What happened after that? The backlog of cases piled up. The Government relented. The Government in quick succession appointed the requisite quota of Judges from amongst practising lawyers. All those members of the bar in the past who were probably thought not suitable were elevated to the High Court bench and have since proven to be magnificent Judges.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government could do the same by inviting good professionals with a record of integrity to become Ministers. Most professionals would be highly flattered and honoured when invited to become Ministers and would probably accept the invitation. I would think that most of them may not want to be Ministers for life, that is, until retirement due to old age but would certainly not mind doing a two term or two-and-a-half term stint.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the selection of Ministers, the Government should open its doors wider, as it did in the case of the selection
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of Judges and all the Ministerial posts would be quickly filled, instead of the situation now where some of the Ministers are made to take care of two Ministries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the loss of privacy, I do not think that there would be a problem there. The Ministers are more than compensated in fringe benefits, such as, travelling in first class, staying in posh hotel suites, or have the opportunity to visit foreign lands. Ministers also meet dignitaries, kings, queens and heads of states and other famous personalities, which an ordinary person, even how rich he may be, may not be able to do so. What the Ministers lost in privacy are amply rewarded elsewhere and they need not be exorbitantly compensated in terms of high salary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for corruption, I think the Government, after nearly 30 years in power, is now experienced enough, especially after the unfortunate appointment of past corrupt Ministers, like Tan Kia Gan, Wee Toon Boon and the late Teh Cheang Wan, not to appoint anyone who has the propensity to be corrupt. In any event, financial incentives cannot prevent a Minister from being corrupt. If a Minister is intent on being corrupt, the hefty salary will not satisfy him. It will make him only more greedy for more money. The high salary paid to him will allow him to enjoy a high standard of living, such as living in a nice house and purchase expensive cars which can be a veil of his ill-gotten money, if he were to be corrupt. So the argument that you pay a Minister well will prevent him to be corrupt is quite fallacious.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that the Government should pay Ministers peanuts, neither am I advocating exorbitant salaries to make them millionaires once they are appointed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still believe that political leadership is a calling. Political leadership posts should not be turned into lucrative jobs. By turning those posts into lucrative jobs, we are not going to attract people motivated by a calling but people who are attracted to politics because of money.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of setting benchmarks for Ministers' salaries based on the top four
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> highest private sector earnings in banking and amongst accountants, engineers, lawyers, CEOs of manufacturing companies and multi-national companies is objectionable. In principle, it is wrong. Ministers must at intervals of time come back to Parliament to ask for and justify their pay increases and also for the pay they are receiving. This principle of accountability of the Ministers in respect of their salaries must never be taken away. The day it is taken away, the seeds of corruption would have been sown.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we know for sure that once a benchmark, as proposed, has been set, the Ministers will not engineer to make sure that they get hefty pay increases every year by encouraging the private sector to increase the pay of its CEOs? After all, many of the big companies such as privatised Telecom and SIA are Government controlled. Also, many of the big manufacturing companies, banks and multi-nationals have close connections with the Government, as they can be influenced. If Ministers believe generally that they deserve pay increases and can justify them, what is there to be embarrassed or feel uncomfortable about. They should not be afraid to come to Parliament to ask for those pay increases. And if Ministers feel that it is not proper for them to canvass for their own pay increases which, in my view, is indeed not proper for Ministers to be asking for their own pay increases, they could get Government MPs or, even better still, get Backbenchers to do it for them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way is to get an independent committee, like the National Wages Council, which determines workers' wages, to study and recommend from time to time how much Ministers' salary increases should be. Anyway, I think it is improper for Ministers to be asking for salary scales which would make them millionaires more than two times over in one term of office.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers promote Asian values and Confucian teachings. Perhaps the Ministers in their more sombre moments, should take notice that Confucian teachings hold up yao and shan as models for other rulers to follow. They were
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> unselfish and public spirited and believed that the position of the ruler should not be a source of wealth and personal benefit. I do not recommend that Ministers make big personal sacrifices like the Confucian models, neither do I advocate hefty pay increases as recommended in the White Paper.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am recommending is based on the principle that the Ministers' job is a calling. It is a public service and cannot be anything else. If the Minister's post is going to be another highly paid job, how can Ministers have the moral authority to lead the country? How can our Ministers be role models? How can they preach against materialism and warn of the decay of society once it wallows in materialism? The founders of modern Singapore preached against materialism. They called on the people to practise thrift, to sacrifice and to do hard work. Mr Lee Kuan Yew himself took a pay cut. That may have been the catalyst to Singapore's success.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proper thing to do is not to peg the Minister's salary to those in the private sector, but to determine an amount objectively which will provide Ministers with a comfortable lifestyle. I have assessed that a Minister can lead a comfortable lifestyle if he were paid $32,800. I have asked the Clerk to circulate my assessment to Members.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the quantum assessed, I think it is fair to add 25% more to cover for any unforeseen circumstances or contingencies and a further $10,000 to pay for the Minister's income tax, if any. The final amount paid to the Ministers shall be about $51,000. I think that is a very fair assessment. In fact, it is on the generous side.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Prime Minister's pay, a 25% premium over and above a Minister's salary shall be given and it is at $63,750 a month. This follows the precedent developed in advanced countries where the Prime Ministers are normally paid about 25% more than their Ministers. It is all in my table.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a practising lawyer. In the course of my work, I need to assess the monthly maintenance given to a spouse or to a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> child. I also do work in assessment on how much an injured person can get. All lawyers also need to assess the cost they should be paid. In those types of work of assessment as a lawyer, I have to be objective. I do not just pluck figures from the air. Accordingly, I dare say that when I assess the Minister's pay, I have been objective in doing so. The $51,000 a month salary for a Minister and $63,750 a month for the Prime Minister are, I would say, fair salaries for them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would ask whether the Ministers and Prime Minister accept those salaries respectively. I wish they could give me an answer today. If not, please let me know the reasons for not accepting them.

  <!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Mohammed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Zulkifli bin Mohammed (Jalan Besar GRC)</b>(
  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, like my PAP parliamentary colleagues, I support the principles and recommendations contained in the White Paper.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it was released about 10 days ago, there has been a fair amount of reservations and cynicism among the general population. This is apparent in the arguments of the Opposition Members who are not in touch with reality. For the general population, their reservations arise from the perception that the benchmarks recommended are excessive and not commensurate with the tasks and responsibilities of Ministers since, as senior public officers, Ministers are already enjoying perks and privileges to compensate for their personal and financial sacrifices. As far as I know and I believe many know too, the true situation is far different from what many perceived it to be.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, it is regretful that there is still such negative talk, including from the highly-educated, who should be more discerning and rational, given the fact that this is not a new issue but has been debated I think for almost a decade now, only more thoroughly so in the recent years. But the fact remains that
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> there will be no end to the cynicism because most politically-related issues appeal more to the emotions than to logic no matter how much information and explanations are given. A short while ago, we have heard the Prime Minister reiterating the rationale and the philosophy behind the recommendations of the White Paper.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, it is essential that the people do not lose sight of the philosophy behind the White Paper. They need to understand that this is an issue of national importance, as already explained at length, and that this concerns the question of ensuring competent political leadership to ensure a good government. Surely, it is not difficult for people to understand that there is a nexus between their own future and having honest and competent people in government. In this regard, our Prime Minister has repeatedly said that the Government's policies and actions, as decided by the Cabinet, will determine whether Singapore continue to survive and prosper, with its people able to enjoy quality of life, or go downhill, which will result in misery and suffering.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the crux of the matter is to ensure that people of calibre from each generation join politics and thereafter become Ministers. It is upon the shoulders of the Ministers to protect what we have achieved so far and it is also upon the shoulders of the Ministers that we place the task of continuing the process of improvements and renewal in the future. It would be irresponsible of us to ignore the reality that it is becoming increasingly difficult today to attract our best talents to go into Government against the scenario of a buoyant economy, both domestically and externally, with salaries in the private sector far outstripping salaries in the public sector. If we do not want our bureaucracy to deteriorate, we have no option but to be competitive with the market. Bringing the salary levels of our civil servants closer to market levels is the right thing to do.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my view, the recommendations in the White Paper are pragmatic, as adequate research and preparations have been done in the search for a long-term
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> solution for salary adjustments for Ministers and senior public officers. In this connection, a relevant question to be asked is: is the recommended formula transparent and accountable? Not many people realise that this is in fact one of the main objectives of the White Paper, ie, to enable the majority of Singaporeans to see and judge for themselves the details of how and what Ministers are paid. In my view, the benchmarks recommended are reasonable as they are still below private sector levels. Furthermore, the proposed salary revision will be done gradually over a period of three years and beyond. Although I can go along with the proposal for a one-third discount for the Ministers' benchmark as recommended, what the people should remember is that there are aspects of the Minister's job for which it is difficult to draw a comparison, such as the political responsibility of persuading and carrying people along to support unpopular and painful policies which are for the long-term good of the country.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like everything else that is new, we must give an opportunity for the formula to be implemented and tested. I also support my colleague's suggestion that the White Paper be discussed thoroughly before we come to a decision. What the people also want to see is the Government's assurance that should the scenario change, the formula to be implemented can be adjusted accordingly. This is very important if we want to avoid this issue being manipulated by irresponsible parties. We have witnessed how this point can be manipulated just a while ago. Although recommendations have been made, we have to wait and see whether we can draw potential candidates to enter politics and take part in managing Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am also of the view that it is equally important to find more effective ways to raise the political awareness of our people, in particular the younger generation, so that more of them will get involved in the political process and become politicians in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, on this note, I support the recommendations of the White Paper.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have three major comments on the White Paper.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I agree that it is imperative for Singapore to continue recruiting top talent into the public service. I agree that good Government is important for any country. It is particularly important for a small country like Singapore, which has relied on its ability to do things, and to do them well to succeed economically. A sound macro-economic environment, telephones which work, airports which are hassle-free - these are all part of what makes Singapore tick, especially a successful regional business hub. Although salaries are not everything, I do agree with the rationale that those who hold public office should be paid well. It does help to keep the system honest and transparent.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I agree with the rationale of benchmarking salaries. Better a system of benchmarking than large adjustments every four, five years which cause unhappy ripples in the private sector and the population at large.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I have, however, a number of questions regarding how the benchmarking is done, or the methodology of benchmarking, and its consequences. The White Paper is very well written. I must commend the civil servants who did quite a bit of the work in writing the White Paper under the supervision, of course, of the Ministers. It shows that considerable thought has gone into making the case for benchmarking. I am sure that much more analyses have been done than what has been presented. I would only wish that some of these analyses which are not in the White Paper could be shared with the public at large. Four questions remain in my mind after reading the White Paper.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First question: Why make the benchmarks person-based, ie, the average of the top four persons, or the 15th person of age 32? Please allow me to give an example. Suppose that in Year 1, individuals A, B, C and D are the top four in one of the six professions. Suppose that their average base salary is $500,000. They choose to exercise their stock options
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that year, and gain an average of, say, $1 million. This makes their average income $1.5 million for that year. Suppose that the following year, these same individuals - A, B, C, D - do not exercise any more stock options. Their average salary goes down to $500,000, which is their base salary. But another group of four individuals - W, X, Y and Z - who have an average base salary of $450,000 and therefore were not among the top four in Year 1, now exercise their share options and gain $900,000. This pushes their salaries up to $1.35 million, and they become the new top four in their profession. The benchmark therefore moves from $1 million in Year 1 to $1.35 million in Year 2. But the average salary of A, B, C and D over two years is $1 million, and that of W, X, Y and Z is $900,000 over the two years. Over a longer period of time, these salaries are likely to be even less, depending on the extent to which share options are given and exercised.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar example can also be given for profit-sharing, or profit-related bonuses of senior partners in professional firms. One unusually large, plum job can cause profits and profit-related bonuses to jump. In other words, stock options and profit-related bonuses can cause salaries to rise to very high levels in certain years, which may not be representative of the average over time for these same individuals. If the idea is to benchmark public officials' salaries with those of the top people in the private sector, then taking the average of the top four in six professions, or 15th person, would result in an over-estimation of these salaries, as these top four could be different individuals in every year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please allow me then to put forward an alternative proposal for consideration. Instead of a person-based benchmark, why not use a percentile-based benchmark? For example, take the top 10th percentile for Ministers, and top 20th percentile of persons aged 32 for Superscale G officers. At this point, I must say that I am hard put actually to recommend a specific percentile without sufficient figures in front of me. Is it top ten? Is it top 15? Is it top 20? To me, that really depends
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> on what the figures are like and because I do not have them here, it is difficult to pinpoint a certain number. The important thing is the principle of percentile-based benchmarking instead of person-based benchmarking.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A percentile-based system is used by Hay Management Consultants, a well-known human resource consultancy firm which has 100 offices in 30 countries. Twice every year, they conduct a survey of top management salaries over 90 large companies in Singapore. They evaluate the jobs of CEOs and senior management, determine their job sizes. For the job of a CEO of a company which sells only one product in the Singapore market is quite different from the job of a CEO which oversees multi-product operations in the entire Asia Pacific region. And hence their job grades. This is in order to compare apples with apples in terms of job grades. They then determine salaries for each job grade, and publish the overall results. Companies choose whether to peg their salaries at the top 10th percentile, top 25th percentile, or at the median, the 50th percentile.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also given to understand that in Singapore, a group of about 10-20 large companies get together on a regular basis to share salary information. Each company then decides where they want to be. One company decides to be a market leader and to peg its salaries within the top 10th percentile. Another company may decide to peg its salaries at the 50th percentile.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In both of these examples, which are actually used in Singapore in the market, percentile-based benchmarks are used. The percentile-based benchmark is broader. It uses a larger sample and is therefore less affected by outliers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A related point is regarding the base for benchmarking. Conceptually speaking, there are two types of benchmarking basis that can be used. The first, pertaining to Ministers, is what the person would have earned if he or she were still in his or her previous occupation. By using this base benchmark would result in individualised salary schemes for each Minister, and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> might result in large differences across Ministers. I think that is very unsatisfactory. The second concept, which is the concept used in the White Paper, is to adopt the nearest private sector equivalent. I agree with this conceptual approach. If percentile-based benchmarking is adopted, I have less reservations with the use of the base of six professions. But since a Minister's or civil servant's responsibility is closest to that of corporate management, why not use only those in corporate management as a base for benchmarking? For example, the ministerial benchmark could be the top 10th percentile of all local Executive Chairmen and CEOs, including managing partners of professional firms. I would like to add here that my point is not so much against $800,000 for Ministers. Ministers can be paid a million dollars, $1.5 million. I think the point is that in terms of benchmarking, let us choose as accurate a benchmark as possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second question: What happens if there is an economic slow-down and private sector salaries, which have a large profit-related component, decline? Will Ministers and public officers' pay also decline? If so, then we could have the anomalous situation that, because of the two-year lag, the decline comes at a time when there is economic recovery, and Ministers and public officers' salaries fall when their counterparts' salaries rise. Think of 1985 and 1987, for example. Or their salaries register a significant increase in a recession year (1985) because the benchmark was 1983 when Singapore was doing well. One way around this, given that the two-year lag is inevitable, is to take a two-year or three-year moving average to smoothen out year-to-year fluctuations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third question: What are the macro-economic consequences of the proposed benchmarking? I can think of two. The first is domestic. Currently, top public sector salaries lag behind those in the private sector. With the implementation of benchmarking, the short-term catching up process will cause average executive salaries to rise even if private sector salaries remain the same. But the question
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> is: will private sector salaries rise eventually because of benchmarking? There is only a limited pool of the best and the brightest who are wanted by both the Government and the private sectors. Will benchmarking cause a ratcheting upwards of executive salaries in Singapore? Will there be an increased demand for cars, property and other high-income goods, causing prices of these goods to rise? Will there be a high-end wage-price spiral? I would feel more assured if we could have the Government's assurance that there will not be any significant competitive ratcheting up effect on senior management salaries, nor an ensuing high-end wage-price spiral.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another possible related macro-economic effect, and that is, on our competitiveness. I asked some MNCs in Singapore for some comparative statistics of managerial salaries. These make for some of the best international comparisons, for MNCs have offices worldwide, and they have standardised job grades and are able to compare salaries with the same job grade. One MNC showed me a comparison of 1994 salaries for a division manager - roughly someone who has been 10-15 years with the company and is a good performer. In nominal terms, the Singapore salary (base salary plus bonus) is higher than that in Germany and th US; about double that in Australia. In fact, Singapore is the second highest on the list after Japan. In another company, a leading US MNC in the computer industry, a Singapore senior manager is paid, in nominal terms, higher than his American and Australian counterparts, but lower than those in Hong Kong, Japan and Germany. There are, of course, many difficulties with international comparisons, but these are rough figures. Singapore's middle and senior management salaries, even when compared with those of developed countries, are already not low. The comparison with developing countries is even more stark. The fact is, as some tell me, that Singapore's salary curve is steep by international comparison. This is in part reflective of the scarcity of top talent in Singapore. My question is: will benchmarking - and the public sector is Singapore's largest
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> employer, I believe even for senior positions - have a negative impact on competitiveness? Or will benchmarking, by enhancing good Government, have a net beneficial impact?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth question: This pertains to the Administrative Officers. Salaries are an important, but not the only determinant of job attractiveness. There are only so many Permanent Secretary posts, so many CEO positions of statutory boards. A top-grade person aims eventually to be at the top of his or her organisation. The provision of challenging, attractive jobs with decision-making empowerment is a major challenge for the civil service. Does the Government have such plans? I am glad to know from the Prime Minister today that the Government indeed does.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, allow me to reiterate my three main comments. I support the rationale for paying Ministers and senior civil servants well in order to keep public service attractive. I agree with the rationale for benchmarking. I have, however, four questions regarding how the benchmarks are formulated and what their consequences are. I hope that these questions can be answered, and the benchmarks fine-tuned. I know that many of these questions have already been examined within Government. I wish that the Government would share their further thoughts with us on this process.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Charles Chong (Eunos GRC):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate on the motion moved by the Prime Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the newly appointed NMP who spoke before me on a very well-delivered maiden speech and I am sure Members will look forward to hearing more such speeches.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the principle that competitive wages must be paid to Ministers and civil servants if the Government has to compete with the private sector for talent. However, I am not completely convinced that just by paying higher and higher wages we will always be assured
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of competent and honest Government. The title of the White Paper "Competitive Salaries for Competent and Honest Government" appears to imply that we will get competent and honest Ministers and civil servants if only we pay competitive wages. Even the World Bank Report quoted in the White Paper, and repeated by the Prime Minister, that Singapore bureaucrats are perceived to be the region's most competent and upright because they are paid the best, appears to be an over-simplification. If that was indeed the case, then I think we should not limit Ministers' salaries to just two-thirds the average income of certain professionals in the private sector. Neither should we limit the salary of Superscale Grade G officers to the 15th position of private sector professionals. Why not be doubly sure of getting good Government by doubling the incomes of Ministers and civil servants compared to the private sector? With the budget surpluses we generate in most years, we can well afford to assure ourselves of good Government for several hundred years or more. The problem would easily be solved if money was the only issue involved in getting good people into Government. But, unfortunately, this may not be the case.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper does mention very briefly that salaries should never be the motivation for persons to become Ministers. However, it did not address non-monetary measures that could attract more talented people into Government. If the objective of the White Paper is to consider ways to ensure that Singapore will always have good people in Government, then it is equally essential that the non-monetary aspect be considered as well.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on civil servants, the White Paper mentions that the Administrative Service is the premier service in the civil service. It goes on to mention that the PSC, in recent years, has been recruiting only 10 to 12 officers per year from a cohort of 40,000 to 50,000. This statement implies that only the best 10 to 12 from each cohort are selected for the Administrative Service. I would like to ask if indeed the best of each cohort were
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> chosen, or was it the best 10 to 12 of only those that applied to join the Administrative Service that were chosen.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has already pointed out several examples where outstanding `A' level students did not apply or decline PSC scholarships. If that was the case, then in all probability there may have been better ones from each cohort that have slipped through the net. The Administrative Service should, therefore, not limit itself with promotions from just within its ranks. The best, as defined mainly by academic results at the beginning of their careers, need not necessarily remain the best after 10 years in their careers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service should consider taking in mid-career officers at every level not only from the public sector, but should also consider those that have established good track records in the private sector. If civil service officers aspire to have equivalent salaries to that of the private sector professionals, then they must be prepared to accept the same competition faced in the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private sector professionals face not only competition from other private sector professionals, but also from officers from the public sector trying to move into the private sector. In many areas, they also face international competition in the form of expatriate professionals. While I support that civil servants should be paid competitive salaries compared to the private sector, I also feel that they should not be insulated from the competition faced by their private sector counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of Ministers' salaries, I think a different approach other than just salaries may have to be considered as well. I notice with interest the increasing number of applications we have been receiving for NMPs since the scheme was started several years ago. While there has been no overwhelming rush of high calibre people with integrity, clamouring to get into Parliament as Ministers or as elected MPs, we do not appear to have the same problem with NMPs. I am aware that NMPs are not in Parliament for the sake of money. The amount they receive may
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> make even an elected Backbench appear to be slightly overpaid. So it is something more than just salary that attracts them into Parliament. Perhaps, it is the lack of onerous responsibilities that are carried by the Ministers or even the elected MPs in their constituencies. What could be more attractive than to be able to take part in the decision-making process, but not be held responsible or accountable to the electorate for these decisions. Whatever the attractions, money is not the main issue.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Ministers, on the other hand, carry heavy responsibilities, some of which have already been highlighted by the Prime Minister. They are also held responsible for their decisions. In many cases, they have to carry more than one portfolio. In one case, where there is no portfolio, the Minister is responsible for all the workers in Singapore. They are also not exempted from constituency and municipal responsibilities in their wards. And they must face the electorate every four to five years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps if some way could be found to lighten their burden, then we may create a situation where the talented and the honest would want to get into Parliament as Ministers and not as Nominated MPs. I, therefore, feel that we should consider not only the monetary issues if we really want to solve the problem of ensuring that Singapore always has good Ministers and that the electorate would be sophisticated enough to continue electing them into office. Until we can find such a solution, we should not add financial sacrifice as another obstacle in the way.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore support the principles set out in the White Paper. But I hope that it can be further refined before it becomes policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is nothing more likely to bring out the basest instincts of greed and envy than knowing what other people earn. How much to pay has been a thorny issue not just for politicians but for the private sector all over the world.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was listening very carefully to what the Prime Minister said and I found myself
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> agreeing with most of what he said. Most, but not all. It is true you cannot have cut price governments. Cut price government is incompetent government. And you cannot rely on pure altruism to get people to take on the very, very onerous duties, as Mr Chong has pointed out, of being an elected representative and being a Minister. I think it is unrealistic to expect that. In a country with 250 million people, maybe you can find enough altruists. In a country of 2 1/2 million people, I think we are putting too much in faith in altruism to expect people to come forward, if they are expected to make big sacrifices.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I part company with the White Paper is on the question of what is a big sacrifice and what is a competitive salary. How much should be paid? If we look at the White Paper, the first question that comes to my mind is: Who drafted this? Can I take it that it was drafted by civil servants? Am I right? Is it drafted by civil servants? Because if it is drafted by civil servants, then we have a bit of credibility problem, have we not? If we look at page 13, last paragraph, for example, it says that "A good Administrative Officer will easily rank among the top 15 in his cohort in terms of ability." Who says so? Is it the civil service that says so? Is it the Administrative Service that says so? Is this a statement of fact? Or is this a statement of ideals that we are trying to achieve? I think a lot of people would be much happier with the White Paper if we knew that this White Paper came from an objective external source and was not just what the civil service thinks they should be paid. I think that is the nub of many people's concern with this kind of thing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there would be people who would begrudge salary increases because of envy, because of political ideals, or because of idealism. But I am not one of them. I do not envy the Ministers their pay, I do not envy them their job. I know how hard they work. I know how hard the elected politicians work as well. When we look at something like this, we are asked
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to make a decision on the basis of incomplete information in a sense. Because we do not really know what other possibilities there are.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why the top 24 people? Why were these 24 people taken? It is an arbitrary figure. Why the top 15th person in that cohort? It is an arbitrary figure too. I think the approach taken by the White Paper is to look at how much the top professionals earn and say that Ministers should earn just as much. I am not sure that that is the right question to ask. Is it really the right question to ask yourself how many people are earning more than you in your cohort? I am not really sure that that is the right question that we want to ask.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the right question that we should ask is: Are we paying enough to our Ministers and to our civil servants so that they can maintain a decent, comfortable lifestyle? When you talk about sacrifice, there is a world of difference between the lifestyle of a person who earns $50,000 a year and a person who earns $250,000 a year. But there is not that great difference in quality between someone who earns $500,000 a year and $750,000 a year. Because once you get beyond a certain absolute level of pay, the extra money that you get is just savings. Unless you have extremely extravagant tastes, how many cars can you drive? How many houses do you want? How many country clubs do you want to join? So really the question I think that we should be asking ourselves on the present salary that we are paying Ministers is: are they really being asked to compromise their style of life?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We look at the entry level for Ministers, in round figures, $600,000 a year. Let me just get a bit of information, if I may, from the Cabinet. How many Ministers feel that on $600,000 a year, they cannot live a decent lifestyle? That they cannot pay their mortgage on $600,000 a year? Any Minister having difficulty buying a car on $600,000 a year? How about paying for their children's education? They cannot afford a holiday abroad? I do not think any reasonable person can say that $600,000 a year does not give him a decent lifestyle.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if we start from the premise that $600,000 already is a good figure, does it really matter to any Minister that his peers could be earning twice or three times that? Does it really matter? This is what I am asking. Because if it really matters to someone, should he really be a Minister? Should he just go out into private practice and satisfy his craving for material things? I am not sure we are doing the right thing by encouraging this constant comparison with other people. You know that if you go into certain jobs, that there is a trade off in terms of pay. But if the pay is high enough, the trade off in terms of lifestyle is not so great.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to Dr Lee Tsao Yuan's speech with great interest because she provides an alternative to the benchmarking here. I do not think many people will quarrel with the principle that Ministers' pay should go up and down with the private sector's pay. That public sector employees' pay should go up and down with the private sector. I think what bothers most people, what makes it difficult for people to accept the recommendations of the White Paper, is the level at which these salaries are pegged. If we say that $600,000 is a fair figure, let us use that as a base. Calculate an index based on the salaries of, say, the top 50 CEOs in Singapore, the top 100 professionals, or whatever you like. Call that base 100. Calculate the index every year. If the index goes up by, say, 10% next year, then move your salary up from the base of $600,000. But do not peg it at an arbitrary proportion of what you think the private sector would get.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not an economist. I do this just off the top of my head. It may not be practical. It may not be acceptable. This is the problem. We do not have enough information. It would be valuable if we could see what sort of alternatives and if we could have figures to show us what these alternatives are.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about the public sector pay, not Ministers' pay, one of the problems with public sector pay, being pegged at private sector rates, as has been pointed out by many of the hon. Members from the private sector, is that the public sector does not function exactly
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the same way. If you want private sector pay, you should be subject to private sector discipline. A CEO in the private sector is running up a sand dune. If he stops running, he starts sliding back. There is no such thing as sitting down and watching the world go by.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A public servant is more like climbing a tree. Once you get to a certain branch, you could sit down and you could admire the view. And unless you do something really stupid, nobody is going to push you off the branch. That is the problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trouble is that people do know Superscale officers. I know several. I am sure everybody knows several. There are many Superscale officers who are worth every penny we pay them and more. But there are also some Superscale officers who do not deserve even the money that you pay them. In the public sector which does not demote and does not fire, does not sanction people for inefficiency, you get the tendency for people to cruise after they reach a certain level. You get a situation where someone has reached Superscale and thinks, "OK, I am happy now. I don't have to do anything more. I really don't want to be a Permanent Secretary. It is all right. I do the bare minimum so as not to be sacked."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deadwood will accumulate. Do we have any assurance that this deadwood will not be there forever. I think I would be much happier with this if we could have some assurance that if there are going to be increases in public sector pay, there will not be indiscriminate increases so that every Superscale H officer gets it regardless of whether the fellow is still performing or whether he stopped performing years ago when he reached Superscale H.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large proportion of any increase will have to be performance related, so that if a person thinks that he can stop and start cruising until retirement, his pay will be cut. There should be no such thing as deadwood taking advantage of the fact that in the public sector, people very rarely get demoted, very rarely get sacked, for inefficiency. They get transferred to places where they cannot cause trouble, but they still draw their salary. That is the problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final word about all this. Since we are so keen on private sector comparisons, may I point out that the board of directors of a company does not set its own pay for obvious reasons. It does not set its own pay. The prerogative of setting the pay for the board of directors belongs to the shareholders.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle in this White Paper is a very important one because it sets the tone for our public service, for our Ministers, for years to come. I think it is important enough that the shareholders of Singapore Incorporated should have something to say to this. May I suggest, not just a Select Committee, that this is important enough to go to the public on a referendum.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking in this House, in a sense, is preaching to the converted, because all of us know what kind of sacrifices are made. But for the average person, there is a certain amount of resentment. From my conversations with various people, there is enormous resistance to the idea of paying so much. The danger of creating the impression that the top slice of the Mandrinate is promoting itself and paying itself is that you create cynicism about the leadership. You create cynicism about the people who are governing and running the country. This cynicism is not healthy at all, because it may translate into a backlash against meritocracy. The idea that everyone is equal is very seductive, enormously seductive. And if the average person feels that it is a small group at the top that are paying themselves very well and picking the same type of people, scholar-types, good 'O' levels, good 'A' levels, paying themselves, you might get this kind of backlash against meritocracy which would be disastrous for all of us.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you really want legitimacy for this kind of thing, may I humbly suggest that we have a referendum. Then we will settle the question once and for all. Give people a series of alternatives, but at least the problem will have been debated, the people will have chosen, the matter will have been solved, hopefully. If this White Paper is reasonable, then I think we
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> should have some faith in the common sense of the average Singaporean. If most people consider it unreasonable, then to put it through Parliament will not silence the grumblers. It will not silence the cynics. It will only give ammunition to those who say that we are being run by a group of very highly paid people who do not understand the concerns of the average citizen. This is what is going to happen. May I say once again that if we are interested in private sector comparisons - the directors do not set their own pay, the shareholders set the pay - put it to a referendum.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Imram bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Imram bin Mohamed (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to express my views on the White Paper.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I do not disagree with the principle of setting benchmarks for Ministerial and senior public officials' pay, I feel very uncomfortable with the proposed formula which pegs their salaries so precisely to the few top earners in the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the salary proposal will send confusing messages to the masses. On the one hand, the public were told that they should make only moderate claims for wage rises. These should trail productivity increases so that Singapore can remain competitive. On the other hand, the public are now told that for the same reason, the Ministers' salaries must be increased by leaps and bounds. The explanation offered is that Ministers must be paid their market worth. If this can apply to Ministers, why should it not apply to others too? A taxi driver would question why he is not allowed to vary his charges to market conditions. For instance, during festive seasons or at other times where there is a high demand for taxis, he should be able to up his fare.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general public will not be able to understand why we need to pay top dollars to attract or retain Ministers. Ministers are already receiving comfortable salaries. Besides, the job carries with it many other tangible and intangible benefits. For example, the level of prestige associated with the position can hardly
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> be matched by any top jobs in the private sector. If, in spite of all this, people still turn away from the job, it must be for reasons beyond money or perks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Ministers are leaders of our nation. Theirs is a noble profession. And as the White Paper states, salaries should never be the motivation for persons to become Ministers. Ministers' salaries are already high by any standard. We may be doing harm to the value of public service by further equating it to high monetary rewards. We need to guard against a possible erosion to the sense of pride and dignity in public service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from being an economic leader, our political leaders are looked upon to also provide strong moral leadership. This aspect of the leadership role is important, as high moral values are indeed crucial to the long-term success of a nation. And one value that our leaders could help instil in our young is that good moral leadership cannot be bought.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Administrative Service, the Government intends to recruit bright graduates into the civil service. I agree that we need to pay salaries comparable to the private sector in order to attract these young people. However, to peg their income at age 32 to the 15th position in the six professions in the private sector may be overly generous.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector works under a different set of rules from the public sector. Monetary rewards may not reflect academic excellence. The brightest graduate who joins the private sector will not necessarily become the top earner at age 32 or at other points in his career.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the objectives of this exercise is to retain talent within the Administrative Service. However, will it work totally? Good public officers, after having served in Government departments and having established a wide network of contacts, would be worth a great deal to the private sector. The latter will be willing to match whatever salary they are getting. Therefore, attrition of some of these people is inevitable and Government should prepare for it in some other way.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I feel the benchmark salary should be derived from a broader base, rather than be narrowly fixed to the 15P 32I, as suggested. We could perhaps consider the top, say, 5% earnings of all the eligible professionals rather than from a limited number of professions. This should give a more realistic measure of the top earners.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Bedok GRC):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the reason we are discussing this issue of benchmarks in salaries for Ministers is because of the conviction we share that competent political leadership is crucial to good government. While some may disagree on the basis of benchmarking, it is my belief, after discussions with many, that our Ministers are well respected for their abilities and integrity. Many share the feeling that they are deserving of better salaries for their scope of work responsibilities and sacrifices.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has mentioned that no Minister has asked for a salary increase. However, when it comes to benchmarking, there are many different approaches and views. Often, after some discussions, one finds that we are actually not at all discussing an issue based on the same parameters. We are not comparing apple with apple. The discussion is far from objective. Why the difficulty in this issue of salaries?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, for some, the absolute dollar value of a Minister's salary itself, some $600,000, now to be raised to $800,000 per annum, is difficult to imagine. This is because when this refers to the CEO of a multi-national company, the CEO is an abstract figure. However, when it comes to a Minister, a household name, or the MP-Minister that I have just met on Sunday, it becomes someone very real. You mean he is earning so much more than me? You mean he requires or he is deserving of such a hefty pay rise? Objectivity is lost and subjectivity sets in. We must realise this. Mr Ling How Doong must realise this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, when we refer to the value of a Minister, we often remember him as a candidate who first entered politics.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> For some, a decade ago; for others, many decades ago. Thus, a Minister is remembered as a former civil servant, a former Army officer or the professional or businessman that he was. So the benchmarking starts from that very point. If he had remained a civil servant, Army officer or businessman, would he command this salary today? This again is the rationale of Mr Ling How Doong. We forget that the candidate for first election 10-15 years ago has undergone a severe test on the job and is no longer that same person. The management, leadership and political skills acquired makes him the Minister he is today. He is very much a value added person.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the lack of empathy for the risks and public responsibilities of a political career. And I think that this is an area which has been under-emphasised in the White Paper. For obvious reasons, the White Paper and the Frontbench cannot elaborate too much or dwell on these issues because they may be seen to be "blowing their own trumpets". Therefore, it is difficult for the public to understand what this means in real terms - risks and public responsibilities. What is seen is that the Minister is a self-confident CEO, surrounded by competent civil servants, escorted by security officers, enjoying all the perks, pomp and pageantry at official functions. He is a person who is perceived to have a very secure job. Does he need to be so highly paid? After all, he seemingly enjoys his position, and his family also enjoys this. As Mr Ling has said, whenever he goes overseas, it is a paid trip. By the way, I did not compare notes with Mr Ling. It just happens that I seem to have hit on the same key point that he has hit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Ling has not mentioned the flip side of this image. If the Minister loses an election, he loses his job. He is not assessed by one boss - the Prime Minister - but by his whole electorate. For a single Member constituency, the candidate has some 25,000 to 30,000 assessors, and this is only at level one. At level two, he needs to satisfy the party cadre members that he has done a good job on a national basis. At level three,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> he needs to satisfy his parliamentary colleagues, and at level four he needs to satisfy the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. As the Prime Minister has said, in our system, the Minister sets the pace, not the civil service. Does the Minister have a secure job? Very, very far from it. As a friend told me, I think there are better ways to make a living. This, in reality, is what the White Paper refers to when it talks of risks. The Minister has a most insecure job. Besides his performance at the job, he has become literally public property with respect to the conduct of his personal life, and this also includes his nuclear and extended family.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of "public responsibilities of a political career", no other CEO's major decision is more transparent or more debated than that of a Minister. The Minister for National Development's policy on flat allocation as compared to that of the CEO of a real estate (even public-listed) company. The Minister for Health's hospital charges compared to that of the CEO of a private hospital or even a conglomerate. The COE policy of the Minister for Communications wins the challenge trophy in this respect! This is the meaning of "public responsibility" as compared to the decision-making responsibility of a CEO of a private or even a public-listed company. This is not to make a triviality of the importance of one against the other, but just to amplify on the meaning of the phrase "public responsibility of a political career".
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an even more sombre note, the failure of a political career as a Minister is even more fatal. This could be a loss at the polls (for a myriad of reasons) or a failure to have lived up to his expectations, or other personal failures. There is even less room for manoeuvre or readjustment. How will he re-shape his life? Has anyone any answers? This must be a lonely, difficult, narrow and steep hill to climb. I have no answer. This is the ultimate risk to bear. This is why the Prime Minister has said that civil servants may accept, but their wives object. It is my belief that as the public becomes more aware of these realities, the empathy will develop, and the issue of benchmarking them becomes easier.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, the job of a Minister is unique, and the demands on a Minister are also unique. There is no equivalent private sector comparison of the scope of the job, or the equivalent responsibility. Our whole nation's destiny is in the hands of these few to whom we have entrusted the affairs of state. Let us pause and reflect. The Government is responsible for building an infrastructure so that economic growth, social and cultural development, and ultimately a better life for all will be the result. Many nations and cities have faced the growing pains of an inadequate infrastructure. Others are unable to move into the next phase of development because of improper planning. The end result is a poorer standard of living for everyone. Is there a price that we can place for having this infrastructure? The Prime Minister has mentioned the cost of $17 million for the Cabinet. This is a mere cost of one secondary school.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, as long as there is a commitment to appoint the ablest and the best on the one hand, and there is no reason to doubt this, and there is a commitment by those appointed to serve selflessly for the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> common good on the other, and we have a track record of this, paying our Ministers better as laid out in the White Paper is easy to endorse. However, the people will be dissatisfied if their trust is misplaced.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.

   <b>EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN AND YOUNG PERSONS</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen</b> asked the Minister for Labour whether he will prohibit employers from employing students who are below 16 years old except where they have obtained consent from their parents and school principals.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most employers in Singapore do not employ workers below the age of 16. A minority such as fast food restaurants and retailers are known to have employed some school children during their school vacation. Such vacation work keeps students occupied in meaningful activities and provides them with a source of supplementary income. School children working during the school term are a small minority and they are mostly working during weekends or on public holidays. Some employers do require consent either in writing or verbally from underaged workers' parents notwithstanding that there is no legal requirement for them to do so. For example, Burger King, a fast food establishment, requires written parental consent.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employment of persons who are below the age of 16, including school children, is governed by the Employment Act and the Employment of Children and Young Persons Regulations. There are special provisions to protect such young workers. For example, the Regulations stipulate that when a young person aged between 14 and less than 16 years is attending school, the period of work plus the period of school attendance shall not in aggregate exceed seven hours in any one day. Young persons are also not allowed to work in any occupation or place of work or under working conditions that are likely to expose them to safety or health hazards.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the safeguards in our law and the fact that employers generally do obtain parental consent, my Ministry is of the view that there is no need to disallow employers from employing school children below the age of 16 unless the consent of their parents and school principals has been sought.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A post-office box number by itself cannot be used as an address on the label of a prepacked food product. This is specifically stated in the Food Regulations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full address needs to be given as this would allow officers of the Ministry of the Environment to go straight to the premises of the manufacturer, packer, importer, vendor, etc, without loss of time, to carry out any investigations. A post-office box number would not enable this to be done expeditiously.

  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there are 8 kerbside parking lots outside the Embassy and 12 parking lots within its compound. It is not possible to provide additional lots along the narrow road outside the Embassy. As the Embassy is in the midst of a residential estate, it has been advised to relocate its Embassy early, especially its Visa Issuing Office.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of complaints received from residents and other road users on obstruction to traffic and amenity problems, the URA has regularly taken action against motorists parking illegally outside the Embassy.

   <b>COST OF AND REVENUE FROM CAR PARKS</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen</b> asked the Acting Minister for National Development, since the establishment of the Housing and Development Board and the Urban Redevelopment Authority till June 1994, what is (i) the total cost of building and maintaining open car parks and multi-storey car parks and (ii) the total revenue collected from these car parks.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 1991, HDB did not include land depreciation costs in its car park accounts. It is therefore only meaningful to give cumulative figures from 1991, as annual accounts before then did not reflect land costs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to HDB's accounts, the total cumulative cost for HDB car parks from FY 90/91 to FY 93/94 is $946 million, while the total cumulative income, which includes fines, for the same period is $878 million. In other words, over these four years, HDB suffered a loss of about $58 million.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the loss should be higher, as the land costs just mentioned were based on a land valuation done back in 1985.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the same 4-year period, URA's total income from its car park operations amounted to $132 million. However, of this, $51 million came from parking fines. URA's income from parking fees totalled $81 million.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;URA's total cost was $72 million. As in the case of HDB, the price URA pays for its use of state land for roadside parking is low. URA would also be incurring a loss if it had to lease land for its car park lots at rates similar to those for private car parks.

   <b>(Shortage)</b>

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.
  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching</b> asked the Acting Minister for National Development, in view of the acute shortage of parking lots at Blocks 738 to 745, Bedok Reservoir Road, whether and when the car park next to Block 742 will be extended.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blocks 739 to 746, Bedok Reservoir Road, are located in a Neighbourhood Centre. Therefore, besides season parking, the car parks also serve short-term parking needs of those patronising the Neighbourhood Centre.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are sufficient parking lots to meet the needs of the season ticket holders as the season parking ticket take-up rate is only 70%. However, during peak periods between 7.00 pm and
  <br>9.00 pm, and on weekends, the additional demand for short-term parking due to the commercial activities is not adequately met. Therefore, HDB plans to provide about 50 additional car parking lots at the reserve site next to Block 742 Bedok Reservoir Road.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These additional car parking lots are expected to be ready by end 1995.
