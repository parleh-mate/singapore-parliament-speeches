<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b> asked the Minister for Law and the

Environment what is the reason for the difference in the

rates of compensation and valuation in respect of land in

the  same  locality acquired by different  Government

departments and statutory boards; how land to be acquired

is valued, and why some of the cases have been referred to

the courts resulting in an increase in compensation; and if

his Ministry will consider setting up a committee  to

regularise  the valuation of land to be  acquired  by

Government departments and statutory boards.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, differences in valuations and the

rates  of compensation payable in respect of lands  in  the

same  locality, arise mainly because no two parcels of land

are  identical in all respects. Each parcel of land has its

own  characteristics depending on the tenure,  Master  Plan

zoning,  state  of  encumbrances, physical characteristics,

the improvements thereon and accessibility to services. All

these  factors affect market value. Moreover, valuation  is

not  an  exact science and there is considerable scope  for

variations in opinions between valuers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the provisions of section 23 of the Land

Acquisition  Act, a claimant is entitled to appeal  to  the

Appeals  Board,  which is presided over  by  a  High  Court

Judge, against the Collector's award, if he feels that  the

compensation is inadequate. Under section



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



35  of  the  Act,  the Appeals Board shall not  reduce  the

amount awarded by the Collector, but may increase it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Centralising valuations has been considered and rejected.

The  Management  Services Department  of  the  Ministry  of

Finance  considered  that setting up a central  Acquisition

Division   to  conduct  compulsory  land  acquisitions   in

contradiction to the present practice of close consultation

between  valuers serving in Government or statutory  boards

would, on balance, be a retrogressive step.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member will be aware of the provisions of sections 33

to  34  of the Land Acquisition Act (Cap. 272), which  sets

out  the  matters to be considered as well as those  to  be

disregarded in determining compensation payable  for  lands

compulsorily acquired. The concept of market value is  used

as the basis for compensation. When assessing the amount of

compensation,  Collectors  are  required   to   take   into

consideration the market value of the land as at  the  date

of  publication of the declaration of acquisition,  or  the 30th day of November, 1973, whichever is the lower.

<div align="center"><b>(Decline in land area taken up by industrialists)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he

will ascertain from the Jurong Town Corporation (a) the

reason for the decline in land area in Jurong taken up by

the applicants in 1975 as compared with 1974, as stated in

the Economic Survey of Singapore. 1975, and whether smaller

areas of land are being taken up by applicants because of

the  increase of rates in the leasing of land by  the

Corporation; (b) of the 122 applicants for land in Jurong

in 1975, how many of them are companies owned by Singapore

citizens and how many are joint ventures with foreign

investors: and (c) what are the different rates in the

leasing of land in the various industrial estates from 1973

to 1975.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the decline in the area of land taken  up  by

industrialists  in  Jurong  and  other   industrial

estates  was due mainly to the generally  depressed

economic  conditions prevailing in 1975.  There  is

no  reason to believe that the decline in the total

area  leased and comparatively smaller  lots  taken

up  were  due  to  the increase in  the  land  rent

charged  by  JTC. JTC has increased the  land  rent

from 1 8 cents per square foot per year in 1974  to

24  cents per square foot per year in 1975  due  to

the  steep  rise  in  land and  development  costs

These  rates  are, however, still  well  below  the

prevailing  market  mates  for  private  industrial

land.  Smaller lots of land were taken  up  because

there  were  fewer  large  foreign  investors   who

normally take up larger areas of land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the 122 allocations of industrial land made in

Jurong  in  1975. 58 were to companies owned  by  Singapore

citizens,  24  to  joint  venture  companies  with  foreign

investors and 40 to foreign companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rates for industrial land charged by JTC in Jurong and

other outlying industrial estates as well as those

in urban areas in 1973-1975 were as follows:-



<pre>



                Cts per Sq                   Cts per Sq

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

ask what are the determining factors in granting  a

lease  of, say. 10 years. 20 years  or  30  years?

Does  it  depend on the amount of capital  invested

and   the   type  of  industry?  Can  the  Minister

enlighten us on this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I am not entirely familiar with the

present practice of the Jurong Town Corporation. But  as  I

understand  from  its  practices in  the  past, they  were

dependent on the nature of the industry and the duration of

the return on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



capital  required. If it was a relatively heavy investment,

then  a  longer  period would obviously be required.  There

were also other considerations, such as the relationship to

the  sea  As  there was a shortage of land along  the  sea-front, shorter leases were granted for investments in areas

near the sea.

<div align="center"><b>JURONG COUNTRY CLUB</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he

will  ascertain  from the Jurong Town Corporation  (i)  the

total cost of construction of the Jurong Country Club; (ii)

the   cost   of  maintaining  the  Club  and  whether   the

subscriptions   from   members  are  sufficient   for   its

maintenance;  (iii) the entrance fee and  subscription  for

membership  of the Club and the present number of  members;

and  (iv) whether membership is open to the public  or,  if

restricted, what are the conditions for membership.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am given to understand

that  the  total  cost  of  developing  the  Jurong

Country Club amounted to $2.917 million as at  the

end of 1975. Another $230,000 would be required  to

complete the development this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first seven months of operation from June 1 975.

the cost of maintaining the Club, including depreciation on

fixed  assets, amounted to $410,000. When the second 9-hole

course  and  other  facilities  are  ready,  the  cost   of

maintenance is expected to increase to 5520.000 per year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrance fee is $3,000 for ordinary members and $12,000

for  corporate members. Subscription is $25 per, member per

month. The Club now has 810 members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income from subscriptions, together with other sources of

fund, such as green fees, rental from practice  range  and

rental  of tennis courts and restaurants will be sufficient

to  cover  the  cost  of  maintenance  when  membership  is

increased further by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



780  members. The Club, when completed with more facilities

for  members, should be able to break even in  1  977  and

operate on its own steam thereafter. There would be no need

for JTC to subsidise its operations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Membership is open to all Singapore citizens. Preference

is, however, given to applicants who reside and/or work  in

Jurong Town. Permanent residents and non-Singapore citizens

will  also be considered if they live and/or work in Jurong

Town  or  in one of the industrial estates managed  by  the

Jurong Town Corporation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia:</b> Sir, from tie reply given by the

Minister, we can see that the entrance fee is rather  high.

Will  the  JTC consider reducing the entrance fee  so  that

more  people will be able to enjoy the facilities  provided

by the Jurong Country Club?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I think the entrance fee has been

fixed  at  a  rate which would enable the Club to  pay  for

itself as rapidly as possible. Of course, there is also the

need  to limit the number of members who use the facilities

of  the  Club,  otherwise every one will want  to  use  its

facilities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia:</b> Sir, I am not happy with the Minister's

reply.  It costs about $3 million to construct the Club.  I

think  we  should  try to allow more people  to  enjoy  the

facilities  of  a  good club. Instead of  limiting  it,  it

should  open its membership to more people. No doubt income

from  entrance  fees will be reduced, but  with  a  larger

membership  the total collection of fees will equalise  the

figure and it can still maintain the Club house.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I am not a golfer and I do not know

the economics of running a golf course. But plain economics

brings out the assumption that with an unlimited number  of

members  the facilities will have to be shared by a greater

number  of  people, and it is therefore  very  likely  that

instead  of being able to play golf when you want  to, you

will have to play when you do not want to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead AAA 1004*. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Teong Eng Siong, L.P. Rodrigo, Hwang Soo Jin. P. Govindaswamy, Ch'ng Jit Koon and Dr Chiang Hai Ding.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, culturally we have always been conscious

of  our rich and varied heritage, and have expressed  pride

in  our  cultural diversity. The Ministry  of  Culture  has

given  as  much  encouragement to  the  reflection  of  the

variety  of  our  cultural potential as  limited  financial

allocations would allow. I think I must emphasise here  "as

limited  financial allocations would allow". More  recently

we have had the development of such activities as Music for

Everyone,  Art  for Everyone, Concert for  the  Young, and

various  exhibitions. But I think my point about  financial

allocations, and therefore constraint upon effort,  may  be

illustrated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in a Ministry whose avowed aim is nurturing

and  development  of culture, there is  only  one  cultural

affairs  officer.  I understand he is assisted  by  a  very

small  number  of officers, perhaps two or three  officers.

The  Minister may be able to enlighten us there.  What  can

this small, even if gallant, handful of people do? How many

cultural  events have they been able to organise, and  for

how  many  people? Compare this number with what reasonable

number  would indicate an effective spread of influence  of

these  cultural  events. Such a kind of  examination  would

serve as an indicator to show the extent to which we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



committed to a policy of encouraging cultural development.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other indicators. If we examine another item of

expenditure  we  can get a good idea of  how  a  policy  is

reflected  in  budget  allocations. For  example, for  the

promotion  of cultural matters and exhibitions,  there  has

been  an increase of allocation from $65,000 for last  year

to  $105,000  for this coming financial year, which  (mind

you)  includes a sum of $30,000 that is subject to Treasury

sanction,  While  the  Minister for  Culture  is  no  doubt

grateful for such small mercies, it would be interesting to

find  out  what  we are getting with this  kind  of  money.

Perhaps the Minister could tell us later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What appears to be happening in the case of the

activities  like  Art  for Everyone, and  Concert  for  the

Young, and so on, is that they seem to be organised  on  an

ad  hoc  basis and this is because there is not  very  many

staff  to look after these events. Like when it is come  to

be known that some artistes are passing through, or when  a

local  military  band  is available for  some  performance.

There  does not seem to be any sequential programme planned

or   any   particular  aim  that  is  discernible  in   the

arrangement  of  the  events in such  items  as  Music  for

Everyone and Concert for the Young, although one must admit

that  an  idea like the Beautiful Singapore Art  Exhibition

does have a worthwhile theme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take yet another illustration, if you look at the

National Theatre Trust Annual Report for 1974-75, you  will

find  that its first preoccupation is major renovations  to

the  Theatre and expenditure. This kind of thing represents

its  principal problem. What else can the Trust  do  except

what  it  has  done, namely, enter into joint  presentation

with  other  organisations.  All  the  same,  with  limited

resources the Trust seems to have done well. But again  its

dependence on sponsors is a clue to the extent of  official

support for its work.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An exceptional, important role as everybody knows is that

played  by  broadcasting: perhaps,  especially,  by  TV  in

respect of giving expression to cultural policies. In  this

regard,  for further contribution to a sense of  belonging,

to  a  consciousness  of  community.  TV  has  to  turn  to

encouraging greater understanding among our citizens of one

another's cultural forms. People have to be stimulated into

a more heightened awareness of, and interest in the various

characteristic  forms  of  cultural  expression.  And   the

stimulus can be provided by RTS if it sets its mind  to  it

and  if it gets the support; if it is the policy to require

it to do this kind of thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, just as an illustration, what is the position at

present  in terms of programmes that are viewed by a  mixed

viewership, by a multi-lingual viewership, by a  viewership

composed  of audiences from the different language  streams

at  the same time? I am just trying to illustrate a certain

condition in our society. The programmes that get a  multi-lingual  viewership are the imported programmes, especially

in   English   and  mainly  in  the  crime  and   violence.

entertainment, and full-length film categories.  And  these

programmes would perhaps occupy as much as half of TV  time

during  a week. At the same time, one other programme  that

gets a mixed audience, a multi-lingual audience, is Justice

Pao.  Incidentally, this popularity of Justice Pao  with  a

multi-lingual  audience  shows  that  a  programme  with  a

cultural flavour of one of the main cultural streams of our

society  can,  can indeed, have an audience transcending  a

particular ethnic group. Unfortunately, here again. Justice

Pao is also an imported programme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Pao Piao.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Yes, we will come to Pao Piao. Otherwise,

we  do  not seem to be able to break through beyond insular

situations  when  one  ethnic group is watching  programmes

only  in its own language. Let me make it plain that it  is

good that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



entertainment be provided for Tamils to watch Tamil  cinema

and  Malays  to watch Pesta Ria and Chinese  to  watch  Pao

Piao, but we want something in addition to this where their

sights  are  taken beyond their own cultural boundaries.  I

hope that the Minister will not retort like he did the last

time when I said the same thing, hsin p'ing, chit, chiu new

bottles,  old  wine. I hope I got the pronunciation  right.

Culture is a laborious process of growth and points have to

be  reiterated  in  order  to  arouse  adequate  attention,

especially as adequate attention does not seem to have been

aroused previously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may make one last point that relates to our young

people,  we  should  think  of  providing  them  with  more

opportunities to continue the cultural interest  they  have

developed  in  schools which have been  encouraged  by  the

Ministry   of   Education's   Extra-Curricular   Activities

programmes, youth festivals, band competitions, and so  on.

I  have  also mentioned the view held by some young  people

themselves that not enough is done to set the sights of our

young  people beyond their immediate surroundings. In  this

connection,  perhaps TV could produce programmes  on  ASEAN

problems, matters, background and other  regional  themes,

gradually  extending the focus in a more global  direction.

We,  of  course,  have Newsreel but the shots  of  Newsreel

comprise  mere  flashes and there is no depth  analysis  of

events  that  take  place around us. We  have  thought  and

talked  about the necessity to carry the attention  of  our

young people beyond their immediate preoccupations. Perhaps

our  organisation has not arrived at a standard when we can

produce programmes like Panorama and 24 Hours that  I  have

noticed, and I am sure the Minister has himself noticed, on

BBC and British Television, but we should certainly try  to

encourage  a  more particular appreciation  of  the  larger

world around us where our young people are concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

Ministry of Culture certainly has great responsibilities to

discharge. On the one hand, it will have to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



actively propagate a multi-racial culture and values of our

people.  On  the  other hand, it will  have  to  raise  the

cultural   quality  of  our  people,  their  thoughts   and

character, in order to cultivate them to be people of  good

quality. This is not an easy task.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last few years, the Ministry of Culture has

actually  put  in some effort in the promotion  of  various

healthy  cultural  and  artistic activities,  such  as  the

holding of public art exhibitions, the organising of public

music  concerts  for the people and so  on,  to  popularise

artistic  tastes and appreciation among the  people.  Radio

and  TV  Singapore have also put forward a number  of  good

programmes  such  as students' debating forums  which  help

them  to  have  a better understanding of and  interest  in

current  affairs and in academic studies. There  have  also

been  programmes  like News Magazine, Children's  Magazine,

Daily  Digest  which are meaningful as well  as  educative.

However, the  number  of such healthy  programmes  is  too

small.  On  the  contrary, there is  a  greater  number  of

nonsensical  programmes  which  outweigh  and  nullify  the

influence  of healthy programmes. In spite of the  cultural

contribution of the Ministry of Culture, there exist in our

society  also undesirable cultural pieces in  the  form  of

sensual, erotic, monstrous and phantasmic films, literature

and   pictures   which  exert  a  great  degenerating   and

corrupting  effect on our people, our youth in  particular.

and  turning them into a weak lot. So for the future of our

youths,  our task now is to strengthen our healthy cultural

force  in  order  to  promote and  popularise  healthy  and

artistic  cultural activities so as to help them  recognise

their  values and be able to distinguish the good from  the

bad. This will benefit them in their life-time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among our youths, there is a sign of decadence. It is

mainly  because  of the fact that some of  them  have  been

affected by the bad habits of Western youths. They take  to

a  life of enjoyment, are easy-going and are not interested

in  our healthy cultural and artistic performances. This is

a  very urgent task pertaining to the pattern of thought of

our youths that is facing the Ministry of Culture



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



and all of us. Obviously, the main task of the Ministry  of

Culture  is  how to face this challenge, how  to  help  the

young  to be receptive to good culture and to rectify their

errors  and wrong thinking and to recognise which  type  of

culture will bring them beneficial influence. In this  way,

we  can  mould our youths into a great force in our  nation

building and cultural development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to advance four suggestions to the

Minister  for  his  reference, to help policy  formulation.

First,  this concerns the work of raising the consciousness

of our people; in other words, national consciousness. What

kind  of  plan, of organized activities is the Ministry  of

Culture  going  to  take in order to promote  our  cultural

quality?  Second, will the Minister consider  reducing  the

rental  charged  for the use of our National  Theatre,  the

Victoria Memorial Hall, or reducing the entertainment  duty

on  certain  performances in order to help  more  artistes,

both local and foreign, to perform in Singapore? These will

include  pugilistics,  music  and  concert  shows.  At  the

moment,  because of the high charges, interested organisers

do  not find it easy to organise such performances. So  our

people  are  deprived of more opportunities to  enjoy  such

performances of a higher standard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, whether the Ministry has taken note of the many

undesirable, phantasmic and erotic literature and  pictures

being  put  on sale in the streets. Last year I  asked  the

Minister  about this and he promised to look into  it.  One

year has passed. How is it that this sort of thing is still

going  on?  Is  it  because the staff in  the  Ministry  of

Culture  are not efficient in their work, or is it  because

the  staff  concerned  are not willing  to  shoulder  their

responsibilities?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, what plans the Ministry of Culture has in the

promotion  of  various  community  cultures  and   artistic

activities? All these traditional many-splendoured cultures

and  arts  should be propagated because they will  help  to

enrich our cultural heritage and, at the same time, give us

a good image internationally, besides boosting our tourism.

<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Sir, one of the

hazards  of being on good terms with the Member for  Katong

is  that in allowing him to speak ahead of you on a head of

expenditure such as this, you find that there is  not  much

else  to  say. I quite realise that in a debate, repetition

is  inevitable. But in this remarkable incident, if I  were

to  speak  it might appear that the Member for  Katong  had

stolen my notes last night and formulated the address which

he  has so ably presented this afternoon! So I have nothing

more to add but to concur with all that the Member has said

in  regard  to  policy  and to support  him  fully  in  his

suggestions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, what has the

Government   done   in   the  encouragement   of   cultural

development, and what exactly is the Government's  cultural

policy? These are questions people often ask. Frankly I  do

not  know  the answer and I do not think many  do.  Indeed,

doubts  have just been expressed by the Member for  Katong.

Out  of  the  total Main Estimates of $44.7 million,  $23.1

million  or  more than 50% goes to the maintenance  of  the

Broadcasting  Department; and out of the total  Development

Estimates  of $14.7 million. $8.5 million or close  to  60%

goes  towards  the  further expansion of  the  Broadcasting

Department. Figuratively it would appear that the  Ministry

of  Culture is primarily concerned with the promotion of TV

culture. If this is the case then, rather than mislead  the

people,  I would suggest that a more appropriate title  for

the Ministry would be the Ministry of Broadcasting!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are serious about cultural development and firmly

believe  it  to be a vital part of nation-building,  a  lot

more  effort will have to be put in. First of all,  let  us

identify  the  correct  direction of  development  so  that

hopefully we could in time, have a distinctive culture that

we  can  truly call our own. I do appreciate this may  take

years,  if not generations, but then the foundation has  to

be  laid.  During the past 10 years we have done little  to

patronise the arts. They have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



been  left largely on their own. Until today we do not have

a decent art gallery. Notwithstanding the small size of our

Republic. I agree with the Member for Jurong when he  spoke

recently  during the debate on the Budget that there  is  a

need and we could easily support a national academy of arts

and music. But today the learning of arts and music remains

largely the privilege of the affluent few, as only they can

afford the high tuition fees. Artists have no place in  our

society.  This is reflected by the fact that seldom  do  we

see them featured in our National Day Honours list.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister for Culture and the Deputy Prime

Minister  are frequently seen patronising Cantonese  operas

performed  by  visiting artistes, and  yet  we  ban  street

wayangs which surely are much more relevant to our cultural

heritage  than the imported operas. I am all  for  economic

development,  but  I  would hate to  see  all  Singaporeans

becoming economic animals lacking the ability to appreciate

the   finer  things  in  life  which  are  not  necessarily

obtainable with money alone. I do not profess to be  a  man

of  culture or to know very much about culture,  unlike  my

Hon.  Friend, the Member for Katong. But to me, quality  of

life in a society should not be measured simply in terms of

per  capita  income, number of TV sets  owned,  heights  of

buildings  or  the number of chimney stacks  at  industrial

estates. These materialistic things are important and vital

for  our survival, but so is the spiritual aspect of  life.

Grantinq  that  economic development should  be  given  top

priority  in  the context of Singapore, and  we  should  be

thankful  that  the  Government  has  done  well  in   this

direction,   however  I  suspect  there  is   generally   a

misconception  that  the  promotion  of  culture   has   no

relevance to economic growth. We are doing well in tourism.

I  think we can do better if there are more activities of a

cultural nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many examples around the world where promotion

in   cultural   activities  has  directly  and   indirectly

benefited  tourism. Take, for example, the very  successful

Edinburgh  Festival  and the National  Eisteddfod  held  in

Britain and indeed many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



other  similar  Festivals held annually in other  countries

are  major  tourist  attractions. Sir,  our  own  excellent

efforts  in  turning the Republic into a Garden  City  have

helped  in  no small measure to draw tourists to Singapore.

This leads me to think that if we promote Culture with  the

same  heart  and  soul  as we put  into  the  promotion  of

Horticulture,  I  feel  sure that the  Nation  will  derive

tremendous benefits both spiritually and economically.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with rapid urban redevelopment our City will soon

lose  many of our traditional characteristics. Has it  ever

occurred  to  the Ministry that before the bulldozers  move

into  any  one  area, it would perhaps be a  good  idea  to

systematically capture either on films or canvas personally

I  would  prefer canvas so that our local painters  can  be

commissioned to do the jobs scenes that may soon be no more

so  that the generations coming after us will at least have

some  idea as to the environment of their forefathers. Sir,

in  many  cities  in the world permanent  open-air  display

centres  are provided for artists -painters and  sculptors.

The  provision of similar facilities at the pedestrian mall

in Orchard Road is at present under active consideration by

the Urban Redevelopment Authority, but strangely enough the

idea did not originate from the Ministry of Culture. Surely

there   must  be  many  other  ways  to  promote   cultural

activities which will not cost the Government too  much  if

we are too concerned about money.



<br><br><!-- Dr Chiang Hai Ding -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chiang Hai Ding (Ulu Pandan):</b> Sir, after listening to

the Member for Katong, who made a very plaintive speech.  I

suspect  that the solution to his problem may  not  lie  in

transferring wine from one kind of bottle to another but in

inviting the Minister to drink the wine that he offers year

in  and  year  out, always under the present  circumstances

with such good spirit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is located at an international cross-road. It

has a relatively open society and is therefore subjected to

many cultural influences. Our people are regularly reminded

by  the  political  leadership of our  need  for  "cultural

ballast".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have furthermore, in the last decade and a half,

literally  transformed the life-style of our  people.  More

than  half  live in high-rise flats instead of kampong-type

environments.  We  are now also engaged  in  manufacturing.

industry,  shipbuilding and repairing,  banking  and  other

services,  whereas previously our people  were  essentially

traders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process we have become collectively richer. Our

Gross Domestic Product at factor cost rose four times  from

$3,043.4 million in 1965 to $12,831.7 million in 1975.  Our

per  capita  GDP in 1965 was $1,566. By 1975 it  also  rose

almost four times to $5,917.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have an economic policy which, the Member

for  Jalan  Kayu has just told us, is eminently successful.

We  have  a  labour  policy, a foreign  policy,  a  defence

policy,  even  a policy for sports. In education,  as  this

House  was  reminded,  so  forcefully  reminded,  we   have

policies galore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is our cultural policy? What are our plans and

objectives? Seventeen years have passed since we formed the

government, ten since we became independent. Where  are  we

now?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we culturally an identifiable people? Are there, for

example, songs that we, or our children, can all sing?  Or

dances  that  they can all enjoy? Are there any  particular

art  forms  that  we  have  consciously  promoted  for  our

people's appreciation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that Singaporeans are not merely people

sporting short hair, most of whom should not smoke and many

of whom are illiterate in two languages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It pains me to propose a cut of $ 10/- from the Minister.

He needs, or his Ministry needs, every cent it can get.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that we cannot measure culture in quantitative

terms. But I ask Members to join me to look at how much  we

have spent on Culture since we became independent ten years

ago.  Through the courtesy of the staff of Parliament every

Member should have on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>



his  chair an Appendix (See cols 711-2) setting out the percentage  of  the

Ordinary  and Development Estimates that this  House  voted

for  Culture since 1965. If you look at the figures in  the

Appendix*,   it   will  bear  out  the  limited   financial

allocations  that we have made to Culture, In the  Ordinary

Estimates the percentage allocated to Culture of the  total

fell  steadily  from  a high of 3.9% in  1965  to  1.5%  in

1975/76. The figure proposed for

1976/77 is 1.4%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Development Estimates the story is about the same

except for a bump in 1972-75. Otherwise, once again we  see

a decline from 1.5% in 1965 to 0.55% in 1975/76. The figure

proposed for 1976/77 is 0.56%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time that we defined our cultural policy and

produced a plan to promote culture in Singapore. There  are

people'   and  institutions  in  Singapore  interested   in

promoting  culture.  They need the support  and  leadership

from  Government. If the Minister has a policy and  a  plan

now,  I am sure many members will be delighted to hear  it.

If not. I trust that this time next year he will unveil his

programme. Once that is articulated, we can discuss,  argue

and  begin  to implement decisions. And this  House,  I  am

confident, will vote to Culture, the appropriate  sums  to

carry out its work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now, it is my regret to move to reduce subhead AAA

1004 by $10.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been

promoting  the concept of multi-racialism in Singapore  for

many,  many  years. In the past, most of  the  periodicals,

circulars, posters, signboards, etc, were usually  printed

in  the four official language media. But, of late, this is

not  so. The periodicals, circulars, posters and signboards

are  printed in either three or even in two languages. What

has  happened  to the other languages? Is the  Ministry  of

Culture short of translators? Or are the other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>



languages  simply left out? I hope the Ministry of  Culture

is  being fair to every language group in any printing that

they do, so that everyone knows what is happening.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I want to deal with the question of the Singapore

culture.  We  have  been talking so much about  building  a

Singapore culture. I wonder how successful we have been  so

far  in building a Singapore culture. This is evident  only

when our cultural troupe is sent abroad to perform, when we

would  have  the  people  from the National  Theatre  Trust

representing the various cultures in Singapore. Other  than

this,  there  is  nothing much to show  locally  about  our

Singapore  culture.  Even TV or Radio  Singapore  for  that

matter  has not taken any step to produce any programme  in

the  four  languages. What we view in these  programmes  is

that each group looks after its own traditions and culture,

If  this continues, we will never succeed in achieving  our

plan of building a Singapore culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that there should be greater coordination

among  the  various  cultural organisations  with  emphasis

placed  on  the  existence of a multi-racial society.  More

multi-racial shows should be organised at different levels,

otherwise  each racial group would be left  to  itself  and

there would be no unity in the cultural aspect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was published in the newspapers that a Tamil film

would  be  shown at 10 o'clock last night but  it  did  not

start  until  10.1 5 p.m. Why is there this  discrimination

against, the Tamil language?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> It is

because of the Parliamentary Report.

o'clock?  They should publish it as 10.15 p.m. I am  saying

that they are discriminating against the Tamil language.

Members  for  showing  concern in this  subject  and  their

support for more funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must point out to Members that cultural development and

cultural activities in any society always come after  other

priorities.  It  is  only after the society  is  reasonably

secure and properly educated with reasonable prospects  for

economic advancement that the society has the time and also

the  money for cultural activities. Nevertheless,  we  have

been able to do a lot of things which we think are good for

the  development  of culture within the very  small  budget

that we are allocated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have pointed out time and again that cultural matters

cannot  be quantified. It does not mean that the  more  you

squander on it the better the culture you will get. I agree

with  the Member for Jalan Kayu that a lot more effort  has

to  be put in. I also agree with his remarks that a society

cannot  be  measured by economic growth.  So  the  cultural

development  of  a society cannot also be measured  by  the

amount of money spent on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the cultural policy? I am told there is a lack of

this   cultural  policy.  But  is  this  not  better   than

pronouncing  an abstract policy which we can  never  fulfil

because of lack of funds and manpower? Would it not be more

realistic to build on what we have? I am not saying that we

do  not have a cultural policy. We have, but as with things

cultural,  it  is  imperceptible. What  do  we  know  about

culture? What can we say about culture? What is culture? It

is all over us. It is like air and water which we can never

get  out  of  it. It is all around us. So a  good  cultural

policy must have a realistic footing and then build  on  it

what  we  already  have. But what do we have?  We  have  an

island  of  two million people, the majority of  whom  have

brought  their own customs and cultures from China,  India,

Malaysia and Indonesia, and an increasing number are  under

the influence of Western culture.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, it is obvious that our first

target,  if  we do have a cultural policy, is  to  preserve

what  we  have  - the good virtues which are  traditionally

handed down from generation to generation. Then we go on by

trying  to make everyone understand how the others live  or

think, so that a sense of tolerance and racial harmony  can

prevail  and  with  a  respect  for  the  other's  virtues,

thinking and way of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the point which the Member for Katong

has  termed "cross-fertilisation" among the people from the

different  cultural streams. I think there is  no  lack  of

cross-fertilisation in our society. What  the  Broadcasting

Department  and  the Ministry of Culture are  doing  is  to

emphasise  such intermingling of different races  from  the

many cultural streams. There is no escape from this kind of

intermingling in our society. Whether a person likes it  or

not,  he  is exposed to the different pulls. A Chinese  may

not  want  to  know what the Malays do in a wedding  or  in

their  prayers, but if his neighbour is  a  Malay  who  is

holding  a  wedding function, there is no escape  for  him.

Whether or not he is curious, he is exposed to this  going-on in his environment. In this respect, I think there is no

hindrance  to the free flow of cultural exchange.  What  we

are  doing in the Ministry of Culture is to help give  this

an emphasis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is reflected in the TV programmes and the Radio

talks and the many other things which are undertaken by the

various  organisations under the Ministry of  Culture.  For

instance,   the  National  Library,  through   its   branch

libraries,    organises   film    shows, lectures    and

demonstrations  on such subjects as Indian  dance.  Chinese

painting and Malay music, in the four languages. There  are

also  explanations of Indian music on Radio in English  and

in  other languages. I am not saying that this is going  to

be  a determining factor in promoting this intermingling or

in  breaking down cultural barriers, but this has been  the

policy  of  the  Ministry. This is  reflected  in  all  the

organisations under it and in the production of  programmes

on TV and Radio.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that so far this has been successful and we

intend to carry on this kind of development. I am sure that

in  time to come and with more effort being put in  by  the

various  people, this intermingling of different  cultures

will emerge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has asked me four questions.

First, what are we going to do about promoting a sense  of

national  consciousness or reminding the citizens of  their

responsibilities? What are we going to do to heighten their

national pride? I would say that this is not only the  duty

of  the Ministry of Culture but, in fact, it is the duty of

everyone  in  this  society to help promote  this  national

pride and a sense of national consciousness. Of course, the

exhibitions, talks and speeches that Members of  Parliament

give  in  the various community centres and functions  will

help. But I think we must also be warned that we should not

be  naive  and  deceive  ourselves  that  by  blaring  into

people's ears we would be able to create good citizens  out

of them.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have national pride and to make people realise their

responsibilities, we must have discipline. We  must  impose

discipline  if something is to be done. Although publishing

speeches  will  make things easier, laws and  other  firmer

measures  are  required. For instance, it is very  easy  to

expect  people  to  behave well in public  and  to  observe

cleanliness and so on. But I doubt very much if without any

penalties and fines laid down in the laws anyone of us here

would pay our tax willingly without any grudge. Without any

penalties to follow up, people would not observe the  rules

of cleanliness in public. I would be exaggerating the power

of  my  Ministry if I say that we can actually make  people

change  their attitude overnight without firm  measures  to

back  us up. If they want sugar coating, we can give it  to

them, but it is the medicine that we want them to take,  As

the  Chinese saying goes, "Good medicine is bitter  to  the

mouth."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of reducing rentals for use of the

National Theatre and the Victoria Theatre, I am afraid that

although   there   are   concession   rates   for   amateur

performances, we  cannot give concessions  in  most  cases

since the organisations are performing many different types

of  variety shows, some of which are profit-making and some

are  not, In this respect, it is difficult to give everyone

a  concession rate for use of the National Theatre and  the

Victoria Theatre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of concession of entertainment duty for

cultural  performances.  I  must  say  that  there  is   no

concession rate whatsoever. But there is provision for  the

waiver of entertainment duty in respect of shows which  are

of  cultural and educational nature. If the shows  are  for

charitable  purposes,  the Customs  and  Excise  Department

would  also  consider waiving such duties. But  every  case

will  be  considered on its own merit and the  Ministry  of

Finance  will decide whether or not entertainment duty  can

be waived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has complained that we have not used

the  four  languages  in some of our  signboards, posters,

circulars and so on. He has also pointed out that there has

been some discrimination. He should never forget that there

is no discrimination of language. This is the last thing we

will have. It is never our intention at all to discriminate

our  citizens whether it be language, culture or education.

The  signboards, circulars and periodicals are not produced

by  my Ministry alone but by the various Ministries.  I  do

not  want  to  speak for the other Ministries.  But  I  can

venture a guess. It may well be that they have adopted this

for  the  sake of simplicity and convenience. But  whatever

they  do,  it  is  not  done  to discriminate  against  any

community  in  our  society. The  purpose  of  distributing

pamphlets  or  putting  up signboards  is  to  make  people

understand clearly about certain things. They may  want  to

show  people  certain places. It is to  explain  what  that

place  is.  If  they can achieve their purpose  in  a  very

simple  manner,  then they would do it. I do  not  want  to

speak  for the other Ministries, but this is what. I think,

is going on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already explained, evolving a Singapore culture

is  time-consuming  and  a  very slow  process.  But  while

Singapore  culture is a faceless one and still  an  unknown

factor,  it  would  be  a pity to throw  away  the  various

dances,  music and the colourful costumes of the dances  of

our   different  races.  In  our  production  of   cultural

programmes,  whether  on TV or through  a  presentation  of

dances  by  the cultural dance troupe, we have always  been

mindful of the need to project the multi-lingual and multi-cultural aspects of our society. Whether it is the People's

Association  Dance  Troupe or the  National  Theatre  Dance

Troupe, this emphasis is always there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu has mentioned that at present

there is a need for an art gallery. He has suggested that a

National  Academy of Arts and Music should  be  formed.  In

this respect, I must inform him that the art gallery at the

National  Museum, for which the Art Council has contributed

funds,  is  almost completed. We are putting the  finishing

touches  to it. On the question of establishing a  National

Academy  of  Arts  and Music, I must say  that  this  is  a

tremendous  task. Based on the size of our population,  the

amount of talent that we can tap, the job opportunities for

the graduates, and so on, this may not be feasible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quite agree with the Member that artists and writers

seldom appear on our National Day Honours list. However, if

they  are artists of exceptional skill and reputation, they

will  be  given due recognition. As a matter of  fact,  the

Ministry of Culture is contemplating to introduce a  system

of  awards to encourage people who have been active in  the

field of art and culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards street wayangs, we have never tried to ban them.

Our policy is to improve the performances of street wayangs

so that they will have a better content in their

performances. Although I am a lover of the Cantonese opera,

I do not dislike other forms of operas. I think what has

prompted the Member to say that we have banned street

wayangs is that over the past year we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



reduced  the  number  of  sites for performances  of  these

wayangs.  But  this was done not to ban or eliminate  these

operas or wayangs but to prevent noise pollution as well as

to  ease traffic congestion. As Members know, urban renewal

projects are going on in our city and many old streets have

disappeared from the street map. The sites, of course, will

also disappear. It is rather difficult for the wayang sites

to  be  located  in  the new housing  estates.  Hence,  the

difficulty  of  getting  sites  for  wayangs  in  the   new

environment.  Moreover, the residents of  the  new  housing

estates  may  also not like them. They create  problems  of

health and noise pollution. Mr Speaker, Sir, this is what I

can reply at the present moment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, there

are  quite  a  number  of Members who have  talked  on  the

subject  of Culture. In the Minister's reply, he  seems  to

have    forgotten   my   question   regarding   undesirable

literature.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I am sorry, Sir, the Member for

Sembawang   has  complained  that  a  lot  of   undesirable

publications  on sex and violence are on sale either  under

the counter or above the counter in the bookshops. This  is

not  the case. The Publications Section of the Ministry  of

Culture  keeps  a  very close watch on publications.  Books

come  in from abroad. Hard-core pornographic books, perhaps

on   the   exploitation  of  sex, are  not   allowed   for

distribution in the bookshops. But the problem here is that

some books and magazines may come in under the veil of  sex

education.  As you know, with the rapid changes in  Western

societies,  the demarcation line is so thin that  sometimes

these  books  that may be classified as sex  education  may

just  slip through the net. But whatever it is, it  is  not

the  deliberate  policy of my Ministry to  allow  hard-core

pornography to circulate in the bookshops.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained just now, the kind of activities that

we  are  going  to  have  in  the  years  to  come  include

instituting the Award



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



of  Culture  for  meritorious activities  in  the  cultural

field.  There  would  also  be a  lot  of  exhibitions  and

cultural performances that would get things going.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, as I said earlier on, not being a

man  of culture, I do not know very much about culture. But

I  must say that I am no wiser now than before the Minister

started  his speech as to which direction to take. I  would

rather  go  along  with  the Hon. Member  for  Ulu  Pandan.

Perhaps if the Hon. Minister could draw up a concrete  plan

of  cultural activities and put it to the House at the next

Budget   session,  then  if  financial  support  is  really

necessary, we will all give our very active support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some Hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, turning to one or two of the

specific points that the Minister has made, on the question

of  wayangs. I am not quite sure what exactly he is  trying

to  imply.  I  do not know whether wayangs are directly  or

indirectly  banned.  But the fact  remains  that  they  are

disappearing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister said that as part of the encouragement of

cultural  activities, we are building on  what  we  already

have.   As   regards  dances  organised  by  the   People's

Association which has organised a lot of dances,  it  seems

to  me that many of such dances have, in fact, no relevance

to our cultural heritage. Take the Chinese folk dances, for

instance.  I think the majority of the Chinese in Singapore

are  from the southern part of China. But you will see that

a  lot  of the dances organised by the People's Association

feature Mongolian dances. What sort of relevance is this? I

do  not  know. I am not a man of culture, but if  you  talk

about building on something that we have, this is not so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point on which I am very pleased to hear is that

the  National Gallery is finally going to be ready. I would

like  the  Minister to please ensure that whatever exhibits

that   we   are  going  to  have  there  will  be  properly

safeguarded because the Auditor-General



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



has just drawn attention to the fact that 1 5 paintings - I  believe it is 15 - in the collection of the  National

Museum donated by members of the public over the years have

disappeared.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I do not know how concrete the

plans  for  cultural activities would be. As we  go  on,  I

think  I can assure Hon. Members that with good support  we

would be able to get things going in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards operas and wayangs. I regret that they are

really disappearing on the streets, First, it is because of

the lack of sites. Secondly. I think it is also because  of

the  lack of talent and lack of supporters. We can see that

many  people of the younger generation do not have as  much

interest in these wayangs as the older folks. This lack  of

support is evident. Thirdly, very few people would like  to

go into the wayang business nowadays because learning to be

a  wayang actor or actress involves very hard work  indeed.

One  has  to be trained as an apprentice from a very  early

age.  And in these days of full employment, it is difficult

for wayang operators to get recruits for their operas and I

think  this  also  contributes to the  decline  of  Chinese

wayangs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the lack of sites, of course, this can be remedied

by  offering them proper wayang stages such as the  one  in

the  People's  Theatre in Kreta Ayer. But  the  fact  still

remains that less and less people want to watch wayangs and

still less want to send their children to learn this art,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards dances by the People's Association, of course,

they are trying to portray Chinese culture. There is a lack

of a good choreographer in the People's Association and, in

most  cases, these dances are picked up from other  places.

So sometimes we cannot avoid the fact that they have put in

the   wrong   dances  But  whether  or  not  the   People's

Association  should confine this item only to the  southern

Chinese  dances, I have my doubts because, at  the  present

moment, no  one  really knows what  are  the  southern  or

northern Chinese dances, and what is a Mongolian dance. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



steps  and the movements are more or less the same; whether

it  is a southern or northern Chinese dance, the difference

lies  only  in  their costumes. If they  wear  a  Mongolian

dress, then it looks like a Mongolian dance. If they wear a

Manchurian dress, then you can call it a Manchurian  dance.

The fact is that they are all Chinese dances.



<br><br><!-- Dr Chiang Hai Ding -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chiang Hai Ding:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has

been  specific and concrete about wayangs. Mongolian dances

and  whatnots, He has asked us for support. I am sure  that

this  House  is  willing and is waiting  to  give  him  the

support  if he will be able to give us concrete and precise

plans and policies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, if I may just be allowed to say a few

words  before I withdraw the amendment. I think it is  very

clear,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Minister is himself  very

conscious of the fact that his Ministry, from the  economic

sense,  is  not considered worthy of receiving more  grants

from  the  Ministry of Finance. It is our job here  to  get

greater support for the work that he is doing, and I  think

the  consensus is quite clear that we want him to get  this

support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may be allowed just to go on and pick up one or

two  points  that the Minister has made in  order  to  help

towards  giving  the Ministry of Finance an  idea  that  we

could get more money for cultural support. The Minister has

said  that cultural activity will have its place in society

and the time is when society has overcome certain financial

and economic problems. I am sure the Minister must be aware

of the theory of a well-known psychologist, Abraham Maslow,

who  says  that  people do not want to go above  a  certain

level  of  needs unless a previous level of needs has  been

satisfactorily attained. In our society, I  think  we  have

come to a certain reasonable satisfaction generally of  our

needs  so  that  I  think it is time that  we  attended  to

cultural  matters. I think this is the point  .--  that  it

does  not  require very much quantification or  statistics,

which  is  a  viewpoint  that many  people  can  reasonably

accept.  And  it  is  because of this viewpoint  that  many

Members here reflected the view



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



that  we  should get more money for the Minister to promote

cultural activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal point the Minister has brought up about

which I cannot fully agree with him but which he may differ

with me over this view, of course, is about the question of

the abstractness of the notion of culture. Of course, if we

want  to  appreciate a painting, then we get  into  several

difficulties on the aesthetic side. Take a modern painting,

for   example.  Personally,  I  must  confess  my  complete

ignorance about what are its aesthetic features.  It  looks

to  me  as though we can get a donkey and have a brush  for

his tail and he can go round swinging his tail - put it  on

to  a piece of canvas and we can get a fine piece of modern

art,  probably. I do not know. But on this point, certainly

we cannot say what culture really means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to take the Minister's resemblance of

culture  to air, He says "Culture cannot be quantified.  It

is  just  like air and water around us." But our scientists

will  tell him that he can quantify air to some extent.  We

can  have  so many cubic centimetres of air. I am not  sure

but I think air is H 20, or something like that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some Hon. Members:</b> No. [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I am sorry. That is water. There you are! I

am afraid if that reflects my knowledge of culture, then  I

stand  very  very  disgraced indeed. But  we  can  quantify

culture.  The quantification is in the same direction  that

the  economists quantify economic development  -  how  many

television sets you have, how many cars you have, how  many

jobs  have been created, how many houses, what standard  of

living.  I  think we can quantify culture in  that  respect

--how many agencies are there for the promotion of culture,

how  many people go and attend concerts, what is the spread

of  the effect of the work that the Ministry has done,  how

many people watch such and such television programmes. So I

think  we  can quantify. The Ministry of Finance officials.

the  Budget people, they can be asked. They are the experts

to analyse it, the systems or that kind of thing. So he can

ask them to help in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



the  quantification. As the Hon. Member for Ulu Pandan  has

said, if on a cooperative basis, the Minister can seek some

form  of  tangible policy to say that we can  go  one  step

further, then this time next year I think we can make  the

quantification.  If  the  Minister  can  come  up  with   a

programme  then I am sure, as everybody has  said,  we  can

give  him  support for a greater allocation  of  funds  for

cultural promotion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some Hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I did not say that I do not want

money for Culture. I just said that cultural affairs in any

country always come, if not last, fairly close to the  last

in the allocation of funds because of the other priorities.

In  a  country  like ours, just emerging from independence.

the  priority becomes even lower than the others. But  this

is not to say that we should not do anything about culture.

For  the amount that we have been allocated in the past and

for  the kind of activities that we have carried on so far.

I would say that we have done quite a lot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am sure there is room for improvement. In this

respect, the need is to get people more conscious  of  this

cultural aspect, When I compared culture to air, I was just

not  really trying to quantify the air that we breathe  and

so  on.  I  think the Member for Katong has  taken  me  too

seriously. But to try and make a study of whether or not we

have culture by listing the number of air-conditioners  and

television  sets that we have, the number  of  people  that

attend concerts and so on would make a mess of it. It would

even  make it meaningless. I do not think that is  what  we

want to do. We can always call in the academicians and  the

analysts to find out whether or not Singapore has a culture

and  at what stage of development has it reached. But  that

is  not the purpose. It does not help us at all. As I  have

said, culture is something that we should not try to equate

it with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



amount of money we have spent on it. It does not mean  that

if  we  have  mere  funds, we get better culture  and  more

cultural activities and if we get less, then the activities

will  come  to  nil.  Money finances only  a  part  of  the

cultural  activities  of  a society.  The  rest  of  it  is

undertaken by the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> After listening to the Minister. I would

like to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Yeo Choo Kok -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 1105.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CAA 1107*. (* The same amendment also stood in hte names of Messrs. Hwang Soo Jin, P. Govindaswamy, Ch'ng Jit Koon)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to speak here. Sir, just hopefully to help

the  Minister get further support for the work that  he  is

doing in respect of the Department of Broadcasting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the necessity to stimulate greater interest

in  cultural  matters, it is obviously  necessary  to  give

greater  strength to Broadcasting. Therefore,  we  need  to

give  every  encouragement and incentive to  the  staff  to

express  commitment  and dedication to the  realisation  of

whatever cultural policy is decided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently certain categories of staff who are critical to

good  production  effort seem to be excluded  from  present

incentive  schemes. This is a condition that prevails  also

in    other   departments   besides   the   Department   of

Broadcasting, but I am interested in Broadcasting  in  this

case. We have heard of schemes like merit increment schemes

established   in   favour  of  people   with   professional

qualifications like accountants, architects, engineers, and

so on. In

`The some amendment also stood in the names of Messrs.

Hwang Soo Jin, P. Govindaswamy, cling Jit Koon and Dr Ong

Leong Boon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



Broadcasting, the engineers would benefit  from  such

schemes. However, categories of staff like producers,

controllers,  executive producers and people  in  the

same   salary   code,  as  those  with   professional

qualifications, although they might merit recognition

through increment, will not qualify. At the same time

also, people with professional qualifications can  be

promoted beyond establishment strength but not so  in

the  case  of producers and controllers. Furthermore,

in  the  present search for talent that is  going  on

among  administrative officers, here again  those  in

Broadcasting in the producer/controller category  are

left  out because they do not happen to be classified

as administrative officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of such circumstances steps should be taken

to   provide  adequate  incentives  for  people  who.

because  of the intrinsic interest the job holds  for

them  offer  good service but feel at the  same  time

left out of recognition.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Hwang is not here. Mr P.

Govindaswamy.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Broadcasting  Department seems to show some  sort  of

discrimination  against  artistes   who   appear   in

programmes  on  TV  and radio. The  artistes  in  the

different  language  programmes  are  paid  different

rates  for the same performance and time. However,  I

would  like  to  point out anomalies and  differences

between  the  Tamil  Section  and  the  Malay/Chinese

Sections, as follows:



<pre>

                            TV        Radio

Tamil Programme

   Singer                   $33        $16

   Instrument Player        $44        $20

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rates for artistes and dramas are as follows:

<pre>

                                 Malay &

                    Tamil        Chinese

                   Section       Sections



Main character       $82          $100

Sub-character        $50          $ 88

Dummy character      $20          $ 44

Artiste              $33          $ 45

Radio singer         $16          $ 20

Instrument/singer    $44          $ 58

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see no reason whatsoever for artistes performing

for  Tamil  programmes either for  the  TV  or  Radio

should be paid lower than those artistes in the other

language programmes. Popularity of programmes  is  no

yardstick  of  the  rate  of  payment.  I  feel  that

performance should be the yardstick.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To earn this meagre sum the artistes have to go

through  six or seven rehearsals and often they  have

to spend a considerable amount of time at the studios

for  rehearsals or waiting for their rehearsals. This

seems  to be rather unfair to the artistes. I suggest

that  a  revision be made of the rate of payment  for

these  Tamil artistes to be paid at the same rate  as

the  artistes  in the other language  groups.  Script

writers  in  the RTS are also paid a different  rate.

Experienced   writers  are  paid  higher   than   the

inexperienced ones. This i~, of course, fair. I  feel

the  same  method  of payment should  also  apply  to

artistes  too.  It  is  rather  unfair  to   pay   an

experienced  and good actor the same rate  as  a  new

hand at the studio.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I want to point out the unequal treatment

given  to  the  1'V  crew of the  Tamil  Section  for

outdoor  shooting. In most cases the Section  is  not

given   a  chance  to  shoot  outdoors  because   the

technicians  and staff of RTS are mostly  engaged  in

the  other language groups. I hope the Minister  will

see  that  fair  treatment  is  given  to  the  Tamil

Section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, quite often there are complaints that the same

artistes  appear  over  and over  again  in  the  RTS

programmes.   It   seems  that  shooting   of   Tamil

programmes  are  done  in most instances  during  the

weekdays.  Therefore,  new  part-time  artistes   are

unable  to  come forward during weekdays  because  of

full-time employment. Weekends are normally  reserved

for Malay and Chinese programmes. Furthermore, if the

excuse  is  that  producers  are  not  available   on

weekends  for the Tamil Section, then I suggest  that

RTS   employ  part-time  producers.  This   is   done

successfully for the Malay programmes.  So  the  same

could  be done for the Tamil programmes too, RTS,  if

necessary, could appeal for recruitment of  part-time

producers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the children's programme also needs improvement.

Week  after  week  the  same setup  is  seen.  It  is  very

artificial.  What you will notice is a person  narrating  a

story, and that's just about it. It seems that this Section

lacks imagination. Perhaps if they could watch some of  the

programmes  like "Sesame Street" on Sundays,  they  may  be

able to get ideas for our children's programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Tamil and Chinese films shown on TV during

the weekdays, no doubt are commendable. But I am afraid the

choice  is rather poor. The films are so old, and it  is  a

well  known fact that some of the actors and actresses  are

no  longer  living.  I also note that  some  of  these  old

Teochew  films  are  constantly repeated.  It  is  time  TV

Singapore acquired more recent films both for the Tamil and

Chinese  sections and, if possible, to screen colour  films

too.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ch'ng is not here. Dr Ong.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Sir, I take this

opportunity  to bring up two points on which  the  Minister

might like to enlighten this House,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is to lend my support to those Members

present  here  who  have  voiced dissatisfaction  with  the

standard  of  production and the lack of sophistication  in

the  direction of programmes that are produced  locally.  I

recognise that our Broadcasting Department is in many  ways

in  the stage of infancy and perhaps, because of a shortage

of  personnel,  we  will not be able just  now  to  produce

programmes  of  a reasonable standard. I am not  trying  to

compare  the  programmes that we have produced  locally  to

those  of  the  NBC  or the BBC. But a better  standard  of

production   would  be  consistent  with   the   stage   of

development,   the   level   of  education,   the   general

sophistication  of  this  country  and  its  people.  I  am

frequently appalled by the programmes, and I would like the

Minister  to  enlighten this House on the  steps  that  the

Broadcasting  Department is taking or shall  be  taking  in

this direction.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter which has been disturbing me is the

fact  that not so long ago an afternoon newspaper came  out

with a headline report which we all discovered later to  be

rather mischievous - I refer to a report which stated  that

Radio  and TV licences were to be increased by two to four-fold.  I recognise that this need not necessarily be within

the  portfolio of the Ministry of Culture. But  one  cannot

deny that the Broadcasting Department is under the Ministry

of Culture.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it turns out today, more than a month later, there has

been  no  increase  in  TV or Radio  licence  fees  and  no

quadrupling  of  the licence fee for colour television,  am

not  saying that we should increase the fee for colour  and

black  and  white  television or radio. I think  we  should

maintain the status quo.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would say that the timing of that release in

the  press  was  very unfortunate in that  it  was  closely

linked with other tax increases in this country. That  gave

rise  to a lot of unhappiness, a lot of talk and a  lot  of

unnecessary problems to various people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have yet to read a statement from the Ministry of

Culture or the Ministry of Finance saying that that  report

was  unfounded  and mischievous. I am beginning  to  wonder

whether  in  fact,  the  Ministry of  Culture  was  quietly

delighted  that  that  report came out  and  therefore  the

public  is "conditioned." so to speak, to further increases

in  licence  fees.  I  suggest  that  if  that  report  was

misleading, as it must be so many weeks after, then  it  is

the  responsibility of the Ministry of Culture to come  out

with  a  statement  refuting the  allegations  and  thereby

clearing the air.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I rise to speak on the

sub-standard performance of the RTS in relation to its News

programmes.  It  is a matter which is entirely  within  the

control  of the RTS and which can be put right without  any

expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to the slipshod manner in which TV News and

Newsreel are broadcast. Wrong pictures are flashed  on  the

screen while some other news captions or reports are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



being read out. A good example would be the TV coverage  of

the  present  Parliamentary session. The  coverage  may  be

creating  an  impression that some of the Members  of  this

House have exchanged names with one another!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is that if the RTS personnel are not

sufficiently conversant with local events and personalities

to  match  pictures and captions of local events,  how  can

they  be  relied upon to do wider coverage of foreign  news

with  which  they  can  be presumed to  be  less  familiar?

Misleading information is worse than no-information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I must thank the Member for

Aljunied   for  bringing  to  my  attention  the  erroneous

identification of MPs in TV coverage. I must apologise  for

this.  I  agree  with him that this is a  slipshod  way  of

presenting  the  photographs of MPs. I  myself  was  rather

annoyed  to see my colleagues appearing on the screen  with

different  names. We will take action on this, and  I  will

get the person responsible for it reprimanded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reply to the very important point regarding TV

licence fees raised by the Member for Kim Seng. My Ministry

has  never put up any proposal for the revision or increase

of  TV  or  Radio licence fees. As Members are  aware,  the

authority  empowered  to  impose taxes  and  to  revise  or

increase licence fees lies with the Ministry of Finance. As

we  all know, the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech

has  not  mentioned anything about the increase  of  TV  or

Radio  licence fees and I think we can take it as confirmed

that there is no increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Member for Kim Seng has gone further to ask

me  that we must make some clarification on this. It is the

New  Nation which has published this speculative report.  I

cannot  be responsible for what the New Nation may  or  may

not  print. If we were to jump up on any speculative report

that   the  newspapers  may  print  and  quickly  issue   a

confirmation or denial on what they print, then life  would

be  very difficult for us in Government. There are hundreds

of  reports  and  stories which the various newspapers  may

print daily, but that does not mean that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



we  have  an obligation to issue any denial or confirmation

of  those reports. This would really be a waste of time. If

a report of a newspaper has not turned out to be the truth,

it  would  be  better to leave it to the  readers  to  take

whatever action they want to. They have themselves  created

this  credibility gap and they will have to answer  to  the

readers.  We  cannot be made responsible for that  kind  of

speculative reports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point which we must make clear. For the sake

of  an efficient Government, we cannot run a Government  by

confirming or denying newspaper reports. Otherwise, we will

have a Government by newspapers and not by a Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong has raised the point about an

incentive  scheme  for  the News  Producers  and  Programme

Producers  in the Broadcasting Department. I am  afraid  we

are not able to consider this at the present moment because

the number of people involved is very small and they are in

a specialised field. It is also very difficult to judge the

performance of a particular person in the production  of  a

programme because in the production of a programme a number

of  people  are  involved. We need a good  coordination  of

supporting staff in order to produce a programme. There  is

someone  in charge of the wardrobes; someone in  charge  of

lighting; the engineers, the script writers and so on.  How

are  we  going  to  judge the performance of  a  particular

person if we were to have this incentive scheme? However, I

am  not saying that we are not going to consider this idea.

As  the  staff of the Broadcasting Department grows and  as

the  method  to  measure  the  performance  of  the  people

concerned  becomes possible, then that may be the  time  to

consider such a scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng has complained of the low

standard  of  production and the lack of sophistication  in

our  programmes. Here I must agree that there is  room  for

improvement.  When he says that the standard of  production

is  low  and  lacks sophistication, I presume  that  he  is

referring  to  the content of the programmes  and  not  the

technical side of the programmes. If the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



engineers and technicians are rated "low" in their standard

of  production, the Member for Kim Seng will not be able to

watch  any programme on the TV screen. He will get a  blank

screen. So I presume he is referring to the content of  the

programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we must agree that the workforce in the

production of programmes is comparatively new to  the  kind

of  media that they are handling and also, with the lack of

good  script writers and directors, it is sometimes  rather

difficult to achieve the degree of sophistication  that  we

want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coupled with this is the lack of professional actors and

actresses  and  good  professional  singers  and   so   on.

Therefore, it is rather difficult to produce a programme of

a very high standard. Most of the actors and actresses that

we engage are amateurs and so their performance, shown side

by  side with imported programmes, like those from the  BBC

or NBC, will show itself to be rather poor. I must say that

making a comparison with imported programmes is not fair if

one  considers the amount of money that foreign TV stations

spend  on  a  particular programme and the amount  that  we

spend on our own production of a programme. There is really

no  comparison  at all. A fairer comparison  would  be  our

programmes   with   those  programmes   produced   by   our

neighbouring  stations. Then the standard of production  of

our programmes would become obvious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has raised this point about

discrimination  against Tamil actors and  singers.  I  must

very seriously point out that there is no discrimination at

all  in  the fees paid to the performers, whether they  are

English-speaking,  Tamil-speaking  or  Malay-speaking   and

whether they appear in a Malay, Chinese or Tamil programme.

There  is no discrimination at all. There is only one table

of  fees in the RTS and that table of fees applies to every

one group. The difference of fees applies to the grades.  I

am  sure the Member will agree that in the case of an actor

there  are the leading actor, supporting actor  and  the

temporary actors



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



who are just one of the crowd in the background - we cannot

pay every one the same fee.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are singers with international reputation.

There  are  also  singers of a low grade.  There  are  also

amateur  singers, and so on. If there is any difference  of

fees  at all, it is based on the grade or according to  the

performance  of the actors, and not based on  the  language

that they speak or according to the programme in which they

appear.  That is complete nonsense. In fact, we  are  doing

what the Member for Anson has suggested

-  that  is to be fair. In the case of The script  writers,

the  experienced script writers get higher  fees  than  the

inexperienced  ones.  The  same  principle  apples  to  the

actors, dancers, singers and others,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also complained of the many rehearsals

needed  for the singers. It is very `unusual for an artiste

or  a singer to be asked to rehearse six or seven times. If

that is so, the artiste or the performer must be a very bad

one and, therefore, requires extra rehearsals. That may  be

the reason why he or she is paid a very low fee. Normally a

good  performer, especially a professional one, needs  only

one or two rehearsals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to outdoor facilities, there is also no

discrimination against the Tamil stream. We  have  a  small

crew  of  outdoor cameramen. With their limited facilities,

they  are  mainly used for the production of  newsreel  and

documentaries. As Members know, newsreels and documentaries

are  transmitted in the four language streams. There is  no

discrimination against the Tamil stream. There is  actually

no  discrimination  at  all. The problem  is  the  lack  of

facilities. Because of this, we have to concentrate on  the

production   of  more  meaningful  programmes,   that   is.

newsreels and educational documentaries,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the children's programmes, I agree that

there  is  room  for improvement. Here again,  it  is  very

difficult to produce a children's programme as children are

unpredictable in their temperament, and it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



very  difficult to coach them. If we compare our children's

programme with Sesame Street. I do not think we can measure

up  to  the quality of that programme because Sesame Street

is   produced  by  an  organisation  specialised   in   the

production of children's educational programmes. Experts in

many  fields are involved in this quality production. I  am

not  saying  that  we should not improve  our  standard  of

production. The Sesame Street production has got a  lot  of

experts  to  support it, for example, educationists, child

psychologists, writers, artists, composers, choreographers.

dramatists;  all  kinds  of  talent  are  involved  in  the

production  of that programme. In our case all we  have  is

the  programme producer or, at the most, the script  writer

or the assistant script writer to do the work,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has asked why we screen films that are very

old.  The RTS has to hire these feature films from the film

producing  companies. Now, we are actually  competing  with

the  cinemas  or  the  film  producing  companies  for  our

audience.  It  is, therefore, only natural that  they  only

allow  us to have films which they think have lost the  box

office  appeal. Most of the films which we  can  hire  from

them are more than 10 years old. Of course, they have spent

millions of dollars to produce the films, and if they think

that  certain  films can still attract the  audience,  they

would keep them for themselves to show them in the cinemas.

They would not want to release them to a television station

because  once the television station has screened the  film

then  everyone would have seen it and the box office appeal

whatever little there is would be lost. It is only  natural

and business-like for these companies to try and prevent us

from getting better films from them. The acquiring of films

is  a  never-ending conflict between a TV station  and  the

film-producing  companies and also the cinemas.  The  film-producing  companies  and  the  cinemas  are  very  closely

connected   with  each  other.  Of  `course,  the   cinemas

themselves are very reluctant to see the TV station getting

all the good films because it means that we are drawing the

audience away from them.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Minister has said that there

is  no discrimination against the Tamil artistes, and  that

it  is  nonsense. I have mentioned about the discrimination

in  the  rates  of payment for the Malay artistes  and  the

Tamil artistes. That also is nonsense! I have already given

the  figures. That also is nonsense! The pictures  screened

are  very  old. That also is nonsense! If the  Broadcasting

Department does not pay more for the films how can  it  get

new  films? It does not want to pay for them. It is willing

to  pay  only $100 and yet it expects to get a new picture.

How  can they get it? Naturally the film companies will not

give  it  to them. There must be a contract with  the  film

companies   to  get  the  films.  That  also  is  nonsense.

Everything is nonsense, and then what happen's?  I  do  not

know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not saying that

everything is nonsense. I was just explaining to the Member

the  facts  of life and the reality of how we  operate.  As

there  was  no  discrimination, I said that it  was  really

nonsense to suggest it, because it did not exist at all  in

our  station. I did not say that what he has said about the

Broadcasting Department screening old films is nonsense. It

is true that we are screening very old films.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already explained why we are screening old films.

It  is not that we do not have the money for new films.  We

have,  but they just could not be found. They are jealously

guarded  by the film companies which want to keep them  for

distribution  to  the  cinemas where they  can  get  better

value.  Only those films which have lost their  box  office

appeal  would  be  released  for  distribution  to  the  TV

stations.  These are films which almost everyone  has  seen

and if they were to be screened in the cinemas no one would

want  to  see.  This does not only happen in Singapore.  It

happens  all over the world. Whether you go to  the  United

States,  Australia, Taiwan, or Japan, you  will  find  that

only the old feature films which are more than 10 years old

are available in the market for screening on TV.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, TV stations counter this practice by producing

their  own  programmes  in their own studios.  The  present

trend is for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



many  TV  stations not to rely very much on  feature  films

from  the film companies. They produce their own films  and

programmes, and because of this they are less vulnerable to

this kind of boycott by the film companies. But since we do

not  have  a  film  industry in Singapore, we  are  really

vulnerable  to this boycott. For instance, where  does  the

Teochew films come from? They come from Hong Kong. That  is

the  only  place which produces Teochew films  and  nowhere

else.  There  is  a limited number of these  films  in  the

market. That is why sometimes we have to use old films  and

sometimes we have to re-screen them. But in most  cases  we

repeat  the  screening only once, whether it is  a  Teochew

film or other films. We do not repeat them many times over,

as the Member for Anson has said.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want an

assurance  from  the  Minister  that  there  will   be   no

discrimination  of  any kind among the Chinese,  Malay  and

Tamil  artistes.  The Minister has said that  there  is  no

discrimination  and that it is nonsense  to  suggest  that.

Will  the Minister give an assurance that there will be  no

discrimination among Chinese, Malay and Tamil artistes? The

Minister  has  already said that, but I want  an  assurance

from him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first and foremost

discrimination does not exist. There is no  such  thing  as

discrimination against Tamil artistes or writers. There  is

no  discrimination. If the Member wants an assurance, I can

give  him my firm assurance that there is not going  to  be

any discrimination at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is what I want.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to raise a

small  point, I do not watch TV very often and I  could  be

wrong.  But the impression I get lately is that  there  has

been    an   increase   in   the   number   of   commercial

advertisements. I can well understand that  if  we  do  not

have so many advertisements, the Government would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



probably  say that the licence fees should go up.  However,

we   ought   to   maintain   a  certain   balance   between

commercialisation and entertainment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of it is that from my point of view and

that  of  many  people,  the  advertisements  seem  to   be

repeating rather too frequently. It is repeated to such  an

extent that we can even hear some of the tunes being hummed

not  only  by children but also by grown-ups.  We  get  the

impression that we are promoting a sort of "Jean and  Coke"

culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to assure this House that

commercial  advertisements will be kept within a reasonable

limit.  Perhaps  the  same  advertisements  should  not  be

repeated  so frequently on the same day or even during  the

short space of half an hour.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, arising from the

reply by the Minister. I must stress that at no time did  I

suggest  that  we  should  have the  same  standard  of  TV

production as the BBC. If only he had listened  to  what  I

said,  he  would  know that I did not at any  time  suggest

that. All that I said was that we should try to improve the

standard  of  production and direction of our  Broadcasting

Department. I asked him if he could inform this House  what

steps  are  being taken to make sure that the  Broadcasting

Department  keeps on improving its standard  of  television

production.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to his reply on the second matter, I must say

that  it  is wonderful to hear from a Member of the Cabinet

that  the  Government  does not  jump  on  any  speculative

report. However, it is my impression, and I am convinced of

this,  that this Government is very sensitive to any public

comment,  It  is  very sensitive to any  criticism  in  the

press.  We  have examples of this. When somebody  writes  a

letter  to a certain press, within a week there is a reply.

I  am  saying  that  the  report which  came  out  in  that

particular  newspaper  was not just a  report  tucked  away

somewhere  in  the  middle pages, it  was  headline  news.

Because of that,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



I  felt  that  it  was appropriate for  Government  to

reply  on  that score. Perhaps we lack a  PRO,  as  my

colleague mentioned here.



<br><br><!-- Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Minister take steps to

correct  the  costumes of the Malay TV artistes?  Most

of  the  lady artistes are scantily dressed?  Some  of

them  are  almost half-naked, looking as if  they  are

feeling  uncomfortably  hot, although  the  studio  is

cool  as  it  is  airconditioned.  The  way  they  are

dressed  seems to suggest that they are  feeling  very

hot.  The impression is that if they are dressed  from

the  waist down, then the upper half is bare.  If  the

upper  half  is dressed then the lower  half  is  very

scantily  covered. If we allow this sort of  thing  to

go  on,  it  means that in future we could  be  seeing

obscene  programmes. All this would lower the  quality

and  standard  of  the  Malay TV  shows.  I  hope  the

Minister will take note of this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, the Member for Jalan Kayu

has   raised  the  point  that  there  are  too   many

advertisements  on  TV.  Advertisements  are   revenue

earners, and the demand for specific screening  times,

of  course, reflects the popularity of the programmes.

The  more  popular  a programme is,  the  greater  the

audience.   Therefore,  if  more  advertisements   are

received  for screening during a particular programme.

it  shows that more people like to see that programme.

The  advertisers naturally want to take  advantage  of

the  wide  audience  and  they  want  to  spend  their

advertising  costs  in as efficient  and  effective  a

manner  as possible, and that is to catch the greatest

number  of  audience. In this case, if  they  were  to

spend  money on TV advertisement, well, I do not think

we  should  refuse them and say that we  do  not  want

their  advertising money, so long as their advertising

filmlets are decent and meet with approved standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What really happens is that an advertiser thinks

that  the  more  his advertisement  is  repeated,  the

better  it would be for the message to be conveyed  to

the  consumer. So they normally pay quite a lot to get

the message across. TV is only a medium offered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



for  use  by the advertisers. We do not want to repeat  the

advertisements or have too many of them, but if  they  keep

on coming, well, it is also difficult to resist them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have different rates for advertising. We have

advertisements  at  the  normal  rate  which  appear  on  a

rotational basis. This means that the advertiser  does  not

mind  whether his advertisement is flashed in the programme

Hawaii  Five-0  or  in a midnight show. For  such  kind  of

advertising,  the  normal rate is applied.  But  where  the

advertiser is very particular about this and wants to catch

the   greatest  number  of  audience  during  a  particular

programme, then he wants his commercials to appear in  that

particular programme. If he wants that, then he has to  pay

a  very  much higher rate. Sometimes it is as  much  as  2�

times the normal rate. So if the advertiser is prepared  to

pay  that exorbitant rate, I think there is no good  reason

to   stop   him,  All  we  have  to  ensure  is  that   the

advertisement,  the  phrases, the  music  in  the  filmlets

conform to the approved standard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai complained about the

costumes of the Malay dancers, We have very strict rules on

costumes.  But we are not strict to the extent of measuring

the  length of the skirt or assess the suitability  of  the

dress  that the artistes wear. We do have some  sort  of  a

strict  code  to  ensure that the costumes for  dancers  or

singers are very decent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng came back on the increase in

licence   fees.   Any  Government  should  be   politically

sensitive.  It must be quick in reacting to any  situation.

But  I  am  not  saying  that we  must  reply  to  all  the

irresponsible speculations. If there are complaints in  the

newspapers and if the officials find that they are  genuine

and  legitimate complaints, then they will reply  promptly.

That  does not mean that irresponsible speculations in  the

newspapers have to be replied, promptly or otherwise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, the Hon. Minister mentioned about

approved  standards.  As far as I  can  see,  there  is  no

approved standard at all, The Hon. Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



for Finance, when he commented on the need to raise the tax

on  tobacco,  said something to the effect that  our  young

people is being enticed into smoking. Up to today the TV is

still  enticing. Although advertisements on cigarettes  are

not  allowed  on radio and TV, advertisements on  cigarette

lighters  are allowed, So what sort of an approved standard

is   it?  Should  we  not  consider  the  side  effect   of

advertisements on our younger generation? If we are running

it  purely  on commercial lines. I say, yes, we  are  doing

very well. If more people want to advertise, well and good,

the  Government makes move money. But I think we  ought  to

consider what sort of effect these advertisements will have

on  our younger generation. If the Minister goes round,  he

can   hear   kids  humming  the  tune  of  "Levi's   second

generation"  or  "Coca Cola". This is the sort  of  culture

that we are promoting.



<br><br><!-- Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, as

regards Malay artistes and those from the Muslim community,

their  costumes should not be compared with those  artistes

who  are  non-Muslims. So I would like to  suggest  to  the

Minister  concerned that the costumes  used  by  the  Malay

artistes  should  be  decided by  the  Malay  TV  officials

themselves.  This would obviate any misunderstanding  among

the Muslim community. I hope the Minister will take note of

this,



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to

bring  up the matter of commercial advertisements under  my

amendment  but  it  has already been brought  up  by  other

Members. Sir, on advertisements. I entirely agree with  the

Member for Jalan Kayu. Just now the Minister said that if a

company is prepared to pay a high advertising rate, it will

increase  our  revenue  and that it is  very  difficult  to

refuse  the advertisement. This is not correct. If  a  very

big  company  is willing to pay a very high price  for  the

whole   lot   of   advertising  time  for  its   commercial

advertisements,  like what the Member for  Jalan  Kayu  has

said, the Jean



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



and  Coke  culture,  where you see the  youngsters  swaying

their  hips  along  the road, this is no  good.  This  will

affect  our second generation. This will lead to a  lot  of

trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are other certain commercial advertisements

like Mortem insecticide, The advertisement says it does not

harm  human  beings. But we know that insecticide  contains

DDT,  and it is poisonous. This is no good. This is  not  a

healthy commercial advertisement. The Programmes Section of

TV Singapore must select and censor such advertisements. If

we  do  not  have such censorship or selection,  then  such

advertisements   will  harm  our  people.   Otherwise   the

advertisers will take Singaporeans to be idiots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch on national campaigns. We have

a  lot  of  slogans  such as those on  National  Day  which

stimulate  our people to respond to our national  call  for

economic  development  and social  progress.  Such  slogans

should  be  included  in  our TV  programmes  as  often  as

possible. In addition, there are organisations that work in

the  society for meaningful purposes. For example, the  MCs

and  CCCs offer scholarships, bursaries and so on and  also

there  are  other commercial and professional organisations

which  also  have  got scholarships, bursaries  to  develop

academic  pursuits and talent for our country. TV Singapore

should capture and publicise all these awards including the

award  ceremony so that the people are made aware  of  such

events as they are good for our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also a lot of heroic acts. For example, someone

has saved a life; this taxi-driver has found a lot of money

from  his taxi and has returned all of it to the owner.  We

should  publicise and encourage such acts  of  heroism  and

honesty in our TV programmes so that the younger generation

and  all  other  members of our society will be  inculcated

with the right attitude and sense of social responsibility.

This is good for the society and is important.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in the process of nation building. We should

instil in our people a liking for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



work  and service. I think our TV programme should also  in

this   respect   stimulate  our  younger  generation   into

developing  this  trait for work and  service,  perhaps  by

devising  some slogans in this direction. Though we  cannot

get  money  by refusing commercial advertisements,  we  can

make  up  by  better  usage of the time  to  stimulate  the

correct  value  and attitude among our younger  generation.

This  will be relevant and conducive to the well being  and

productivity  of our country. This will also  be  of  great

help in our future development.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, after

hearing  all this. I feel a bit excited and would  like  to

say  a  few  words.  Money is important  in  this  society.

Without  money a lot of things cannot be done. There  is  a

saying  that even if you want to spend money, there has  to

be a purpose. If there is too much money, it is not so good

either.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching on TV advertisements, can it not be arranged

that  commercial advertisements come either before or after

the programme, and not interrupting the programme every few

minutes?  Perhaps  this would not  give  rise  to  so  many

complaints from the viewers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I

support what the previous speakers have said. In regard  to

commercial  advertisements, of  course, we  have  to   be

business-minded.  The  Minister has  said.  "the  more  the

better".  If  there are too many commercial advertisements,

then  the  whole night through there will be advertisements

in  our  programmes,  and  there will  be  an  unfavourable

reaction, resulting in fewer viewers and we will  not  have

enough  audience to attract advertisements and  there  will

not  be  enough commercial advertisements. As a result,  in

time to come, we will not make a profit. This goes round in

a  circle and is a very interesting topic. We must consider

this  problem carefully. Just now the Member for Jalan Kayu

has brought up the matter and I have not heard a very clear

reply to that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must have a certain proportion of commercial

advertisements in our programmes. Nevertheless, there  must

be a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



yardstick. For example, in one hour of programme, how  many

commercial  advertisements should we allow, We should  also

be fair to the advertisers, If we just take their money and

not  consider their interest, it would appear that this  is

not very honest. So I hope the Minister has a very balanced

judgment  with  regard  to  commercial  advertisements.  He

should pay regard to the requirement of the viewers as well

as  the advertisers, We should have a good balance in  this

regard.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, as much as we want to have more

revenue, we do also see to it that our programme  is  of  a

good   quality  and  that  the  advertisement   commercials

appearing on TV screens are of a decent nature. We have  no

control on the products that they want to sell except those

which  are  prohibited  by law, for  instance,  cigarettes,

tobacco and so on. They are not allowed to be advertised on

TV  or over the radio or in any newspaper. So long as  they

have a product to sell and the commercial is presented in a

decent manner, conforming to the approved standard, we will

allow them to advertise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a code in RTS for the type of song and the length

of hair and so on, all described in great detail. There are

certain things that we accept and certain things that we do

not.  We do not control the kind of product that they  want

to  sell. So long as the commercial is of a decent  nature,

there  is  no reason why we should not accept  it,  As  the

Member  for  Kampong Kapor has pointed out,  sometimes  the

commercials  are  of  a very childish nature;  Mortem,  for

instance,  They take the people of Singapore to be  idiots.

But   if  the  products  that  they  are  selling  are  not

prohibited,  there is no reason why we have  to  turn  them

down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any one-hour programme there is a maximum of three

breaks.  In  each  there can be as  many  as  five  or  six

commercials. In any case, the length of commercials is such

that  it  should not tip the balance of good programmes  in

favour  of  these  commercials. We try to maintain  a  very

strict  balance on this. I do not think that  we  have  too

many commercials in our programmes. Maybe the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



Member  is  referring to those very popular programmes  and

since, as I have said, many advertisers want to pay  a  lot

more  to  take  full  advantage of the  popularity  of  the

programmes,  it appears that there are a lot of commercials

in  those  programmes. If one were to switch  over  to  the

other  programmes, like documentaries or programmes  of  an

educational  value, then one can hardly see any commercials

at  all.  There  are certain programmes which  specifically

exclude  commercials, say, a programme  of  educational  or

cultural  value. There are no commercials at all  appearing

in these programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the suggestion by the Member for Bras Basah that

we  should have the commercials either before or after  the

programme, it is rather difficult to implement this because

the advertisers are not stupid, If they have to spend their

money, they want to spend it wisely. They all know that  if

we  are  to  put  all the commercials as suggested  by  the

Member, then the audience would not switch on and view  the

advertisements before the programme and wait  to  see  more

commercials  before switching it off. So it would  come  to

nothing. The advertisers want to catch the attention of the

audience and there is no better way of doing this  than  to

flash their commercials during a programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the Member for Kampong Kapor for putting various

suggestions  as  to  how the TV programmes  can  be  better

utilised by including reports of the various activities  in

the  constituencies. I think the constituencies  are  given

quite a lot of coverage in this respect, like the functions

organised by the Citizens' Consultative Committees  or  the

Management Committees of community centres. They are  given

prominence  in the newsreels. Although we may not  want  to

make  these  as feature films, now and then he can  see  in

Newsreel people being awarded for scholarships from the CCC

members   or   even  from  Members  of  Parliament.   These

activities do get some coverage on TV in Newsreel.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the slogans on National Day that we should

emphasise on TV. I say that we want to convey this  message

across  to the public but we will have to do it in  a  more

subtle  way than just blaring it through the radio and  TV.

On  the  occasion of the National Day celebrations we  have

these  slogans  painted  on banners  and  hung  across  the

street.  But if we want to convey the message daily, there

are  more subtle ways than just flashing the slogans on the

TV screen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of the newsreaders over TV and radio,

particularly in the Tamil and English sections -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Govindaswamy, are you going to repeat

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> No, Sir. This is a different point.

Sir,   some   of  the  newsreaders  over  TV   and   radio,

particularly  in the Tamil and English sections,  make  far

too  many  mistakes. Some of the readers, particularly  the

new recruits, seem to make terrible mistakes. I wonder what

is  the  basis of selection of newsreaders. How  are  these

people selected? How are they trained, and for how long are

they  trained  before they are put on the  job  before  the

camera  or  the  microphone? Could the Minister  elaborate?

Last night when the speech of the Member for Henderson  was

broadcast  over  TV  the  photograph  of  the  Member   for

Sembawang was flashed over the TV screen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I could not agree with the Member

for  Anson more that the standard of our newsreaders is far

from perfect. In fact, this has been a serious problem  and

is  rated very high among our priorities for improvement of

the standard of the broadcasting. The problem is that it is

not  easy  to get the right kind of people for training  as

newsreaders. A good newsreader is not someone whom you  can

pick  up  from any one of the school leavers and train  him

for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be a good newsreader, first, he must have a very good

voice.  Second, having that voice, he must be  able  to  go

through  a  course  of'  education  and  acquire   a   good

pronunciation  and good diction either in  English.  Tamil,

Malay or Mandarin. After this, he must also be prepared  to

be  trained  as a newsreader. Even with all these  aptitude

tests,  it  is sometimes difficult to get the right  person

for the job. I will give an example of how difficult it  is

for us to get good news readers.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, in the last recruitment exercise held in

March  last  year  for Tamil newsreaders. 206  applied  for

audition  and,  of  that  number, 179  turned  up  for  the

audition,  and only one passed. After further  training  he

was put on the air. Because of this poor result and because

of the need, for newsreaders, 13 who had shown some promise

in  the  audition were selected to undergo training.  After

three months of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



coaching, nine failed to make any satisfactory progress and

had  to be rejected. Out of the remaining four, three  have

improved  considerably and have since been  placed  on  the

newsreading  roster. The other one is still under  training

and may eventually make the grade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of English newsreaders, an exercise was

conducted in April last year for part-time newsreaders. 914

applied  for auditioning but only 714 turned up,  and  only

eight  were found acceptable for training. Of these  eight,

only  two so far have been found satisfactory and they  are

now rostered for newsreading. Of the remaining six, one has

already been found not suited for newsreading and the other

has  informed RTS that he is not interested in the job  any

more. So that leaves us with only four persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not that we are not conscious of this need for a

good  standard  of  newsreading,  and  we  are  continually

endeavouring to search for the right people with the  right

voice   and  with  good  pronunciation  for  the   job   of

newsreaders,  but  such people are not available.  Why  are

they  not  available? I do not know. Maybe  it  is  because

English  is  not the mother tongue of the majority  of  our

people.  We  also find that even those who  come  from  the

English  stream  are unable to pronounce correctly.  It  is

possible  that  when they were in school  they  might  have

acquired  a  poor pronunciation, and have not attempted  to

correct their speech and so on. This makes it difficult for

us to select good newsreaders. But in any case we are still

trying  and are sparing no efforts to get the right  people

for proper training to become newsreaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the reply given by the Minister to the

queries raised by previous speakers, I think I am beginning

to  understand why the People's Association is  so  profit-conscious. The People's Association, if I am not  mistaken,

should be people-orientated, that is, catered to the  needs

of  the people at the ground level. I am not sure that this

Association, as it is now, is an association of the people.

by the people, but it is definitely not for the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will quote one incident to show why I am so

disappointed  with the present development of the  People's

Association. On one occasion, a community leader telephoned

an  official  of  the People's Association  to  confirm  an

earlier arrangement for a cultural show in connection  with

a  public function to be attended by an MP. The reply  from

the  Association  was, "You pay the $300  first, otherwise

there will not be any show in the evening." Sir, this  kind

of  attitude prevails not only among the officials  in  the

People's Association but also generally among the staff  of

the civil service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we let this trend of behaviour to go unchecked, I

am afraid the People's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



Association  will end up as an association  without  people

or, better, to rename it, the Bureaucrats Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the Citizens' Consultative Committees, we have

this  zoning called the District Secretariat to  facilitate

the  meeting  of  the  Chairmen  of  various  CCCs  of  the

neighbouring constituencies so as to get them to  know  one

another, For the Youth group, the People's Association also

has  the  same sort of zoning for grouping leaders  of  the

Youth group from the neighbouring constituencies, But those

in   between,   namely,  the  members  of  the   Management

Committees, do not have this kind of zoning or grouping.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to ask the Minister whether he has any plans

for this sort of zoning or grouping so that the Chairmen of

the  Management  Committees of neighbouring  constituencies

can get together once a month or once in a fortnight at the

meeting table so as to know one another better.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker Sir, in order to encourage

cultural  activities the People's Association has formed  a

cultural  troupe  to  give  cultural  performances  in  the

various community centres and the constituencies, In  order

to  recover  costs  for  transport  and  other  very  small

expenses  the People's Association charges a token  fee  of

$300 for each performance. Each cultural troupe consists of

at least 60 to 80 people and they perform for a duration of

two  hours.  I would say this is a reasonable rate  because

$300 is not enough to pay for these part-time performers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rate of $300 was laid down in 1971 and since then it

has   never  been  revised  in  spite  of  inflation,   NWC

increments  and  so  on.  So  the  $300  charge  for   each

performance  is only a token fee, If they were required  to

pay the full fee. I think it should be much more than that.

It  is  a  very  far cry to say that because  the  People's

Association  has levied $300 per performance, it  has  lost

the support of the people and that it is not an association

for  the  people. This money is just a token fee to  ensure

that  the  organisers are really interested  in  organising

these cultural shows



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



and that they do put in an effort to get the people to come

and watch these shows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could be that the attitude of the Association's

officials in demanding the money is not so diplomatic.  But

the  fact still remains that for every cultural show a  fee

has  got  to be paid. Otherwise when the show is  over  and

when  the  people  have all left, the People's  Association

will be left with nothing to recover expenses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Sir, I do not think the Minister has

understood  me  correctly. I did not ask for free  cultural

shows.  I  am  querying the attitude of  "pay  first,  show

later",  I  am  querying  this sort  of  mentality  of  the

officials of the People's Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the Minister has answered another point. I

was  asking whether he has got plans for zoning or grouping

the  Chairmen of the various Management Committees together

at a monthly meeting. He did not answer that point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know about

this  incident  of "pay first, show later".  But  the  fact

remains  that  there  is this charge  of  $300.  Maybe  the

attitude  of  the  officials is not correct  but  the  fact

remains that someone has got to pay the fee,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the regional grouping of the Management Committees, I

do not know whether or not it is desirable. This has got to

be  studied  carefully. It may be that  certain  Management

Committees like to be grouped together and form a  regional

council,  but I do not think the Management Committees  can

be  compared  with the Youth groups. The Youth  groups  are

grouped  into  several  regions and they  form  a  regional

council  because  they have more or less similar  types  of

activities.  For the sake of efficiency and  also  for  the

sake of promoting the activities, it is found necessary  to

have  the Youth groups grouped into several regions. But  I

do not know whether this could be applied to the Management

Committees. We will certainly give this a thought and study

it  carefully. If it is found desirable and  good  for  the

efficient

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment I merely want to seek

information as to what are the cultural organisations  that

are on the Contribution roll under this vote.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the main

functions  of the People's Association is to encourage  our

youths   to   participate  in  meaningful   activities.   I

understand  that  the People's Association  has  now  about

16,000 members enrolled in its Youth section. Recently,  at

a  military tattoo display, the Youth section was asked  to

perform  one  item involving 128 persons, As the  officials

could  not get the required number of persons from  amongst

their  1  6,000 Youth membership, they had to  force  their

Centre  staff  and kindergarten teachers to participate  in

the military display.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to know how much does the People's

Association  spend  each  year on the  Youth  groups.  What

percentage of the 1 6,000 Youth members are really active?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also understand that the People's Association

employs  about 20 full-time dancers and about 100 part-time

dancers  for their cultural troupe. What is the purpose  of

employing   such   a  large  troupe  of  dancers   at   the

Association's headquarters? Would it not be more beneficial

if  these  paid dancers were sent to the various  community

centres  to recruit more people to participate in  cultural

dances  and to conduct classes at the different centres?  I

feel  it  should  not be the policy of the  Association  to

maintain  a semiprofessional dance troupe. This  should  be

left to the different cultural organisations. On the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



other hand, the People's Association dance troupe should be

used  to  popularise our culture at the different community

centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the present situation is continued, then I feel that

the  community  centre  will not be able  to  organise  any

cultural  activities, as the incentives given to the  semi-professionals  at  the  Association headquarters  are  much

greater than what the community centres can provide,



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, in reply to the Member for

Jurong's   question   on  the  contribution   to   cultural

organisations.  I would briefly say that, firstly,  the  Ee

Lian  Dramatic Society was given a grant of $1,500 to  help

it  to stage a play at the Victoria Theatre. Secondly,  the

National  Book  Development Council was given  a  grant  of

$1,000 to enable it to update the survey conducted in  1969

on  book  development activities in Singapore.  Thirdly,  a

grant  of  $700  was given to the newly formed  Society  of

Singapore Writers to assist it in its production of a multi-lingual  newsletter for its members, This is a  very  small

contribution. Whatever grant the Ministry gives is  only  a

token gesture. It is hoped that these grants will encourage

the  members of the various societies to pursue their  aims

and objectives, for cultural activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has raised a question on the

People's  Association Youth group. In March last year, the

People's   Association  was  asked  to  send  a   team   to

participate  in  the  1975 military tattoo  display  to  be

staged  at  the  National  Stadium  for  the  National  Day

celebrations. This exercise requires perfectly synchronised

movements  and  at  least about 30 training  sessions  were

necessary  to  achieve a good display. Most of  the  youths

taking  part  in this display were employed  and  they  had

their own activities also, It was, therefore, difficult  to

find a group of 128 persons from the Youth group willing to

attend regularly the 30 training sessions. As a result,  it

was   found  that  for  the  sake  of  putting  up  a  good

performance it was necessary for the Centre staff and  some

kindergarten teachers to participate in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



military  tattoo,  as they were able to  attend  rehearsals

regularly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the amount of money spent on the Youth group

for  the  last  and current financial years,  the  People's

Association was given a provision of $40,000 as subsidy for

more than 80 Youth groups which have a total membership  of

20,000.  At  present there are a total of 1,206 members  in

the  People's Association Youth Movement serving as  office

bearers in the 82 Youth Executive Committees. The range  of

activities  varies  with the different Youth  groups.  Some

activities draw more participants than the others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained to Members just now, the People's

Association maintains a cultural troupe. It does not have a

large  number of full-time dancers, as the Member for Anson

has suggested. It has only 14 full-time dancers and 40 part-time  dancers.  The amount of money spent on  them  is,  in

fact, very small, especially on the part-time dancers. They

get  a nominal allowance of $3 per session. The purpose  of

keeping  this group of dancers in the People's  Association

is  to  meet the demand for cultural performances from  the

various  community centres in the constituencies.  It  also

wants  to keep this cultural troupe as a nucleus of dancers

in  order  to  maintain a high standard. At the  same  time

these dancers can be sent to the community centres to teach

the   people   the  art  of  dancing  and  other   cultural

activities. In fact, this small group of fill-time  dancers

are given training in the People's Association headquarters

by  professional  choreographers and other  instructors  to

upgrade  the  standard of their performances. Not  only  do

they  participate  in the cultural shows,  they  also  give

instruction  at the community centres. After  learning  the

art  of dancing from the professional choreographers,  they

are  sent  to  the community centres to teach  the  younger

people  there  the art of dancing. There is,  therefore,  a

dual purpose in maintaining this cultural troupe. First, it

is to upgrade the standard of the performances and meet the

demand for cultural performances at the constituency  level

and, secondly, by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



becoming dance instructors they can pass on their knowledge

and skill to the people in the community centres.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to

take  this  opportunity  to ask the  Minister  whether  the

cultural  troupe  in  the People's Association  is  put  on

circuit  performances, Circuit performances  have  received

good  response from the public. The various items in  these

cultural   shows  are  very  interesting,   which   include

performances by the Girl Piper Band, folk dancing, singing

and  the  various dance items. These cultural  performances

have   attracted   more  than  1,000   spectators   in   my

constituency.



<br><br>6.10 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>This   proves   that   these  cultural   performances   are

appreciated  by  the  people. If the  cultural  troupe  can

perform in the various constituencies, this may be one  way

to  promote cultural activities at the grassroot  level.  I

hope  the  People's Association will send  bigger  cultural

troupes to perform in the various community centres in  the

constituencies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Sir, does the People's Association

intend  to  replace  the street wayang with  this  cultural

troupe?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Sir, I think the Minister has not yet

given the full list of the organisations which receive  the

cultural  grants.  I  have added the total  figure  of  the

grants  which he quoted just now but they do not equal  the

total figure as shown in the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister what is the basis

of  giving a grant to a cultural organisation, and  whether

consideration will be given to other cultural organisations

should they apply for these grants.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the grants

given to cultural organisations do not necessarily add  up,

because  it is not necessary for us to actually  spend  all

the  money. If there is no application for a subsidy,  then

the grant is not given.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, any application for a grant is carefully

considered  and if there is a deserving case the  grant  is

given.  Of  course, there are more societies  applying  for

grants  than  we  have  the money to give,  and  we  cannot

satisfy  all  of  them. Therefore,  we  can  only  grant  a

contribution rather sparingly. We have given quite a lot of

money  to the various organisations and normally we try  to

see  that  these monies are properly expended. If they  are

not  spent, the surplus money will be put  back  into  the

Consolidated Fund.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the Member for Sembawang for his views on the

cultural troupe. I agree that it is very popular but it  is

also  costly to run the shows. We have tried to give  these

performances in the various constituencies, but I am afraid

that   this   cannot   be  done  because   there   are   65

constituencies and if we hold one performance a  month  for

each  constituency, then on the average it  would  take  65

months  before  we  can give a repeat performance  in  each

constituency.  I  must  say that members  of  the  cultural

troupe  have a very busy schedule on their hands. They  are

fully  booked for the various occasions such as the Chingay

procession,  the National Day parades, and many  others.  I

must say that their work and their services have been taxed

to the full.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Sir, the Minister has not answered my

question yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, regarding the Member's question,

there  is  no intention of staging wayangs by the  People's

Association  because  maintenance of this  cultural  troupe

alone  is more than it can afford. Moreover, the wayang  is

something which should be left to the wayang operators.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Sir, could the Minister tell the House

how does a cultural organisation qualify for a grant? Could

he tell us the criteria? In what manner can an organisation

apply for contributions?

<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be reduced by $10 with respect of subhead AAA 8301*. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr Yeo Toon Chia and Dr Chiang Hai Ding.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not so long ago, community centres were built

entirely  by  the People's Association for the  benefit  of

residents living in the respective areas, I am not making a

value  judgment  of the community centres.  Although  there

have  been  some  criticisms of the role community  centres

play  in  a  given environment. I am convinced  that  given

proper  leadership, community centres can have a tremendous

impact  on  our  society. The need  for  community  centres

cannot be denied, In fact, community centres of today  must

be  better  equipped, well laid out and offering facilities

for  a variety of activities that would cater for the needs

of the young as well as the old.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although community centres used to be built by the

Government  in the past, in recent years the  bulk  of  the

funds  for  building  these community centres  have  to  be

raised  by the residents themselves. I do not quarrel  with

the   concept  of  community  participation  and  financial

involvement in a project that would serve their own  needs.

But   my   complaint  is:  to  what  extent   should   this

participation  take  place? I advocate  that  the  People's

Association and the community leaders of an area,  where  a

community  centre  is to be built, must  sit  together  and

decide  on  the  minimum facilities needed in  a  community

centre  for any given locality. Once this is decided,  then

the funds for the building of the centre should be provided

by  the People's Association. If the community leaders want

to improve on the minimum provisions provided, if they want

to  improve  facilities, if they want to make their  centre

more   attractive,  etc., then,  they  should  raise   the

additional funds.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present policy, it appears, is that even for a key

community  centre in a constituency, the bulk of the  funds

has  to be raised by the constituents with a minimal  grant

from the People's Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Telok Blangah there were six community centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An Hon. Member:</b> More than enough!



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> You have not heard the story yet. Four

centres  have already been demolished and one more is  also

going  in a month's time. The only remaining one is  to  be

demolished  in about two years' time. Now to  build  a  key

community  centre  in the constituency, not  more  than  $1

51)000  is  forthcoming. For a high density new  town  what

kind  of  a community centre can a $1 50,000 grant  provide

that could cater for the needs of the young as well as  the

old?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, let me avail myself

of this opportunity to inform the Minister how the People's

Association  carries  out  its under-cover  activities.  In

September  or  October  last year, in  order  to  meet  the

requirements of the Building Control Division, in  respect

of  the construction of a rubbish collecting centre and  so

qualify   for  a  certificate  of  fitness,  the   People's

Association did not consult the Management Committee on the

CC  officials. They decided to build the rubbish collecting

centre by the side of the cooking c ass at a cost of  about

$1,600. They notified the Management Committee about this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a meeting, the Management Committee felt that the

rubbish  centre  should  not be built  beside  the  cooking

classroom  as the ground there is used for tea parties  and

other  functions, and especially in the evenings when  many

people come to this place for recreation. So the Management

Committee suggested that the rubbish ground should be built

on  a  site adjacent to the sewing classroom on the  night.

The  Association  replied that if  the  rubbish  collecting

centre  was  sited elsewhere, it would require a  new  plan

from the architects







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



and  this  would delay the construction and would  also

mean   an   increase   in  costs,  and   the   People's

Association  had  no  money. So unless  the  Management

Committee   was  prepared  to  foot  the  bill,   their

suggestion  could  not  be  approved.  Sir,   such   an

arrogant   and  harsh  reply  on  the   part   of   the

Association  was really uncalled for.  To  raise  funds

for  a rubbish centre, the CC considered following  the

example of other CCs by staging a concert where  famous

singing  stars could be invited to take part and  where

senior  officers from the People's Association together

with  other  luminaries could also  attend, and  there

would  be  no problem of raising enough money to  build

20  to  30  rubbish  centres.  However,  the  high  and

haughty People's Association did not come to help,  and

moreover,  the  Management Committee did  not  want  to

bend  themselves so low as to be sycophantic  in  their

attitude.   Therefore, nothing  came   out   of   that

proposal. Since the People's Association said they  had

no   money,   therefore,   the   Management   Committee

suggested that the People's Association should ask  the

Minister  for Finance, through the Ministry of Culture,

to  allocate  the necessary funds for the  building  of

the rubbish centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under my amendment, I would like the Minister

to  explain why the sum of $348,500 out of last  year's

allocation for CCs was not utilised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under FY 76, there is an allocation of $1 .1 million

for  the  use  of community centres. I would  like  the

Minister  to  tell us whether a rubbish centre  for  my

constituency  costing  about  a  thousand  dollars   is

included under such allocation, so that in the end  the

Building  Control  Division will be  able  to  issue  a

certificate of fitness for the whole building.  I  have

to  seize this opportunity to make a direct plea to the

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of this year, the Management

Committee  wrote  to  the People's Association  to  say

that  the lighting for the basketball court was  always

out  of  order  due to some fault with the  underground

cables.  Repairs would cost about $3,000 to $5,000.  In

order  to  prevent a short circuit of those underground

cables and lamp-posts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



and  thus  endangering people who frequent  the  basketball

court,  I  would like the Minister to direct  the  People's

Association  to  take  immediate  measures  to  repair  the

lighting   system,   and  to  ensure  that   the   People's

Association does not delay by making any excuses. If anyone

is  electrocuted in the meantime, remedial action  will  be

too late and the consequences will be tragic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Sir, when Leng Kee constituency was

born  in  1972, it inherited a fairly substandard community

centre,  As a start, I thought the Centre could  serve  its

purpose and that I would be spared the effort of building a

new  one.  But  sometime last year  we  were  told  by  the

People's   Association  that  in  view  of  urban   renewal

development, the community centre has got to go. I think it

has  joined  the fate of the five community centres  of  my

good Friend, the Hon. Member for Telok Blangah. I have just

received the estimates from the People's Association  panel

of  architects, which show that the new Centre is going  to

cost   $1.6  million.  At  present,  the  dollar-for-dollar

contribution from the People's Association, has  a  ceiling

of  $150,000.  I  fully support the Hon. Member  for  Telok

Blangah  that with $150,000 you can hardly build a  hut.  I

would  therefore  like the Minister  to  inform  the  House

whether  or  not  there is a possibility  of  the  People's

Association's  contribution  being  increased  to  a   more

meaningful figure.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, the People's Association is not a

revenue-producing statutory board. Unlike  other  statutory

boards,  it has no power to levy taxes or impose  rates  on

the  services it provides. Its only asset, whatever it  is,

is   the  goodwill  of  the  people.  The  money  for   the

development project of the People's Association is supplied

by  the  Ministry  of  Finance, and therefore  its  use  is

strictly controlled by the Treasury.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, the People's Association has

relied   heavily  on  public  contributions  for   whatever

additional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>



community centres or facilities it requires. The Government

pays, as Members know, a subsidy to the building fund on  a

dollar-for-dollar basis up to a maximum of $150,000  for  a

key  community centre. However, it now seems that this form

of  fund  raising has put a heavy strain on  the  time  and

energy  of  Members of Parliament and also on the community

leaders. Since there are many fund-raising campaigns  going

on  at  any one time, competition is very keen and moreover

because of the slowing down of the economy in the past  few

years  donations  are  not so forthcoming  as  in  previous

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is no cause for despair. Community leaders

should  make  a  greater effort to reach  the  target.  The

People's   Association's   policy   of   inviting    public

participation  in  fund-raising campaigns  to  finance  its

projects will carry on. First, this form of fund-raising is

good because it gives community leaders something to do and

also make them enthusiastic about their work. Secondly,  it

creates more interest in community centre work. As a result

of   their   fund-raising  campaign  the  whole  management

committee of the Centre will be made aware of the need  and

the  kind  of  activities that the community centre  should

have.  Thirdly, it makes them proud of their work and  they

would  be  more willing to come forward to look  after  the

Centre  and  also  to guard it against vandalism,  if  ever

there is any.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in view of the rapid changes due to urban

renewal and also housing projects in the next few years, we

have  to  accelerate the pace of community centre  building

projects  to  meet our future requirements. Many  community

centres in the old areas are affected by urban renewal.  As

the  Member  for Telok Blangah has so rightly pointed  out,

many  of  these  old centres are affected by these  housing

projects  or urban renewals and therefore they have  to  be

pulled down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve these targets, additional funds are required.

Owing to the high cost of building construction, it is  not

possible to rely so much on public donations, The Board of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



the  People's Association has therefore recently  submitted

certain proposals to the Treasury and they are in the midst

of  a  series  of negotiations. I hope that the  sentiments

expressed  by the Members of Parliament here in this  House

will add their weight to the Association's arguments, and I

am  sure  Members'  opinions and views  will  be  seriously

considered by the Ministry of Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Planning Committee of the People's

Association  has made a study of its requirements  for  the

next  five  years. Based on the number of  housing  estates

that  the Housing and Development Board and the Jurong Town

Corporation are going to build in the next five years,  and

also  based  on the ratio of 40,000 persons to a  community

centre, the People's Association estimated that they  would

require at least 28 new community centres for the whole  of

Singapore over the next five years to meet the requirements

of the new housing estates. In addition, they would require

another  27 new centres to replace the old ones which  have

to  be  knocked  down,  like those in Telok  Blangah,  Bras

Basah,  or  Leng Kee constituencies. These old centres  are

either  affected  by  urban renewal, or  are  in  very  bad

condition  and  therefore have to be pulled  down, or  are

presently housed in the Housing and Development Board  shop

premises, which  are not really adequate  or  suitable  as

community  centres. So in replacing these 27 old  community

centres, together with building 28 new centres, a total  of

55  community  centres will be required in  the  next  five

years.  Based  on a very modest cost of $300,000  for  each

community  centre,  we  will  require  something  like  $16

million  just  for the construction of these  centres,  not

including the cost of land acquisition. The amount is quite

substantial.  The People's Association's proposals  to  the

Government  for the construction of a Community  Centre  at

$300,000  each cover what we call the basic core  structure

of  a centre on the new site. The basic core structure will

include  a hall, office, storeroom, basket ball court,  and

so on, leaving all the additional facilities to be provided

later  by the usual fund-raising campaigns. In other words,

we are asking the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>



Treasury  to  allow us to have at least an initial  sum  of

money  for  us  to begin. The Centre must at least  have  a

place on which to operate, and if any additional facilities

are   required  the  community  leaders  should  go   round

collecting funds. We hope the Government would be  able  to

give  dollar-for-dollar subsidy up to a maximum of $150,000

for each Centre. Although this is a very substantial sum of

money,  we  hope  that  this  proposal  can  be  favourably

considered.  But, of course, there are other priorities  to

be  considered by the Ministry of Finance, though I  cannot

speak  for them. In any case we are fighting very  hard  to

obtain the necessary funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kapor raised the matter about the

dustbin  in  his community centre. I think there  has  been

some  misunderstanding here. It is not that we do not  want

to spend the money. The question is that we do not have the

money  to spend. The $300,000 that he mentioned is actually

meant  for development purposes. The grant as shown in  the

Development  Estimates  is  to be  used  for  building  new

community  centres or new projects. Any other  expenditure,

such  as  repairs or the construction of a  bin  collecting

centre  will  have  to  come from the Main  Estimates.  The

construction  of  the  bin centre at  the  site  originally

proposed  involves a sum of $4,000. In fact,  the  People's

Association  has  agreed  to  pay  this  $4,000   but   the

Management  Committee wanted to re-site it somewhere  else,

for  which an additional $2,000 is required. Unfortunately,

at that time the Association had little funds left for this

kind  of  work,  and  so  it  had  been  suggested  to  the

Management  Committee that in order to get  the  work  done

quickly  this additional sum of $2,000 should be paid  from

the Management Committee fund. But the Management Committee

turned   down  the  Association's  proposal.  The  People's

Association had to wait for this year's allocation of funds

because they have already gone to the bottom of the  barrel

for funds. That is the position.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, may I put forward a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



Minister  to  help him reduce the financial burden  in  the

construction of new community centres?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all Housing Board estates there is provision for the

construction  of  recreational and  sports  facilities  and

swimming pools, which are subsequently handed over  to  the

Sports  Council. May I suggest to the Minister to  make  an

approach  to the Housing Board to include the provision  of

community centre sites in their overall planning. This will

help him to reduce his financial burden.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, the Housing Board normally sets

aside  a  piece  of  land for community development.  There

again,  we have to decide whether we have the money to  pay

for  the  land. The matter of finance comes in. It  is  not

just  that they give you a piece of land. You have  to  pay

for  it. According to the estimates, it costs about $5  per

square foot.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> It is true that the People's

Association  has to pay for the land based on current  land

rate.  What  I am suggesting to the Minister is  this:  why

cannot   the  Minister  negotiate  with  the  Housing   and

Development  Board for special terms and  get  it  free  of

charge for social services?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> That will be ideal only if they agree

to  give us free of change. But every one has to show  some

sense  of economic effectiveness. There is the question  of

accountability, and every department has got to account for

its  own  expenditure. If the Housing Board is prepared  to

give  us  land free of change, then, of course, we will  be

very happy to accept. On the other hand, whether it is  the

Housing  Board, the People's Association, or the  Treasury.

that gives the money, the money comes from the same source.

that  we  want,  but his money. In any case,  we  wish  him

success  in his negotiations with the Minister for Finance.

If  he  wants  any  assistance,  I  have  quite  a  bit  of

experience in negotiations and I am willing to give him  my

support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with those words. I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $44,760,690 for Head Q ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head R be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 1004*. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Hwang Soo Jin and P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this subhead, I would touch upon the fire fighting

policy  of the Ministry with regard to improving  the  Fire

Brigade's fire fighting capacity to control fire hazards in

high-rise  buildings. I think we are all aware.  Sir,  that

high-rise  building  is  now  the  chief  media  of   urban

development and more and more of our people will be located

in  high-rise buildings in the future, Along with  this,  I

would expect that the Fire Brigade's capacity --

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> On a point of order. Sir. There is a

subhead  on  fire  fighting, and I  think  the  Member  for

Serangoon  Gardens  could discuss that under  the  relevant

subhead.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I agree with the Member for Kim Seng. There

is  an  amendment  under the name  of  Dr  Ong  Leong  Boon - amendment  (9)  to  subhead BFA 1109,  Fire  Fighting  and

Ambulance  Services.  If  the subject  of  the  Member  for

Serangoon  Gardens  is purely on fire fighting,  I  suggest

that  he  waits  until then. But if it is  one  on  general

policy of the Ministry, he can carry on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> I think I made it quite plain at the outset

that  I  was  touching on the policy of the  fire  fighting

capacity of the Fine Brigade.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In which case, I suggest you wait until

amendment (9) is moved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Very well, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, in his Budget Statement to the

House,  the Finance Minister showed great concern  for  the

health  of  smokers and prescribed the shock  treatment  of

higher  customs  and excise duty on tobacco.  As  a  fairly

heavy  smoker myself. I must admit that I am responding  to

the  treatment.  The prospect of having  to  pay  more  for

cigarettes  has  shocked  me  into  cutting  down   on   my

consumption. Over the last few years, our Government  seems

to rely on higher taxes, charges and fines as a panacea for

numerous  social ills. Singapore became cleaner because  of

the  introduction of heavy fines for littering;  to  reduce

the number of cans on the road, we raised the road tax;  to

cut  down  on consumption of water, we raised the price  of

water.  I  am  not  here to question  the  wisdom  of  such

measures,  although in passing. I think it is pertinent  to

say  that whilst in some cases the end justifies the means,

this sort of "stick" ought to be used discriminately and as

a  last  resort only when other measures of a  less  severe

nature have failed to produce results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I really want to say under this subhead is simply

that  since  the  recently announced increase  in  duty  on

tobacco  is with a view to bringing about better health  to

the  people, the increased revenue derived therefrom  which

is  estimated  to  amount to several  millions  of  dollars

should properly be spent on promoting better health of  our

people. In this regard, I cannot think of a better  way  of

spending it than on the promotion of sports. Sports,  as  I

see  it,  is perhaps the best form of preventive  medicine.

But  looking through the expenditures of the Ministry  over

the  last few years, I am unable to find evidence of active

financial  support having been given to  the  promotion  of

sports.  Although for the first time there  is  a  proposed

grant  of $2 million to the Singapore Sports Council, there

does not appear to be a firm commitment since it has as yet

to  be sanctioned by the Development Planning Committee  of

Treasury  who  are known to be sticky on items  which  they

consider  to be of a non-revenue generating nature.  Today.

we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



heard  so much from the Minister for Culture. In any event,

to-date  the Council still owes the Government  a'  sum  of

$3.15  million  being  part of the costs  incurred  in  the

construction  of  the National Stadium. I  would  therefore

urge  the  Minister  to negotiate with his  colleague,  the

Finance Minister, with a view to obtaining his agreement to

allocate the entire increase in revenue from higher duty on

tobacco  for use in the promotion of sports. I  would  also

urge the Hon. Minister to follow up the suggestion which  I

made during the debate on the Budget that all the surpluses

of  Singapore  Pools  (Pte.) Ltd, should  go  towards  the

promotion of sports. And how about making it compulsory for

the  Singapore Turf Club to surrender part of their takings

annually  for the promotion of sports? Surely,  betting  on

horses is just as much an anti-social habit as smoking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we have over the last few years been expanding our

sports and recreational facilities, these are unfortunately

not  sufficiently decentralised as to be near centres  with

heavy concentrations of population. For instance, the seven

constituencies  neighbouring  Jalan  Kayu,  namely.   Upper

Serangoon.  Tampines,  Nee  Soon,  Punggol.  Sembawang  and

Serangoon  Gardens, have a combined population of something

like 250,000 to 300,000, but there is not a public swimming

pool  nearby.  All  our constituents need  one  badly,  and

although  requests  have been put forward  by  some  of  my

colleagues, including the Minister of State for Labour, who

is  the MP for Upper Serangoon constituency, we have so far

received  no response. With a very young population  as  we

have  today,  it is important that we should  provide  them

with adequate facilities and amenities to let off steam and

there is no better way than to get them involved in sports.

We  urge them to work hard but we should also provide  them

with  opportunities and facilities to enjoy the  fruits  of

their labour in a meaningful way. We decry their habits  of

frequenting coffee-houses and window-shopping at complexes,

but what alternatives are we offering them?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, under this subhead I would like

to speak on two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



different   subjects,  that  is,  temples  and  sports   in

Singapore.  A  number  of  temples, both  authorised   and

unauthorised,  have  been  demolished  for  urban   renewal

development. But the alternative sites given are,  in  most

cases,  not  suitable for the temple devotees  because  the

alternative sites for all the different temples are located

at   one  place.  For  instance,  the  temples  which  were

demolished  at  Silat Road, Sentosa and many  other  areas,

were  given alternative sites at Queenstown. Then there  is

the Rama temple at Changi Road, 14th milestone. The present

site  has  been given by the Army and they have  put  up  a

permanent  structure there. In view of  urban  renewal  the

Authority wants to take back the piece of land, but they do

not  want  to give an alternative site. They must  give  an

alternative site because the piece of land was given by the

Army.  The  people in that area must have a  temple  there.

Could  the  Minister  consider allocating  the  alternative

sites nearer to the former sites and not resite them in one

corner  of  the  island? I also want to  know  whether  the

Minister  would  consider building temples in  new  housing

estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the subject of sports. Sometime ago I

mentioned  that our National Stadium was a white  elephant.

Fortunately, the officials responsible for the Stadium woke

up  and it has since been a popular meeting ground for many

exciting  games,  so  much  so that  to  ease  the  traffic

congestion there is a provision for the construction of  an

underpass across the main road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must commend the present Chairman of the Singapore

Sports  Council  who  is  doing  a  wonderful  job  and  is

personally attending to the problems of the SSC. However. I

wish  to  raise a few points. Some of the fields that  have

been taken over from the British Armed Forces are not being

maintained  properly, especially those  at  Tanglin,  Dover

Road  and  Farrer  Park, where the  turfing  seems  to  be

disappearing bit by bit, Even before the dry season  began.

there  were  already bald patches on the turf and  this  is

because there is no one to advise on proper maintenance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Tanglin, the golf course and the tennis courts are

obviously very popular. It is so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



popular that its revenue is second to the National Stadium.

However, there  are no proper changing  rooms  and  toilet

facilities. Although there has been a persistent demand for

squash courts, to-date, none has been built. I am sure that

squash  courts together with additional indoor and  outdoor

games  will bring additional revenue to the SSC. The tennis

counts  are over-used that there is little chance  for  any

maintenance work to be carried out. It would be much better

to  cement  these  courts and thereby reduce  the  cost  of

maintenance.  In fact, these facilities at Tanglin  are  so

popular that even tourists find it convenient to use  them.

Furthermore,  I  must point out that theme  are  no  proper

parking facilities at this place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Sports Council is responsible for the

organisation of Pesta Sukan. What plans has it got for this

year's  Pesta  Sukan? Which countries will  be  invited  to

participate? I also want to know if the SSC has  sufficient

funds  to  subsidise  the  various sports  associations  to

organise these games. In the past, the SSC suggested to its

affiliated bodies to organise certain games but when  funds

were  requested,  the SSC left it to the individual  sports

associations.  As  a result, in the last  few  years  Pesta

Sukan  lost  its usual glamour. Thus, sportsmen from  other

countries have declined to participate in Pesta Sukan.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of late, there has been a great demand for tennis

counts  all  over the island. The available courts  are  so

overused that as a result there is a racket going  on  over

the bookings in certain places. Many of our people have all

of  a sudden decided to take up this game. I wonder whether

the  SSC  would consider constructing more courts all  oven

the island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Football Association of Singapore has been mainly

responsible  for  holding very successful football  matches

and has promoted a great deal of interest among the public.

Unfortunately, the players are the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



ones  who  suffer most. When they take time-off from  work,

they  lose their wages and thus their earning power.  As  a

result, there seems to be a certain reluctance on the  part

of  the players to come for practices. I feel that if these

people  can be financially assisted to the extent of  their

wages  for  the periods when they are required to  practise

they  would not have to suffer any financial loss.  I  hope

this incentive payment will benefit them and encourage them

to play better soccer for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I want to know what form of assistance the SSC

is providing the Constituency Sports Clubs, and how many of

the  Constituency Sports Clubs have so far  benefited  from

such assistance. Recently. I was nominated Chairman of  the

Inter-Constituency   Sepak-Takraw   Tournament   Organising

Committee. From my very short experience and also from  the

SSC  Report  on Inter-Constituency Sepak-Takraw  Tournament

1975. I  understand  that it is a  normal  practice  among

Sports  Liaison officials not to attend meetings  conducted

by  SSC. Since these people are voluntary workers and  they

are  so  heavily  taxed in their own work,  would  the  SSC

consider  giving the Sports Liaison officials an  allowance

as an incentive to them and to ensure that they do not have

to   be  out  of  pocket  b~  meeting  additional  cost  of

travelling incurred in attending these meetings.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Jalan Kayu is a man

after my own heart and to have such a suggestion from  him,

a  smoker himself, is most commendable. The idea of getting

definite sources of revenue to finance sports projects  and

the  development of sports facilities in Singapore has been

considered   by   my  Ministry  on  many  occasions.   Many

alternatives  have been considered, including  the  lottery

now  known  as  the Singapore Sweep and the Football  Pools

which has now become Toto.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House may wish to know that the Singapore Sports

Council  has formulated a 7-year Master Plan for the  long-term development of public sports facilities in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



Singapore. The Master Plan recommends the creation  of

an  international indoor stadium, a velodrome,  multi-purpose   indoor  stadium,  swimming  pools,  athletic

stadium,  tennis  courts, football fields  and  squash

courts.  All  these facilities will  be  decentralised

all over the island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master Plan envisages an expenditure commitment

of  $75.45  million and the recurrent expenditure,  in

excess  of revenue, ranges from $6 million in 1976  to

$8.8  million in 1982. Through consultations With  the

Ministry  of Finance this year, a grant of $2  million

has  been  provided  for  the  development  of  sports

facilities  which  cover  some  of  the  much   needed

facilities envisaged in the Master Plan which  I  have

mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing in mind the urgency to develop adequate

sports  facilities in order to promote sports for  the

masses,   the  present  system  of  financing   sports

through  grants  and loans plus interest  may  not  be

sufficient.   I  agree  with  the  Member   that   the

additional  revenue  derived  from  the  increase   in

import  duty  on cigarettes and tobacco  as  has  been

announced  recently, should be channelled  for  sports

promotion   purposes.   In   fact,   prior   to    the

announcement on the increase in cigarette and  tobacco

duties,  my  Ministry  had  intended  to  request  the

Ministry  of Finance to levy a few cents tax  on  each

packet   of  cigarettes  for  the  purpose  of  sports

promotion.  In 1974, duty was levied on 3.610  million

kilogrammes of local and imported cigarettes.  At  the

rate  of  one kilogramme of tobacco to 88  packets  of

cigarettes  of 10 sticks each, the total volume  works

out  to  about 317.715 million packets.  With  just  a

levy  of  a  few cents, we could, in fact,  expect  to

collect  an  additional revenue for  sports  promotion

equivalent  to the additional revenue from the  recent

increase in duties in cigarette and tobacco.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the announcement was made by the

Minister  for  Finance, I suggested  to  him  that  at

least  50%  of  the  additional revenue  arising  from

duties  on  cigarettes  should be  channelled  to  the

Singapore Sports Council so that the annual  grant  in

the Budget may be correspondingly reduced. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



fully  agree  with  the  Member  that  smokers  who  ignore

Government's  call to reduce or stop smoking,  which  is  a

serious  health  hazard, should contribute  in  a  positive

manner  to sports which is health-giving. I am not  one  of

the  veteran  smokers  in  the Cabinet  who  are  immunised

against  lung and other pulmonary diseases referred  to  by

the  Minister for Finance. In fact. I have never smoked  at

all. I support the views of the Member for Jalan Kayu,  not

because  I  am not a smoker but because we need a  definite

source of funds to finance public sports facilities, and to

ask  for  50% of the additional revenue from the duties  on

cigarettes seems reasonable enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of asking the Singapore Turf Club to

support  sports from its revenue, this again  is  a  matter

which  is  in  the hands of my colleague, the Minister  for

Finance. I can suggest it to him,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Toto, it is for sports. Its origin can be

traced  to  a  proposal  made by my  Ministry,  as  I  have

mentioned earlier, to raise money for sports. I would  like

to  thank the Member for his suggestion. As I have  already

said,  negotiation is going on between my Ministry and  the

Ministry of Finance on the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Member for Anson, he has brought up the

question of temples and sports which appear to be unrelated

subjects, because one relates to the spiritual realm  while

the  other to temporal affairs. However, he has a point  in

bringing up these two subjects together, since sports  deal

with  the  enrichment of the spirit, one  relating  to  the

religious  spirit  and  the other is  what  all  of  us  in

Singapore  is  quite concerned with, that  is,  building  a

rugged  physique. He has referred to temples which have  to

give way to urban renewal and other development projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be emphasised that development projects which are

for the benefit of the people as a whole must go on. If any

building  is  in the way of such development, obviously  it

will have to go. This is unavoidable, This applies not only

to temples but also to mosques and churches.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the policy of the Government to provide sites in

every  new  satellite  town for the  building  of  mosques,

churches, Hindu or Chinese temples for the people living in

these  new  satellite towns. This policy has  already  been

announced  and  will be implemented. The Government  cannot

provide a site to replace every religious building affected

by  urban renewal and development. What is desirable is  to

build  a  new Hindu temple in a satellite town where  there

are a large number of Hindus. A good suggestion is to build

one   such   temple   for  several  temples   affected   by

development.  The  management committees of  these  temples

should  pool their resources to get a new temple  built  as

soon  as possible. The choice of a site for the new  temple

is left to the Hindu Endowment Board and the Hindu Advisory

Board   which  are  concerned  with  the  problem  of   the

construction of new temples at the satellite towns. In this

regard.  Sir,  I have already directed the Hindu  Endowment

Board,  of  which the Member for Anson is the Chairman,  to

set  up  a management committee to coordinate the clearance

of  sites  used  for religious purposes and  to  build  new

temples in satellite towns. The management committee  which

will  be  set up under the Hindu Endowment Act will  advise

the  various management committees to transfer compensation

money  from  the demolished temples to the  Board  for  use

specifically  for the building of new temples in  satellite

towns. The committee will also look into the other aspects,

including fund-raising, for the construction of new temples

in satellite towns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of sports, in the last Budget sitting the

Member  referred  to  the  National  Stadium  as  a   white

elephant. Now he says that the National Stadium  is  not  a

white  elephant.  Instead, he says  that  the  elephant  is

causing traffic congestion. He has praised the new Chairman

of the Singapore Sports Council for attending personally to

the problems of the Council, including the construction  of

an  underpass  which not only eases traffic congestion  but

also provides a short-cut to the Stadium and a safe passage

for the convenience of the public.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also raised a number of points concerning the

maintenance  of sports facilities as well as assistance  to

sports organisations. The fields at Tanglin. Dover Road and

Farrer  Park, under the management of the Singapore  Sports

Council,  are  being  maintained regularly  throughout  the

year.  There is a heavy demand for the use of these  fields

by  members of the public, especially during week-ends  and

public holidays. The fields are, therefore, without a doubt

generally  over-used and this causes heavy wear  and  tear.

This  goes  to  emphasise that the fields of the  Singapore

Sports  Council  are fully utilised and  that  theme  is  a

shortage of playing fields.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of tennis at Tanglin, the players

normally  are  already  properly  attired  for  the   game.

However,  those  who  wish  to change  on  use  the  toilet

facilities  can  do  so at the booking  office  where  such

facilities are available. Steps are being taken to  convent

a  small hut, adjacent to the tennis count, into a changing

room.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1975, the Sports Council requested that the clay

courts  at Tanglin be cemented, but it was turned  down  by

the Ministry of Finance because they felt that it would  be

more  economical to cement the courts at a time when  major

repairs or renovations were due.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SSC has tennis courts located at different pants of

the  island  and the most popular courts are those  at  the

National Stadium, Farmer Park and Tanglin. The Council  has

implemented  a twice-a-week booking system at the  National

Stadium  on Mondays and Thursdays to enable more people  to

have  a  chance  to play. The previous booking  system  was

unsatisfactory as theme were complaints from the public. As

a  result,  the Council insists that bookings can  only  be

made  in  person between 8 am, and 10 am. This  arrangement

took effect from, 18th August, 1975 and it has been found to

be  working very satisfactorily. Steps are also being taken

to  floodlight the courts at Farmer Park as the peak  hours

are between 5.30 p.m. and 10 p.m.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council has also plans to build another eight tennis

courts  and  nine squash courts at the Kallang Complex  and

two  more of each at St. Wilfrid Road in the Whampoa  area.

At the moment, we already have 11 squash courts in use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pesta Sukan is an annual feature of our sports

programme  and  it  has  proved to be  very  popular.  With

increased support from local participants and the  emphasis

on  mass  participation, the Council has been and  will  be

catering for more local competitions and mass participation

events such as the National Walk, National Jog and National

Cycling. The national sports associations participating  in

the  Pesta  Sukan  receive a subsidy and the  Council  also

provides  for the medals for all the competitions. However,

those  national  sports  associations  wishing  to  include

foreign   participation  can  do  so  provided   they   are

responsible for all such expenses involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1975, the SSC provided a small subsidy to all

constituencies  which had organised a  Constituency  Sports

Association (CSA) on a Constituency Sports Club (CSC).  The

Council  is  considering the possibility of giving  another

subsidy  in  1976  for all constituency sports  clubs,  The

following  are  the  forms of assistance  that  the  Sports

Council  has given or will be providing to the constituency

sports clubs:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Council's assistant sports officers will attend

management  committee meetings of the CSA on  CSC  to  help

with  their  immediate problems. They will also assist  the

sports  liaison  officers  in the  organisation  of  intra-constituency sports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Sports Council will provide free auditing

services to the clubs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) All donations to the clubs via the SSC will be tax

free.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The clubs' use of SSC facilities will be at a

concession rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) A seminar for Sports Liaison Officers and Chairmen and

members of the CSA on CSC was conducted in 1975. It is true

that SLOs are voluntary workers, But the Sports



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



Council has provided them with these privileges:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) free passes to witness football matches at the

National Stadium;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) concession rates at SSC instructional lessons in

swimming, tennis and squash:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) concession mates for use of all SSC swimming pools;

and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) special rates for all seminars organised by the SSC.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SSC is therefore sympathetic towards sports liaison

officers,  If they are advisers of the Constituency  Sports

Clubs - I believe most of them are Members of Parliament  - and if they feel strongly about the matter of allowances, I

suggest they bring it to the attention of the Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards incentives for our football players, this

matter  is under the jurisdiction of the FAS and I  believe

the  FAS  is  the  body  to negotiate with  the  respective

employers  of  these  football players  on  the  matter  of

refunding  or reimbursing whatever monetary loss they  have

suffered by way of attending practices.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is one

point  that  I have left out. As regards the Somerset  Road

temple, the matter has still not been settled yet. Can  the

Minister take action to settle the matter?



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, the Member can rest assured

that  I am looking into the matter actively and will settle

it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I wish to thank the Hon. Minister

for Social Affairs for his comments on sports. Pursuing  on

the points that he has made, may I say that with regard  to

changing  facilities and toilets at the  tennis  courts  at

Farmer  Park where we have 14 tennis courts, there  is  not

even  one  changing room. We would be most grateful  if  he

could  build a changing room for tennis players  at  Farmer

Park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I think the Minister did comment that in the

coming  year, eight new tennis courts will be  built.  Just

two days ago,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



or  yesterday,  when  the Minister of  State  for  National

Development commented on the fringe car parks, he said that

those  car parks could be converted into tennis courts  and

squash  courts.  May  I suggest that the  Chairman  of  the

Singapore Sports Council approach the Minister of State for

National  Development in pursuit of  this  same  matter.  I

would  also  suggest  that  the Hon.  Minister  for  Social

Affairs  should approach the Minister of State for National

Development on the same matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the point of allowance for football players in

the inter-constituency games, I was told that this year the

allowance would be exactly the same as last year. In  fact,

theme  was  a proviso to the effect that the allowance  for

this year might be slashed because of some Finance Ministry

decision.  Can  I  seek the assurance of the  Minister  for

Social  Affairs  that the allowance for  the  participating

teams  for  football anyway be maintained  at  last  year's

figures  and,  of  course, if possible, increase  it  to  a

larger sum?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I must say that I am simply

delighted  by  the  reply  of  the  Hon.  Minister  to   my

suggestion and I wish him success in his negotiations  with

the  Hon.  Minister for Finance. In the event of his  being

successful, any smoker who should die from smoking could at

least die with the knowledge that he died for a good cause!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one point that I am still not quite certain

and  that  is  the revenue from Toto. Why should  the  Hon.

Minister negotiate with the Hon. Minister for Finance? From

the  very outset, in the setting up of the Singapore  Pools

(Pte)  Ltd, the objective was laid down cleanly  that  the

money made therefrom is to finance sports. I made the point

in  my  speech  during the Budget debate. The  company  has

several  millions of dollars in the bank.  Why  should  the

Minister for Social Affairs continue to negotiate? I  would

have thought that it is his might to claim that money.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, on the question of a changing

room at Farrer Park tennis courts raised by the Member  for

Kim Seng, there is a changing room at the sports centre  at

the  moment.  I  have been there and I saw a changing  room

there. If that is not enough, we may look into the question

of adding a few more for the tennis players.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Just one more.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> All might. That makes it easier

still. We can add one more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the allowance for the inter-constituency

sports.  I  am not aware of any slashing of the  allowance.

But  I  will look into this matter and the Chairman of  the

SSC can help me out with this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the Toto money, well, it should have

come straight to the SSC. But as matters stand, this is for

the Minister for Finance to decide on the matter. As I said

just  now,  I  will  be negotiating with the  Minister  for

Finance  on  that and I hope Members can give  me  all  the

support they can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some Hon. Members:</b> Yes, we will.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

I am glad to hear from the Minister for Social Affairs that

he  would be building eight squash courts this year. May  I

ask  him  in which constituency will the squash  counts  be

built? Will any be built in Sembawang?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu has suggested the construction

of  a swimming pool. In the case of swimming pools, we have

two  in Sembawang Constituency and we are prepared to  give

him  a  swimming pooI if he wants it. If theme  is  such  a

plan,  we  are prepared to give up one swimming pool  to  a

neighbouring constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the building of squash counts, if possible, I

would  like  to have some built in my constituency  because

the  young people in the rural areas are also very fond  of

squash. If squash court facilities are concentrated in  the

urban  areas, then those living in the mural areas have  to

travel  a long way to the City area to play squash. Sir,I

hope the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



for  Social  Affairs  will  consider  the  possibility   of

building squash courts in the rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, may I join in this

question of lending support to the Hon. Minister for Social

Affairs with regard to seeking more funds for the Singapore

Sports   Council's  activities?  Just  now   the   Minister

mentioned  that  as of right the profits  from  Toto  pools

should  be  ploughed  into the SSC for  sports  activities.

Whilst  I speak for myself. I am sure Hon. Members  on  the

Backbench  would  give  their  heartiest  support  to   the

Minister  too  when he negotiates with his  colleague,  the

Hon. Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the question involved here is the objective

of the setting up of Singapore Pools (Pte) Ltd. To my mind,

as  far  as I can recollect, from the replies given by  the

Minister concerned the profits of the Singapore Pools (Pte)

Ltd are to be ploughed back for the promotion of sports  in

Singapore.  Today,  with amendments to the  Sports  Council

Act, more constituency sports clubs are to be formed; and I

am  sure more money and facilities will be required by  all

these  CSCs. As an example, the Member for Sembawang,  with

two  swimming pools in his constituency, is still not happy

as he wants some squash courts. Well, that is quite natural

because  as  more and more constituencies  form  their  own

sports  clubs, they  want to provide more  facilities  for

their constituents.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member for Jalan Kayu has suggested, over the

years  the  fringe  constituencies around Upper  Serangoon,

Punggol.  Jalan Kayu, Tampines, including Paya Lebar,  have

always  wanted  a swimming pool. A piece of land  has  been

found in Surin Avenue, but no funds could be made available

for  the  construction  of  a  swimming  pool  despite   my

questions  to this House. I think the time has come,  right

and  ripe,  -emphasise  "right and ripe"  -  for  the  Hon.

Minister for Social Affairs to press on with his colleague,

the  Minister for Finance, for more funds, and if  that  is

not forthcoming we will debate on it again at another time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question concerns what the Member for Sembawang

has   just   mentioned,  i.e, increasing  the  number   of

activities  by  providing  more  facilities  so  that   the

constituents can benefit. He has my support, Sir. Also, the

Minister can be assured of my support.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, to answer the Member for

Sembawang, it is very difficult to please everybody, but we

will do our best. If it is possible, we will provide sports

facilities  for the people in the rural areas too.  I  know

that  the Member for Sembawang is a good sportsman. He  man

13  laps at the National Stadium in 24 minutes, and that is

an achievement. I can assure him that we will look into the

question  of  building squash courts or jogging  tracks  in

Sembawang. To the Member for Punggol, I thank him  for  his

support.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head R be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead ACA 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometime ago two ILO experts were seconded to our

Registry  of  Cooperative Societies to make recommendations

on  the constitution of our cooperative societies. They had

recommended   the   reorganisation  of  the   Registry   of

Cooperative   Societies  into  a  Cooperative   Development

Department. The new cooperative legislation would encourage

the   consolidation  and  diversification  of   cooperative

activities and the formation of an integrated system  of  a

primary, secondary and an apex organisation. May I know how

successful has the Ministry been in the amalgamation of the

several  cooperative societies into a national  cooperative

movement,  and whether all those cooperative societies  are

in a healthy state?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened to the recommendations made by the ILO

experts'? Have they been implemented? Sir, to-date how many

cooperative   societies   have  gone   into   multi-purpose

business? May I have the facts and figures on this?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gather that with no full-time officials to look into

this subject, the concept of a multipurpose society is  not

possible. For instance, the Teachers' Cooperative  Society,

which  had  gone into multi-purpose business sometime  ago.

could  not  balance  its accounts. I  understand  that  the

outgoing  committee could not account to the newly  elected

committee  for a big sum of money and a proper  explanation

has  yet  to be given. I wonder what has happened  to  this

society? Is the Registrar satisfied with the administration

of the society? Could the Minister comment on it?



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, the House will recall that

during  the  last Budget debate I mentioned  that  the  ILO

experts  had  made  a  number  of  recommendations  to  the

Government.  These  include  the  reorganisation   of   the

Registry   of  Cooperative  Societies  into  a  Cooperative

Development Department, the formation of a Cooperative Apex

Organisation for the cooperative movement, the revision  of

the  cooperative law and the establishment of a Cooperative

Training Centre. As a first phase of the reorganisation  of

the Registry of Cooperative Societies, the establishment of

the  Registry  has been strengthened with the  increase  of

four  additional staff, including two of executive  officer

grade. The strengthening of the staffing situation has made

it  possible  to  reorganise the Registry on  a  functional

basis.  It  has also enabled the Registry now to  undertake

more  promotional and educational work for the  benefit  of

the cooperative movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of unifying the cooperative movement.

this has been actively pursued. A cooperative convention of

representatives of various cooperative societies  was  held

in March last year to discuss the proposed Cooperative Apex

Organisation. Owing to divergent views on the  constitution

of  the proposed Cooperative Apex Organisation, as well  as

the  question of representation, it was decided  that  this

proposal be deferred until relevant details of the  revised

cooperative laws are known.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of a revision of the existing cooperative

legislation, the draft Bill has been sent to the  Singapore

National  Cooperative Union and the National  Trades  Union

Congress to seek their views on certain fundamental  issues

which  affect  all cooperative societies, including  those

belonging  to the trade union movement. Comments  from  the

Singapore  National Cooperative Union have  been  received,

but  the  NTUC is still studying the draft legislation.  We

have  sent  them  a reminder and are still waiting  for  an

answer.  The  cooperative movement is  by  and  large  very

healthy,  with  the  exception of a  few  weak  cooperative

societies which are receiving guidance and assistance  from

the Registry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree fully with the Member that good management is

vitally   important   for  the  successful   operation   of

cooperative  societies, including multi-purpose  societies.

Unfortunately, only a few cooperative societies can  afford

full-time  staff which are particularly required  by  those

societies  which  have  been converted  into  multi-purpose

societies.  It will take time for the movement  to  develop

professionalism  in the administration  and  management  of

cooperative societies. In this regard, the establishment of

a  cooperative  training centre is important.  This  centre

will  in future conduct courses for in-service training  of

staff  and  for  the training of officers and  managers  of

cooperative societies on a regular basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding multi-purpose cooperative societies, at present

theme  are  seven of them. Two were converted  from  Thrift

amid  Loan societies, while the remaining five were  formed

as multi-purpose societies from the start.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Member also wanted to know the position of the

Singapore Teachers' Multi-purpose Cooperative Society.  The

big  sum  of  money which he mentioned actually  refers  to

discrepancies of consumer stocks in hand valued at $25,544.

which  could  not  be verified owing to the  absence  of  a

proper  stock record, The Registrar is satisfied  that  the

present  management committee has been making an effort  to

rectify the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



shortcoming. The society has also been advised  to  improve

its  accounting  system and to have its  staff  trained  in

proper  accounting practices with the help of its  external

auditors.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, in view of the explanation of

the Minister, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head R be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead BAA 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment is moved to seek some information

from  the  Minister. Can the Minister inform the House  the

type  of complaints received and entertained by the Central

Complaints Bureau? What happens to the complaints when they

are  received? What kind of investigations are made, if  at

all  made, on receiving complaints from the public? If  the

complaint  is  against  a  public servant, what  follow-up

action  is  taken? And is the head of the  department  kept

informed? Is the complainant advised of the outcome of  the

complaint that he has made?



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, through the years the Central

Complaints  Bureau has established itself as an avenue  for

complaints  from persons who consider themselves  aggrieved

by  acts  or  omission  on  the pant  of  individual  civil

servants or departments. The Bureau, not unlike the  famous

Justice  Pao  series  on television, as  mentioned  by  the

Member  for  Katong  just  now,  is  prepared  to  take   a

determined  stand  to  rectify a  wrong  done.  In  several

instances  too, the processing of one particular  complaint

has  led to a general overall improvement of the department

as  a whole. Despite the burden which the investigation  of

complaints   imposes   on   the   inspected   offices   and

departments, their response has been generally satisfactory

and  encouraging. While the Bureau endeavours to treat  the

inspected department or officer with consideration, it will

on  no account do so at the expense of complainants, and it

displays suitable firmness where necessary.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bureau received 695 complaints last year. Complaints

received and attended to by the CCB fall under three  broad

categories.  The  first  category  relates  to   complaints

against    individual   civil   servants.   Cases   include

discourtesy,  misconduct,  petty  bureaucracy,  unnecessary

delay of service, and discrimination of service. The second

category  relates to complaints directed against Government

departments  and  statutory  boards,  The  complaints   are

usually  directed  against departments  which  have  to  do

enforcement work.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last category of cases attended to are, strictly

speaking,  not complaints but rather appeals for assistance

and inquiries. All cases, either big or small, referred  to

the  Bureau  are studied. If necessary, investigations  are

made  before  action is taken to refer the  complaint,  The

Bureau sometimes receives complaints which are malicious or

frivolous against hardworking and innocent public servants.

While ensuring that such public servants are protected from

such  injustice through careful investigations, the  Bureau

never  hesitates to take action against any public  servant

who has failed to discharge his or hen duty properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the policy of the Bureau to keep the complainant

informed  of the outcome of his complaint immediately.  For

cases  requiring protracted investigation and  verification

of  statements made by various parties, interim replies are

given  to let the complainant know that the Bureau is still

actively  pursuing  the issue on his  or  her  behalf,  The

Bureau has a small staff but, with the efficient deployment

of  staff and the cooperation of the departments which have

dealings with the Bureau, so fan work in the Bureau has not

in any way been handicapped by the limited staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the campaign to reduce incidents of

discourtesy in the public service, since September 1974 the

Bureau  has  started  deploying  its  officers  to  conduct

observations   and   inspections  at   various   Government

departments  and  statutory  bodies  which  have   frequent

dealings with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



public. From September to December 1974 the Bureau made 122

such  visits.  Last  year, 465 visits  were  made.  Besides

observing the way officers at the counter treat members  of

the  public,  an  assessment of the  facilities,  such  as.

directional  signs,  cleanliness of  waiting  areas,  etc..

available  for  the public, was also made. Reports  of  the

visits  which were considered worthwhile for the respective

heads  of departments to note and to take action have  been

brought to the attention of the departments concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bureau has found these visits fruitful and effective

in  eradicating  discourtesy in the public service.  Hence.

for  the current year the number of visits planned will  be

doubled.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, in view of the complaint by the Minister that the Central Complaints Bureau is under-staffed, I hope the Bureau will get less and less

complaints about the public servants from now onwards. With

that hope I beg to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to he allocated for Head R be reduced by the

whole sum in respect of subhead BCA 1111



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to congratulate the Minister for Social

Affairs and to offer him a bouquet for the immediate action

taken to resolve the problems faced by the Haj pilgrims who

were  left  stranded  because  of  the  unavailability   of

aircraft  which  had been booked by two travel  agents  who

handled  the  travelling arrangements for the Haj  pilgrims

last  year. I hope that the Minister's assurance  given  in

answer to an oral question by the Member for Geylang Senai.

that MUIS would take over the management of the Haj affairs

this  year and arrange with Singapore Airlines to transport

Haj pilgrims from Singapore to perform their Haj pilgrimage

can be i in p1 implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise as with the Minister's promise to provide

welfare officers for the Singapore pilgrims, the MUIS  had,

in fact, provided four



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



welfare  officers last year, when the pilgrims were staying

in  Mecca and Medina. I wish to thank the President of MUIS

for  his efforts to make available the services of the four

officers concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to know. Sir, what was the cost incurred

by  the  MUIS  in  respect of these officers,  and  whether

reports  have  been received from these  officers.  Is  the

Minister  satisfied with the performance of these  officers

in  looking  after  the welfare of the  Haj  pilgrims  from

Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, firstly, I would like to thank

the  Member for his kind words. It is not only the Ministry

of Social Affairs or the Muslim Religious Council but there

were  many other Government departments which were involved

in solving the problems faced by the pilgrims last year. We

moved in just at the right time and therefore we were  able

to  solve  those  problems, This year the Muslim  Religious

Council  will be responsible for pilgrimage matters between

Singapore and Mecca.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also true, Sir, that last year four welfare

officers  accompanied our pilgrims to Mecca.  Two  of  them

volunteered their good services free of charge. As  regards

the  other  two officers, although the cost  of  their  air

passage  was  paid  by  the  travel  agents,  the  expenses

incurred  during their 60-odd days stay in Saudi Arabia  to

carry  out  their duties, amounted to $3,941.73.  This  sum

includes  service charges by sheikhs in Mecca,  Jeddah  and

Medina, transportation charges, costs of accommodation  and

personal expenses. Pending approval from Government ~o meet

this  expenditure from public funds, the MUIS paid out  the

above  sum  out  of the Baitul-mal Account, in  the  first

instance. The Ministry of Finance has been asked to  refund

to the MUIS the sum expended.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, were these

two  welfare  officers appointed by the MUIS, on  did  they

voluntarily come forward to offer their services as welfare

officers?  As regards air passage, was it paid for  by  the

travel agents who arranged the flights for the pilgrims, on

was  it paid by those who had no connection whatsoever with

the pilgrimage?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, on the question of the two

welfare officers who gave voluntary service, they submitted

their  names  to  the  MUIS for voluntary  work,  and  were

accepted by the Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the air passage, offhand I am not in a

position to say anything definite, but I think it must have

been paid by the agencies involved with the pilgrimage from

Singapore to Mecca.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, if the cost of the air passage for these  two

welfare  officers  was  paid by the travel  agencies  which

organised  the  pilgrimage, this  is  indeed  improper.  If

anything  is given free, there must be an ulterior  motive,

The  travel agencies which have direct connection with  the

Singapore  haj pilgrims should not take part  in  providing

for  the  welfare officers. If I am not mistaken these  two

volunteers   themselves  are  sheikhs  dealing   with   haj

pilgrims,  and I believe they both have a special  interest

in offering voluntary service. So also is the case with the

aim  passages  offered. I beg the Minister to give  serious

consideration to this matter.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, I will take note of that for

the next pilgrimage.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): With that

assurance  given  by the Minister, I hope this  year  there

will  not  be a recurrence of this affair. I beg  leave  to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head R be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead BEA 1107.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether he could set up

a   home  for  disabled  children  or  children  born  with

congenital  diseases.  According to statistics,  there  are

about  8,000  such children. I think this is a very  urgent

problem  and  requires  immediate attention.  I  make  this

request  because I understand that the number of homes  for

the  care  of unfortunate children managed by the Salvation

Army and other charitable organisations are not sufficient.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received an appeal from a housewife in my constituency

who told me that she was unlucky enough to have a child who

has been afflicted with poliomyelitis since birth and could

not  move all these years. Her family is poor and  most  of

the  members  of the family have to go out to work  and  so

they are not able to take came of this child. She has asked

me  to  approach the Social Welfare Department  to  find  a

place  for  her child. I have made several applications  to

the  Social  Welfare Department. However, all  the  replies

have  been  negative, stating that there is no vacancy  and

the child has to wait.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case relates to a petty trader. He is unfortunate

enough  to  have  two  children both with  some  congenital

diseases. One of them is being taken cane of by a home  for

disabled children but the other child is left out as  there

is  no  place for her. I believe theme are many  more  such

cases. I would therefore sincerely request the Minister  to

consider establishing a home for such children in order  to

alleviate  the  hardship of those families. However,  as  a

temporary  measure, the Ministry could find  some  suitable

place to accommodate these children until a proper home  is

built.
