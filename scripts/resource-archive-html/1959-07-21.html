-(The Deputy Prime Minister).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, my colleagues have

during  the  past  few  days explained  the  policy

statement of the Government in detail. Today I wish

to emphasise a few matters on Home Affairs that are

contained in the policy speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the promulgation of the new Constitution of

internal self-government and the formation  of  the

first  internal self-government, we the  people  of

Singapore  have  entered into a new  historic  era.

This  is an important transitional period.  On  the

one  hand,  the symbols of Colonial  rules  are  on

their  way out and on the other hand is a  new-born

anti-Colonial  self-government  of  the   people - an

internal  self-government of limited powers.  Since

the masses of the people have handed this power  to

the P.A.P. Government, they have, at the same time,

entrusted us their future happiness. Therefore,  we

must  put  our feet on the ground and shoulder  the

responsibilities that the people have entrusted us.

Of  course in an island of 225 square miles with  a

population  of  1½  million  people  relying   on

entrepot  for our livelihood, it is by no means  an

easy  task  to  carry  out  socialist  policy   and

socialist   re-construction.   The   P.A.P. have

repeatedly announced their long-term objective that

only  through a thorough socialist reform  and  re-construction  can we improve and raise  the  living

standards  of the people. In order to achieve  this

we  must  pave the road for an early re-unification

with  the Federation of Malaya. It is only  through

merger with the Federation to become a State in  an

independent  country that we  can  have  the  basic

conditions  for  the establishment of  a  socialist

state.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the power of internal self-government is

already  in the hands of the people today, we  must

fully  utilise this advantageous political position

to do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



our  best  during  our  term of  office  to  create

conditions favourable to an early merger  with  the

Federation  of Malaya. We must make our strife  for

national  re-unification  the  most  pressing   and

important task of the P.A.P. Government. We  should

not forget that over and above the government there

is  the Internal Security Council which decides  on

internal   security   matters  affecting   external

defence. Therefore every responsible citizen should

be  fully aware of this fact so that we may do  our

work in a cautious and realistic manner. We wish to

emphasise that rash adventurism, here and now,  can

only  bring  unfortunate consequences  to  the  new

government.  Of  course,  we  hope  the  Federation

member  on  the  Internal  Security  Council   will

understand  the  desires  and  aspirations  of  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a mass Party in a predominantly Chinese city,

we  must  adopt  the most dynamic  and  imaginative

steps   in   carrying  out  our  task  of  national

construction.  We  should  point  out   early   re-unification is to the mutual interests and benefits

of  the people of the Federation and Singapore.  Of

course, in carrying out this work in order to reach

our  objective, a small section of the people  will

always  oppose  us  and show their dissatisfaction.

But  the  Government  must consider  the  long-term

interests of the State as a whole. The interests of

a  small section of the people must be subordinated

to  the interests of the majority of the people - the

Malays, Chinese and Indians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the problem of law and order and in

dealing with crimes and secret societies, we should

not   overlook  their  basic  social  and  economic

causes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the former Government was being

inept  in  tackling  the problem  of  unemployment.

Certain  Assemblymen  and even Assistant  Ministers

were  seen  mixing up with secret society gangsters

and   had  no  hesitation  in  making  use  of  the

gangsters  in  order to achieve their own  personal

ends.  All these point to the fact that crimes  and

secret society



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



activities  have,  to  a certain  extent,  received

official patronage. The P.A.P. Government will adopt

a  positive  attitude in tackling  these  problems.

Regarding  our  long-term measures, the  Government

has  already  announced that it  will  take  active

steps  to  expand  industries so that  the  factors

contributing   to  criminal  and   secret   society

activities,  i.e., unemployment, would be  improved

and  gradually solved. In the immediate future, the

people will be encouraged to organise themselves to

combat  gangsterism, and the Police Force  will  be

reorganised  and  strengthened and  its  efficiency

raised.  At the same time, we intend to  amend  the

Criminal Laws so that the authorities will be  able

to   punish  more  severely,  those  convicted   of

creating   public  disorders.  In  tackling   these

problems, the Government will pay special attention

to  more  constructive measures in  protecting  the

safety  of the people and stopping the crime  wave.

In fact, from last month the Government has already

taken measures to stop those activities leading  to

crimes,  namely,  yellow  culture,  juke-boxes  and

pintable  saloons.  We will actively  continue  our

campaign  in this direction. Also our prisons  will

be  reformed so that more emphasis will be laid  on

the rehabilitation of the criminals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of immigration, we have to consider

carefully the problem of increasing unemployment in

the country. During the past few years, the average

number  of  immigrants per year is  6,000.  In  the

first  half  of this year, however, the  number  of

immigrants has exceeded 4,000. It is estimated that

by  the  end of the year, the number will  probably

reach  10,000. Add to it will be another 10,000  or

more people per year coming from the Federation  to

live   in   Singapore.  The  problem   is   further

aggravated   by  the  startling  rate  of   natural

increase of the population. All these point to  the

fact  that  if we allow this situation to  develop,

then   our   unemployment  problem  is   going   to

deteriorate further and our entire national economy

will    undoubtedly   be   faced    with    greater

difficulties.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large-scale immigration will not only worsen our

unemployment and population problems  but  it  will

also   create  political  problems.  How   can   we

assimilate these new immigrants whose thinking  and

outlook  are  not Malayan and how do we  instil  in

them Malayan loyalty?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a Government elected by a great majority

of  the  people to serve their interests.  We  must

give  prior  consideration to the interest  of  the

people  of Singapore. In order to avoid a worsening

of   the   unemployment  situation,  we  must,   of

necessity, adopt a more restrictive attitude in the

matter  of  immigration, so that more opportunities

may be given to the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the People's Action Party, in accepting the

mandate to form a Government have long ago realised

that  we  will be facing these grave and  difficult

problems. However, we have a disciplined party  and

a   concrete  political  programme,  and  with  the

continuous  support  of the  great  masses  of  the

people,  we  are confident that in  the  next  five

years, the new Government will be able to lead  the

people  of Singapore one step closer to a peaceful,

happy and democratic Socialist Malaya!



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, I give my full support to the  motion

moved  by  the  Deputy Prime Minister.  Before  the

elections,  our  Party  clearly  made   known   our

policies to the electorate so that the people could

make their choice. For instance, in connection with

our  policy on women even before the election,  our

Party  had  clearly enunciated its policy.  In  the

policy  statement,  we have very clearly  explained

the  conditions  that are faced  by  women  in  our

present  society  and also what we  will  be  doing

after we have been returned to power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody knows that in the old decadent society,

certain  men,  because of their  wealth  and  their

power,   frequently  had  three  wives   and   four

concubines  and,  as  a  result  of  this,   family

tragedies were always the order of the day. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



is  a  great  insult to the dignity  of  women.  Of

course, there are certain women who do not dare  to

face  reality, and because of the pressure  mounted

against  them by social conditions and  because  of

the  fact  that they have been denied opportunities

for  education, perhaps, for instance, some of them

feel that because of the comfortable life given  to

them therefore they are prepared to accept the life

of  a  concubine of some rich man. We are going  to

educate such women so that they will realise  their

own  dignity.  We  will make them discard  the  old

luxurious  way  of  living. We will  make  them  no

longer  desirous of having a comfortable  luxurious

life. We want them to be women of a new society. We

also  hope that sensible men will also realise that

a system of multiple wives will fail to create more

family  happiness and there will be  no  peace,  so

that  wives  and children will all be fighting  one

another, as a result of which tragedies will arise.

We  are  going  to  encourage women  to  leave  the

kitchen  and  ask them actively to  participate  in

political  activities to struggle  for  the  rights

that  belong to the women. We will ask  that  there

will  be  more  creches to be put up  so  that  the

professional  women  may be  able  to  leave  their

children  in these creches and they can  peacefully

do  their work outside. Further, we are going to do

our  utmost  to protect women from being  exploited

and  harmed, and we will investigate the conditions

of  women  working  in  bars and  other  places  of

entertainment.  We  are going to  punish  seriously

those  who  entice women to take part  in  unlawful

activities.  At  the same time,  we  are  going  to

increase the scope of possibilities for women to be

employed  and we will do our best to see  that  the

wages  paid to women are not lower than  men's  and

also  to  investigate  the conditions  under  which

women are compelled to work overtime. We will  also

insist  that  during  the prenatal  and  post-natal

period they are given sufficient leave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, our Party is in the Government and we will

progress  step  by step in order to carry  out  our

policy   to  improve  the  political  and  economic

position of women in this new society of ours. I am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>



a  woman and, with regard to the problems of women,

I  have very high ideals and strong sentiments, and

I  am sure that many Assemblymen have the same kind

of  sentiments that I have. In the near future,  we

are  going  to pass legislation stipulating,  under

the  law, that every man may have only one wife  so

that we can create a happy life in the homes of our

new society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the policy speech made by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara concerning the Government's

administrative policy, the Member for Cairnhill has

given  his viewpoint on the united labour movement.

He stated that his Government had allowed the trade

unions   to   develop  at  random  and  that   they

registered any union which wished to be registered.

His  viewpoint  and ours are totally different.  We

all  know  that if we let the trade  unions  to  be

registered  as  they are formed  this  will  merely

result in the breaking up of the solidarity of  the

workers. The Member for Cairnhill said that he is a

trade union leader, but has he ever thought that if

we  allow several more unions of the same trade  to

be  registered, what kind of position or status the

workers  will  have  in  their  negotiations   with

employers? If he had thought of this point, perhaps

he  would not have said that during the period when

his  Party was in power, they would simply register

any union that wished to be registered. We look  at

this  problem in a different manner.  We  all  know

that if we allow different unions of the same trade

to be-

debating  the Trade Unions (Amendment)  Bill  which

<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  30th May, 1959, was a  day  for  the

people  of Singapore to march forward. On that  day

all  the  people  in  Singapore, by  constitutional

means of evolution, voted our 43 Members into power

in  the Assembly. We will follow the wishes of  the

people and will do our best to implement our  Five-Year  plan. Furthermore, we will establish a happy,

prosperous and good Singapore. We will do our  best

to merge with the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the former Government superficially was

prosperous and built good buildings for the people,

the livelihood of the people was poor. This kind of

thinking could be thought of only by them  but  not

by  us; we think differently. The rich live in  big

houses, ride in cars; whereas the poor people  live

in  cottages and sometimes cannot even enjoy  their

daily  three meals with satisfaction. We will unite

the people of Singapore to work peacefully in order

to build a happy, egalitarian Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past hundred years the people had been

oppressed   by  the  colonial  rulers   and   their

livelihood  was difficult and although they  worked

very  hard they could not improve their livelihood,

not   to   mention  the  provision  of  water   and

sanitation  and  the development of  facilities  in

school,  and  so  on.  Therefore,  those  corrupted

conditions existed as if there was no Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this is a Government of the people. We will

put  emphasis on the livelihood and rights  of  the

people. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>



will  work  and enjoy with the people of Singapore.

We  will do our work as responsible citizens.  This

work  should be done by all the people  who  should

conscientiously work together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the other day, the eyes of the Member for Cairnhill were blurred. It was because

formerly he was on this side of the House, and  now

he  is on that side. Tears came from his eyes,  and

so  his  eyes  were  blurred. He thought  that  his

colleague, the Member for Tanglin, said that in our

country the deficit must be borne by all the people

and  not by a minor section of the people. I  think

this  is  the wrong view. We must know that today's

Government  represents the poor people.  The  money

got  from the poor people must be used for the good

of  the poor people. The wealthy are able to obtain

thousands  of  dollars in salary but the  poor  can

only get a very small pay, and if the reduction  in

allowances  is  to be borne by all  the  people  of

Singapore, it is most unfair. Furthermore, this  is

only a reduction in variable allowances. There  are

many low-paid Government employees who support  our

measures. I met a low-paid Government employee  the

other day who told me that what the Government  did

was quite right. He also said that in the past they

had to pay 70 cents for a kati of sugar, but now it

is  only 20 cents a kati. A number of years ago, if

anyone  wanted to buy a car, he had to  pay  coffee

money,  but  now they can buy a car without  paying

coffee  money.  In the past if I wanted  to  buy  a

shirt, I had to pay something like over $7 but  now

I  only  pay about $3. That goes to show  that  the

prices  of daily commodities have greatly  reduced.

We  are  only reducing the allowances of Government

employees  who are receiving high pay, and  I  feel

that  this would not be a very great loss to  them.

Furthermore  there  are  a  great  many  people  in

Singapore  who  do not have to bear  a  higher  tax

burden.



<br><br>3.09 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker,  there  was one moment during  the  debate

last Friday when I felt really anxious about the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



Member for Cairnhill. That was when at one stage of

his peroration he took off his glasses to wipe them

so  that  he could get a better view of Members  on

this  side  of the House. If I remember  correctly,

Sir,  he  was at that moment preparing to  fix  his

gaze  on the Minister for Labour, and he might have

succeeded but for your timely intervention. I was a

little  perturbed by this obviously  well-rehearsed

gesture  because  the  one thing  you  cannot  help

noticing  in  this House, even without glasses,  is

our  Minister for Labour and Law. In fact,  Sir,  I

had  to take a quick glance in the direction of our

Minister for Labour and Law to reassure myself that

nothing  untoward had happened to him. But even  if

the  Member  for Cairnhill had some  difficulty  in

recognizing  the Minister for Labour  and  Law,  he

must  have been in pretty bad shape not to be  able

to  see the Government benches. Sir, you have  only

to look at the seating arrangements on this side of

the  House to become aware of this fact - the benches

are  packed to full capacity. On the other side you

see  a  thin,  wavering line  of  Opposition  front

benchers  lost in a vast wilderness of  empty  back

benches - all  fronters  and  no  backers.  It   then

occurred  to me that the trouble was not  with  the

hon. Member's glasses as with his political vision.

His  political  vision  was not  particularly  keen

before the elections, and it appears to have  faded

more than somewhat since then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Sir, when listening to the speeches of

the hon. Members opposite on the Speech by the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara, my mind kept going back  to  the

little  story  about seven blind men who  tried  to

describe an elephant.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Eight!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I stand to be

corrected. It might be eight. In that story, one of

the  blind  men  caught hold of the trunk  and  was

quite  sure that the elephant was a snake.  Another

caught hold of the ear and-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suppose the hon. Member is

entitled  to  his  exordium, but  I  think  he  has

probably  taken  a  bit  too  much  time  on   that

exordium. Talking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



about  elephant trunks and snakes, I do not  think,

will help us to make any progress with the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I m really

building   an   elaborate  structure   which   will

eventually reveal what the elephant stands for  and

what the blind men stand for. With your permission,

Sir,  I think there are times when a very important

political point might have to be got over in  terms

of   parables  for  which  I  believe   there   are

precedents elsewhere.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Of course, I suppose the

Minister  can convince the Chair that all  this  is

relevant. To me, at the moment, it seems to be very

irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the point of that story is

that  the  hon.  Members opposite  appear  to  have

groped  about as unsuccessfully with the Speech  by

the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara as the seven blind  men

did with the elephant.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I understood the Minister to say

eight.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I think the

revised  version of the story should read  "eight",

and I will stick to "eight".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Sir, the representatives of U.M.N.O.

complained that the elephant had only four legs and

said that its fifth leg was missing; and the Member

for  Cairnhill complained that the P.A.P. elephant

was  in fact a modified version of the Labour Front

mouse.  He  claimed  that there  was  no  essential

difference   between  the  P.A.P. programme - I   am

getting  to the point at issue - as embodied  in  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech and what the Labour

Front - latterly    the    S.P.A.    /U.M.N.O./M.C.A.

Coalition  Government - had been trying to do  during

the   last   four  years.  This  belief  that   the

Government's objectives are essentially the same as

the Opposition's prompted the Member for Tanglin to

outline  in  this  House the  role  the  Opposition

intends  to  play.  The  Member  for  Tanglin,  who

obviously has a nautical turn of mind, saw  himself

and his colleagues



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



as ancient mariners helping the Government to guide

the ship of state. He compared, Sir, the Government

to the crew of a ship and the Prime Minister to its

captain.  He  alarmed us, Sir, by saying  that  the

Opposition would keep a weather-eye open, and  warn

the  crew  and  the Captain whenever the  ship  was

heading for the rocks. The assumption - a completely

incorrect one, as I shall show later - is that we and

they  are heading for the same port. Now, Sir, even

if  this  assumption is true, the last  thing  this

Government  intends to do is to  take  advice  from

shipwrecked captains. If the hon. Members  opposite

had known anything about navigating ships of state,

they  would  not be on the political  rocks  today.

They would not be marooned sea captains.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without appearing to be unduly immodest, I think

our navigation charts are more reliable because, as

you  can see, Sir, after four years of struggle and

effort,  the captain and crew on this side  of  the

House have reached their first port of call safely.

On  the  other side, Sir, you see slightly  seasick

captains, minus passengers, crew and ship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, I was just wondering how they

intend  to  reach the next port of call five  years

from now. I have no doubt. Sir, that they genuinely

believe that even if they have no ship or crew they

can  swim for it. Sir, the next journey - this  five-year journey - is through uncharted seas, and if  the

Members  opposite think they can swim for it,  then

they  must be rasher men than I thought they  were.

Therefore, I submit, Sir, that there is a world  of

difference between what we stand for and  what  the

hon. Members opposite stand for. Ours is a world of

the living. Theirs is a world of the dead. In fact,

Sir,  listening  to some of the speeches  from  the

hon. Members was like listening to voices from  the

grave.  They  are  part and parcel  of  a  Colonial

society  which  gave  birth to them  and  nourished

them.  Their  attitudes,  their  ideas,  and  their

approach  to  politics  are  the  by-product  of  a

Colonial  society now in the process of being  laid

to rest.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was

contrasting   the   difference  between   the   new

political force that we represent and the political

force the Members opposite represent, and the  only

way I can indicate the difference is by contrasting

the  old  with the new, and if you will permit  me,

Sir, that will be quite evident when I contrast the

two  generations of men and women who  are  in  the

world of politics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading, Sir, from left to right, there is the

Member for Tanglin who began his political career-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am afraid I must ask the Minister

to  go off that tack because to me it seems that if

histories of individual members are given, the hon.

Member will be speaking on something which is very,

very  far  away from the motion. He  can  speak  in

general  terms,  I  quite  agree,  contrasting  the

outlook of one group of people with the outlook  of

another  group  of people, but I do  not  think  he

should embark on personalities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, I shall talk

collectively  and  generally.  As  you  know,  Sir,

collectively, the representatives of the Party  now

called  the  S.P.A., the majority of them,  started

life as political apprentices in a Party called the

Progressive  Party, a Party which is  now  defunct.

One  characteristic  of this  older  generation  of

politicians was their propensity to switch from one

political Party to another political Party. Many of

them,  Sir,  have  two or three or  four  political

parties   to   their   credit.   Another   feature,

collectively speaking, Sir, of the political record

of   the  Opposition  is  that  they  profess   one

political   doctrine  today,  just   the   contrary

political  doctrine  the  next  day,  and   perhaps

something  else the following day. Sir, if  someone

were writing a political history of this island, he

would  be amazed to discover the bleached bones  of

so  many  political  Parties.  They  have  had  the

Progressive  Party,  the  Democratic   Party,   the

Liberal-Socialist  Party,  the  Labour  Front,  the

Socialist Party and now, Sir, the S.P.A.  Why  were

the  older generation of politicians, of  whom  the

hon.  Members opposite are the lone survivors, able

to switch from Party to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



Party,  to change political ideologies, to  profess

that  they  were  in  favour  of  the  defence   of

Colonialism;  that they were against  Socialism - and

yet  these same people come back and say that  they

are  now  in favour of anti-Colonialism,  and  that

they are now in favour of Socialism?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that this chopping and changing

about  from  one political party to another - what  I

would  call  political  polygamy - derive  from   any

personal  defects  in the people concerned.  It  is

simply  that  they  were  symptomatic  of  the  old

Colonial society which trusted men who could not be

relied   upon  to  owe  any  consistent   political

allegiance, and it was people of that calibre  that

the  old  Colonial society welcomed, because  those

who  can chop and change their views are the people

whom you can manipulate and can use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt, Sir, that as individuals they

wanted  to be single-minded, determined, and  loyal

to  a  political cause. But they could not, because

they  were  serving a society which was already  in

the process of decay. So they wobbled and collapsed

primarily  because  they  did  not  understand  the

nature  of  the social forces which they  tried  to

harness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Sir, in 1954, the Progressive Party,

which  was then in the ascendancy, thought that  it

could  outwit a rival political Party,  the  Labour

Party,    through   the   device    of    automatic

registration. The theory was that by the device  of

automatic  registration they could bring  into  the

political  arena,  people whom they  believed  were

Progressives at heart and could therefore be relied

upon  to  vote for the Progressive Party. But  what

happened  was that through the process of automatic

registration they brought in a large group  of  new

voters  who  turned out to be not  Progressives  at

heart.  The people elected to vote for a new Party,

a  Socialist  Party - the  Labour  Front.  Similarly,

recently, Sir, the SPA, formerly the Labour  Front,

thought  it  could also retrieve the  situation  by

using   another  device - the  device  of  compulsory

voting - again on the assumption-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you will

remember  in this House, when I spoke on compulsory

voting,  1  said  that it would react  against  our

Government, and it has so reacted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, I am very glad to

hear for the first time that the leader of the  SPA

deliberately  embarked on a venture which  he  knew

would   eventually  react  against  him.   But   my

understanding  of  the situation  is  different.  I

worked  on  a  newspaper which wrote  an  editorial

warning  the then Government that they  were  being

very   foolish  to  embark  on  compulsory  voting,

because  the  consequences might be otherwise  than

what  was generally hoped for by S.P.A. But anyway,

Sir,  through  the device of compulsory  voting,  a

larger  group  of electorate - the electorate  jumped

from  300,000  to  600,000 - was  brought  into   the

political arena, resulting eventually in the  death

of  yet another political Party. And the reason for

this  is  that both the Progressives  and  the  SPA

failed  to realise, and still do not realise,  that

the  vast  majority of people since they belong  to

the  under-privileged class are ready for a  social

revolution. And the larger the electorate  becomes,

the  greater  the preference for political  Parties

which    are    equipped,   organisationally    and

ideologically, for a social revolution. The PAP was

such a Party. The people recognised it as such  and

they voted for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We of the PAP believe, Sir, that a social

revolution is inevitable. It is inevitable  because

people  no  longer believe that poverty,  injustice

and   humiliation  are  conditions  to  be  endured

patiently.  They  are  not  visitations  sent  from

heaven.   Social  revolution  is  inevitable.   The

problem  is  whether  it  will  be  brought   about

peacefully or through revolutionary violence.  That

is  the  choice  presented to people  everywhere - in

this country and in many countries in Asia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We of the PAP are dedicated to bringing this

social   revolution  to  birth   through   peaceful

democratic means. Sir, those who have read the Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara's  speech  with  a  little  more

perception  would have understood that the  purpose

and  aim of the programme outlined in the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's  speech is  to  bring  about  the

social   revolution  through  peaceful   democratic

means.  Our  programme is not as the  hon.  Members

opposite suggested - a rehash of the Labour Front and

SPA  programmes. It may be, Sir, that the SPA,  the

Labour   Front   and  even  the  Liberal-Socialists

proclaimed  socialist ideals; they  too  proclaimed

their  determination to seek justice for the common

man.  But where we and they differ, and the  voters

saw  the  difference,  is that  we  are  in  deadly

earnest  about implementing our proclaimed  policy.

That  is  the difference, Sir. In their  manifestos

the  hon. Members opposite were sometimes even more

revolutionary during the election campaign than  we

were.  In fact, if I recollect correctly, Sir,  our

programme was more realistic because we went to the

election not promising Utopias and heaven on earth.

We  said,  "If you vote for the P.A.P., the  P.A.P.

Government  will demand sacrifices on the  part  of

the   people."  In  fact,  I  remember  the  former

Minister for Commerce and Industry going around the

country  with  a very tattered copy of  the  Petir,

wherein  we did write a series of articles  saying,

"If  the P.A.P. were elected to power, we would not

give  you  a heaven on earth." We said we  demanded

sacrifices  and work on the part of the people.  We

said   that  during  the  election.  Hon.   Members

opposite  used  that issue of the Petir  number  to

show that the P.A.P. Government offers you far less

than  what we are able to promise you. And yet  the

people voted for us, Sir, because they knew in fact

that,  unlike  Members opposite, we are  in  deadly

earnest  in whatever promises we made. And that  is

why, Sir, they voted for us, for the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, Sir, we have never, either before,

during or since the election, ever



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



promised  Utopia. All that we intend to  do  is  to

show our people that a socialist democracy can make

things better for the people, can improve their lot

though  not  in terms visualised by the Member  for

Tanglin. He complained of a P.A.P. dictatorship - how

terrible  we  were  because our  recent  action  in

introducing  wage  cuts  had  brought  considerable

suffering and hardship; because those who  rode  in

taxis were now reduced to riding in buses. But what

the  hon.  Member for Tanglin and those  who  think

like  him  do not realise is that the vast majority

of  the  people in this country have travelled  and

will  travel  by  buses.  But  as  far  as  he   is

concerned, "the people" means two kinds of  people,

Sir.  Those whom God has elected should  travel  by

taxis and those whom God has condemned to travel by

buses.  An  injustice begins when people  who  have

been ordained by God to travel by taxis are reduced

to  travelling by buses. That is injustice. But  if

people  who have been ordained by God to travel  by

bus  continue  to travel by bus,  that  is  in  the

natural  order  of  things.  It  is  that  kind  of

outlook,  Sir, which ended in disaster for  Members

who now currently support the S.P.A.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our goal is to strive for a socialist

democracy  which  does  not  promise  paradise  but

invites and demands certain sacrifices. But let  us

make  one thing clear. Though in trying to  achieve

and  establish a social revolution we shall  demand

sacrifices  from the people, especially from  those

who are in a privileged position in society, let me

tell  them  that in the long run the sacrifices  we

demand  will  be  cheaper than a social  revolution

brought  about by revolutionary violence. There  is

no  choice.  If  you  are embarked  upon  a  social

revolution,  then to bring it about  peacefully  we

must  make  the  necessary sacrifices;  or  we  can

postpone  it because we are too afraid to  shoulder

the  very small sacrifices demanded. But eventually

the  sacrifices  will be imposed on people  whether

they  like  it or not - and perhaps at a far  greater

cost than what is demanded of them today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the background against which the

speech  by  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara  should  be

viewed   because  then  you  will  see  in   proper

perspective the policy outlined in that speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I would like to deal with a particular

aspect of our social revolution - the creation  of  a

Malayan nation. One of the major tasks of the newly-created Ministry of Culture will be as the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech put it, "to instil  in  our

people  of  all races the will to be a nation."  In

this  connection, Sir, I would like  to  deal  with

some   of   the  observations  made  by  the   UMNO

representatives, and in particular the  Member  for

Geylang Serai.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, Sir, his speech and that of the Member

for  Kampong Kembangan were the most disturbing and

the most dismal I have heard during this session of

the Assembly. I say "disturbing and dismal" because

they  spoke  as leaders of a Malay political  Party

whose counterpart happens to be the ruling Party in

the  Federation. The UMNO representatives  in  this

Assembly  not  only  professed scepticism  that  we

would ever be able to create a Malayan nation,  but

they  were  also of the view that  it  was  not  an

enterprise they would approve of. In fact, Sir, the

Member for Geylang Serai advocated what was in fact

a  new  theory - the  theory of  three  nations.  The

Malays, he said, should remain Malays; the Chinese,

Chinese;  the  Indians, Indians. This  three-nation

theory  seems to be a recent development,  for  the

Member for Geylang Serai appears not to have  given

voice to it before in such strong terms when he was

a   Member   of  the  Labour  Front - U.M.N.O. - M.C.A. -

Coalition Government. Since his departure from this

side of the House to the other, this new theory  of

a   Singapore  of  three  nations  has  been  born.

Perhaps,  Sir, the most unusual feature about  this

three-nation theory is that it does not quite  fall

in  line  with  the Federation U.M.N.O.'s  attitude

towards  the question of a Malayan nation. Sir,  in

the Federation, the creation of a Malayan nation is

not  only accepted as a desirable objective  to  be

striven  for  but  also  as a  practical  one.  The

Federation's leaders,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



from  Tunku Abdul Rahman downwards, have repeatedly

stressed  that  the future of the  country  depends

upon  the  three races being welded into a  Malayan

nation. In fact, this objective is the corner-stone

of the Alliance policy in the Federation. The Tunku

in  particular has never hesitated to lash  out  at

political parties which thrive by preaching  racial

exclusiveness.  In  fact,  Sir,  last  Sunday,  the

former  Prime Minister of the Federation  came  out

with a slashing attack on political parties in  the

Federation  which  have overtly exploited  communal

sentiments and appealed to racial prejudices.  Yet,

Sir,  the  representatives of Singapore's  U.M.N.O.

are  publicly repudiating the concept and aim of  a

Malayan  nation.  Why, Sir, if it is  possible  and

desirable to weld the three races in the Federation

into  a  Malayan  nation,  should  the  Member  for

Geylang   Serai  and  his  colleagues  advocate   a

contrary  course  for Singapore? Anyway,  Sir,  the

Member for Geylang Serai must know the consequences

of  a  theory  which insists on keeping  the  three

races distinct and separate. First, such a division

must  keep  alive the flames of communal prejudices

and  fears, both of which can be readily  exploited

by   communal  leaders  who  have  no  constructive

policies  to  offer  the  people.  The  Member  for

Geylang  Serai  may  not  have  followed   to   its

inevitable and tragic conclusion the logic  implied

in  his  three-nation theory. He may not have  gone

far in his thinking - yet. Since he is not here, Sir,

I  shall lead his colleagues to this inevitable and

tragic  conclusion if only to make  them  aware  of

what this sort of thinking can ultimately mean  for

them,  for us and for the 1½ million people whose

lives  and happiness we hold in our hands. For  one

thing,   Sir,   the  three-nation  theory   implies

resistance  to  Malayan nationalism simply  because

Malayan nationalism is a complete negation  of  the

three-nation  theory.  If, as  is  inevitable,  the

forces  of Malayan nationalism grow stronger,  then

the  Member for Geylang Serai and those  who  think

like  him must actively resist Malayan nationalism.

And  how  is  Malayan nationalism to  be  resisted?

There is only one way of doing this and that is  by

fanning the latent flames of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



communalism.  Put  more bluntly, racial  solidarity

can  and must be strengthened only by appealing  to

racial  fears and racial sentiments.  That  is  the

logic of any movement where the binding link  is  a

sense  of  racial identity. The only way  a  racial

group can retain its identity is by appealing to it

in terms which it understands - and racial groups can

understand and appreciate only those concepts which

are  spelt out in racial terms. Conversely it  also

presupposes accusations of racial treachery against

Malays, and for that matter Chinese or Indians  who

ally  themselves with non-communal parties striving

in  the  direction  of a Malayan  nationalism.  For

every  Malay - and  Chinese or Indian - who  repudiates

the  idea of racial exclusiveness, becomes a direct

and permanent threat to the proponents of the three-nation theory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Member for Geylang Serai will re-examine some of his speeches made during the recent

election, he will discover how necessary it  is  to

exploit  openly communal and racial  sentiments  to

strengthen  racial solidarity. It may be  something

which  he  may not want to do but which  is  forced

upon him by the force of circumstances. For that is

the  only  way you can hold racial groups together.

So  it  is inevitable that as the forces of Malayan

nationalism gather strength, they must be countered

by  fanning  the  fires  of communalism,  and  this

process  must eventually end either in the  triumph

of  Malayan nationalism or in communal discord.  It

may  be, Sir, that the Member for Geylang Serai and

his associates may think that it is possible for  a

communal  leader  to switch off  communal  passions

once  they  threaten to get out of  hand.  Sir,  in

India  and Ceylon, there were communal leaders  who

thought  they  could switch off  communal  passions

which  they  had  perhaps  unwittingly  helped   to

create. They could not, as hundreds of thousands of

people discovered to their horror.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me put the matter a little more plainly. We

in  Malaya and in Singapore have reached a stage in

our  political development where we have the choice

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>



two  roads: the road to Malayan nationalism or  the

road to communal dissension - or worse, Sir, there is

no  third road. We move in the direction of one  or

the  other. Sir, the Member for Geylang  Serai  and

his  colleagues may be of the view  that  only  the

Federation  should  follow  the  road  to   Malayan

nationalism while Singapore should take the  tragic

road  to  communalism implicit in the  three-nation

theory propagated in this House during the last few

days.  But if Singapore keeps to the communal path,

it  can  only result in this predominantly  Chinese

city becoming a bastion of Chinese communalism.  In

other words, the three-nation theory propounded  by

some of the U.M.N.O. representatives is not even an

invitation but an insistence that this State, which

is  dominated by the Chinese, should convert itself

into  a bastion of Chinese communalism - because,  if

we  deny them the opportunity of becoming a part of

the  Malayan nation, then we are saying they should

remain  a bastion of Chinese communalism. I do  not

know,  Sir,  whether they realise the  consequences

which follow from the three-nation theory that  was

propounded   by   them.  This  is  the   inevitable

consequence, if Singapore should become  a  bastion

of  Chinese  communalism, then I say the  prospects

for  Malayan nationalism will be equally dim in the

Federation,  because  Singapore  as  a  bastion  of

Chinese  communalism will act as  a  stimulant  for

Chinese  communalism  in the  Federation.  To  this

extent, Sir, the three-nation theory, confined only

to Singapore, will frustrate and destroy one of the

major  aims  of  the  Alliance Government,  of  the

Federation's U.M.N.O. and of the Tunku to create  a

Malayan nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai asked us what we

meant  by "Malayan", and whether we hoped to create

a Malayan nation. They are rhetorical questions but

it  was  quite clear from his general tone that  he

was  quite  sceptical about this. He presumed  that

there can be no such thing as a Malayan and that we

certainly cannot hope to create a Malayan nation in

Singapore. But I will answer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



the  second part of his question. Yes, Sir, we hope

to  create a Malayan nation because the alternative

is  too terrible for us to contemplate. That is why

this Government has set up the Ministry of Culture.

We  believe that the prelude to a Malayan nation is

Malayan  consciousness, and a Malayan consciousness

can be brought about by implanting in the minds  of

people ideas and sentiments which provide them with

a  sense of common identity, common purpose, common

effort, and common destiny.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Sir, is not as impossible a task as the

U.M.N.O. representatives  sitting  opposite   may

think. It is being done every day in every country.

For   example,  people  are  not  born   Americans,

Frenchmen   or  Japanese.  They  are  turned   into

Americans, Frenchmen or Japanese. A man becomes  an

American, or Frenchman, or Japanese because of  the

mental  conditioning he is subjected to;  in  other

words, national consciousness is largely a question

of  education and upbringing. A child born  is  not

born  a  Frenchman, or a German, or a  Malayan,  or

even  a Malay or a Chinese. It is through the  long

process of mental conditioning that he turns out to

be  a  Malay,  Chinese or Indian. In fact,  Sir,  a

Chinese brought up in the cultural traditions of  a

Malay  imbibing the Malay language, Malay religion,

Malay  customs  and  traditions,  becomes  for  all

practical  purposes  a Malay.  Similarly,  you  can

bring  up an Indian or a Chinese as an American  or

any other nationality that you want. It is not race

but  the  cultural conditioning to which a  man  is

subjected  that makes him whatever  he  is.  It  is

therefore  not that difficult to create  a  Malayan

consciousness.  This is happening  every  day.  For

instance,  I  invite Members on the other  side  of

this House to look at Members who are in our Party.

I, Sir, am a Ceylonese - a minority of minorities  - one of those covered by the Constitution. Yet I  am

not  afraid. I have never felt any particular  fear

that  as  a  minority  of  minorities  I  might  be

trampled upon by my colleagues on this side of  the

House  or  by  the  Party  to  which  I  subscribe.

Because,  Sir, in my Party, though we have  Malays,

Chinese and Indians,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



we  do  not  talk or think as Malays,  Chinese,  or

Indians.  We think as Malayans. And one  becomes  a

Malayan  when one ceases to evaluate the character,

goodness,  and intelligence of a man by the  colour

of  his  skin,  by the shape of his  nose,  or  the

texture of his hair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not saying that the effort to create a

Malayan  nation  is  an easy one.  There  are  many

obstacles,  but  I say the major  obstacle  to  the

creation   of  a  Malayan  nation  is  communalism.

Communalism, Sir, does not spring out  of  nowhere.

People  are not born communalists. They are  turned

into  communalists. The flames, of communalism  are

fanned  by  a  minority of leaders who discover  in

communalism  a  short-cut to political  popularity,

and in every case, Sir, it has often turned out  to

be  a  short-cut to tragedy when, not the  communal

leaders,  but  thousands of  innocent  and  deluded

people  have had to pay the price-and a very  heavy

price  sometimes. Therefore, Sir, we fully realise,

as  the  Alliance Government in the  Federation  of

Malaya fully realises, that the task of creating  a

Malayan  nation  will be a long and difficult  one.

The  further we move in the direction of a  Malayan

nationalism,  the  fiercer will be  the  resistance

offered  by  those  who have  vested  interests  in

communal  politics, whether they be Malay, Chinese,

Indian, or even English educated. We realise,  Sir,

that communal sentiments are the easiest things  to

exploit in times of political stresses and strains.

For  example, in the recent elections, the  S.P.A.

tried to whip up Chinese communalism because of our

stand  on  the  question of Malay as  the  national

language.  The S.P.A. issued a pamphlet  which  was

supposed  to be a guide to their speakers.  One  of

the  points stressed in the pamphlet was that  when

speaking  to  a Chinese audience, they  should  say

that  the  P.A.P. was endangering Chinese  culture

because  by  standing  for Malay  as  the  national

language, We were going to destroy Chinese culture.

There was talk of ramming Malay down the throats of

non-Malay children. That was an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



open appeal to communalism, and the exploitation of

communalism  need  not  necessarily  come  from   a

communal party. And yet, Sir, the interesting thing

is  that  there  was  not a word  of  protest  from

U.M.N.O. leaders against this attempt by the S.P.A.

to  work up Chinese communal feelings on the  issue

of  a  national language. Just one little  item  of

food  for  thought  for the hon. Members  opposite.

They should reflect on how, in these elections, the

people  reacted  to communal propaganda - whether  it

came from a communal party or not. This, Sir, is  a

predominantly Chinese city and yet the people voted

for  a  Party which espoused Malay as the  national

language. I do not think we have quite realised the

significance  of this. We went before  the  people,

largely  Chinese, who quite rightly  are  proud  of

their culture, a very ancient and rich culture, and

said, "We of the P.A.P. will fight this election on

the  basis of Malay as the national language".  And

they voted for us. This, Sir, is political maturity

and  responsibility  of  a  very  high  order,   It

revealed  that  the  ordinary  people  can  show  a

greater   sense  of  responsibility  and  political

wisdom than can some of the so-called leaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, the underlying assumption

behind Malayan nationalism and a Malayan outlook is

not  very  difficult to grasp. It is  simply  this:

that  the  shape of a man's nose, the  cut  of  his

eyes,  the  colour or the texture of his hair,  are

not a sound basis on which to build a political  or

an  economic philosophy. Neither can political  and

economic   problems  be  solved  by  reference   to

something which we just got through the accident of

birth - our  skin, our colour, and the shape  of  our

eyes.  Therefore,  Sir,  a  Malayan  outlook   then

initially  means acceptance of the  truth  that  in

politics  and  economics, racial considerations  do

not enter. More positively, it means acceptance  of

the  fact  that whether we are Malays, Chinese,  or

Indians, we are committed to living in this country

for all time. If we are not to live permanently  as

strangers  and  rivals, then  we  must  accept  the

idea - there is no other choice - that we must live as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>



members of a nation, a Malayan nation. That is what

we  mean by creating a Malay an outlook. It is  the

only  outlook worth fighting for, because even  the

term  of life of political parties is more or  less

foreordained.  They  will run  out  their  allotted

time.  But people, the Malays, Chinese and Indians,

will live here for hundreds of years. And we of the

present  generation can at least  help  them  solve

this  difficult  problem, by  removing  from  their

minds  what is really a superstition - that race  and

religion  are factors which should enter  into  our

political calculations. And not only that, but that

they  should  also become the basis  for  political

conflict.  If  we  can during our  term  of  office

exercise  this superstition then perhaps,  Sir,  we

would have done a great deal for the future of  our

country.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  new trade union policy outlined  in  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech is not a  surprise

to  the  trade  union movement in this  country.  I

myself  being so closely associated with the  trade

union  movement  try to bring to  this  House  some

important things when we are discussing the  future

of the trade union movement in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after the war, in 1947/48, trade unions were

so  powerful in Singapore and so militant that they

were  in the foreground to fight for the legitimate

right  of  workers  in  Singapore.  But  under  the

pretext  of Communist subversion, the past colonial

Government  introduced  the  Emergency  Regulations

which considerably affected the growth of the trade

union  movement  in  this country.  When  this  was

implemented, most of the unions became weak and its

leaders  had  to find a different line.  Since  the

introduction  of  the Emergency Regulations  up  to

1955,  most of the unions merely existed for name's

sake.  Then in 1955 there were the elections  under

the  Rendel Constitution, and about one year  after

the  elections, the unions became powerful and they

again  fought to see that justice was done  to  the

workers.  But when we discussed from 1955  onwards,

even though we had a party government,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



it  began  to  change from the party name  into  an

individual  name, and now it is commonly  known  to

the  people of Singapore and to trade union circles

as  the Labour Front Coalition Government, or as it

is  generally  known, the Lim Yew Hock  Government.

Even though it is known by name as the Labour Front

Coalition  Government, we trade unionists  and  the

general   public  called  it  the  Lim   Yew   Hock

Government.  And  all that the Government  did  was

this.  The  Government tried to  divide  the  trade

union movement in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1956, almost all workers and trade

unionists  were  watching the situation,  and  they

were  paving  the  way to see the  funeral  of  the

Government.  The  Government  had  openly  declared

their  policy that they were the Labour Front,  and

they would do whatever they could to help the trade

union  movement in this country. But when they  sat

in  the Ministry they forgot what they had promised

to  the  people. They forgot what they promised  to

the workers, and they adopted an entirely different

attitude  which we think is worse than the attitude

of the past Colonial Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from 1956 onwards, we, the trade unionists,

were watching and paving the way, in a peaceful and

democratic  way, to see the funeral of  the  Labour

Front  or S.P.A. Coalition Government. Finally,  on

30th  May, we succeeded, and we all saw the funeral

of  the  past  Government. But  luckily,  Sir,  the

former  Chief Minister and Minister for Labour  and

Welfare  is  in the Opposition today,  so  that  at

least we have the chance to hear what he had to say

about what he had done for the trade union movement

in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Cairnhill last Friday

mentioned that the past Government had done so many

good  things. One important thing he mentioned  was

that  while he was Chief Minister and Minister  for

Labour  and  Welfare he tried  his  level  best  to

settle  disputes, and finally settled  so  many  of

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the important things in the new

policy is that the new Government is going to  have

an Industrial Court of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>



Labour. For that the workers will be happy. Genuine

cases will be heard in this Court of Labour and the

awards  of  that  Court  will  be  implemented   by

statute. What happened to the last Government? Even

today,  the trade union movements, when looking  at

these courts of labour and arbitration courts,  are

suspicious because the past Government, even though

they had the Labour Court, the Industrial Court and

courts of inquiry, did nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, on Friday, the hon. Member for

Cairnhill  mentioned that he settled the  Singapore

Harbour  Board Union's dispute. Sir, in  1957,  the

Singapore Harbour Board Staff Association started a

go-slow  campaign for recognition of  their  union.

Finally  the  matter was brought  before  the  past

Assembly.  The  Assembly appointed a Commission  of

Inquiry  to  make a recommendation and  to  lay  it

before  the Assembly. The Commission did,  and  the

recommendation  was put before  the  Assembly.  But

what happened to the recommendation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a Commission ordered by the whole

Assembly, and the recommendation was put before the

same Assembly. At that time, the Opposition Member,

the Member for Tanjong Pagar, moved a motion asking

the  House to urge the Singapore Harbour  Board  to

implement  the Commission's findings. On the  first

day,  the whole of the Assembly, if I am right,  22

Members,  unanimously  agreed  that  the  Singapore

Harbour  Board  should implement  the  Commission's

findings.  It was passed in the Assembly.  But  one

week, two weeks and three weeks passed, and nothing

happened.  The former Chief Minister  and  Minister

for  Labour  and Welfare had no guts  to  face  the

Singapore  Harbour  Board and tell  them  that  the

Singapore Legislative Assembly had passed a  motion

unanimously urging the Singapore Harbour  Board  to

implement the findings of the Commission.  Although

the  Singapore  Harbour Board is a statutory  body,

the  Government  failed to  make  them  accept  the

findings  of the Commission, and if the  Government

failed  to  enforce the findings  on  a  Government

employer,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



how  could the Government force a private  employer

in  Singapore to follow the recommendations  of  an

arbitration court or a court of inquiry?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, after three weeks the subject was

brought before the same Assembly, and at that  time

we all knew that the Labour Front was going to sink

and  the  Party leaders and the present Member  for

Cairnhill  were running mad to form  a  new  Party.

They  tried  to go to the Opposition  side  to  get

Members and all kinds of political manoeuvring were

going  on.  So, when again the matter  was  brought

before  the Assembly, what we heard from the former

Chief  Minister  and the Minister  for  Labour  and

Welfare  was  that  he was not  going  to  ask  the

Singapore  Harbour Board to enforce  the  findings.

The reason he gave was personal prejudice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, he said in the Assembly that with the

present  law, seven members can form a trade  union

in  Singapore. In other words, our past  Government

and  the  Minister for Labour and Welfare were  not

interested in seeing a united trade union  movement

in  this  country and they were not  interested  in

seeing that the trade unions and their workers  are

happy. But what they are interested in is their own

selfish  interest, and to see that their  blue-eyed

boys are happy, wherever they have got them, and to

give  them more encouragement to do corruption  and

to break the trade union movement in this country.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I must have

misunderstood the hon. Member. But has  he  alleged

that the Member for Cairnhill encourages corruption

in  the trade union movement? If he has, of course,

that  is  completely unparliamentary. I might  have

misunderstood  him. Perhaps the hon.  Member  would

explain?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> I did not mean the present Member for

Cairnhill  is encouraging corruption.  Sir, I  was

talking  about the past Government, and I  am  not

particularly pointing to any one man.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is all very well. But by the

past  Government, I take it the hon.  Member  means

the   then  Chief  Minister  and  his  Council   of

Ministers.   Therefore,  there  is   in   fact   an

imputation against the character of the Member  for

Cairnhill, and I think the hon. Member should be  a

little bit more careful about his imputations.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> Mr Speaker, when one talks about

political  or trade union corruption, it  does  not

mean  that they are going to receive money straight

from  the workers and put it in their pockets  What

the  trade union movement is interested in  is  the

attitude of the Government towards the unions,  and

in that sense we, the trade unionists, believe that

the  Government is corrupted because they  are  not

interested in seeing to the welfare of the workers.

But we do not really mean that they receive $10  or

$5  from  workers so that they can join a union  or

form a union.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member is now entering into

a  debate  with the Chair. I do not think  that  is

proper,  and I ask the hon. Member not to  use  the

word  "corrupt" because The word "corrupt" in  that

sense means corrupt in the dictionary sense.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> Sir, one important thing is that,

even   today  there  are  people  who  are  closely

associated with the Labour Ministry who are not  in

Singapore.   It  is  not  surprising.   After   the

elections they scooted off to Hongkong or  to  some

other  place. If they are so fond of  us,  why  did

they  want to run away from this country. Sir?  Did

they  find jobs for the trade union movement?  They

managed their affairs in the Labour Ministry in  an

inefficient way. They also contested the elections,

but  in the elections it is quite natural that  one

will  have  to win. When they cannot get  into  the

Assembly,  they scooted off the next day by  plane,

and they are no more in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this machinery which is meant to safeguard

the interest of the working class, to safeguard the

interest  of  the  trade  union  movement  in  this

country was abused either by the past Government or

through the inefficiency of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



department  concerned to use that  machinery.  That

was  where  the past Government collapsed,  because

even  on Friday last the Member for Cairnhill  said

that  he passed the Shop Assistants Ordinance,  the

Clerks   Employment  Ordinance  and   every   other

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you say you have passed an Ordinance but you

keep  it  in the files of the, Ministry of  Labour,

what benefit will the worker get? There are so many

Ordinances  which they passed and which  are  still

kept  in  the old files of the Ministry of  Labour,

and nobody knows where they kept them now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Government pass an Ordinance, it is the

duty   of  the  Government  to  see  that   it   is

implemented without fear or favour. Once  they  are

able  to  do  that, then only will the workers  say

that  it  is a real Government who looks after  the

interest  of  the people. But the past  Government,

said  the hon. Member for Cairnhill, had, to  their

credit, passed the Clerks Employment Ordinance, the

Shop   Assistants  Ordinance  and   the   Factories

Ordinance and so many other Ordinances. But we  who

have moved so closely with the trade union movement

know   that  although  all  these  Ordinances  were

passed,  they  were kept in the files,  and  nobody

went to see whether the employers are following the

Ordinances  or not. There are certain  cases  where

there  is nobody to prosecute or take the necessary

action  against  the employers who did  not  follow

these Ordinances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing in the policy speech is the

Trade Union House. It has long been the ambition of

the  Singapore  Trades  Union  Congress  and  other

unions  to see a central organisation for  all  the

workers, and, of course, the Singapore Trades Union

Congress  before spent a considerable time  to  see

that  there should be a united trade union movement

and a central place for all the unions to assemble.

But   the  encouragement  we  got  from  the   past

Government  was quite pitiful. Also  the  fantastic

number  of splinter and yellow unions formed during

the  past  four  years in Singapore prevented  this

ambition of the unions. All the unions in Singapore

should   be   united   under  a   single   national

organisation. And this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



national  organisation must have  a  proper  place,

that  is, a trade union house. The policy  of  this

new  Government is wholeheartedly welcomed  by  all

real  trade  unions in Singapore  because  we,  the

trade  unions, were fighting against two  kinds  of

exploitation.  One  is that  we  are  fighting  our

foreign  masters, and the second  is  that  of  the

local  colonial masters' exploitation  of  workers.

But since the new Constitution came into force, we,

the  trade  union movement, must have  a  different

outlook, that is, a national outlook and a sense of

responsibility. The present Government is  here  to

see that a real trade union movement is encouraged,

and  a  proper  place should be given  to  them  in

Singapore.  And,  of  course,  the  present  P.A.P.

Government has a foundation laid by the trade union

movement in this country, and the P.A.P. knows what

to  do  and  what  is  good  for  the  trade  union

movement. We are here to see that justice and  fair

play   should  be  done  towards  the  trade  union

movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trade union office will also play an

important  part to produce the fruits of  the  good

work  this Government is going to do. If we want  a

really  contented  trade  union  movement  for  all

workers,  we  must also have a policy of  educating

these   workers   and  the  trade   union   leaders

themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, it is also the duty of the trade union

movement to have full trust and confidence in  this

new  setup,  that  is  the  Court  of  Labour,  the

Arbitration Court, the Conciliation Board, and also

a  new  Trade  Union House, to encourage  the  real

growth of the trade union movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should again say that what the past Government

did  towards the trade union movement can never  be

forgotten. The subject of splinter unions will come

up for debate again at the next sitting and we will

have  a  more interesting time with the hon. Member

for Cairnhill sitting at the opposite side, because

up  to 30th May, the last day, he was sitting  here

and  he was mainly responsible for the splinter  or

yellow  unions in Singapore. But we will be  giving

them a good time,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  on  the  13th of August on the  splinter  and

yellow  unions. He cannot run away because  we  are

happy he is just opposite us.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the hon.

Member  is  fair  in  saying that  the  Member  for

Cairnhill will run away. I am sure he will find the

Member  for Cairnhill in his seat, on the  13th  of

August.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> I would just say that he was lucky he

got elected again here. As a trade union leader, he

will be talking on trade union policy.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member is very fond of

debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> Sir, there is one point I would like

to  mention to the hon. Member for Cairnhill  while

we are talking about economic policy. He said there

is  a good atmosphere for industrial development in

the  Federation. But he forgot to mention also  one

point  as well, i.e. there is good opportunity  for

political crooks to run away to the Federation  and

start tin mines. So it is not only for business but

also for political crooks just to scoot off to  the

Federation,  go to Ipoh, and start tin mines.  They

have got good opportunities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, regarding this new Ordinance

relating  to the trade union movement,  we  on  the

workers'  side will consider it as the Magna  Carta

of  the trade union movement and for the workers in

Singapore. The only Party or Government  which  can

faithfully  carry out this policy  is  the  present

Government - the P.A.P. Government - because the P.A.P.

has  got  the backing and confidence of  the  whole

trade union movement in this country.



<br><br>4.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Lee Khoon Choy)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara of  our  self-governing State in his speech at the opening of the

Assembly said that the People's Action Party  would

carry out its Five-Year policy, but our friends on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



the  other  side are splitting hairs and expressing

doubts on all kinds of matters. It is difficult  to

blame  them because for more than a hundred  years,

the  Colonial  rulers  have  instilled  in  them  a

slavish  education.  Such  a  mentality  cannot  be

eradicated in a short period of time. Therefore, in

the  speech  of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  it  is

mentioned   that   the   political   and   economic

revolution  that have been started by us,  must  be

supported  by a cultural revolution.  It  was  also

said    that   we   must   cultivate   a   national

consciousness. Not very much of this work was  done

in  the  past. But the present Government  has  the

responsibility to establish and to  instil  in  the

minds  of all our people here the will to create  a

united nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Ministry of Culture, set up by the Government, has as its principal task the

instilling of a Malayan consciousness and  also  to

promote  the interflow of culture between  all  the

races  here.  During the Colonial  regime  and  the

slavish policy of enslavement, emphasis was  placed

on  individual enjoyment and also to propagate  the

belief  that  Westerners were better  than  Asians.

They  allowed yellow culture to poison the thinking

of  our  youth. You can see in the cinemas, in  the

newspapers,  in  the  mosquito  Press,   and   even

sometimes  hear  from  the  radio,  the   kind   of

materials  that  have been used  by  them  are  all

pornographic  or  full of sensation  in  character,

such  as  murder, assassination, etc., in order  to

stimulate  the  baser instincts of the  people,  so

that  our  youth  when  faced  with  such  kind  of

materials would forget their own culture and forget

the  responsibility  of  national  construction.  I

believe  everybody will agree that during the  past

100  years  or  more the Colonial Government  never

once  concerned itself with the establishment of  a

national   consciousness.  This  is  because   they

intended to rule always over this place. I  do  not

think  that  there is a single Colonial  ruler  who

would  give up control over a Colony. At  the  same

time, colonial education had forgotten to instil in

the  youth  a spirit of sacrifice for the  country.

Therefore,  when the Government decided  to  reduce

the allowance of the civil servants we explained to

them  very  carefully, that it was in the interests

of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



country  and  its  future that we  had  done  this.

However, because of the desire of the individual to

entertain  himself, these people do  not  have  the

spirit  of  sacrifice  for  the  interests  of  the

country.   Under   colonial   rule,   because    of

restrictions imposed by circumstances, the cultures

of the Chinese, Malays and Indians were not allowed

to  develop freely to promote healthy culture.  The

bad elements in cultural activities have taken this

opportunity  to advance themselves  and  they  have

promoted yellow culture and, therefore, the  P.A.P.

Government  ever  since it  came  into  power  very

quickly   adopted  anti-yellow  culture   movement.

Members  could  see in the Press or  probably  have

seen  in the Press that we have banned a number  of

mosquito  newspapers. We have also closed down  the

places  that would promote and cultivate and foster

gangsterism.   The   papers   have   reported   our

activities  and these activities have received  the

overwhelming support of the people. This is  merely

a passive way of doing things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of the Ministry of Culture is a heavy

one, because its task is to nurture the thinking of

the  youth of Singapore. Therefore, we have adopted

measures  to  reorganise  the  programmes  of   the

various   races   that  are  broadcast   by   Radio

Singapore. In the past, Radio Singapore placed  too

much   emphasis  on  English  programmes.  In  this

direction  we  are  taking steps to  improve  these

things. From the 2nd of August, we will have  quite

a  few new programmes in the Chinese section, There

will  be  symposiums  on  the  air - cultural  talks,

introduction  of  the  cultures  of   the   various

races - drama,   sporting  activities,   rural   area

activities,  a  women's magazine, trade  union  and

school activities, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have been in touch with various musical

and  dramatic organisations to ask them to  put  on

programmes at the Botanic Gardens and other  public

places   to  stage  programmes,  to  show   healthy

cultural  activities. These measures  taken  by  us

have got a dual purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want music and culture to be brought to the

masses  of the people. Everybody knows that in  the

past, art and music are the monopoly of only a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



small  section  of  the  people.  We  can  see  the

Victoria  Theatre. The past Governments  had  spent

nearly  $2½ million to construct such a luxurious

theatre  in order to allow a small section  of  the

people, wearing suits and neckties, to go in  there

and  enjoy  themselves. Did they  know  music?  Not

necessarily. They merely went there to  let  people

see  them  and  know  that  they  belonged  to  the

privileged class. On one occasion, I in my capacity

as  a reporter went to attend a concert. I was able

to  see  with my own eyes such as I have described,

Music  had become the instrument by which  a  small

section  of  the  privileged people endeavoured  to

enhance  their  own  social position,  Furthermore,

last  week  when  we  went to visit  the  community

centres,  we  were  able to see  that  a  so-called

community  centre had become the  private  club  of

certain  individuals. In one place we were able  to

see  only propaganda materials issued by the United

States  Information Service, How can the youth  who

grow  up  in these circumstances possibly  have  an

understanding of national problems? They have  been

subjugated  to  the  mental  enslavement   of   the

Colonialists. They have been influenced  by  ideals

imported from foreign countries. How can we  foster

a mentality among the youth for them to be loyal to

this  country? Therefore, the duty of the  Ministry

of  Culture is to see that the youth of  all  races

here   are   able  to  develop  in   very   healthy

circumstances  an understanding and  a  loyalty  to

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the era of the privileged people is over, The People's Action Party represents the

great   masses   of  the  people.   Everywhere   in

everything that we do we always consider the people

first.  We  hope that those people who have  hidden

themselves  in  the ivory tower - the musicians  and

the artists - will be able to come out and contribute

their  art to the people and will become  one  with

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These mass performances in music and art have

another meaning. It is intended that the music  and

the  art  of all the races interflow, so  that  the

people of the various races would be able to  enjoy

and  appreciate the art and culture  of  the  other

races,  and  so  that in time the cultures  of  the

three major races of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



country will become one Malayan culture. Culture is

developed by the people. It is not developed  by  a

Government department.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. Kandasamy (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,

the Member for Tanglin this morning found some time

to  touch on the trade unions as well, but the hon.

Member was so lost in private enterprises and trade

unions that the trade unionists on this side of the

House  got  the  impression  that  perhaps  he  was

suggesting  that  private  enterprise  should   now

organise itself into trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Member for Cairnhill, Sir, the former

Minister for Labour and Welfare, waxed eloquent and

took  a long time to say the little that he had  to

say. Three points that he made, however, need to be

answered, at least for the inaccuracies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill claimed to be a trade

unionist. I wonder whether he claimed that right as

a result of having been a secretary of the Clerical

and   Administrative  Workers  Union,   the   Vice-Presidents  of  which Union at that time  were  two

employers, namely, Mr G. H. Kiat and Mr Seah Peng

Chuan,  or by his recent appointment as adviser  to

the  Company  Union,  and the  Transport  Employees

Union.  Sir, it has been a long time since he  held

office as a trade unionist. Trade union history has

changed  very  much  since  the  day  when  he  was

secretary of a union. His concern for the principle

of  collective bargaining was most amusing. Was  it

his  belief in collective bargaining that made  him

deny the elementary rights of a trade union to  the

Singapore Harbour Board Staff Association?  Despite

the recommendations of a Court of Inquiry appointed

by  his  own  Government and despite  a  resolution

adopted  in this House, the former Chief  Minister,

the  Member  for Cairnhill, refused  the  Singapore

Harbour  Board  Staff  Association  the  right   to

negotiate for all its members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill accused the Singapore

Trades Union Congress



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



of being silent over the cut in variable allowances

to Government employees. The Singapore Trades Union

Congress  does not exist solely to look  after  the

remunerations  of  Division  I  and   Division   II

officers of the Government service, who in any case

are  not affiliated with the Singapore Trades Union

Congress. The Singapore Trades Union Congress works

to improve the standard of living and conditions of

employment  of all workers of Singapore.  It  might

interest  the Member for Cairnhill to know  that  a

vast  majority of workers in Singapore do not enjoy

even 50 per cent of the salaries and allowances  at

present  enjoyed by the Division I and Division  II

officers of the Government service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Government, Sir, was elected into

office  by the overwhelming support of the  workers

of Singapore. It is a Government which has publicly

proclaimed  that it is on the side of the  workers.

Therefore, Sir, when the Minister for Finance  says

that  the  Government  upholds  the  principles  of

collective  bargaining and the  Whitley  machinery,

that  statement is good enough for the  workers  of

Singapore  and  the workers' movement  accept  that

statement.  Unlike  the  previous  Government,  the

former   Labour  Front  or  the  S.P.A.   Coalition

Government,  the  Minister  for  Finance  of   this

Government did give an assurance to the  unions  of

Government   employees  that  agreement   regarding

variable allowances will have retrospective  effect

from  1st  July, 1959. In the past four years,  the

S.P.A.   Government   had  always   rejected   this

principle of backdating an agreement. We would have

thought,   Sir,   that  when  the  Government,   as

employer,  invited  the unions  to  negotiate,  the

leaders  of  the  unions  would  have  carried  out

negotiations  immediately  in  order  to  reach   a

satisfactory agreement as soon as possible so  that

the  workers whom they represented would  have  the

satisfaction  of knowing what lay  ahead.  But  the

leaders  of  the so-called Council of Joint  Action

are  not  prepared to negotiate under  the  Whitley

machinery,   for  in  negotiation  they   find   it

difficult  to  present a case but it is  easier  to

seek



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



publicity  for  themselves. Sir,  there  were  many

unions   outside  the  Government   service   whose

difficulty in the past had always been to bring the

employers  to  the  negotiating table.  In  private

industry, it has always been impossible for  unions

either to bring the case to the Labour Ministry  or

directly   to   bring   the  managements   to   the

negotiating  table;  but  here  in  the  Government

service,  the  Government has offered  negotiations

and the unions have rejected them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill further said that he

thought  deeply  about the Singapore  Trades  Union

Congress  having  executive powers.  No  doubt  his

thinking was assisted by officials of a Chamber  of

Commerce  as  usual. Sir, the workers of  Singapore

have  followed  the thoughts and the  actions  that

followed the thoughts of the former Chief Minister,

and  they  did not like at all what they  saw.  The

workers  showed their dislike for the former  Chief

Minister's thoughts and actions by giving  a  sound

beating to the Singapore People's Alliance on  30th

May.  That  was  the  answer  of  the  workers   of

Singapore  to the former Chief Minister's  interest

in  trade unionism. Previous Governments,  for  the

sake of satisfying public opinion, probably, made a

pretence of supporting trade unionism; but in  fact

both  by administrative and legislative action they

made  it  impossible for big and strong  unions  to

carry  out  the legitimate activities  of  a  trade

union.   Previous   Governments   also   introduced

legislation which gave any seven persons the  right

to  form  a trade union. In fact, Sir, a  man,  his

wife  and  five children can form a union  in  this

country.   By   this  means,  previous  Governments

intended  to  show the world that in Singapore  you

can  have as many unions as possible, and therefore

the  workers  have  all the rights  to  form  trade

unions.  What they did not wish to publish was  the

fact  that  it was the weakness of the  legislation

which permitted so many unions to exist in the same

industry.  This is the weakness of the trade  union

movement, We have, Sir, as a result of that  policy

in Singapore today 225 unions organising a total of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



about 130,000 workers, and when this is compared to

about  450,000 workers in Singapore, it is easy  to

realise  that  only 30 per cent of the  workers  in

Singapore have been organised though there are  200

unions too many. In these 225 unions, there are  at

least 24 unions, each of whose membership does  not

exceed 50, and there are unions with seven and  ten

members.   There  are  eight  general   unions   in

Singapore, each competing for the same category  of

members. Our Government, Sir, has seen the weakness

of  this and has categorically stated that it  will

strengthen  the trade union movement.  One  of  the

means of strengthening the trade union movement  is

to  give  executive powers to the Singapore  Trades

Union  Congress or any other central  organisation.

The  present Singapore Trades Union Congress, which

was set up eight years ago and which by legislation

is not permitted to have executive but only to have

advisors  powers, is weak and ineffective and  many

unions  do  not  have confidence in  the  Singapore

Trades Union Congress. The past Government, keeping

in  line  with its policy to favour the management,

the   exploiting  classes  and  the   colonialists,

refused  the  demands of unions  that  the  central

organisation   should   have   executive    powers.

Therefore,  you find the trade union movement  that

exists  in  Singapore was not able  to  hinder  the

activities   of  the  unscrupulous  employers   and

colonialists who exploited the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contradiction between policy and action was

to be expected from the past Government, since they

served  the  interest  of  the  colonialists.   Our

Government is pledged to serve the interest of  the

people  of this country. We recognise that  one  of

the   most   important  conditions   before   sound

industrial  relations  can be  established  is  the

creation  of  a trade union movement that  is  well

organised,  unified, responsible,  disciplined  and

confident. Confidence and responsibility  born  out

of a realisation of its own strength, knowledge and

ability of its own to negotiate and reach agreement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



with management. A trade union movement, because of

the  organisation and resources that it  possesses,

is able to carry on collective bargaining backed by

facts,  figures  and sound reasoning.  Sir,  it  is

impossible  to have industrial peace if the  unions

are  weak  and  divided. It is impossible  for  the

unions  to  be strong and disciplined  as  long  as

their   own  central  organisations  do  not   have

executive   powers.  Since  industrial   peace   is

absolutely essential for the speedy realisation  of

the  economic  progress  of  the  country,  it   is

imperative  that  the trade union movement  is  re-organised    and   assisted,   as   suggested    in

Government's policy.

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  we have heard the speeches of Members  of

the  Opposition  and  their  attitude  towards  the

Government policy. However, we have full confidence

in  carrying  out our work. We are aware  that  our

policy  has got the support of the majority of  the

people  of Singapore, and at the same time we  know

our   policy   will  bring  about  happier   living

conditions for the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to talk about the

problems  of  women. We are aware  that  women  are

found  in every corner of society. They have hands,

feet,  and brains too. They are among those members

who have built up society, and they also constitute

members  of  the human society. But under  colonial

rule  and in a feudalistic society, and because  of

the  previous  Government they were  oppressed  and

exploited  and  were  not  able  to  develop  their

working ability. Now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



under  the care of the new Government most  of  the

women  in  this country will eventually  understand

and  realise their responsibilities of  working  in

this new society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we fully support the 48 items

of our policy. The Government will legislate on the

abolition of polygamy which, if committed, will  be

regarded as a crime. But this will not apply to the

Muslims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the new Government will further

the  work  of  the  Department of Society  Welfare.

During  this  short space of time we have  received

some  tragic complaints from women. 99 per cent  of

their problems were due to polygamy. Therefore,  we

must   immediately  stop  aggravating  this  tragic

incidence. We therefore fully support the 48  items

in our policy statement.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

if  I  may begin by referring to the speech of  the

Minister for Culture. In his address, he said  that

the  reason  for  various political parties  having

disappeared  from the political scene  was  because

these  parties did not have any appeal to the  mass

of  the people in Singapore. Mr Speaker, Sir,  the

present  Government has been elected under the  new

Constitution  which assures this  country  complete

internal   self-government.   Now   this   complete

internal  self-government did  not  come  about  by

living in a world of fantasy, or by waving a  magic

wand.  Someone had to work for it, someone obtained

it,  and  the fruits of somebody's labour have  now

gone  to the P.A.P. Government. That is so in  most

aspects  of  life - someone works hard,  and  another

reaps  the benefit. One does not quarrel with that;

life is like that. The P.A.P. will work hard today,

and  somebody else will reap the benefit  tomorrow.

So let not the P.A.P. laugh or scoff at the Parties

and  the persons who have done their best to  bring

out the present situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve years is not a long time, Mr Speaker, in

any  political  experiment or in any  struggle  for

self-government. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



idea  and  the hope of gaining self-government  for

this  island did not begin to stir actively in  the

hearts  and  minds of the people  until  after  the

Japanese occupation. It had been a thought  in  the

minds of the people before the Japanese occupation,

but  it became a spiritual necessity, it became  an

urge   after  the  Japanese  left  the  Colony   of

Singapore.  Yes,  it was after the  advent  of  the

reoccupation  that  the people  of  Singapore  went

forward with the purpose and aim of bringing  about

self-government  for  this  island  as  quickly  as

possible. That has been achieved in the short space

of twelve years. So let us, therefore, not scoff at

the Parties or the persons who have been able in  a

peaceable   manner   to   bring   about   our   new

Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the speech of the Minister

for  Finance, I had hoped he would have set out the

financial  policy of his Government for the  coming

year.  We know the intellectual attainments of  our

Minister  for  Finance; we know his calibre  as  an

economist;  and  we  know his stature  as  a  civil

servant.  With  these  three qualities  working  in

unison  to  help the Minister, Mr Speaker,  I  was

eagerly  awaiting  some pronouncement  which  would

give  an  indication  to this Assembly  as  to  the

financial future of this country during the  coming

year.   But  instead  of  making  a  statement   on

financial policy, he indulged himself in a  lecture

to  this House on fantasies and realities, He  said

that  civil servants were suffering from  fantasies

and that the sooner they got down to realities, the

better  it  would be for all of them. Perhaps,  Mr

Speaker,  the  civil servants were  living  in  the

realm  of fantasy. Who could blame them? The  truth

of  the  matter is that there were present  amongst

them  four  such good storytellers and actors  that

they  were able to produce the fantasies which kept

the  civil  servants in line with them.  The  civil

servants had with them the four musketeers,  Athos,

Porthos,  Aramis  and  D'Artagnan,  the  man  whose

rapier  never failed to reach its mark.  Who  could

therefore  blame the civil servants? If they  lived

in a world of fantasy, then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



that  fantastic world was created for them by  none

other   than  Athos,  Porthos,  Aramis,   and   the

indomitable D'Artagnan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, quite recently the Minister for

Finance talked over the radio. It is the policy  of

the  present Government that each of its  Ministers

should  keep  in touch with the people by  bringing

himself  over  the air and into the  homes  of  the

people. It is a very good thing, a very good  thing

indeed.  In  the  radio talk of  the  Minister  for

Finance, his first preoccupation was with the  role

of  the civil servant in the State of Singapore.  I

am  grateful to the Minister for having set out the

views  of  his Government on what the role  of  the

civil servant should be in a state such as ours.  I

myself have ideas on what that role should be and I

was exceedingly interested to hear the views of the

Minister for Finance, who himself has been a  civil

servant  of high eminence. Listening to his speech,

Mr  Speaker, I hoped that perhaps he, as  Head  of

the  Ministry which deals with all civil  servants,

would in one of his future broadcasts also tell  us

what  the role of a Minister should be in a  system

of  government  such as ours; and that  perhaps  he

might  also go on to tell us what the role  of  the

Back-benchers on the Government seats should be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite recently, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime

Minister made a pronouncement that Government Back-benchers have a role to play in the democracy  that

he was contemplating. I, Mr Speaker, was not aware

that   Back-benchers  had  a  role  in  the  active

governing  of  a State such as ours. But  naturally

one  would be delighted and one would want to  know

what the Prime Minister's conception of the role of

the  Government  Back-bencher  in  a  parliamentary

democracy is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education in his speech, Mr Speaker, Sir, said that $63½ million of the

national  budget of Singapore is spent on Education

and that all of this $63½ million - I speak subject

to  correction,  Mr Speaker - went towards  personal

emoluments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I think it was the Minister for Labour and

Law  who said that 42 per cent of the total revenue

of  Singapore went to personal emoluments. He  also

drew   a   comparison  that  the   total   personal

emoluments in the Budget of the United Kingdom  was

15  per cent. Mr Speaker, I think the Minister for

Labour and Law, possibly inadvertently, failed also

to  mention  in the same breath that  the  personal

emoluments,  in so far as education in  the  United

Kingdom goes, do not appear in the national Budget;

that  the  personal emoluments in  so  far  as  the

medical services in the United Kingdom go,  do  not

appear  in  the national Budget; that the  personal

emoluments, in so far as the United Kingdom  police

force  goes, do not appear in the national  Budget,

whereas   all  these  three  expensive   heads   of

expenditure  do appear in our national  Budget.  As

the hon. Minister for Education said, a quarter  of

our national Budget goes to education. The two most

expensive  items  on  personal  emoluments  in  our

Budget,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, are, first,  education;

and, second, medical services. These two items  are

significantly  absent from the national  Budget  of

the  United Kingdom. These items appear  either  in

the budgets of the local Government authorities  or

they appear as subventions moving from the national

Government  to various boards and local  government

authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I merely mention this, Mr Speaker, because the

Minister for Education and the Minister for  Labour

and Law mentioned these facts to the House in order

to bolster up the Government's case for cutting the

salary   of   civil   servants.   Employer-employee

relationship  is  a  matter  entirely  between  the

employer and the employee. But the manner in  which

these salary cuts have been brought about, and  the

ostensible reasons put out by responsible Ministers

for  these  cuts, is not only the  concern  of  the

employer and employee but also the concern  of  the

people at large.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the reasons given by the

Minister for Finance when he was about to introduce

these  cuts  were  two-fold.  First,  the  wasteful

expenditure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>



of   the   previous  Government  and  second,   the

threatened  deficit of $14 million.  These  reasons

had  impelled  him  into cutting  the  salaries  of

Government servants by doing away with most of  the

variable allowances for certain categories and  all

of them for the rest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, variable allowances are called

variable allowances because it was said at one time

or  other  that the cuts could be effected.  To  my

mind,  Mr Speaker, the justification for  bringing

about  these  cuts can be either that the  cost  of

living  has gone down or that the national  economy

has reached the stage where it is imperative to cut

these  allowances.  Nobody has suggested  that  the

cost of living in Singapore has gone down after the

advent of the P.A.P. Government. If anything, it is

suggested that it has gone up. Therefore, the  only

other reason which could have impelled the Minister

for  Finance to take this drastically quick  action

was  the  state  of  the national  economy - the  $14

million threatened deficit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech, Mr

Speaker, Sir, we are told that "the immediate  task

facing  the Government is to place the finances  of

the  country  on  a  sound and healthy  basis.  The

threatened deficit of $14 million for 1959 can  and

will  be wiped out.." The phrase used, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  is  "the  threatened  deficit".  So  why  the

Minister for Finance was making such play about the

speech of the Member for Tanglin I am at a loss  to

understand.  He himself used the words  "threatened

deficit", not a deficit which has come into  being.

So, therefore, the phrase "threatened leak" used by

the   Member  for  Tanglin  is  still  appropriate,

whereas the Minister's statement that the boat  has

sprung a leak already and is filling with water  is

not  borne  out  by  the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's

speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I was hoping that the Minister for Finance

in  his  speech would tell us how it was  that  the

past  Government had wasted the reserve fund  built

up so laboriously by the previous Governments which

are now being pooh-poohed and scoffed at by certain

Members  of the Government. He has not in any  part

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



his  speech indicated how, where or in what respect

there has been wasteful expenditure. I would in all

earnestness  suggest  to the Minister  for  Finance

that  the exchange of one capital asset for another

capital   asset   is   not  wasteful   expenditure,

particularly  when the exchanged capital  asset  is

bringing to the Government revenues on the invested

capital asset. I would suggest to the Minister  for

Finance  that  most of these moneys which  he  says

have  been  wasted by the previous Government  have

gone  into such assets. Whether it remains  in  the

form  of money assets, or whether it remains  in  a

changed  form  such as buildings  and  houses  that

people  can  live in, is not wasteful  expenditure,

but sound finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may now divert to the

speech  of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. It seems  to

me,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that the two important items

in  the  speech are when the Government  says  that

"the  prime  task  is  to build  up  a  climate  of

confidence   under   which  trade   expansion   and

industrial  growth can take place" and  the  other,

towards  the end of the speech, where the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara says that in so far as the State  of

Singapore  is  concerned, it is  the  intention  of

Government  to  create and bring  about  conditions

favourable  to  a  union or  integration  with  the

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, Mr Speaker, Sir, these are the

two  important  factors in the speech  which  would

bring  about a state of affairs in Singapore  which

would  mean peace, happiness and prosperity to  all

of  us.  If  either one of these objectives  fails,

then  the future of Singapore is indeed bleak. Soon

after the speech had been delivered by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. Mr Speaker, Sir, there was a  wave

of  confidence  in  Singapore.  But  I  venture  to

suggest  to the Hon. Prime Minister that to  create

confidence  in  the  country,  one  speech  is  not

enough, particularly when several others have  been

made prior to this one which tended to destroy that

confidence.  Therefore,  it  is  now  left  to  the

actions  of  the P.A.P. to build up  a  climate  of

confidence   under   which  trade   expansion   and

industrial growth can take place.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as a Member of the opposition, I feel it is my duty to support the Government in

every  measure and in any measure that is  for  the

general benefit of the State of Singapore. I  think

there  is  hope  in the speech, and if  the  P.A.P.

carry  out the policy speech, as we hope they will,

then  I  think  the future of Singapore  is  bright

indeed. But Mr Speaker, Sir, there are signs  that

in  certain aspects, what the P.A.P. say  and  what

the  P.A.P. do, does not seem to follow one  track.

The  first thing they did as soon as they came into

power  was  to  impose salary  cuts  on  Government

servants. Now, as to the manner in which they  were

imposed - the  Minister for Finance said  that  there

had  been  negotiations. As far as I am aware,  the

first meeting was called by the Government on  19th

June  and on the 20th June the whole thing had been

implemented,  by  way  of  circulars   to   various

Government   departments.   In   the   history   of

negotiations,  Mr Speaker, Sir,  between  employer

and  employee. I venture to suggest  this  was  the

most  successful  piece of negotiation,  especially

when one remembers that it was the employer who had

brought the employee to the negotiating table  with

a view to cutting salaries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is the only way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It had been suggested by the Member

for  Cairnhill that it would have been possible for

the   Government  to  bring  these  people  to  the

negotiating  table  and  to  tell  them  about  the

economic   plight  of  the  country,  the  wasteful

expenditure of the previous government and that  it

was a matter of life and death for these cuts to be

imposed.  Is it being suggested that civil servants

are  callous,  and  only interested  in  their  own

pecuniary profits from their work? A modus operandi

could have been arrived at; an agreement could have

been reached that the cut should operate as from  a

certain date. The Deputy Speaker has suggested that

this was not possible. I venture to suggest that it

is possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the salary of the State

Advocate-General  was moved in this  Assembly,  and

when I touched



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



upon a topic, you ruled me out of order because  it

was not pertinent to that particular issue. I think

that the issue which I raised then, is relevant  to

the motion now before us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Advocate-General, Mr Speaker, Sir - his

appointment  is  governed  by  section  30  of  the

Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council.  Section

30 subsection (4), reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The State Advocate-General may be appointed for

a  specified  period and, if he was  so  appointed,

shall, subject to the provisions of subsection  (6)

of   this   section,  vacate  his  office  (without

prejudice to his eligibility for re-appointment) at

the  expiration  of that period,  but,  subject  as

aforesaid,  shall otherwise hold  office  until  he

attains the age of fifty-five:".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this section in the Constitution makes it

possible for the Government in power to appoint the

State Advocate-General if they think fit from  year

to  year,  unlike  the  Auditor-General  who,  once

appointed,  holds  his  post  until  the   age   of

retirement.  Both these offices - the office  of  the

State  Advocate-General  and  the  office  of   the

Auditor-General - are  important  posts   under   the

Constitution.   The  Constitution   makes   special

provision for these two offices because the  nature

of  these offices is such that the holders of these

offices  must be left free to carry out the  duties

of   their  posts  without  looking  behind   their

shoulder  all the time at a Minister who  might  be

behind  their  backs.  I  am  not  suggesting,  Mr

Speaker, that in this particular case it is so, for

I  have  too great a respect for the present holder

of  this  office to suggest that such  a  state  of

affairs could ensue from this appointment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is a waste of time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> But it is possible that when the Hon.

the  Prime  Minister ceases to be  Prime  Minister,

there  could be some other Prime Minister who might

misuse  that provision in the Constitution. It  is,

therefore, important that before a State  Advocate-General  has been appointed, care should  be  taken

that  he  is a fit and proper person to  hold  that

office.  But  once he is appointed,  he,  like  the

Auditor-General, should hold office until he is 55.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest to the Hon. the Prime Minister that

this  is  a defect in the Constitution and that  he

take   early   steps   to   remedy   this   defect?

[Interruption]. Chief Justice who?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please continue,



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is another

section  of the Constitution which I would like  to

refer  to - section  29  which deals  with  Permanent

Secretaries.  Section  29,  subsection   (1),   Mr

Speaker, Sir, reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There shall be for each Ministry one or more

Permanent Secretaries who shall be persons who  are

public officers."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (3), Mr Speaker, Sir, the one I am

concerned with at the moment, reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every Permanent Secretary shall, subject to the

general  direction  and control  of  the  Minister,

exercise   supervision  over  the   department   or

departments to which he is allocated."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I read that section in the Constitution, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  it means this - that  the  Permanent

Secretary  shall  exercise  supervision  over   the

department or departments to which he is  allocated

subject  of course always to the general  direction

of  his  Minister. I understand that to  mean,  Mr

Speaker,  that the control, the check,  the  orders

issued  to  all  other servants in  the  department

shall  be through the Permanent Secretary and  that

those  orders  will  be  issued  by  the  Permanent

Secretary on the general direction of the Minister,

I  would  like the assurance of the Hon. the  Prime

Minister  that this section of the Constitution  is

being adhered to by his Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just one last point, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

been  requested to find out from the Hon, the Prime

Minister  to  which Ministry sport is attached  to.

Sport  seems  to have been missed out of  the  list

setting  out  the  departments and  duties  of  the

various  Ministries - perhaps inadvertently.  Perhaps

the  Prime  Minister would like to tell  the  House

that  he has not forgotten sport and that it is  in

fact attached to some Ministry or the other,

<br><br>6.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Ong Eng Guan):</b> Mr Speaker, the Rendel Constitution is

now  dead. We have today in this Assembly  on  your

right hand side 43 representatives of the people of

Singapore.  Although the Rendel Constitution  as  a

constitution is now dead, we have still remnants of

the  Rendel  era  and the pre-Rendel  era  in  this

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship which the captain and his crew under the

Rendel  Constitution have navigated for four  years

has   now  sunk,  and  a  new  ship - the  State   of

Singapore - is now being manned by a strong, youthful

and  virile  crew and this ship, we are  confident,

will  chart  and pave the way to all the  hopes  to

which we the people have aspired for many years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we understand the limitations of the present Constitution, which do restrain the

political  power of the elected representatives  of

the people. We do understand those limitations.  We

do  understand that the elected Government  has  to

work  within certain defined powers and that  there

are  curbs  and  restrictions on those  powers  and

functions  which a normal fully elected  Government

is supposed to exercise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we also understand that within the island state of Singapore, we also have limitations

on  our  economy, limitations which even a magician

turned Minister for Finance cannot solve. I do  not

envy  my  colleague, the Minister for Finance,  for

his  heavy  tasks. But we the P.A.P., understanding

those  very  limitations, have come  up  today  and

accepted the responsibilities of Government because

there  is  no choice left to the people.  For  many

years, particularly during the past four years,  we

have  seen  that  it was nothing but  inefficiency,

waste,  corruption and filth everywhere. The masses

cannot   get   what   they  want - even   the   basic

necessities which any modern Government  should  be

able  to provide. And it is the task of the  P.A.P.

Government,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



knowing  the political and the economic limitations

of the present situation, to come up and accept the

responsibility of this Government, as we did so  in

the City Council. When we were in the City Council,

our powers were as limited within the framework  of

the  Constitution as our powers now in the  present

Government are limited within the present framework

of  the  new Constitution. But we will be taking  a

wrong   move   if   we   refuse   to   accept   the

responsibility of Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are working the Constitution hoping that the day will soon dawn on our people

when  we shall breathe the fresh air of freedom  as

our  brethren in the Federation and other parts  in

Asia  do  breathe. Our way is the way  of  ultimate

independence  through merger with  the  Federation,

and  before  that  is achieved we  have  to  accept

whatever limitations are imposed on this Government

by   the   so-called  new  Constitution - limitations

imposed  on  us in this island State  with  no  raw

materials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short-term policy - that is, the providing

of  the  basic  necessities of  life  to  the  1½

million people of this island - and in our long-term

policy of attainment of re-unification of Singapore

and   the  Federation  of  Malaya,  one  thing   is

paramount  and that is, Mr Speaker, the  unity  of

all  the communities and the races in Malaya. I may

not  entirely  agree  with the leader  of  U.M.N.O.

(Tunku Abdul Rahman) in his political policies, but

I  must admit that he is a man of far vision and in

the  Sunday  papers he has said that  the  greatest

enemy now in our midst is communalism. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  communalism, as the Tunku has  said,  is  the

greatest  enemy  in our midst.  As  the  Tunku  has

attacked and sworn at communalism in the Federation

of Malaya, we in Singapore should echo his call and

we should try to stamp out in this little island of

ours any kind of communalism in our midst.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the limitations of the Constitution,

the  role  of  the  Opposition is  even  much  more

important than ever. The role of the Opposition  is

to provide constructive criticism to the Government

and not just to attack the Government in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



all  its policies. We have heard speeches from  the

Opposition  Benches and I have not even  heard  for

one  single moment any Opposition speaker give  any

constructive ideas. Perhaps the hon. Members in the

Opposition are not capable of doing it.  Then  what

they should do is not to speak too long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one single theme which strings across

the  speeches of the eight Opposition  Members  and

that  is  nothing  but the variable  allowances  of

4,000  members  of the civil service - or  even  less

than that. They say that the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara is good and that there  is  nothing

wrong  with  it. Perhaps Members of the  Opposition

know  that  the  speech spoken  on  behalf  of  the

Government  of  Singapore is a practical,  sensible

and  modest  approach  to the  problems  of  a  new

Government  in its first term of office.  I  cannot

understand  why  Members of the  Opposition  should

have  spent so many days and yet were not  able  to

contribute any constructive idea to the running  of

the  Government machinery but just  to  attack  the

Government, especially the Minister for Finance and

the  Minister for Labour and Law, on the recent cut

in  variable allowance, Just now, Mr Speaker,  the

Member for Farrer Park said that the deficit in The 1959 Budget is only a threatened deficit.

Yes,  Mr Speaker, it is only a threatened deficit because it

cannot be otherwise. We have not completed the year

1959  and the Minister for Finance could only  make

an  estimate that until something is done it  would

be  a deficit. Mr Speaker, we do not wait, as  the

Rendel  Government and the other  Governments  did,

for  the  ship to sink first before we take action.

We  have no time left to wait for the ship to  sink

first.  We  have  to take action  immediately.  The

Government  has to take drastic action  immediately

in  the  interest  of  the national  economy.  Such

actions  could  have been prolonged or  delayed  if

previous   Governments  had  not  spent  money   so

wastefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park was asking just now

for  evidence of wasteful expenditure  in  previous

years. Mr Speaker, in one of the departments in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



my Ministry, all the expatriates can leave and even

if  two-thirds of the local officers leave, we  can

still run as efficiently as before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park mentioned that finance

was    squandered   not   on   annually   recurrent

expenditure  but  perhaps on  buildings.  Buildings

like  the  expensive S.I.T. houses, buildings  like

the expensive bungalows in Kay Siang Road built for

S.I.T. expatriate officers in which the Member  for

Farrer  Park had taken a hand - this is what he  said

is  not  wasteful expenditure! I do not  understand

what  is meant by wasteful expenditure. Perhaps  it

is  not  wasteful expenditure as far as that  small

group  of  members comprising vested interests  are

concerned, but it is wasteful expenditure as far as

the people are concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park asked the Government

what  the  role of a Minister is. Mr Speaker,  the

role  of  a  Minister in the P.A.P.  Government  is

different from the role of a Minister in the Rendel

Government.  The Minister in the P.A.P.  Government

really  works and slogs. He does not leave anything

responsible in the hands of the civil servants.  We

have  noticed  that under the Rendel  Constitution,

four  or  five Ministers can go on leave to  Japan,

Hongkong and other places, and yet the machinery of

Government carries on. The P.A.P. Minister  is  one

who  believes  in sincere and honest  work  and  in

leading  a team of good, honest and sincere workers

in  the  civil service to work likewise, I  do  not

think that the civil service worked so hard for the

people in the previous Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park asked also what the

role of a Back-Bencher is in the P.A.P. Government.

The role of a Back-bencher in the P.A.P. Government

is  similar to the role of a Minister in  a  P.A.P.

Government - nothing  but  work  and  work.  All  the

P.A.P.  Assemblymen  are sent to  their  respective

Ministries just to slog and to work. For  instance,

in my Ministry of National Development, in addition

to  the  Parliamentary Secretary, there  are  seven

Assemblymen who have given up their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



jobs  in order to work for the Party. They are  now

getting  less,  Mr Speaker. They get  $500  as  an

allowance  out of which they contribute an  average

of $250 a month to the Party and out of the $250  a

month they pay $50 for transport allowance, They do

nothing but slog in the Ministries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, a few days ago, an Opposition

Member   mentioned  parliamentary   democracy.   We

believe   that,  on  the  Government  Benches,   we

understand   more   about   the   fundamentals   of

parliamentary  democracy  than  do  the  Opposition

Members,  because we believe that for democracy  to

work,  we  must  not only understand  the  form  of

democracy  but  its very essence. The  hon.  Member

expressed the fear that the majority in a democracy

might  not respect the rights of the minority,  but

as  our  Deputy Prime Minister has mentioned during

the  motion on the Committee of Selection, although

the  minority is less than one-sixth of  the  total

membership  of this House, it has been  given  two-sixths  of  the representation on the Committee  of

Selection.  Mr  Speaker,  we  do  understand   the

essence of democracy better than many others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, since we cannot expect much constructive efforts from the Opposition, we have

to  rely  entirely on the people who have given  us

strength and hope. We do ask them to contribute  to

us ideas of how to run the Government machinery and

to  bring  their  daily problems to our  attention,

because  we  believe  that if  we  do  not  have  a

constructive  Opposition, the best  thing  to  have

is - and  we do have it - an intelligent public opinion

and  a  people who will always be ready to  support

us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, it is especially important in

the work in my Ministry that the support of all the

people  is required. In my Ministry, there are  two

urgent  tasks confronting us. The first one is  the

grave  and urgent task of building houses  for  the

people.  The  second  task  is  the  planning   and

execution  of  a rural programme, to bring  to  the

half  a  million  people  in  the  rural  areas   a

programme which will modernise the rural areas, Mr

Speaker, we are now left with a very acute  housing

shortage. In my first week



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



of  office. I received more than 1,000 applications

for  houses.  We  are now left with  a  very  acute

housing shortage and due to wasteful expenditure in

the past - Mr Speaker, Christmas Island was sold for

only  $20  million,  and I am sure  the  phosphates

there  cost  many times more - we find ourselves  not

having sufficient funds to build all the houses  we

want to build. The S.I.T. has been building in past

years  an average of 2,000 units per year. This  is

not  sufficient,  In order to  catch  up  with  the

shortage,  at  least  10,000  units  a   year   are

necessary. Moreover, in the past years, the  S.I.T.

has  been  building houses not meant for the  lower

income groups, because if houses were built for the

lower income groups, there would be less chance  of

corruption.  The poor people cannot pay  for  their

houses. From now onwards, Mr Speaker, the emphasis

will be on houses for the lower income groups,  and

more houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second important aspect confronting the

Ministry of National Development is the interest of

half  a  million residents in the rural  areas  who

have been completely ignored in the past. With  the

past  regime, it was nothing but mere eyewash - "Form

that   commission,   that   department   and   this

department." The P.A.P. Government does  not  talk.

It  works  and, as a first step, it has united  all

these multifarious and small departments under  the

various  Ministries  into one administrative  unit.

The  Fisheries Department, Agricultural Department,

Veterinary Department, Animal Husbandry Department,

and the Rural Development Commission, together with

many   other  small  departments  from  other   co-operatives  come  under the Department  of  Primary

Production. The P.A.P. Government is now working on

a  programme to serve Malay rural dwellers  and  to

encourage them in the task of national construction

and   national  development.  Surveys   are   being

prepared  to  provide standpipes for and  to  bring

electricity  to  the kampongs, and  the  Government

will assist them to modernize the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government does not believe in

charity.  We  believe that everyone - man,  woman  or

child - in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



country  must play his or her part in the  task  of

national  construction. We do not believe  in  just

idle  living. Everybody must contribute his or  her

bit.   The   P.A.P.  Government  will  make   every

endeavour  to  make the farmers contribute  to  our

national  economy by increasing production  in  the

fields   of   agriculture,  animal  husbandry   and

fisheries development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Ministers and the Back-benchers of the P.A.P. Government work. The Party members in

our  Party work, and we have every confidence  that

the 1½ million people in Singapore will also work

the  same  way  as we do. This is  what  our  Prime

Minister  has  said - nice things do not  just  come

down from the sky.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are faced at present with a serious shortage of land in Singapore, partly due

to  the  previous administration in  not  having  a

policy  of  land  rationing. It is recognized  that

while our population increases in number every day,

the  amount of land available to the people  always

remains the same, and therefore it is vital for the

present generation as well as the future generation

to  evolve a sound land policy. Much of Singapore's

land  is either occupied by catchment areas, burial

grounds, or by the British armed forces. Much  land

is covered by tidal or mangrove swamps and there is

also  land  where cultivation is not possible.  The

previous  administration never even  thought  of  a

land policy. We shall put up plans for a sound land

policy, so that whatever land we are left with  can

be  made  use of wisely. Just to give an indication

of our present acute shortage of land: Commerce and

industry and residents take up 23 per cent  of  the

total  area  of  209 square miles of the  mainland.

Tidal swamps take up 11 per cent; the British armed

forces  absorb  11  per cent; the  catchment  areas

absorb  6.2 per cent. Mr Speaker, all these amount

to  a  total of 51.2 per cent of useless land. Land

held  by  various authorities for special  purposes

embraces a further 3.8 per cent; roads and  rivers,

3.3  per cent; nothing much is left for the  people

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



cultivate  or for future development purposes.  Who

is to blame for all these?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we believe that in this transitional stage of our history and that before we can attain

independence through merger with the Federation  of

Malaya, it is important that there should be  great

understanding  between  the  Government   and   the

people,  and  that there should be a common  united

effort of everyone in this country, so that many of

the problems which are facing us now - for instance,

the    problem    of    land   shortage,    housing

shortage - which  is connected with industrialisation

and  urbanisation - and  the problems  of  the  rural

dwellers could be more easily solved. Depending  on

the  nine Ministers, or depending on the 43  P.A.P.

Members of the Government benches, or depending  on

the  tens of thousands of members in our Party,  it

is not sufficient. We believe that in the difficult

times  ahead, which will last many, many years,  it

is  important for every person in this  country  to

understand   the  limitations,  firstly,   of   our

Constitution,  and secondly, of  our  economy,  and

that  there  are certain things which no Government

can  do, and no Minister for Finance can solve.  So

long as we have that understanding, and so long  as

we have everybody working in a joint united effort,

we  are  confident we can tide over  the  difficult

situations until a new day dawns over us, and  from

then  onwards,  Mr Speaker, the P.A.P.  Government

hopes to achieve a socialist society which we  have

all wanted for so long.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  first  may I  present  my  personal

greetings  to  you? It is a pleasure  to  have  you

resit  over this House with the decorum that befits

a legislature of the people. Sir, by the providence

of  a democratic constitution, you were spared  the

inconvenience  of  fighting the  elections.  May  I

hasten  to assure you, from this side of the House,

that  that  has not diminished your authority,  nor

the respect with which we hold your rulings in this

House.  There are, I hope, a sufficient  number  of

old faces to make you not altogether at sea. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



furniture  remains the same, three  P.A.P.  Members

are  here  to  remind you of the,  old  times.  Two

Opposition Members, who used to be here albeit they

look  a little greyer and older now, are also  here

to keep you company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I hope in the months ahead you will not find

the   somewhat  refreshing  gusto  of  the   P.A.P.

Assemblymen too burdensome a duty to have to carry.

I can assure you that I myself could not have asked

for  a more energetic and effective crew than  that

which the electorate has given me. But I would like

to   thank  more  than  the  electorate.  I   think

Providence must have provided us with eight of  the

most  suitable Opposition Assemblymen that we could

possibly  have  chosen. Even if  we  wanted  to  do

better,   even  if  we  were,  according   to   the

Constitution,  given the privilege of  picking  out

eight  names  to sit across us in this Chamber  for

the  next  five  years, we could not possibly  have

improved upon it. One Honorary Doctor of Laws,  the

leader; his deputy luckily is also here so that  he

will   always  be  reminded  of  the  follies   and

stupidities  of his past colleagues;  someone  from

the prehistoric age from Tanglin came to life-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was tempted to allow the

Prime  Minister  to continue in view  of  the  nice

words  he said! But I think I must ask him to avoid

personalities  in this debate, and to  get  to  the

meat of the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, much as I

appreciate  your views on this matter,  may  I  say

this.  It  is important before the drama commences,

first to have the dramatis personae and I have  out

of    modesty   for   the   P.A.P.,   briefly   and

comprehensively covered all of them. But out  of  a

sense  of fairness to the Opposition, I would  like

to sketch out the villains of the piece in the next

five  years. And may I just have one last  sentence

in  passing? Even their evil misdeeds in  the  City

Council will be squatting upon their heads for  the

next  five  years, in the person of the Member  for

Farrer Park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to say quite frankly and honestly

that  we are not really concerned with them.  As  a

force, a political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



force  representing the bulk or a sizeable  portion

of  the community, they have ceased to matter. When

I  say  that, I would like to make an exception  in

the case of our three U.M.N.O. friends. I say quite

frankly  from  this  side of  the  House,  that  we

acknowledge   that   they   carry   with   them   a

considerable body of Malay opinion, but not all, As

for  the  others,  they are there like  gunny-bags,

which I used to see in Japanese-occupied Singapore,

strung across the field for Japanese soldiers to do

bayonet  practices. Dead ducks, they could  not  be

deader!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last four days we have watched their

performance  from this side of the  House  and  the

role  they have cut for themselves, the poses  that

they have struck and the tone that they have set. I

would like to sum it up by saying that I have never

seen  a  more sterile, a more dessicated  group  of

people.  More bankrupt a political crowd has  never

graced these chairs. They raised three themes.  The

Member  for  Farrer Park is going to be  the  great

theoretician for the Opposition. He is the man  who

is  going to expound to us for the next five  years

the  theory  of the democratic system,  or,  as  he

said,  "Democracy".  He said we  were  undemocratic

when  we scrapped the City Council because all over

the  democratic world, as he understood  it,  local

Government, presumably after that practised in  the

old Singapore Municipality - subsequently turned City

Council - was  part of democracy. Therefore  when  we

scrapped  it,  it  was undemocratic.  Then  when  a

Minister  assumes  powers which  have  always  been

exercised by those in executive authority, when the

Finance Minister assumes the powers which were once

exercised  by  a colonial Financial  Secretary,  he

says it is undemocratic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today he spent a considerable time labouring his

point about how we should always be on guard to see

that  the  rules and regulations of  democracy  are

observed.  Sir,  it is the most  important  of  the

three  themes that they have raised, and I  propose

to deal with it last.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next theme was the pay cut. The Member for

Cairnhill  waxed  eloquent. In fact,  he  waxed  so

eloquent that there was a moment when I was fearful

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



his  dentures.  But  he  has forgotten  one  simple

elementary fact. In the trade union world, once you

are  burnt, you cannot, like the phoenix, rise from

the ashes. He burned himself to ashes over the last

four  years. His words on the principles  of  trade

unionism  and the practice of collective bargaining

fell  somewhat flat on a trade union movement which

had  learned not to regard his Ministry  of  Labour

and  Welfare  with the esteem and trust  which  our

Ministry  of Labour and Law is held by the majority

of the working class in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third theme was Malay rights. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  are  grateful to the Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan  for having moved that amendment  because

he  not only exposed himself, but he also helped to

bring  about one of the most farcical situations  I

have ever seen in Singapore politics. Suddenly  the

great progressive from Farrer Park became the great

supporter  of communal rights. And the  Member  for

Cairnhill,  a man who appeared with me on  a  radio

forum  during the election time, who hoped to  make

political   capital  with  the  Chinese  electorate

because  the  P.A.P. stood firm  on  Malay  as  the

national  language,  and  who  tried  to  needle  a

Chinese  communal  point  home,  found  himself  in

exuberant support of Malay rights and privileges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last few years, the P.A.P. was

plagued  on two occasions by what we term Left-wing

adventurism.  I  now see in this  unprincipled  and

completely shameless switch of political  line  the

beginnings  of  the twists and turns of  Right-wing

political adventurism. A man-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Strong words, but if the Prime

Minister  means  those words to refer  to  an  hon.

Member of the House then, of course, he knows  that

those words are unparliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

extremely careful not to offend you. Had  I  called

them  Right-wing political adventurers - that is what

indeed  was  on the tip of my tongue - I  might  have

offended the rules.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



But  I  am  not  criticising the character  of  the

person.  I  am  saying  in strong  and  categorical

language that that sort of political conduct is, in

political terminology, adventurism. And adventurism

can  be  of  two types - one Left-wing and the  other

Right-wing - and I term this Right-wing  adventurism.

It  is  as simple as that. It is a precise term  of

art,



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Prime Minister used

other  words,  "unprincipled" and so on.  Now,  the

Prime  Minister  of course is the only  person  who

will know whether he wishes those words to apply to

a  specific Member of this House. If he  does  not,

then  he  is  perfectly in order. But if  he  does,

then, of course, he is not in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> If I may quote the famous

last words by a Member of the former Assembly,  "My

conscience is clear."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Then, I do take it that those words

were  not  meant  to refer to any  Member  of  this

House. Please continue, Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker. I

would like to tell the Member for Kampong Kembangan

and his colleagues that what they are doing in this

Chamber is exactly the counterpart of what a  group

of  M.C.A. Right-wing political adventurers did  to

the  Alliance  on the eve of their elections.  Sir,

let  me  read  to our U.M.N.O. friends  across  the

Chamber what his leader had said on communalism and

the  future  of Malaya, from a copy of  the  Sunday

Times  of  July 19th, dateline Alor Star, Saturday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tengku said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...he was sure Malay political parties, such

as  Party  Negara and the P.M.I.P.,  would  support

U.M.N.O. if  it chose to contest the Parliamentary

election without its M.C.A. and M.I.C. partners.

But  U.M.N.O. being the ruling  political  party,

has  realised that in democratic Malaya, it has  to

join   hands  with  non-Malay  political   parties,

particularly the M.C.A. and M.I.C."



<br><br>and he went on to say-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the interpreters are

finding a little difficulty in following.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am obliged, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  for reminding me that while I may be reading,

there are persons who have not the advantage of the

written script.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tengku said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This form of national unity is essential in

order to bring peace, harmony and prosperity to the

people of this country."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tengku continued:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A cosmopolitan country like Malaya cannot afford

to  have a political party which fights on communal

lines."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what the M.C.A. did to the Alliance,

bringing  up  Chinese language issues, banging  the

communal  drum  and, at the same time,  asking  for

seats,  and  cloaking  their political  avarice  in

patriotic,  communal  terms, is  exactly  the  same

technique  which  our friends from U.M.N.O. across

this Chamber have done in the last two days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell them quite frankly and earnestly. If they

want  the  P.A.P. Government to succeed in carrying

the  Chinese  mass  with it, in  its  programme  of

nation  building,  in  which  we  have  made   some

tremendous   political   gestures   for    national

solidarity - such  as  on  questions  of   education,

language  and  culture - then do not  exasperate  the

Chinese mass by constantly harping on a theme  upon

which  the Government has already stated its  stand

in clear and categorical terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me inform the Member for Cairnhill and the

Member  for  Farrer Park, the new converts  to  the

cause  of  Malay  nationalism,  what  we  said   in

November last year. There is one thing very  simple

and  easy about the P.A.P. What we believe  we  set

down  in  clear and precise terms for all to  read.

Unlike  our  opponents on the other  side,  we  are

prepared to put ourselves down in print. I know  of

no  pamphlet, no manifestos issued by  any  of  the

Members  on  the other side, because they  have  no

political  credo.  Let  me  just  run  through  the

statement  we made on our fourth anniversary  which

we  entitled "The new phase after Merdeka. Our task

and policy". And we analysed why there had been  no

merger  of  Singapore and the Federation.  We  said

that  there were two reasons. First, there are  one

million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>



Chinese  in Singapore. Before I read, it,  however,

may  I  say that what I am going to read  has  been

acknowledged by the leader of the U.M.N.O. in  the

Federation  of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman,  as  the

correct reason for there being no merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nobody doubts that if the population of

Singapore  were  one  million  Malays  and  150,000

Chinese,  instead  of being the  other  way  round,

Singapore would have been merged in the Federation,

What  then  is  the problem? It is that  of  nation

building  in a multi-racial society. The difficulty

is  especially acute in Malaya because the  Chinese

are  not  a minority. In the Federation, by itself,

the Malays just outnumber the Chinese. If Singapore

were  included,  the  Chinese would  outnumber  the

Malays. It is because the Indians are a minority in

the  Federation and Singapore that they present  no

difficulties to merger."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, may I read very slowly for the benefit of

Members  of the Opposition what we stated  was  the

fundamental prerequisite to unification of the  two

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It must be demonstrated to three million Malays

in  the Federation that the one million Chinese  in

Singapore  are  ready,  willing  and  able  to   be

absorbed  as one Malayan people, all able to  speak

Malay,  and  willing  to  work  together  for   the

economic betterment and upliftment of the Malays as

equals  of  the other races. Malay fears  that  the

Chinese  would outnumber and overcome them  in  the

economic,  social  and  cultural  fields  of  human

endeavour must be dispelled. The Malays would  want

to be satisfied that their language and culture are

not  relegated to second place. Hence the paramount

importance of settling once and for all what is the

premier  language of Malaya. It is for  us  in  the

mainly  Chinese  Singapore to show that  we  accept

this  and  welcome  any  step  to  make  the  Malay

language  the  national  language  spoken  by  all.

Culture is to a large extent the result of language

and  literature, and the acceptance  of  the  Malay

language  by  all  as  a  national  language  which

everyone learns is an important step forward."



<br><br>Sir, no other Party has stated its stand as clearly

as  the  P.A.P.  I  am not speaking  to  the  Malay

U.M.N.O. leaders opposite, for they do not want  to

be  convinced. I am speaking for the benefit of the

Malays  in  the Federation. The Malays in Singapore

will  see  from  our deeds and will feel  from  our

policies  that  we mean exactly what  we  say.  The

Malays in the Federation will hear of it from their

friends and relatives in Singapore, from the Press,

from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



Radio.  I  hope, if there is nothing else  that  we

have achieved in the course of the next five years,

we  will  at  least have achieved  one  thing - prove

conclusively  in a Chinese-dominated city  that  to

play the Chinese Chauvinist line is not the way  to

power,  that  a  Party which carries  with  it  the

majority of the Chinese can act in a way which fits

into  the context and pattern of a Malayan society,

and not a Chinese society. Unlike the M.C.A. in the

Federation,  we are a Party rooted in the  mass  of

the people; therefore we are in a position not only

to  make  paper concessions but really to translate

into  action what we believe to be fundamentals  in

this  task  of  nation-building. We  can  and  will

translate our ideals into practice. We are not like

the M.C.A. rebels in the Federation, people who are

just  floating  on top. To keep mass support,  they

have  to  beat the big Chauvinist drum. We  do  not

have  to  do  that.  Our support  comes  out  of  a

realisation  on the part of the Chinese  mass  that

this  is  an honest and sincere Party dedicated  to

the  welfare  of  the whole of  the  people,  which

include the Chinese, the Malays and the Indians and

the  rest, the vast majority of whom are  the  poor

and the underprivileged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I dismiss all the foolish things that have

been  said  by the three U.M.N.O. Members  in  this

House,  by saying that it will be our pleasure  and

our  privilege in the course of the next five years

to  make  the three U.M.N.O. Members eat  back  the

foolish  things  they have said on  Malay  communal

issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the pay cuts. I want to tell the civil

service that the issue at stake is not the loss  of

allowances or what they have chosen to term as "the

principle  of  negotiations".  Let  me  tell   them

plainly  and bluntly that the issue is the survival

of the English-educated in their attempt to try and

bridge   this   gap,  the  transition   between   a

privileged   class  society  and   an   egalitarian

society.   The   English-educated  are   singularly

placed,  by  virtue  of the past  history  of  this

territory,  to  play  an  important  role  in  this

transition.  They  can help in  bridging  the  gulf

between  a colonial past and an egalitarian future.

If they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



understand  the  issues, I have not  the  slightest

doubt  that  many  of  them  will  respond  to  the

challenge with which they are faced. Let  me  start

at the beginning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they are bellyaching about is not the

principle of negotiations. The bellyache is the pay

cut.  If  tomorrow unilaterally, we impose  a  wage

increase, I do not believe there is going to  be  a

hue and cry. It is not over imaginery principles of

collective bargaining in trade union practice  that

they  are soured with. It is the very real loss  in

dollars and cents which is going to come at the end

of July. I want to present them with two arguments.

First to appeal to their better nature; and second,

to  those who have no better nature, I present them

with the awful alternative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those in the civil service who have better

natures, let me say quite frankly that we have  not

done  this because we like to do it. Why should  we

like  to  hurt and injure people who must work  for

us?  Part of the democratic system means that there

is  a  civil service which does the bidding of  the

Party  that has the mandate of the people.  I  have

explained this many a time before, but I  think  it

bears repeating. The theory of the democratic State

is   that  there  is  a  good  motor-car  in   good

mechanical  condition, with mechanics, fitters  and

so on to keep it sound. And there is a driver there

to  take the Minister where he wants to go.  It  is

for  the Minister having been elected by the people

to  decide where the driver is to go and how and by

what  route.  It  is  the  business  of  the  civil

service - the  driver, the fitters  and  the  rest - to

keep that car in sound mechanical condition. We  do

not  wish to punish, incapacitate, antagonise those

through whom we must translate our policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the very time when we were fighting for

family  allowances - my colleagues the  Minister  for

Labour  and  Law,  the Minister  for  Finance,  the

Deputy  Speaker - let  me tell  the  Members  of  the

Opposition  we were fully aware of the consequences

if we failed. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>



campaign was, as the Minister for Finance said,  to

break  the  will  of the British civil  service  to

govern and to assert the will of the local man. And

that we did. Not the Member for Farrer Park or  the

Member for Tanglin. We have not taken the fruits of

their  labour.  The  Member  for  Farrer  Park  was

labouring under a delusion that because there  were

lots of stooges in the City Council of which he was

not  one for parliamentary reasons, we are enjoying

the benefits of this self-government. Now, Sir,  if

there  were no people like us to break that system,

the  Member for Farrer Park (I went out  just  now,

Mr Speaker, Sir, to chase up one of the fitters of

the  Government  machine.) I remember  having  read

many  years  ago of how the Member for Farrer  Park

went  on  a  special training course to Britain  to

train  himself to be the mayor. So I asked  one  of

the  Government fitters in the research  department

to  dig up this Press cutting. Well, unfortunately,

they are not as efficient as they ought to be,  but

they  will  be  at  the end of  these  five  years,

believe  you  me.  He has not given  me  the  Press

cutting. He has given me an excerpt and it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Straits Times 3-7-53, A. P. Rajah Progressive

North  making special study in Britain on functions

of Mayor,"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, then there were long debates about the

sartorial outfit of the Mayor. The gown, the - may I

be  forgiven,  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  in  making  this

reference, but I can assure you that I mean to cast

no  aspersion  upon the dignity of  your  sartorial

attire.   I   would  like  to  make   this   point - [Laughter].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. First I think members of the

Strangers' Gallery are getting a bit out  of  hand.

They  seem to be laughing too much. Perhaps, it  is

the Prime Minister who is giving them the lead, But

I  wonder  whether all this reference to the  Mayor

and  his sartorial garb has anything at all  to  do

with  this motion before us; whether there  is  any

relevance in it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Indeed! I would like to show

that   the  Member  for  Farrer  Park  is   a   man

representative of that lost



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>



generation,   that  believes  in  the   forms   and

trappings of democracy, and is completely oblivious

to  the fact that the British democratic system - the

forms  and trappings - undiluted, unamended, is bound

to perish in South-East Asia. All his time is spent

on  the  outward forms and trappings. It  was  even

debated  quite  seriously  whether,  if  the  Mayor

turned out to be female instead of male, she should

wear  trousers  or  wear a skirt. Fortunately,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, when the time came, the man destined

to  be Mayor by his Party was unable to contest the

elections for fear of being routed and the lady who

hoped to get into trousers disappeared quietly from

the  political  scene. The Mayor  whom  the  people

elected decided, for the good health and benefit of

everyone,  to put the robes and the chain  and  the

other  paraphernalia of office in the  place  where

they should be - a museum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell the civil service this. They knew, or

their  leaders knew, what was coming. At  the  time

when  we were fighting for these wage increases  we

did  not fight for the people at the top. We fought

for  the  people  at the bottom.  But  because  the

people  at the top would not come unless the carrot

was  offered,  they were also offered something  at

the  top.  And  may  I say, to the  credit  of  the

Minister for Labour and Law, that throughout  those

tortuous  negotiations for the final implementation

of  Ritson, he resisted the demands from  the  top.

But,   nevertheless,  because   a   principle   was

involved, parity between the local officer and  the

expatriate  officer, we had to  press  on,  knowing

full  well  that the whole thing was unhealthy  and

economically unsound.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to London, the Member for Cairnhill and

I.  The  Member for Cairnhill, may I say, Sir,  is

one  of  the  most  skilful  political  types  that

survived  a pre-Rendel era into this era.  He  knew

full  well  what  the  civil service  wanted.  They

wanted   to   guarantee   allowances,   basic   and

everything.  To  freeze it and  make  it  something

beyond  the  reach  of  an elected  Government.  He

agreed with me that it would be iniquitous to foist

on the people of Singapore allowances which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>



were completely disproportionate to the economy  of

Singapore. That was the reason why the Constitution

came  to  be  written in the way it did.  The  word

"remuneration" in the definition column in  section

1 means:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"in respect of any officer means only the

emoluments of that officer, the whole or  any  part

of which is pensionable."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having seen what happened in the City Council,

certain  members  of the civil  service  wanted  to

build  themselves in. But that did not  take  place

and  he  was a party to it. He knew full well  that

the  proposal was unjust. And now he says "contrary

to  trade practice". The process of rationalisation

of  the pay scales may take years, that is,  if  we

are given that time. Let us say quite honestly that

the  P.A.P. Government is a realistic one. When  we

say  that we are negotiating, we mean it.  We  have

imposed  a rule of thumb with an allowance cut.  We

know  that  in  so  doing, there  will  be  certain

categories    of    professional   and    technical

men - doctors,  architects, technicians,  maybe  even

lawyers - who  will find themselves at a disadvantage

in  respect of their counterparts in the commercial

world,  and therefore adjustments will have  to  be

made to face the facts. Eventually, it may well  be

that  in  certain categories, we may even  have  to

reward  people  more than even the colonial  system

did,  because  we  are going  to  face  up  to  the

economic  facts of life. We are not just  going  to

carry on a legacy of an expatriate past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state - I mean no aspersion on this officer,

but  I  put  it  forward  as  an  instance  of  the

psychological malady of the civil service: a  local

officer  today is staying in a posh local hotel  at

considerable Government subsidy because once upon a

time there was a shortage of housing accommodation.

Europeans  come  and  go on  leave  and  therefore,

pending  being housed in Government quarters,  they

squat in expensive hotels in town and the Singapore

Government  subsidises it. And so it goes  on,  and

local officers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



who, according to the rules and regulations of  the

game, fit the bill also do these things. These  are

things  which should not be and cannot be and  they

will  have  to  stop. But that in my  view  is  not

altogether  their fault. It was because the  system

allowed  such  things to happen.  Once  the  system

allowed  civil  servants to spend  their  time  not

busying  themselves in the tuning up of the  engine

in  the car to make it go better and faster, but in

looking out for spoils, naturally everybody  joined

in  the sport. Everybody wanted to get as much  out

of  the  service as they could, and very  few  were

interested in putting into the service as  much  as

they could give.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there are certain good features about the

civil  service which we want to preserve. First,  I

would  say  that it is relatively a loyal  service,

There  are  the  few  odd ones - the  noisy,  fatuous

types -  whose  folly and stupidity will  ultimately

catch  up  with them. But, by and large,  they  are

loyal to the ideal that the civil service should do

its  best to carry out and implement the policy  of

an elected government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, they are relatively incorrupt. Looking

around  South-East Asia, I think we have reason  to

congratulate ourselves on the manner in  which  the

last elections were carried out, I am told that  in

Thailand,  in the course of an election, bombs  get

thrown into polling booths, I am told that in  some

of  the  islands  to  the  east  of  us,  returning

officers  helped voters to write out the  names  of

the  candidates whom they wanted to  choose.  I  am

told  that  in some other parts they put  into  the

ballot  boxes lots of votes for the candidate  they

wanted to see win before the voting began. I  would

like to pay this tribute to our civil service - apart

from  a  few black sheep with whose activities  the

appropriate Government departments will catch up in

the course of time - they are relatively honest,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have assured them of their future, as indeed

it  is  the business of a Government to ensure  its

cadres of their future. The Communists



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



also  do  that.  They guarantee the  livelihood  of

every worker of the Government - his life, family and

education - as long as the man is alive and  perhaps

even  after  he  is dead. And for that  reason,  we

agreed  to  allow the Constitution to  protect  the

pension rights of our civil service. When they join

the service, it is necessary for them to know that,

if   they   devote   their  whole   life   to   the

administration of the State, at the end of it  they

can  go out to pasture with reasonable comfort. But

I  would  like  to remind them of this,  that  that

guarantee   is   only   worth   anything   if   the

Constitution exists. Where a State is destroyed  in

the  process of revolution, the State that succeeds

does not necessarily honour the obligations of  the

precedent system. We have a vested interest to  see

that this State does not collapse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to those who have a better nature, I say,

"Play  your  part  in the building  up  of  a  more

egalitarian  society." History  has  given  them  a

singularly  important  role.  By  the  process   of

elimination  through  Malayanisation,   they   have

filled up all the key positions of the apparatus of

the State. And it is the business of this State, if

it  is to survive to bridge the inequalities of the

past,  to  bring about the order and justice  of  a

more equal society of the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who are only concerned with their

personal  interest, I say this:  If  we  lose  this

battle, they will also lose. For unless we are able

to  build  through the processes  of  a  democratic

system a more equal and just society, then all  the

pensions  and the pastures in the Constitution  are

gone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are fully aware of what we have inherited. Two

of the Ministers of this Government were members of

the  civil service. We know that we have got a  10-horse power engine to carry a ten-ton load. This is

the   real  dilemma  of  this  Government - that  the

administration has got just as much as the best  in

the  service can put up, and that best, through  no

fault  of  theirs, is unequal to the demands  which

our people have made upon the Government. It is our

business  therefore to try, first,  to  supercharge

the engine by adding the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



talent and skill - both executive and managerial;  by

importing, if necessary, expert technical knowledge

and  know - how. But the long-term objective is  even

more  important, that of building up an  engine  of

more than 10-horse power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service is now open for competition to

all  streams  of education - English, Chinese,  Malay

and  Tamil educated - and we will take from  all  the

streams, the best of them all. There is nothing new

in  this either. We have clearly told them what was

coming, and I remember that in Fullerton Square  in

the  midst of an election campaign I told  them  of

the  future. I said then, and I say now, that  they

must  be  prepared  to compete on  equal  terms.  A

system in which because the white man spoke English

and  therefore he liked best the near white man who

spoke  English, and after that the  local  man  who

spoke  English, cannot be sustained in a  situation

where  the boss has changed. The boss is no  longer

the  Secretary of State for the Colonies. The  boss

collectively   are   the  miserable   hawkers   and

labourers,   teachers,   clerks - the    people    of

Singapore.  And once we are committed to  one  man,

one  vote, regardless of colour, creed, wealth  and

knowledge, then we are committed to a more just and

equal society. I say to the civil service and their

present  rather inept leaders who have  begun  what

they believe to be a revolutionary movement against

the   Government,   that  if  nothing   else   more

catastrophic  happens  to them  than  the  loss  of

allowances  in  the  top  brackets  of  the   civil

service,  and  the  fact that  they  have  to  face

fiercer  competition from the non-English  educated

members of the service, then they should go down on

their  bended knees and thank the gods  that  their

souls have been spared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to the third theme - democracy as

expounded by the Member for Farrer Park. I want  to

preface my remarks with this reminder of the  past,

that the English educated, because their avenue  of

information has been confined to the English Press,

have been unable to face up to the real issues that

the  country is faced with. The English  Press  has

played a diabolical role



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



in  the last few years. They believe that the march

of  time  can  be stopped by scaring  the  English-educated. Nobody really seriously believed that  my

Ministers and I were a gang of lunatics.  In  fact,

after  we won, they took scrupulous pains  to  list

all  the  virtues that we possess, and  which  they

already   knew   a   long  time   ago.   But   they

systematically  distorted  and  misrepresented  the

issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only people who are prepared to face the

facts  are  the  people in the  leadership  of  the

P.A.P.  We  pursued  our line not  for  reasons  of

political  opportunism but because we  believed  it

was  the only way, the only sensible and sane  way,

to prevent all that was good in the past from being

destroyed by all that was bad in the past. I  would

like  to  say that this is a government  with  long

memories.   We   do  not  pursue   petty   personal

vendettas, but what we say as a matter of policy we

stand by.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first task, so far as the English-educated

are  concerned, is to pose the issues  to  them  so

that  they  will  see the stark realities  of  this

situation.  And  I say to the civil  servants  that

what  is at stake is not just their pay allowances,

the   principle   of  collective   bargaining   and

negotiation, or their pensions but what is at stake

is  the  survival of the democratic State. And  the

problem  arises  in this way. As a  result  of  the

aberrations of past colonial governments, masses of

people  were allowed to come into this  country  to

help  provide cheap labour, to exploit the national

resources.   All   the   immigrants   fended    for

themselves,  and it is a credit to them  that  they

did  it  so  wonderfully. They provided  their  own

schools.   They  provided  their  own  systems   of

education  and upbringing. And they provided  their

offspring  with  a complete set of cultural  values

which  they  thought proper. And the misfortune  we

are  faced with now is that there are broadly  four

large linguistic and cultural groups with different

sets of values. If it was a question of one man one

vote in the early days where only the English



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



educated  voted, this problem would not arise.  The

problem arises in an acute form when all the  other

language-groups  vote.  As  far   as   Malaya   and

Singapore are concerned, the bulk of the population

are  either Chinese or Malay educated, and the bulk

of  the  present leadership of both the  Federation

and Singapore are English educated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I assure the Member for Farrer Park, two

Ministers of the Government side studied  and  took

examinations in Constitutional Law and Practice the

Rule  of  Law,  and both passed their examinations.

Six  of  the  nine Ministers spent  part  of  their

education   in  colleges  abroad,  and  are   quite

familiar   and  conversant  with  the   rules   and

principles, and the trappings and the forms of  the

democratic  system.  But  all  the  Ministers   and

Assemblymen.  English-educated,  Chinese  educated,

Malay  educated,  Tamil  educated,  understand  one

fundamental  rule, and that is, if a thing  is  not

made  suitable  for  the  people,  that  thing   is

useless. And I put the issue as simply and  plainly

as  this: that the mass of the Chinese educated and

the  Malay educated and the Tamil educated and even

the  English  educated in this country  have  never

read  Dicey  on  the  Rule  of  Law,  or  Wade  and

Phillips,  and have never heard about  Hansard.  If

they  decide that the democratic system which  they

hear has come into being after independence in  the

Federation   and   internal   self-government    in

Singapore,  does not make any difference  to  their

lives,  if  it  only perpetuates the  follies,  the

stupidities,  the inequalities, and the  injustices

of  the  past,  then at the end of five  years,  or

maybe ten years, we have only ourselves to blame if

they decide that this system is unsuitable. And  if

we  try  to  pay  attention to  forms  and  not  to

substance, then surely we will fail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reduce to its barest essentials what we on

this side of the House believe to be the democratic

system.  It  means a system where each man  has  as

much a right to live in this world as the next man,

and where



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



it  is  possible for the majority of the people  to

bring  about  changes in the social  order  without

resort  to force. Translated into political  terms,

it  means giving one man one vote, and allowing him

to  decide  who should govern, and how they  should

govern  for a specified number of years.  It  means

the  right  at the end of that specified number  of

years again to pass judgment on that government and

on  others  who  may  present  themselves  for  the

mandate of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell the Member for Farrer Park that there

is  nothing  which  this Government  does  that  is

undemocratic if it is within the framework of  this

Constitution,  and that is, on the hypothesis  that

this  Constitution is democratic; and  I  have  not

heard any of the Members on the other side say that

this Constitution is not democratic, let alone  the

old  Progressive  Party loyalist,  the  Member  for

Farrer  Park, But despite all the democratic  forms

and   procedures   and  the   spirit   which   this

Constitution   tries  to  provide  for   democracy,

fundamentally  it is not a democratic Constitution:

because  there  is an over-riding  provision  which

gives  the  British raj the right to revoke  it.  I

have  not heard the Member for Farrer Park complain

against  this.  At the bottom of his  heart  he  is

thinking that if anything goes wrong, well, what to

do.  He will be rescued by the British raj.  He  is

not  complaining about this. That is the reason why

I  say  this: in his preoccupation with forms,  the

outward  manifestations, the robes and  regalia  of

democracy, the rules and by-laws, he has  forgotten

the  fundamentals, and that is,  the  will  of  the

people  of the majority shall prevail, on how  they

should  be  governed and by whom. And  at  periodic

intervals  they  will  re-assert  their  right   to

decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell the Members opposite quite frankly that if

you  try  to  run the undiluted, the British-styled

democratic  system  in  the context  of  South-East

Asia, you will collapse. It is not possible. I have

not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



heard the Member for Farrer Park nor the Member for

Cairnhill  say  that  the  Preservation  of  Public

Security  Ordinance is undemocratic.  According  to

the   book   of   rules   of   the   British   type

Constitutions, it is undemocratic. But if  you  pay

just lip-service to little by-rules, the frills  of

a  democratic  state, then you have  no  chance  of

survival.  You  must try to translate  into  actual

reality the basic objectives of a democratic system

within the conditions which exist in Singapore,  in

Malaya, in the milieu of South-East Asia in revolt.

In  the whole history of South-East Asia, there has

never  been an epoch where there is so much ferment

and  turmoil as has taken place since 1945-a  whole

system of society crushed and crumpled up. Many  of

our  neighbours have yet to find the final form  in

which  they will be governed. Let me read this  for

the  benefit of the Member for Farrer  Park.  I  am

reading now from a very sober Sunday newspaper, The

Observer  of  London, from their  correspondent  in

South-East Asia; 14th June, 1959, page 9, where  it

says:



<br><br><div align="center">"The Lights Are All Going Out All Over Asia</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who believe that political salvation

lies   only  in  political  democracy  as   it   is

understood in the West, the lights of Asia are  one

by  one waning and going out. Military leaders have

taken  effective power off the hands of politicians

in  Pakistan, Thailand and Burma. Indonesia  is  on

the  brink of a constitutional revolution  designed

to  give  President Soekarno and the Army the  real

control   of   national  affairs.   In   Laos   the

Conservative  Prime  Minister  now  enjoys  special

powers  which  reduce Parliament to a  cypher.  The

general elections which are due to be held in three

different  countries of South-East Asia  this  year

have been postponed."



<br><br>Let me read out another passage:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the war nationalist movements gain

momentum  and  the  Asian  countries  won  or  were

granted their independence, but the humiliation did

not   end   there,  Their  new,  often  jerry-built

imitations  of Western democratic systems  were  in

too   many   cases   exploited   by   opportunistic

politicians, wrecked by bureaucratic boneheads  and

plundered by the pocket-lines. Economies  ran  down

the  hill,  corruption  and  inefficiency  poisoned

national administrations, and the result is chaos."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



I  say  without any hesitation that if we  have  to

make  variations and adaptations to the  forms  and

trappings and the frills of a democratic system, we

shall  do  so, because the business of a government

is  to  govern and we have the mandate  to  govern.

What  is more, we had the courage to put down  what

we  intended to do and had a clear mandate  on  it,

unlike Members on the opposite side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we preoccupy ourselves with forms and

procedures  then  we shall all be wasting  a  great

deal  of time in the next five years, because  some

of  the forms and procedures which may have  to  be

followed  may  not be in accordance with  the  best

traditions of Westminster or the British Government

at  Whitehall. But I give you this assurance.  That

this  is a Government which is fully aware  of  the

essentials of a democratic state, which it believes

are  worth  preserving, and at  the  same  time  is

sufficiently knowledgeable of the realities of  the

situation  to try and make the system work  in  the

context  of  South-East  Asia.  I  would  tell  the

Members opposite this - more important than the  dead

letters of a Constitution are the actors who  bring

it  to life, If you have Mr Mak Pak Shee trying to

play Hamlet, or worse, Chew Swee Kee trying to play

Shylock, then even Shakespeare becomes a farce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, your system is as good as the best men

who  operate it. And let us never forget that.  For

over  thirty years, the only political  Party  that

constantly organised to get the best actors on  its

side  was  the Communist Party of Malaya. And  they

recruited and trained them. The nationalist Parties

did  not emerge until 1945. If you want to play the

democratic  drama, then you must have the  dramatis

personae  to  make  it worthy of listening  by  the

people  to  whom  you are presenting  it.  That  is

really the crux of the problem. I say, without  the

slightest  immodesty on the part of  my  colleagues

and myself, that we are the only group that has the

coherence,  drive and the convictions to  build  up

something more than ourselves



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>



-a   democratic,   socialist  movement   within   a

revolutionary situation. The issue is as simple  as

this.  If we do not continue recruiting as we  have

done   in  the  past  five  years,  then  we  shall

eventually wither and die, It is only if we recruit

and  we grow in strength within the next five years

that  we can face the world at the end of it,  with

the  aplomb  and assurance as befits a Party  which

has  dedicated itself to the interests of the  mass

of  its  people.  And you can only recruit  if  you

convince those whom you intend to recruit that  you

are recruiting for a worthwhile cause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me draw one lesson for the Members on the

other  side.  There is not one single  Member - apart

from  the  U.M.N.O. Members who are representing  a

portion  of  the  Malay  people - who  represent  the

people. They represent a group which is spent, lost

and  exhausted.  Why  have  they  got  no  Chinese-educated  with  them? Because they  are  unable  in

their  preoccupation with mayoral robes, rules  and

procedures,  to  bring home the  message  that  the

democratic system can work in the interest  of  the

majority of the people, if there are men and  women

of  integrity, honesty, drive and purpose  to  make

the system work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell the Member for Tanglin this - that going to

Sunday school once a week to preach is no good.  Go

down  and work for the people every day of the week

if you want to bring home to them the fact that the

elected  representatives are  worth  electing,  and

that  the  system that elected representatives  are

working is worth the keeping.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the power of the State which we now control is

used  not to enrich the lives of many of its people

but  to  line  the pockets of a few of  the  ruling

hierarchy, then verily we shall all perish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say that

the  P.A.P.  Government had put its  cards  on  the

table  before  it assumed office. We  did  it  over

three  months  of  campaigning beginning  from  the

famous  day  of 15th February at Hong Lim.  It  was

there the Deputy Prime Minister said things and set

off  a chain reaction which finally ended with  the

routing of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



rogues  and  scallywags that  used  to  haunt  this

Chamber.  We  have  placed before  the  people  the

mandate that we sought of them. We did not  try  to

deceive anyone. We know exactly what is expected of

us  because we have made these promises. Unlike the

previous   Government,  we  gave  no  hostages   to

fortune.  Plainly  and simply, we  took  the  stand

which we knew was necessary and in the interest  of

the  survival  of  the democratic state  in  order,

first,  to cleanse the system of the evils  of  the

past,  and to retrieve some of the liberalism,  the

tolerance  which  were the good  things  we  should

carry into the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell the Opposition this. They provide us, and

I hope they will continue to provide us in the next

five  years,  with that vivid contrast  which  will

throw   up   the   virtues  of  the   P.A.P. into

magnificence. But if we fail, let me tell them that

this is not a constitutional position of Tweedledum

and   Tweedledee,  Democrats  and  Republicans   in

America,  or  Tories and Labour in Britain.  If  we

fail, and we are unable to make the system work, it

is  not they who are going to come back. They  will

be fleeing for their lives, because behind us there

is  no other alternative which is prepared to  work

the  democratic system. And therefore, in the  last

analysis, if we fail then brute force returns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure no one in this House nor any one in the

country would want this to happen. And therefore, I

say  to all those who wish us ill, that if we fail,

woe  betide them. But to those who wish us well,  I

give  this message. This is a Government consisting

of people who put their ideas, their ideals and the

welfare of their people above themselves, This is a

Party  which  has  the courage of its  convictions,

which is prepared to pursue what it believes to  be

right   in  the  interest  of  the  people  without

deviating for opportunist reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be an era which will light up the dark

pages of the history of Singapore, post 1945. If we

succeed, as we intend to, in building a climate not

only  of national solidarity but a climate in which

the   ordinary   people  begin  to   believe   that

institutions of Government in the country  are  run

by people who are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>



loved and revered because they are working for  the

mass  of  the  people, then we  will  have  done  a

service, not only to ourselves, our Party  and  our

movement,  but we will also have done a service  to

the democratic socialist movement. Until the advent

of  the  P.A.P. no group proclaiming the democratic

socialist  cause ever struck roots in the  mass  of

the people. Let me say, Mr Speaker, Sir, judge  us

not  in the next five years by the standards of the

British House of Commons and the British Government

in  Whitehall. Judge our performance in the context

of   our  objectives  and  the  realities  of   our

situation,  and at the end of five years  you  will

certainly not find us wanting in courage, in skill,

and in sincerity.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Toh, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes. Mr Speaker, we began

this  debate by quoting the conclusion to the  Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara's speech. Let me  now  end  this

debate  by quoting the introduction to his  speech.

We    reiterate   that,   through   peaceful    and

constitutional  means,  we  will  take  the  social

revolution  a  step further. We  are  a  Government

pledged to bring about a more just society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if it consoles the Opposition, I will

say that we, the P.A.P., do not believe in throwing

stones  at those who have already fallen  into  the

well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the following Address in reply to the

speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara be agreed

to:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Legislative Assembly of the State of

Singapore,  express our thanks  to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara for the speech which he  delivered
