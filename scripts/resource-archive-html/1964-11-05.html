<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the words proposed to be left

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As agreed by the House, the debate on the

motion and on the amendment will be proceeded with

simultaneously. The Member for Jurong had the Floor just before

the Assembly rose last night. Mr Chia Thye Poh.



<br><br>2.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we see that

the present situation is serious enough. We also see that a lot of money

earned by the sweat and blood of the people has been used to buy foreign

arms,and to bring into this country foreign soldiers, rockets and

other things to preserve Malaysia and to continue with the

suppression of the people and their just struggle. Thus, under

these circumstances, this territory will become an arena for

Anglo-American imperialists and colonialists for their trial of

strength. The purchasing of foreign armaments can only give

wealth and benefit to foreign manufacturers of arms and can only

bring misery and suffering to the people in this territory. Not

only are the people faced with economic bankruptcy, they are

also facing the calamity of disruption and breaking-up of their

families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North Bornean uprising is the struggle of the people to

free themselves, but the British have been brought there to

continue to suppress the people, thus expanding the war. After

observing the situation in North Borneo, certain British

military officers say that the war there will continue for quite

a long time, perhaps eight or 10 years, maybe longer. It will be

a protracted war. Even the British themselves are not sure of

the duration of the war, and are not sure of the outcome of

their armed suppression of the people there. So, resorting to

arms and war cannot solve the problem at all. Not only that, it

will bring



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



more suffering and hardships to the people, will cause a

squandering of Government funds, and will incur more and more

hatred from the people. Under these circumstances, there are

only two courses open to the political Parties. One is to solve

the question of Malaysia politically. In other words, return to

the people their basic rights; to disband Malaysia and to allow

the people to decide for themselves their destiny. The other

course is to continue with dictatorial and adventurous action

and to gamble with the lives of our youths and to make cannon

fodder of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Alliance Government have chosen the second course.

They would not like to rectify the error they have made. At the

same time, they think that they can bamboozle the people by

covering up their present embarrassment. They have put up

slogans such as "Defend the Country" and the rest of it in order

to divert the people's attention. We have now seen the

psychological warfare and many other campaigns waged by the

Government. This psychological warfare has been conducted in

many fields, such as patriotic conferences, confrontation

exhibitions, forums and the rest of it. But no matter how and in

whatever way the Government carry out this campaign, the purpose

of it all is to distort the truth and confuse the people by

catch phrases and slogans in order to extend the war to preserve

their consolidated interests. True patriots have been branded as

pro-Indonesia and traitors. At a recent exhibition put up in

Singapore, even Inche Boestaman was branded as a traitor to this

territory. Boestaman was arrested because of his past struggle

against the British colonialists. His arrest only proves the

pro-colonial inclination of the Party in power. But we can also

understand the hue and cry made by the Government. They will put

out more catch slogans and phrases. They will continue with

their present line of action and repeat cant phrases in order to

maintain their own position. The real anti-national traitors in

the Party in power will continue to resort to old tactics and

intrigues. We have sufficient facts to see through them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China has also been accused by Chiang Kai-shek as a Soviet

stooge. Other countries have been branded by these Rightists as

Communist stooges. No matter how the Party in power wage

psychological warfare, the people are still clear in their

hearts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Borneo there are about 2,000 youths who have escaped

into Brunei. Why should they do so? Because they do not want to

be conscripted into the army to fight other people's cause. The

Chief Minister of Sarawak also said that about 20,000 youths in

Sarawak had disappeared. They did not want to join national

service. This is a most regrettable matter to him. Even in

Malaya and Singapore there are also thousands of youths who do

not want to be enlisted and become cannon fodder. According to

the Government of Singapore, there are about 50,000 youths in

Singapore who are eligible for national service. But, in fact,

the actual figure given by them is 70,000. Many Singapore youths

do not want to enlist. The Deputy Prime Minister said yesterday

that the number was 50,000. So it was 20,000 less than the

official figure of 70,000. What is the actual position? We do

not know. Only the Party in power know the actual facts. From

this difference in the figures quoted, we can know that the

Government are playing with figures. No matter how they do it,

the youths of Singapore still do not want to enlist as and

become soldiers and cannon fodder. If the Party in power

describe this unwillingness on the part of Singapore's youths as

being anti-national and traitorous, then I say that there are

thousands more of these youths in Singapore, including some

members of the P.A.P. in the lower stratum, who refuse to listen

to the cries of the P.A.P. leadership to join the national

service. They do not want to take part in any military training

in spite of intimidation and propaganda. So if they call us

anti-national, then there are some members who are not only

anti-national but also anti their own Party. This shows that the

P.A.P. itself is not even in a position to bluff its own

members, to say nothing of the people at large.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The refusal of the people to take part in national service

is gathering momentum. Appreciating this difficult situation and

losing confidence in Malaysia itself, the Prime Minister keeps

on saying that we should have confidence in Malaysia. His

repeated statements about having confidence in Malaysia show

that he himself lacks confidence. That is why he wants to use

words to restore the confidence of the people in Malaysia. In

fact, he went to London to get help to solve his present

embarrassment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunistic P.A.P. leadership has no guts to go

against the unreasonable policies of the Alliance Government. So

it has no alternative but to follow the policies of the

Alliance, much against its will. We know that the present

situation of the P.A.P. leadership is rather tragic and

regrettable. Who knows that one day the Prime Minister of

Singapore may be degraded to the position of Chief Steward of

Singapore? If the leadership still continues to play with

politics, then one day it will find itself in a very difficult

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, no matter how much the P.A.P. smear us, our

loyalty to the people at large will be appreciated by the people

themselves. Our determination to go against Malaysia and

conscription is unshakable. We believe that only the people

themselves can solve their own problems. They cannot be solved

by British soldiers. The people of Singapore have already made

their contribution by way of opposing Malaysia. Our leaders have

gone to gaol because of their opposition to Malaysia.

Internationally there are countries which are against Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> On a point of

order. Under the amended Standing Orders, the Member is allowed

a maximum of one hour to deliver his speech. Yesterday he had

the Floor for at least 45 minutes. I think by now he has

exceeded the time limit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have got a brief on my table which says

that the Member for Jurong was on his feet yesterday for 21

minutes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

If you say that Afro-Asian countries are for the struggle

against Malaysia, then it shows that our stand against Malaysia

is correct. If the ruling Party says that it is because we are

against Malaysia that others also follow us, then it means that

we are very strong to be able to influence others to accept our

stand against Malaysia. In fact, there are some 50 countries in

Afro-Asia which are against Malaysia. So the Party in power is

less influential than we are. In spite of the tours of the Prime

Minister to Africa and other countries, he has not been able to

enlist support for Malaysia from the Afro-Asian nations. What we

want to remind the Party in power is that we never expect any

foreign power to replace our own power and strength against

Malaysia. So long as Malaysia remains in existence and so long

as military expansion is the policy of the Government, we shall

continue to go against Malaysia and conscription. We shall not

change our stand unless they change their policies. And the

people will suffer as long as their policies are not changed.

One day when the Prime Minister himself meets with difficulties,

then he will realise and admit that our stand against Malaysia

is correct and that our stand against conscription is proper and

correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, that is all I wish to say.



<br><br>2.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, in speaking on the motion and

the amendment to the motion, I wish to deal with the problem in

a way which may be of interest to the business community in

Singapore, particularly to the Chinese business community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original motion as proposed by the Barisan Sosialis is

intended to weaken the resolve of our citizens to stand up to

the undeclared war waged by Indonesia against us, which is

called confrontation. There has been an unending series of

incursions across the Sabah and Sarawak borders by Indonesian



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



armed forces. In recent months Indonesian commandos and

paratroopers have landed on the Malaysian mainland itself. Here

it is not a case of the Malaysian Government and we waging war

against the Indonesians. Quite the reverse. Indonesian armed

forces consider themselves entitled at will to invade our

territory. In the face of this military threat, the Barisan

Sosialis believe that the best solution is to disarm ourselves.

No doubt the Barisan Sosialis will welcome the occupation of

Singapore and other Malaysian territories by the Indonesian

army. But I believe that the overwhelming majority of our

citizens have not the slightest desire for the country to be

occupied by the Indonesian army.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put it in these basic terms, it is obvious where the choice

lies. But in the present political and economic situation in

Singapore, there may be members of the business community,

especially the Chinese business community, whose businesses have

been hit by confrontation and who may try to get a quick and

easy solution. They are asking themselves: is there a short-cut

whereby we can make peace with Indonesia and resume our formerly

prosperous business?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I have been privileged to be present at the two

Ministerial discussions in Bangkok and at the summit conference

in Tokyo. I can therefore speak with some authority derived from

personal contact and negotiations with the Indonesian leaders. I

am in a better position than most Members of this Assembly to

assess their intentions and, on the basis of this assessment, to

say what the prospects are of an early and easy settlement with

Indonesia. I have to say that there is none whatsoever, and that

we must be prepared to live with confrontation for a very long

time. Of course, we can settle on Indonesian terms, which simply

means that we will divest ourselves of the means to stand up to

military pressure which they may apply on any occasion in the

future. A condition of the demand that we disarm ourselves is

the early and complete removal of the British military presence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless we are prepared to give a timetable for the withdrawal of

British military forces from Malaysia, a timetable acceptable to

the Indonesian political and army leaders, there can be no

peaceful settlement of this conflict between us. That was the

position as I found it at the first Bangkok meeting. That was

also the position when the summit talks collapsed in Tokyo last

June.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the question that the business community, especially the

Chinese business community, must face is this:

do they want an early solution which will bring about an

inevitable occupation of our country by Indonesian troops? Or

are they prepared to stand up and fight? If there is any other

way whereby we can achieve a peaceful settlement without risking

Indonesian military occupation, I can assure this Assembly that

we will try our best to get it. But in the nature of things it

is just not on the cards, and we are therefore faced with the

prospect of a long struggle. And here it is important that the

Chinese business community make their calculations correctly.

They would be extremely foolish to fall for the bait of early

resumption of business when that bait contains the seeds of

their own destruction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese business community in Indonesia, some 15 or

more years ago, made a fatal and tragic error and they are now

paying very dearly for it. Historians who have studied the

fortunes of the Indonesian Communist Party were amazed at the

support which a substantial part of the Chinese business

community in Java extended to the P.K.I. in its early formative

stage in the post-war years when the P.K.I. was operating for

the first time in its history as a legal political organisation.

Why the Chinese business community acted in this manner is still

a mystery. Perhaps they were resentful over some nagging petty

regulations or restrictions which the national Government

imposed on them and, therefore, they decided to lend support to

some opposition Party. Perhaps they thought that by giving money

to the P.K.I., they could have a measure of control over their

policy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>



Whatever the reasons were, the course of events took a turn

completely different from what they themselves had expected or

hoped for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Indonesian economy deteriorated with increasing

rapidity, the influence of the moderate Indonesian leadership

declined, as I shall explain later. In their place hot-heads and

ultra-nationalists emerged. When this happened, naturally a

scapegoat must be found for the economic morass into which the

country had floundered. The scapegoat then was the Chinese

population in general and Chinese businessmen in particular. In

large parts of Java, Chinese shops were closed down and the

Chinese population physically driven out at the point of the

bayonet. In many other places, their property was confiscated.

And even when they were allowed to do business, it was on very

restrictive and often humiliating terms. These facts are well

known to our Chinese business community especially those who

have business ties with the Chinese in Indonesia. Needless to

say, if we are to be completely defenceless, as the Barisan

Sosialis want us to be, then the occupation of our country by

Indonesian troops will automatically take place and our Chinese

businessmen cannot expect a treatment better than that which

their compatriots received in Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early days of the P.K.I., on several occasions they

came close to political extinction, principally because of

pursuing anti-national political activities. But on each

occasion the Chinese businessmen financed and even supported

them organisationally so as to enable them to make a quick re

covery. Mr Speaker, if you think it incredible that Chinese

businessmen in Indonesia could support a Communist movement in

that country, let me remind you of a certain elderly Chinese

gentleman in Singapore who was openly in cahoots with our

Communist comrades here. When he found to his chagrin that this

got him nowhere, he did a startling somersault and he is now

hobnobbing with certain interesting people on the ultra Right.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To return to the situation in Indonesia. Before the

assumption of total power by President Soekarno in 1958, we saw

a series of Indonesian Governments headed by people such as Dr

Hatta, Mr Soetan Sjahrir, Dr Djuanda and others. These are the

ablest and most rational leaders which Indonesia has produced,

and they bent all their energies to reviving the economy of

Indonesia in order to raise the livelihood of the masses and the

peasantry, to make business run more efficiently, to increase

production in the estates and in the tin mines, the oilfields,

and indeed in all sectors of the economy. They resolutely

opposed political adventures such as the West Irian campaign.

They concentrated all their energies on economic reconstruction.

Unfortunately for them, their efforts came to nought. The

principal reason for this is that the Communist Party of

Indonesia, through its affiliated trade unions and peasant or

ganisations, were able to frustrate each and every attempt at

economic improvement. Strikes paralysed the ports, factories,

estates, oilfields and other economic enterprises as and when

the Communist leaders called for them. So when the rational

economic solution attempted by Hatta, Soetan Sjahrir and others

failed, the only course of action open to the Indonesian leaders

was to play the line of hysterical ultra nationalism. In parti

cular the leaders had to create external enemies whose imagined

threat to the Indonesian revolution provided a rallying point.

In this way they forestalled the time when the Republic of

Indonesia would disintegrate. First, there was the West Irian

campaign. When this was wound up successfully - and we in

Malaysia, Mr Speaker, Sir, helped them in this venture - then a

fresh external enemy had to be discovered. Unfortunately for us,

this time the enemy they chose is us. The present Indonesian Gov

ernment cannot make honourable peace with Malaysia because then

President Soekarno and other Indonesian leaders would have to

explain to the people why they are so desperately poor, and he

would have no external adventure to divert his people's

attention from their present abject poverty. So these are the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>



basic revolutionary forces that are propelling the Indonesian

leaders in the present situation. Even if President Soekarno

were to die, or if he were to be deposed today, I do not believe

that the new setup that will emerge will be one with which we

can come to terms on an honourable basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some businessmen who wonder whether or not

Singapore would not have been better off if she had not joined

Malaysia. Businessmen who so believe this are calculating on the

basis that in an independent Singapore the British military

forces will remain for an indefinite period so as to prevent any

possible take-over of the Government by the pro-Communist

open-front organisations in the first place, and the Malayan

Communist Party soon after that. Now this assumption of theirs

about an independent Singapore is completely false. In the

present world situation, with the emergence into independence of

nearly the whole area of Asia and Africa, it would not be

possible for the British to maintain their military

establishments in Singapore if the elected independent

Government of Singapore asked them to leave. This has happened

in Ceylon, where the British once maintained a naval base in

Trincomalee. So the alternative scheme to Singapore's entry into

Malaysia which flight have avoided Indonesian economic

confrontation depended for its survival and economic prosperity

on the completely false assumption that British military power

can remain to prevent the Communist take-over. But they cannot

remain. What will happen if the Communists take over the

government in Singapore, whether by fair means or foul? There

will be a conflict between a Singapore and a Malayan Government.

Such a conflict may start, first, by an economic blockade of the

island with consequences more disastrous than Indonesian

economic confrontation. This conflict will eventually escalate

into war between the two territories. And let us not delude

ourselves into believing that that cannot happen here. It has

happened in other countries. Think of Korea, Vietnam, Laos, and

Cyprus. And it could, and in my calculation probably would, take

place if Singapore had gone



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



it alone. So we had no alternative but to press ahead with

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troubles that we are facing are not of our own making,

but are clearly the result of the decision of the Indonesian

Government to interfere in our domestic affairs with the object

of absorbing us. In this situation, we have one of two choices.

First, to surrender, if not immediately, then through a

so-called negotiated peace which would leave us defenceless against

military occupation any time President Soekarno decides to carry

it out. The second choice is to stand up and fight. It is only

traitors in this country like the antinational, pro-Communist,

pro-Indonesia, bankrupt political forces in the Barisan Sosialis

which favour surrender to Indonesia. The Barisan Sosialis

leaders, of course, hope that if they were to assist Indonesia

in successfully subverting the country, they would be rewarded

with high office under Indonesian military occupation, positions

which they were unable to win in democratic elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me stress the gravity of the issue we

are debating. We are not here like little children playing

marbles in the backyard, or building sand-castles on the

beaches; nor are we debating stand-pipes, schools or community

centres. The issue before us is one of survival, of life and

death, of resisting enslavement by a larger country with

reckless leaders and a big army. The levers and instruments here

are not nice speeches or delicate diplomatic manoeuvres, nor

even more unpleasantly petty political intrigues and

conspiracies. The levers here are those of naked power, power

which, as a great revolutionary puts it, comes out of the barrel

of the gun. Whether we like it or not, we live in a

revolutionary epoch and right in the heart of the seething

revolutionary arena of South-East Asia. It may be a good thing

for me to remind hon. Members of what that same great

revolutionary said of revolutions. He said, "A revolution is not

an invitation to a banquet. It is not essay writing, embroidery,

poetry or other nice and elegant things. It is the effective and

organised use of violence."

come from the mouth of politicians who are Members of this House

and if they are designed to weaken the spirit and determination

of the people, then they must be deprecated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are shocked to see the motion moved by the Barisan

Sosialis, because at a time when Malaysia is facing con

frontation from the enemy followed by incursions and aggression

from the air, sea and on land, the Members of the Barisan

Sosialis who claim themselves to be genuine patriots and who are

lauded by their foreign masters are prepared to move a motion of

a nature which will bring disgrace and dishonour to our nation.

If hon. Members of the Barisan Sosialis will read between the

lines of their motion and feel that there is no truth in it,

they can withdraw it. We do not indulge in lies as the Barisan

Sosialis are fond of doing in this House.

Therefore, I had to rebut his accusation.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I did not hear it. But if my attention had been

<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I withdraw the statement I

made just now. If we read carefully the motion in the names of

the Member for Jurong and the Member for Paya Lebar, we can

arrive at this conclusion, that it is a continuous link-up with

those who call themselves "fighters of the national



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



Kalimantan Utara" led by Sheik Azahan and with the Voice from

Jakarta. The object of this motion is purely to weaken the

spirit of our people in order that our people, who have been

known for their fighting qualities, can become cowards. Should

this be the attitude of warriors of a nation which the Barisan

Sosialis claim to be proud of?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a saying, "Do not beat a hornless

bull because if you do so and he cannot attack you with his

horns, he will find other means of attacking you." Similarly if

our small Malaysia which loves peace is provoked by aggression,

we are prepared to lay down our lives in its defence. How shall

we show our integrity and honour in the face of this crisis at a

time when our country is being attacked? We read from the

newspapers that our youths are rallying to the call to defend

their country. Thousands of them have come forward to register

for military service and they have patriotically pledged to

defend their country. They would rather be dead than just merely

he alive. This is the pledge of true Malaysian patriots who love

their fatherland. Even women have stated publicly in the

newspapers that they want the Government to arm them for

military service. They have called upon the youths of this

country to defend our integrity and sovereignty. If any youth is

not prepared to defend the country, then he should strip himself

naked. The object of this motion is to weaken the determination

of our youths. If our youths are not prepared to defend the

country and they do not consider themselves to be warriors of

the fatherland, then we cannot say that they belong either to

the male or female sex.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is now clear that those who call themselves

patriots and who are lauded by the so-called freedom fighters

abroad are, in fact, the agents, henchmen and puppets of the new

neocolonialism. Their argument is that Malaysia was forced upon

the people of Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak. This is nothing new.

The concept of Malaysia has been mooted long ago. We held a

referendum to determine this issue. Malaysia was established

before the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



general elections were held in Singapore and

Malaysia. In the general elections after Malaysia, the Parties

against Malaysia were rejected by the people, if Malaysia was

rejected by the people, then naturally the Parties who were

against Malaysia would be in power today. But we know that the

pro-Malaysia Parties received a clear mandate from the people.

Was Malaysia then forced upon the people? I am surprised to see

Members of the Barisan Sosialis with droopy eyes in the day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we heard Opposition Members use the word

"war", which, of course, has been brought about by the

neo-colonialist power. Malaysia has never embarked upon any

aggression. Even the Philippines which is claiming Sabah has not

made any incursions into Malaysian soil. It is not Malaysia

which is the aggressor. It is Malaysia that has been attacked by

the Indonesians and a few traitors, as witnessed the landings in

Labis and Malacca. If it is true that confrontation by our enemy

is to protect or safeguard Malaysia, as alleged by the Member

for Paya Lebar, I am very surprised why Indonesia is still

reluctant to free Timor Island - an island which is not far from

Indonesia - which is still being colonised by Portugal, and why

the right of self-determination has not been implemented in West

Irian. Why is this so if Indonesia is struggling for the right

of self-determination of other countries? Why did Indonesia not

say a word before Malaya achieved independence and before

Singapore merged with Malaya at a time when Indonesia had

friendly relations with Malaya? When Malaya realised its

independence in 1957, surely Indonesia realised that British

forces were still stationed in Malaya. Why was there no

confrontation then? Why do they now claim that they want to

liberate Malaysia from neo-colonialism?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to refer to something which took

place 12 years ago. An Indonesian, Professor Mohamed Yamin, who

was then the Minister for Education and Culture, was interviewed

by an American journalist who asked him, "Is Indonesia claiming

West



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



Irian from the point of view of history?" Professor Yamin

answered, "No, we do not claim West Irian from the historical

point of view. But we are claiming it from the point of view of

Dutch colonialism. This includes Kalimantan Utara, Malaya and

others." This was the basic intention of the Indonesian people.

They wanted to absorb Malaya into Indonesia. This has been the

basic struggle of the Indonesian leaders since 1945. They wanted

to establish an independent Malaya within the framework of

Indonesia Raya which was subsequently changed to Melayu Raya.

This is nothing new to old freedom-fighters because this happened

only some 11 or 12 years ago. It is only the newcomers who

do not know about this struggle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar drew attention to the fact that

his Secretary-General, Mr Lim Chin Siong, did give advice with

a warning but that we did not heed it.

His advice was that if Singapore were to join Malaya, the

consequences would be grave. So the analysis of his

Secretary-General has come true. The Barisan want the prediction of their

Secretary-General to materialise, because in an interview with a

journalist of Bintang Timor he said that it was better for

Singapore to merge with Indonesia than Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is now clear who are the patriots of

Malaysia. Unfortunately, the Member for Jalan Kayu is not with

us now. Yesterday he said that conscription was not only against

the wishes of the people, but it was forcing our youths here to

fight against their brothers in Borneo or Kalimantan Utara. Mr

Speaker, what is the definition of "our brothers in Kalimantan

Utara"? We are not fighting our fellow countrymen in Sabah. We

are fighting the aggressors from Indonesia. Are the enemies we

are trying to drive out our brothers? Brothers, not to us, but

to members of the Barisan Sosialis. This is as clear as

daylight. I am sometimes confused because of the constant con

tradiction in their arguments. I do not recognise the aggressors

as our brothers. Our brothers are the patriots who are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



prepared to fight for every inch of our country, and not the

soldiers who have landed on our soil. The term "brothers" is

used by pro-Communist and Communist supporters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Jalan Kayu went on to say that although

Malaysia is independent, it is not a sovereign State. They say

that there are foreign bases in Malaysia. Malaysia was not

invited to the Cairo Conference, therefore it is not a sovereign

State. I am puzzled by the definition of the term "sovereignty".

Does he mean to say that only in Malaysia there are foreign

bases? What about in Africa and other parts of Asia? As I have

said earlier on, I am confused. Because we were not invited to

attend the Cairo Conference, we are not an independent country?

A country which has been acknowledged by the United Nations as

being independent and sovereign. It is not independent according

to the definition of Communist and pro-Communist elements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson yesterday said. "The people are

against conscription. We have canvassed from house to house to

find out the views of the people, and our finding is that they

are against conscription." It is still fresh in my memory. Mr

Speaker, when a Gallup poll was held by University graduates at

Tanjong Pagar. They issued a statement in Tanjong Pagar showing

the percentage of the electorate in Tanjong Pagar who were

agreed on merger in accordance with the White Paper or merger in

accordance with conditions for Sabah and Sarawak. They claimed

that 80 per cent were against the White Paper merger. That was

the result of their Gallup poll. They were the judges and they

were the election officers. They counted the ballot papers and

they were the returning officers. They claimed that 80 per cent

were against the White Paper merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they come hack again to the House to claim that they are the

real and only representatives of the people. Mr Speaker. I do

not wish to labour at length on this point. It is a shame when

our country is facing a crisis, attacked



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



by the enemy from the air, on land and at sea to urge the

Central Government to stop conscription and exhort the youth not

to take up military service. It is a sin perpetrated by Members

of the Barisan Sosialis. Posterity will never forgive them. This

mistake is due to the fact that there are cowards agitated by

the Barisan Sosialis in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support wholeheartedly the amendment moved

by the Deputy Prime Minister. The moment has arrived when we

should rise and respond to the call. There is a Malay saying

- when the house is burning, the rats run. It is a shame to our

nation. I urge and appeal to all people who love peace, who love

their fatherland, to rise and respond to the call. It is better

to die fighting than merely to live.



<br><br>3.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

there is an air of complete unreality in the debate that has

taken place on this motion by the Barisan Sosialis to condemn

national service, the training of our youths in military combat

and the remote possibility of their dying in the jungles of

Sabah and Sarawak. Nobody really believes, not even the Barisan

Sosialis, that there is any immediate probability or likelihood

of the youths of Singapore being called out in significant

numbers to fight or die for Malaysia. A lot of news was created

out of national registration and national service. About March

this year it was introduced in the peninsula. Later it was

extended to Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak in order that we shall

all be equal Malaysians. Out of this prodigious patriotic

effort, only some 80 young men from Singapore have gone to Port

Dickson for some military training. But this Barisan motion and

the Government's amendment to it are matters of postures, and

they are important. For it is in our postures that we give an

indication of whether we are growing up to the realities of life

in South-East Asia or whether we are still adolescents in a

world of make-believe, of sheriffs and bandits, of revolutionary

anti-colonialists and wicked white colonial exploiters.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Mr Speaker, Sir, the world and South-East

Asia cannot be painted in such simple black and white. For the

Barisan Sosialis, listening to them yesterday, the world has

stood still since 1961. Malaysia is still a neo-colonialist

plot, a big sellout. There is still the myth of revolutionary

uprisings in Sabah and Sarawak being crushed by a colonial power

grasping its £400 million worth of investments, according to the

Member for Jurong, without quoting his authority. Does he really

sincerely believe all that he said, all the Member for Paya

Lebar has said now? For them nothing has changed. It is a

remarkable capacity for self-deception. Still the

well-established, anti-colonial, anti-Malaysia, anti-national service

line. The same old arguments, all trotted out from their 1961

archives. The anti-national service one, it goes back one decade

to 1954. Still against the wicked colonialists who are going to

make our poor Chinese middle school students die for a wicked

imperialist cause, cannon fodder. And they dutifully repeat this

line of suppression of the people's liberation movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only indication that came from the Opposition benches

that these speeches were being made in November 1964 and not

1962 or 1961 was from the Member for Hong Lim. He has a keen

sense of what the Communists call "tailism". The tail and "ism".

The mass sets the pace. In order not to be left behind, you tail

in. He correctly reflected the different mood and temper of the

people when he said, "Military service, yes." Well, the Member

for Hong Lim was caught in a dilemma. He added this proviso,

"But our youths are not to fight and die outside Singapore. We

can defend ourselves by just squatting on this island of 214

square miles." One can sympathise with the Member for Hong Lim.

He can no longer afford to follow in the wake of the

Barisan - hoping that when heads are chopped off, the body will go with

him. But that has not happened. The Barisan is still there,

still growing more stupid heads. And he knows that the Barisan

is isolated. It is chilly when you are isolated, when you mount

a demonstration in Hong Lim Green and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



the masses have vanished into thin air. The poor Member for Choa

Chu Kang is now cooling his heels off for six months to

contemplate the folly of his actions and wondering how it was

that some of his compatriots now in this Chamber were braver and

fiercer revolutionaries but wiser men and still here. So the

Member for Hong Lim cannot agree with them because he knows the

masses are melting away. He cannot agree with the P.A.P, either

because his propaganda line is that whatever the P.A.P, does is

bad. Therefore, when we say that the people should be

trained - and he knows that the people generally want to get trained

- he says, "Yes, agree to one-half and disagree with the other half,"

and be absent from the vote so that his position is still re

served. Who knows now that perhaps other heads and other

movements may disappear, and he will inherit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Barisan's old refrain sounds oddly out of tune in

these very awkward circumstances. The Member for Jurong said

yesterday that the situation is getting graver day by day. I saw

some very gray and tired lines on his face. The youthful

cherubic appearance of the assistant professor has given way to

the first lines of real rugged granite bitterness of the stark

realities of a revolution that has failed. He reminded the

House, and regardless of Central Government propaganda, that it

was not the Indonesians alone but local fierce freedom fighters

leading the way into Pontian and Labis. He commiserated a lot of

the poor people who suffered as a consequence of this ever

graver situation - fishermen cannot fish, and curfews. His heart

bled for the masses. On whose side is he on? Always on the side

of the masses, that goes without saying. But I want to know in

this particular case when here is a group of people who land by

parachutes and by motor boats on territory which is not theirs,

and this has made it necessary for the elected Government of

Malaysia to impose these restrictions in order to prevent these

incursions, on whose side is he on? Is he saying that all these

hardships can be avoided just by not having curfews, not

defending ourselves, having more chaps



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



leading more Indonesians in? Is that what he is saying? it will

end up with no Malaysia; of course, I agree with him. You get

more locals leading more Indonesians, no defence taken, and as

he says, there will be no Malaysia. And then what? The

revolution has failed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member has a remarkable capacity for sticking to the

established line. Confrontation came because Malaysia is a

neo-colonialist plan, and it therefore brought in troubles and

tribulations. Why is it a neo-colonialist plan? Because 80,000

square miles of real estate in Sabah and Sarawak were forcibly

added to form Malaysia in order to preserve £400 million worth

of investment. So my colleague the Minister for Finance wanted

to know whether these investments in Sabah and Sarawak are in

danger of being robbed or whether, in fact, they were already in

Malaya and there was almost no significant investment in Sabah

and Sarawak. What was it about? He could not answer. Then, all

in the same breath, he went on to say that the intention of the

British as colonialists must be to extend the war in Asia. E was

flabbergasted, because if you extend the war - I mean, the

classic theory of imperialism is that you must have war because

of a conflict of interests, and when wars take place the wicked

capitalists sell guns to both sides to fight each other. Then it

makes sense to me. Malaysia fights Indonesia. Malaysia buys

helicopters, guns, submarines, jets, etc, from the British. So

the British have an interest in extending the war. The Americans

and the Russians sell guns to Indonesia, and the British,

Australians and New Zealanders sell guns to us. But is he

seriously suggesting that we should believe him when he said

that the British extend the war in Asia all in order that more

British money will be lost in hiring Gurkhas to stretch out

along a thousand-mile frontier in Sabah and Sarawak, more

British helicopters sent to the Far East, thereby wasting a lot

of petrol running around the place, holding mock exercises over

Singapore to test the air defences and so using up jet fuel?

Selling guns to themselves to create a war? These are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



the parrotted recitals, a conglomeration of

pseudo-Marxist-Leninist assertions

- all to explain away the folly of their past mistakes, their

policies pursued in selfish party interests that led them to a

dead end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not naive enough to believe that the British,

the Australians and the New Zealanders come to our aid purely

for reasons of charity, humanity, and love of democracy. Of

course, the British would like to keep their economic interests

in this region. Of course, they want to keep a foothold - if not

a foothold at least a toehold - for their military interests and

military influence to extend over this area. And, of course,

they want to keep their lines open with New Zealand and

Australia. But the acid question is: is it in our interest and

the collective interest of nearly 11 million Malaysians to have

them fighting on our behalf, or out of this country with us

fighting on our own? That surely is the acid question, is it

not? If they are bad for us because they are pursuing their

wicked selfish interests which undoubtedly they are, then we

should get rid of them. But I would like to hear reasons why we

should. And if they are cogent, convincing reasons, then surely

you will carry the masses with you. Why should the Naval Base be

shut down, Tengah shut down, Changi shut down'? So that there

will be peace in South-East Asia and we can have more cultural

troupes coming from Jakarta, and we can send the Member for

Jurong to learn Malay in Jakarta? And so we will all be friends

together and brothers in South-East Asia? Why not'? But first we

must test the credibility of these possibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the British had that capacity of foresight,

if they knew in 1962 (just before the Brunei revolt and just

before the first act of intervention by Indonesia into our

affairs) that they would find in 1963/64 an evergrowing

commitment in defence expenditure - Gurkhas, helicopters,

aircraft carriers patrolling these waters -- I suggest that they

might have taken a different policy decision on the future of

Sabah and Sarawak. The curious thing about the whole of the

Indonesian line



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



is not that Singapore is joining Malaya as

neo-colonialism but Sabah and Sarawak. But like the British, our

problem now is not what the balance of interests was before

Malaysia was formed, but what is the balance of conflicting

alternatives now facing us. Where do we go from here to face up

to the future? On our part, we have no doubts in our mind that

if the boundaries of Malaysia were reduced or altered in any way

as a result of Indonesian pressure, then our own future is in

peril. For then the whole of South-East Asia becomes softened up

for further encroachment and expansion by the strongest power in

this region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there were no confrontation, perhaps we might believe that we

would get rid of the bases as an act of friendship to our

neighbours. But no man in his right senses doubts that if there

were no British bases in this region today, confrontation would

not have stopped simply at sporadic guerilla raids, bomb

explosions and subversion. The people are resigned to the fact

that for a long time we shall be dependent on foreign assistance

to keep the Indonesians from eroding the boundaries of Malaysia.

But the more British, Australian and New Zealand forces are used

on the ground either in Sabah and Sarawak or in the peninsula in

Malaya, the more Malaysia is thrown psychologically on the defen

sive, and having to explain to the Afro-Asian world why its

nearly 11 million people are still unable to do its own

mopping-up operations of a few platoons of guerillas. In a nutshell, the

problem that faces us is how to get into a position where we can

maintain indefinitely a firm shield against Indonesian attack

with unflagging support from our allies and without draining our

economic resources. What our enemies want to see happen is our

gradually being bogged down in a situation where we face more

and more economic disaster and chaos, with more and more arms

chasing our own tails, and being finally squeezed from outside

and disintegrating from inside.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have moved this amendment, Sir, not because we believe

that the Central Government will suddenly expand its training

resources and facilities to build



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



an army comparable to Indonesia's. If the Central Government

were to begin to raise an army comparable to Indonesia's, i.e.

about 40,000 of Malaysia's 10 to 11 million people compared to

400,000 of Indonesia's 103 million people - but now, according

to President Soekarno in Ponyang, it is 104 million; every time

he speaks he represents more people, stronger men -- there will

be an enormous increase in our defence expenditure, about

four-fold. We have got about 10,000 now. If you multiply by four, it

is going to have some very unpleasant effects on our economy.

But it is our hope that by this stand we will give a lead to our

people to face up to our responsibilities. Whilst a large stand

ing army to emulate Indonesian proportions may be extravagant

and unwise, yet a territorial army of week-day civilians trained

at week-ends who can be called upon to assist the regular army

in maintaining the security of the nation is a feasible

proposition which can be achieved at little cost provided the

people are prepared to make the effort. Next time, if a landing

were to be attempted say at Tuas in Jurong whilst the regular

forces were defending the shore line, and if the Member for

Jurong were to mount another offensive with probably more

calamitous results than the one he mounted in Hong Lim, then we

would not have to waste our troops chasing him and his few

friends. We would have the Singapore Territorial Army to look

after them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, I suggest to the Barisan Sosialis that

we are making it clear to ourselves, our own people and to our

neighbours that we understand what the stakes are in South-East

Asia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a motion of

high treason has been tabled before this House by the spokesmen

for Jakarta, and I wish to speak a little on this motion. First

of all, I wish to ask the Members opposite whether they will

clearly tell us that they are speaking on behalf of the people

of Singapore, the people of Malaya, the people of Sabah, the

people of Sarawak, or the people of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the recent sittings of the Central

Parliament, only the Members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



of the Barisan Sosialis were against effective national

defence for Malaysia. During these two days, the spokesmen for

Bung Soekarno again spoke of anti-conscription. I would like to

ask them again, are they really loyal to Malaya? Are they really

looking after the interest of the people of Malaya? Mr

Speaker. Sir, you are aware that Indonesian terrorists had

invaded Malayan soil in Muar. This was the third landing of

Indonesian terrorists in our country. We are indeed fortunate

that the people are loyal to Malaysia. They reported immediately

to the security forces about the landings of the invaders. These

invaders were all rounded up in a short time. Mr Speaker, Sir,

if the people were to listen to the evil speeches of the Barisan

Sosialis and did not co-operate with the Government but assisted

our enemy, then the third landing of Indonesian terrorists would

not have been so easily wiped out. Members of the Opposition

should be loyal to the country and make concrete and responsible

criticisms of the Government. They should not be speaking on

behalf of the enemy in order to gain sweet favour from them. Mr

Speaker, those traitors who have helped to destroy our country

will pay heavily for what they have done. History too has

recorded the tragedy of a traitor who sold his country. I wish

to draw the attention of the Opposition to the tragedy of a

Chinese traitor, Wang Ching-wei. I am afraid they will share the

same fate if they pursue an anti-national movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they are complaining furiously that Malaysia is

causing hardship to the people. But, Sir, they have highly

praised the so-called guided democracy of Indonesia. They have

praised their policy of asking people to eat rats and jagong.

They even feel that the moon has a better shape in Indonesia

than the moon in Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at this very moment, they are still shouting

that Malaysia is neo-colonialist. I wish to draw their attention

to the recent Conference of the non-aligned nations in Cairo.

There were more than 40 leaders from the nonaligned countries

who attended the Conference. These leaders turned a deaf ear



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



to Soekarno's anti-Malaysia policy. Do you think that if

Malaysia were a neocolonialist set-up, these non-aligned leaders

would have turned a deaf ear to Soekarno? Certainly they would

have supported him. This is clear proof that Malaysia is an

independent sovereign country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now come to the question of the

British forces here. The Barisan Sosialis have time and again

said that Malaysia would be an independent country if British

and other Commonwealth troops were kicked out from Malaysia. On

the other hand, they say that they are loyal only to Malaya and

not to Malaysia. What sort of dirty logic are they telling us,

Sir? During these two days' debate, the Members opposite have

called upon this House to support Azahari, the champion of the

anti-Malaysia movement. Sir, as you are aware, Azahari, and may

be the Barisan Sosialis Members who have disappeared from this

House, are still in Jakarta engineering to send Indonesian

terrorists into Malaysia to destroy us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Malaysia is a fully independent country. But the

Barisan are still condemning us when friendly nations assist us

to protect our country. Mr Speaker, Sir, Malaysia is a young

and weak nation with an army of only 10,000 troops compared with

the 400,000 strong army of Indonesia. If friendly countries like

Australia and New Zealand had not come to our aid, what would

have happened to us? I see no reason why we should not accept

military aid from friendly countries when they are willing to

give it to us unconditionally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis and pro-Communist

elements across the Floor will be very happy to see Malaysia

crushed. Members of the pro-Communist front across the Floor

should stop using their out-dated anti-fascist, anti-imperialist

and anti-colonialist slogans as they will deceive the people no

more. They should be aware that only two or three Communist

countries sympathise with their masters in Indonesia. They

should know that the rest of the world fully recognise Malaysia

as an independent sovereign country. Therefore, the question of

Malaysia being a neo-colonialist plot is all bunkum.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to protect the lives and property of our

Malaysian citizens, I wish to give my full support to the

amendment of the Deputy Prime Minister.



<br><br>4.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, since the Assembly resumed last year, the anti-national

elements sitting opposite have wasted a lot of the time of this

House by shouting their anti-Malaysia, anti-foreign,

anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist slogans. Apart from this, they

have also openly declared that the guerilla warfare in North

Borneo is a war of national liberation.



<br><br>4.14 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Dr Fong Kim Heng) in the Chair]</h4></div>



When debating the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's policy speech last

year, I said that they were doing so in order to advance the

cause of the Communist movement. As the open front organisation

of the Communists, they have united with the old boys'

associations and trade unions to carry out anti-national

activities in order to destroy Malaysia because they know that

the ultimate aim of Malaysia will be to bring about a more

prosperous, peaceful and independent nation. This is what the

Communists do not want to see happening. In the past one year -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b> left the Chamber.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): He is afraid. He can stay. For one year, the Barisan Members

have been selling themselves to their foreign masters to destroy

Malaysia. More and more of the workers who were formerly with

them have come over to our side. Many old boys' associations

have also stopped their anti-national activities and dissociated

themselves from this anti-national group. Why have the Barisan

Sosialis come to this end? The reasons are very simple. Our

nation is truly independent now. Our Government is formed by the

one-man-one-vote system. It is formed by popular election. The

fate of our nation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



is in the hands of every citizen. Every citizen under a

democratic government can enjoy the right of education and other

facilities. In Singapore, the popularly elected Government is

carrying out various projects to serve the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, since the formation of Malaysia we have

entered a new epoch and a new industrialised society is in

progress. In the not too distant future, we will be able to give

more and better employment opportunities to the people. This is

what Malaysia will bring about. But the anti-Malaysia traitorous

Barisan group are still stubbornly holding on to their past

idea, persisting in their anti-national line, thus showing their

true nature of collaborating with foreign masters and being

traitors to our nation. From this, we can see their demeanour of

being subservient to their foreign masters. This is also proof

of their high treason. There are several reasons to suggest

this. Firstly, before Mr Chor Kok Thong, a member of the

Barisan Sosialis Central Committee, left for Communist China, he

announced to the Press that he had never been loyal to Malaya.

Yesterday I gave the Barisan Sosialis a chance to explain this.

But up till now, no reply or explanation has been given. Last

year when the House opened a new session, the Barisan Sosialis

had pledged to preserve, maintain and protect our Constitution.

But the actions taken by the Barisan Sosialis in the course of

the past year have shown that they have eaten their words, going

counter to what they have announced in this House. Secondly, the

Indonesian landing in our territory is an act of aggression and

yet the Barisan Sosialis claim that this is because of the forma

tion of Malaysia, thus showing that they are foreign agents and

traitors in our midst. Thirdly, enemy troops have landed in our

territory. There have been a series of landings in Johore. Muar

and Malacca. The Barisan Sosialis have never condemned them.

This fact also goes to show that the Barisan Sosialis are in

collusion with foreign enemies. So this shows that the Barisan

Sosialis are foreign agents amongst us, creating trouble in our

State, as evidenced by the demonstration held recently against

conscription. They wage their campaigns



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



against this nation, thus exposing themselves as traitors. If

they are loyal to our country, then they should appeal to the

people to respond to conscription. Instead, they urge the people

to oppose conscription and to ask for the withdrawal of British

bases here in order to see our country enslaved. I would like to

ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, how are we going to protect

ourselves and our sovereignty and independence without including

bases? If Indonesia were to declare war against us, would the Ba

risan Sosialis be able to persuade their Indonesian masters to

reverse their policy and save our country? Do they have this

magic power to repel the Indonesians? The Barisan Sosialis'

stand before and after Malaysia has always been the same. They

want to push the people into the sea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in our midst, there is a group of

traitors. These people are reactionaries according to Communist

terminology. Such people, according to the practice in Communist

countries, are sent to the Siberian labour camps. These people

have been trying to make our country subservient to a foreign

power. They have even lauded the landing of foreign troops in

our territory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the wheels of history are ever

moving forward. Anyone who wants to turn them back will be

discarded by the people and trodden under. Our struggle against

colonial rule ended in September 1963. The past era has gone,

never to come back again. I would like to ask the Barisan

Sosialis to understand this well, otherwise they will disappear

forever from the minds of the people.



<br><br>4.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Yesterday and today, the

Barisan Members in their speeches have proved that they are

enemies of their own nation. They form their policies in accord

ance with those of Indonesia and the Communist countries.

Foreign troops have come into our land. The Barisan argument is

that at this juncture we should be subdued and that we should go

down on our knees to seek peace with our enemies. These people

are neither



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



loyal nor grateful to the country. The people understand this

very well. When foreigners threaten the sovereignty of our

country, we have to resort to national service registration to

protect our lives and property. Either the Barisan speak in

their dreams, or they are not aware of local conditions. We know

the inner feelings of these people.. They seem to live in a

world of dreams. Their influence is decreasing day by day. Their

supporters are disappearing day by day. In order to raise the

hopes of their followers and keep their influence going, they

are resorting to this tactic of opposing national service. Their

propaganda will not be believed by the people. In the last

referendum and in the last elections, their tactics were

understood by the people. When Rome was burning, Nero, the

emperor, was playing his fiddle. That is the kind of action the

Barisan are following. If they are really loyal citizens of this

country, they should join the forces and help defend the nation.

But since they are supporters of Soekarno and his policies, they

are opposing national service. If a man is a loyal citizen of

this country, he will be prepared to lay down his life in its

defence. He will be happy to register his name for national

service to fight for his country. But if he opposes national

service, then we call him a traitor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan are singing their old song of opposition to

Malaysia. More than 75 per cent of the people voted for merger

and the formation of Malaysia. How can they claim that this was

forced on the people? In the 1963 general election, the people

further endorsed the policy of merger and Malaysia. The eyes of

the people are not shut. They realise the real situation as a

result of the referendum and the election. All the Barisan's

talk really shows their deceitful character and the deception

that they try to practise on the public. The people have no

choice but to laugh at the tactics of the Barisan. Although

there is an armed attack by the masters of the Barisan, that is,

the Indonesians, we have been able to defend ourselves. Will the

Indonesian stooges play to their tune and carry out their

propaganda? They are in favour of international communism. They

have to change their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



tactics and policies. We do not know when they are going to be

nationalists. They say that Malaysia is a warmonger, but the

people know who is really in favour of war. They also say that

we have to go according to the policy of peaceful co-existence.

The Indonesians have landed at Labis, in Johore, and near

Malacca. Who is attacking whom? Soekarno is attacking Malaysia.

So the Barisan do not actually know what is happening. Even if

they do not know what is happening, they should know from the

newspapers what is happening in the United Nations. So we are

the sufferers from Indonesian aggression. In order to defeat our

enemies and defend our country we have to enlist in national

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the amendment of the Deputy Prime Minister.



<br><br>4.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this motion

concerns the question of Indonesian aggression and the loyalty of the Barisan

Sosialis to our nation. Indonesian aggression by air, sea and land shows

that the territories of Malaysia are now subjected to the conditions

of war. No one who is loyal to his country can connive at this aggression.

This is an act of robbers and thieves. The motive of the Indonesian

aggression is very clear. It is none other than territorial

expansion and the diversion of the attention of the Indonesian

people from their suffering. Everyone knows that Bung Soekarno

is a very ambitious person, but with the encouragement of

Indonesian Communists, Indonesia harbours imperialistic inten

tions against Malaysia. So in order to do their work as lackeys

of Indonesia, the Barisan Sosialis have to do something on this

side to gear their behaviour and actions to Indonesian

aggression. They have been bragging so much and bluffing the

people here without knowing that their lies will never be taken

seriously by the people. They know that they are slaves of

Indonesia. That is why the only way out for them is very simple,

and that is to sour up the relationship between the people and

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



Government and to lead Indonesian troops into our territory. It

is regrettable that they should act so foolishly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speeches that they have made over the past few days

contain a lot of old tunes and hackneyed phrases that they have

repeated time and again in the past. In fact, we expected to see

more intelligence in the Opposition Members but we have been

very disappointed, I am sorry to say. This is the Opposition now

and they do not deserve any credit from any quarter. The

speeches that they have made are not in any way different from

those made by Dr Lee Siew Choh in this House and others like

him. I hope that they will realise their foolishness and, amend

their ways. Instead of opposing national service, they should

give their support to this righteous cause so that Indonesian

aggression may be stopped in time. Perhaps by so doing there

will be some hope for the Barisan. But they never wake up to the

realities of life. Even internally the Barisan Sosialis arc

split on the question of national service. The Socialist Front

in the Federation of Malaya support national service, and the

Singapore Barisan Sosialis have to keep quiet about it in the

Federation Parliament. But now they have the audacity to come

here and talk against national service. They do so because they

are without enlightened leadership. They are just like blind men

groping about in the dark. They do not really know what they are

doing and what to do. In fact, they are against everything that

the P.A.P. is doing for the people. They have to go against the

P.A.P. in spite of all the good things that we have done for the

people in order to save their own face. The people are very

clear in their minds that we are now faced with the threat of

Indonesian aggression. But the slaves of Indonesia who have

found their way into the Barisan Sosialis are trying to sour up

the good relationship between the people and the Government. We

must tell the people now that the No. 1 enemy of our nation is

Indonesia, and the No. 2 enemy is the Barisan Sosialis. As a

sovereign independent nation, Malaysia is an emergent nation in

this region.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



In order to stop aggression from a foreign source, we have to

resist whatever acts of aggression that are carried out. On the

other hand, we have to look after the welfare of our people

internally. But unfortunately we have some Indonesian agents in

our midst. So it is our duty to wake the people up and show up

these foreign agents and reveal them to the people for what they

are. We know that as long as parliamentary democracy exists in

Singapore, we will give the people every opportunity to decide

who is right and who is wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Opposition Members are just like a mouthpiece of Radio

Jakarta. They are propounding Indonesian opinion in this House

as though they are Radio Jakarta. But they have overlooked one

point, and that is that the suffering and misery that Indonesian

aggression has brought to our people has produced more widows

and orphans in our country. A lot of families have been broken

up because of Indonesian aggression, but the Indonesian slaves

in our midst do not want to take cognisance of these facts. Let

me tell them simply this: why do we want to break up Indonesian

aggression'? As far as the Malaysian people are concerned, we

are better off in all respects than the Indonesian people. That

is why we do not want Indonesia to interfere with our affairs.

We have every right to defend our nation and our way of life. We

have a good system of parliamentary democracy. Compared to the

so-called guided democracy of Indonesia, we are far better off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian leaders shout slogans about revolution every

day. Bung Soekarno can only do this in his own country, hut when

he goes abroad, he enjoys life and acts in a different way from

that of a revolutionary. But the Barisan Sosialis are singing

high praises of Bung Soekarno in spite of his shortcomings.

There is a great difference between the livelihood of our people

and that of the Indonesian people. If the Barisan Sosialis

imagine that there is a great paradise in Indonesia, that Bung

Soekarno is an enlightened leader,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



then I have to tell them that such imagination is too fantastic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we are better off than Indonesia in terms of material

benefits, let us talk about spiritual conditions. We enjoy full

freedom in this part of South-East Asia. We have freedom, but

freedom does not mean that we should give freedom to our

Indonesian agents to lead Indonesian troops into our territory.

Freedom does not mean that we should allow the enemy in our

midst to act freely in order to undermine our nation. We should

not have a misconception about freedom. This wrong impression

that the people might have been given should be corrected. The

freedom that we enjoy is not enjoyed by the Indonesian people.

The Barisan Sosialis have full freedom to speak in this Chamber.

They can say whatever they like here. So they have no excuse to

say that we have not given them freedom of speech. They have the

freedom to scold people in this House and to abuse others, but

we should not give them the freedom to spread rumours, because

rumours are dangerous to our nation. So there should be certain

limits to freedom. Those peace-loving people who want to

preserve freedom in the proper sense should expose the Barisan

Sosialis because they do not say what they mean. Their words are

not the same as their acts. Instead of protecting peace and

promoting freedom, they are undermining both these precious

characteristics of a democratic country. Their intentions are

very clear. They want to create trouble and chaos in this

country, to cause more strikes and to undermine our economy so

that in the last analysis they will put all blame on the

Government. This is what they are trying to do. They try to put

the blame for the suffering brought about by Indonesia entirely

on the shoulders of the Government. They are trying to stir up

feelings of discontent among the people against the Government.

But they have already lost in Malaysia. They are not successful

in what they do, otherwise they will not be in the embarrassing

situation as they are in now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are trying to guide the wolf into the room to eat up the

children.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



They are trying to help Indonesia to crush Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to take up the argument of the Member for Thomson

about Malaysia not being invited to the Cairo Conference. He

said that this is proof that Malaysia was a neo-colonialist

country. But I want to ask hurl whether China took part in this

conference. If not, can we then say that China is a neo-colonialist country? Switzerland and Norway did not take part in the

Cairo Conference. Can the Member also say that they are

neo-colonialist countries? To say that those countries which have

not been invited to the Cairo Conference are neo-colonialist

countries is sheer nonsense. In fact, the non-aligned nations at

the Cairo conference are not sympathetic towards Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir,

yesterday the Member for Paya Lebar introduced a motion in this House

opposing conscription. At a time when the Indonesians are intruding upon

our land and when enemy troops are committing aggression against

us, thus endangering our lives and property, he does not want to

take up arms in defence of our country, although he is a

representative of the people. In addition to that, he has

collaborated with the enemy and has acted as the mouthpiece of

Indonesia. He is like Wang Ching-wei in Chinese history. He can

even exceed Wang Ching-wei in the way the latter sold China to

Japan. The Barisan Sosialis are against conscription. They claim

that the reason is that Malaysia is a neo-colonialist product,

and since Indonesia is opposed to neocolonialism, therefore,

they should also side with Indonesia and oppose Malaysia. This

logic of the Barisan Sosialis is absurd. Their efforts in

opposing Malaysia in the past three years have all been futile.

Malaysia has the support of the majority of the people. At the

National Referendum held on the 1st September, 1962, the people

voted in favour of it. There was a mission from the United

Nations to assess the wishes of the people. There were elections

in the Borneo territories. All this proved that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



the concept of Malaysia was in accord with the wishes of the

people. The recent general elections also go to prove that

Malaysia has the support of the majority of the people. The

Barisan Sosialis' stand on Malaysia has been discarded by the

general mass of the people. Therefore, the establishment of

Malaysia is the fulfilment of the desire of the peoples of the

territories concerned. It is not, as the Barisan Sosialis have

termed it, a neo-colonialist product.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson has also

said that their Party have carried out door-to-door

investigations, and have visited the electorate. They have

claimed that, as a result of these visits, they have found that

the people were not in favour of Malaysia. What is the true

fact? Wherever they went they were scolded and rejected by the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of conscription, according to the statement

by the Central Government, there were 14,800 odd youths of

various races who came forward to register themselves for

national service in May. The figure is about 80 per cent of that

for last year. Also in March this year, about 100 youths from

Singapore went to Port Dickson to undergo training. Thousands

more youths have responded well to national service. This is in

contrast to the attitude of traitors like the Member for Thomson

and other Members opposite. I feel they have no place to hide

themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition Members have also mentioned the Cairo

Conference. But I would remind them that the outcome of the

Cairo Conference was that a statement was issued the contents of

which were contrary to the wishes of their master, Soekarno. As

a result, Soekarno did not sign the final document of

declaration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to enlighten these internal agents of the

contents of the declaration. It embodied the statement of

respect for national integrity and sovereignty and freedom from

foreign aggression. Does this not imply a censure against

Indonesia for its aggression against our territorial integrity?

Today all peace-loving people of the world know that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



Malaysia is a country subjected to aggression by Indonesia. But

regrettably the anti-national elements in our midst, namely, the

Indonesian running dogs, have considered Indonesian aggression

as a war to liberate this territory. They regard our own troops

as foreigners and our measures to conscript as a form of

suppression. At this time all the loyal people are united to

defend our territory. Yet these foreign slaves and running dogs

in our midst do not want to rise to the occasion and awaken

themselves. Their end will be just like that of Wang Ching-wei,

the traitor of China.



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I think the Barisan

Assemblymen have tried their best to confuse the issue over the

question of national service and conscription. So it is

profitable, I think, if we can get the picture clear. In no

democratic country normally are people allowed to go against

conscription in times of emergency or war. Only what are called

conscientious objectors, pacifists, Quakers and extreme

pacifists and so on go against national conscription for the

views they hold. Otherwise we cannot conceive of any group of

people who, in a national crisis, want to go against national

service. Yet the Barisan Sosialis and their friends propagate

this line. There are various reasons why they are doing this.

But what we on the Government side cannot understand, and the

people at large fail to understand, is that the whole world,

except Indonesia, have extended recognition to Malaysia. Even

Communist States recognise Malaysia as a sovereign and

independent nation. Indonesia, of course, does not recognise us.

The question arises, why does Indonesia not recognise us? The

Indonesians, or rather the Indonesian Government, say that

Malaysia is a neocolonialist creation because the British agreed

to allow Sabah and Sarawak to achieve freedom and independence

by merging in the new Federation of Malaysia. Until five months

ago, the merger of Singapore with Malaya was not considered a

neo-colonialist act by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



the Indonesian Government. Radio Republic Indonesia had even

referred to the referendum in Singapore. You will remember, Sir,

that at the conferences in Manila and Tokyo, President Soekarno

referred to the necessity for self-determination for the people

of Sabah and Sarawak only. He made no reference to Singapore.

Now, Indonesian Government leaders have called for the

liberation of not only Sabah and Sarawak but of Singapore. Not

only Radio Jakarta, but also Radio Kemam and Radio Kalimantan

Utara have called for the liberation of Singapore and Malaya as

well. The charge of neocolonialism can remain a charge. But the

Indonesian Government had to follow up this charge first with

economic and then military confrontation. They can call us a

neo-colonialist creation a million times. That will not matter. But

it is confrontation, military, economic and political subversion

as an instrument of confrontation which makes it necessary for

us to make a stand against the Indonesian Government. The

reasons why the Indonesian Government have found it necessary to

carry out confrontation, as they call it, against us, is the

absence of internal opposition of any considerable strength in

any of the four States towards Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation was completely different in the case of the

Central African Federation involving Northern Rhodesia,

Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia. There, at that time, the

problem of the white settler population in the three States had

a lot to do with the opposition to the Federation. The Central

African Federation broke up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Federation of Malaya is a federation where the

majority of the people in Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore, before

joining the new Federation, voted in favour of a democratic

system. They voted in free, democratic and secret elections to

join Malaya in the new Federation. The Barisan Sosialis leaders

and their Assemblymen, although ideologically pro-Communist or

perhaps Communist, are at the same time Chinese by race. Now as

Malay I can better understand their position than many could.

<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche A. Rahim Ishak:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, as I was saying before the recess, the Barisan Sosialis

leaders and their Assemblymen, although ideologically

pro-Communists or perhaps Communists, are, most of them, at the same

time, Chinese by race. I think the Members of the Barisan

Sosialis are in a dilemma. They are unable to detach themselves

from the Indonesian line spread in so many devious ways. For

example, they are unable to detach themselves on this question

of confrontation locally manifested by their policy of

anti-national service. They cannot move themselves away from this

Indonesian line of the charge of neo-colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesian confrontation appears in two aspects. The first

is an ideological one, pursued by the P.K.I. more than any other

group and Soekarno. The P.K.I. - Parti Kommunist Indonesia -is

against Maphilindo, which is the new name for the old theory of

Indonesia Raya. The other aspect of confrontation is a racial

one pursued by the Army, upholders of the theory of socio

national-Marhaenism, first propounded by Soekarno and now

pursued by many people like the late Professor Mohamed Yamin - a

racist theory. Actually this racist theory based on

socio-nationalism, terms which are the reverse of Hitler's national

socialism, today is supported by many political groups, big and

small.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If confrontation and the charge of neo-colonialism is

pursued only by the P.K.I., then the Barisan Sosialis can line

up with the Indonesians only along ideological lines. But the

Barisan Sosialis leaders know deep down in their hearts that

this charge of neo-colonialism, this confrontation which they

are supporting, is actually double-edged. It is also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



inspired at the same time by a racial theory, manifested by

Maphilindo or Indonesia Raya for Melayu Raya directed against

the Chinese in Indonesia, in Malaysia and in South-East Asia.

Why indeed should President Macapagal want to join Maphilindo,

the Malays in this country can easily understand. But

unfortunately, they, the Barisan Sosialis leaders, do not seem

to understand. For the last 10 years there have been in the

Philippines efforts directed against the Chinese by legislation,

to drive them out from the rural areas and even from the urban

areas, in the field of commerce and industry, something which

the Indonesians tried to do beginning in 1955, particularly in

the rural areas, and which they have failed to carry out

successfully. As a matter of fact, the unenviable position that

the Barisan Sosialis members have manoeuvred themselves into,

does not permit of any initiative at all on their part today.

They are caught in their own fire, so to speak. They must listen

to Radio Kemam very carefully, and this is a piece of advice I

want to give them. Listen in to Radio Kemam - tonight, if

possible, or on all following nights. They will find that Radio

Kemam - incidentally, for their benefit, I want to explain what

the name "Radio Kemam" means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the man Ibrahim bin Haji Yaakub, in Indonesia known as

"Iskandar", was a Malay school-teacher who emerged in Pahang in

1939. He had collaborated with Japanese spies, and when the

Japanese invaded our country (then a colony of Britain), Ibrahim

bin Haji Yaakub belonged to a movement called the "Fujiwara

Kikan". They were the big overlords then, and Ibrahim Yaakub

later became a Colonel in the Japanese-sponsored Army called the

"Giyu Gun". He fled from Malaya before the British re-occupied

our country and today he is a Member of Parliament - correction,

they do not have a Parliament now, they have a People's

Consultative Congress like Communist China - representing Rhiau

for Soekarno.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the movement led by Ibrahim bin Haji Yaakub was called

"Kesatuan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



Melayu Merdeka" and it was fashionable then, like now, to

abbreviate words by their first syllables. In Jawi, of course,

the abbreviation of "Kesatuan Melayu Merdeka" is KEMAM.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this movement of "Kesatuan Melayu Merdeka", ever since

Ibrahim bin Haji Yaakub fled to Indonesia, has been renamed

"Kesatuan Malaya Merdeka", also known as "KEMAM" in

abbreviation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Radio station, which used to broadcast to boost up the

morale of people like the Members of the Barisan Sosialis before

us here, pumps out day in and day out - if they care to listen,

which 1 think they should - this racial theory, which

unfortunately probably the Members opposite do not understand,

because it is in the Malay language, although they call

themselves loyal citizens of this country. Day in and day out

Radio Kemam spouts this racial theory. They will find that Radio

Kemam reflects the thinking of the racialists, not only those

around Ibrahim bin Haji Yaakub in this country, but also those

in Jakarta.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Radio Kalimantan Utara is something else. That is the

station run by the Barisan Sosialis colleague, Shaik Azahari.

Let me ask them one question. How do the Barisan Sosialis

Members think the Indonesians are going to solve what the

Indonesians call "the Chinese problem", if they succeed in

confrontation in Singapore and Malaya'? I hope they will try to

answer this question. The Barisan Sosialis, in pursuing a policy

of anti-national service, have unwittingly helped the cause of

the Indonesian motivation of confrontation, although in

supporting confrontation they would want to help the reasons

which motivate the P.K.I. Here is where they cannot detach

themselves from the other. They are caught in both.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Malaysia was horn, the Barisan Sosialis might have

opposed its formation purely on ideological grounds. That was

the reason we understood why they opposed Malaysia and merger.

Of course, they opposed merger for their own selfish reasons.

Their position is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



somewhat different today. For example, they are unable to

imagine whether they will want to go against national service.

If, for example, the Army under Nasution, and the Right-wing

leaders and racists take over control of the Indonesian islands,

they are not in a position to decide this eventually today. I

really feel sorry for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in connection with this indecisive

attitude which the Barisan Sosialis Members and their leaders

have manoeuvred themselves into, I am reminded of a story told

me about 10 years ago about a Japanese woman who was a recent

convert to Christianity who went to church on a Good Sunday

morning. There is no intention to show disrespect to the

Japanese people. It is just a story of a Japanese woman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While listening to the church sermon, every time God's name

was mentioned she half-stood up, took off her hat and sat down

again. But every time Satan's name was mentioned, she did the

same thing. Now she was not very sure, so to be on the safe

side, she did what she did.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will have noted that when General Gusti Djatikusomo,

who was then Consul-General in Singapore and later became the

Indonesian Ambassador in Kuala Lumpur, was in this country, he

was very fond of putting on the national costume of Javanese

royalty, because he belonged to the Royal House of Surakatta. He

is a Raden - that is the Javanese name for Raja or Tengku in this

country. The costume he wears consists of a headgear in typical

Javanese style, a double-breasted tunic with buttons going

diagonally across the breast, and a typically Javanese-painted

sarong, complete with royal chapals. The Army in Indonesia, on

the other hand, have their military uniform, trousers and all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Barisan Sosialis Members are so involved with all

and sundry, with the Indonesian confrontationists, including the

P.K.I., Parti Murbah, Indonesian racists and others - and

because they are tagging on so hard to the Indonesian sarong and

trousers, one of these days the sarongs and trousers of all of

them

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



- Aidit, Subandrio, Soekarno, Mohamed Razif, Djatikusomo.

Nasution and all the other racists one of these days their

trousers and sarongs will fall off, and the Barisan Sosialis

Members will have to face the naked truth! But, I suppose, Sir,

between the P.K.I. and the Indonesian racists, the Barisan

Sosialis would prefer the P.K.I. But sad to say, theirs unlike

the Japanese woman whose choice is between God and Satan, will

be between two unmentionables!



<br><br>5.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I have the good fortune to be a Member of this Assembly as well

as of the Central Parliament, and I notice a strange and

significant difference in the attitude of the Barisan Sosialis

Members in this Assembly and in the Central Parliament. Here

they are like wounded lions, while in the Central Parliament

they are like half-dead mice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This resolution should properly be tabled in the Central

Parliament, because this matter is one properly within the

purview of the Central Parliament. But their representatives

have never dared all this while to bring up this question before

the Central Parliament. They are, however, prepared to do so in

this Assembly for reasons which are quite obvious, because they

know that in this Parliament, despite their talk about

dictatorship and so on, there is more freedom of speech and more

liberty for them to say what they want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, the core of this matter is more or less

enshrined in the motion itself and in the amendment to the

motion. The operative phrase in the main motion by the Barisan

Sosialis is the allegation that the present policy of military

expansion and war is by the Alliance Government - their thesis

is that confrontation is really military expansion by the

Alliance Government, whereas we contend in our amendment that it

is Indonesia's policy of aggression and subversion. So the

question is, who is the aggressor? They contend that Malaysia is

the aggressor but we contend that it is Indonesia who is the

aggressor. Sir, there is an obvious



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



definition as to who is the aggressor. As far as I know - the

Barisan Sosialis can correct me - there is not a single

Malaysian soldier in any Indonesian territory, there is no

Malaysian paratrooper in any Indonesian territory, and there is

no subversion by Malaysia going on in any Indonesian territory.

But in Malaysia there are Indonesian paratroopers and Indonesian

soldiers, and there are Indonesian-trained Malaysian traitors in

our midst. The Barisan Sosialis in their speeches yesterday and

today have never made one word of criticism against Indonesian

aggression. They deny the existence of Indonesian aggression but

their masters, the Indonesians themselves, are quite open about

it. They admit there is aggression. I refer to a document called

"Malaysia's Case in the United Nations Security Council". It is

a report of the proceedings in the United Nations and the

Indonesian representative, unlike the Barisan Sosialis, did not

bother to disclaim that Indonesian soldiers are not committing

aggression. I quote an extract from the speech made by the

Indonesian representative at the United Nations Security Council

in which he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I would not deny that our volunteers, our guerillas

together with militant youths of Sarawak and Sabah, some of whom

had been trained in our territory, have entered the so-called

territories in Sarawak and Sabah. They have been fighting there

for some time, this is no secret.'



<br><br>And yet the Barisan Sosialis in their speeches imply that there

is no Indonesian aggression when their masters openly said in

the Security Council that there is aggression. And they said,

"What of it; we are sending soldiers, we are training Malaysians

to infiltrate into Malaysia, to indulge in acts of sabotage."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And now this fighting has spread to other areas in

Malaysia beyond Sabah and Sarawak such as Malaya. Why is

Malaysia so gravely concerned now that it requests a meeting of

the Security Council?'



<br><br>The stooges of the Indonesians pretend that there is Malaysian

aggression but their masters openly admit that they are

committing aggression, they are prepared to go on with the

aggression. So



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>



why make a fuss about it'? It goes on to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As a matter of fact, the fighting now in Malaysia is on a very

small scale compared to the magnitude of the fighting in Sarawak

and Sabah.'



<br><br>The Barisan Sosialis denies that there is aggression, whereas

the Indonesians do admit that there is aggression. In all the

speeches of the Indonesian representative they have never

claimed that there is a single Malaysian soldier in Indonesian

territories, and yet the Barisan Sosialis motion talks about

military expansion and war by the Alliance Government. Where is

the war by the Alliance Government? Which war? Sir, as we all

know - but I do not want to go into too much detail - apart from

the Russians and the Czechs, the Afro-Asian countries in the

Security Council voted in condemnation, directly or indirectly,

of Indonesian aggression in Malaysia. So it is only the Barisan

Sosialis and their Indonesian masters who claim that Malaysia is

committing aggression. In fact, the Indonesians do not claim

that, only the Barisan claim it. Why, therefore, is the Barisan

Sosialis pretending and perpetuating a falsehood that there is

Malaysian aggression'? There are two reasons for it. First, the

domestic quarrel inside the Barisan Sosialis. You will remember,

Sir, about a year ago, the present leaders of the Barisan

Sosialis - some of whom are here-took the line that they would

oppose conscription under protest, not opposing conscription,

but Dr Lee Siew Choh condemned them as supporting British

imperialism. He took the line that there should be total opposi

tion to conscription. So now orders have come from outside

compelling them to eat humble pie, and that is what they have

been doing the last two days. They have been trying to outbid

Dr Lee Siew Choh in following his line, and to that extent they

respect Dr Lee Siew Choh who turns out to be more correct in

interpreting Communist policies than the Boy Scouts of the

Barisan Sosiahis, amateur revolutionaries who try to curry

favour with Peking and Jakarta. So today they have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>



to bring up this motion in order to out-manoeuvre Dr Lee Siew

Choh. They know that Dr Lee Siew Choh's line has gone down

better in their Party than their amateurish attempt to play both

sides, to be constitutional politicians and revolutionaries.

That is one reason why I submit, Sir, they have brought up this

motion - to show to their followers that they are more

revolutionary than Dr Lee Siew Choh who has said some very

harsh things about them. I do not think I will tax the patience

of this House by pouring out the abuse that Dr Lee Siew Choh

has levelled at them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reason is the realisation by the pro-Communists

in the Barisan Sosialis that they cannot hope to capture power

in Malaysia, constitutionally or unconstitutionally, by

persuasion or by violence, and they know that the only way the

Barisan Sosialis or the pro-Communists can come to power is with

the help of Indonesian bayonets. My colleague, the Minister for

Finance, said earlier that they have no chance, either

constitutionally or by violence, of becoming Commissars,

Ministers, or Parliamentary Secretaries except by leave and

licence of Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote another document if they think that the

Indonesians are going to spend money, to sweat, and to shed

blood to make these people Commissars. They arc mistaken because

there is another document called "Indonesian Involvement in

Eastern Malaysia". This is a report of some interview with

certain members of the C.C.O. - Clandestine Communist

Organisation in Sarawak. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There is a good deal of anti-Chinese feeling within Indonesia

and the Government may not wish to advertise their support' -



<br><br>that is the Indonesian Government -



`for a Chinese movement. To certain neighbours and international

audiences Indonesian propaganda claims that Malaysia is in danger of being taken over by Chinese Communists. Indonesian

opposition to Malaysia is an attempt to prevent an outpost of

Peking being established in South-East Asia.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



It goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Some of the Indonesian authorities' caution about aiding

the C.C.O. is reflected in the statements of the Chinese who

have been captured or surrendered on their return from Indonesia

to Sarawak.'



<br><br>It goes on to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Indonesians have formed no exclusive Chinese volunteer

Unit. The Chinese are indeed a minority in the Units in which

they have been incorporated. Nor have all the Chinese sent

across the frontier by the C.C.O, been recruited into the

existing volunteer formations. They have simply been kept in

reserve.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it quotes from a C.C.O. volunteer who defected:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`On going back to Indonesia after the attack, I found the

Chinese in the Unit singled out for harsh treatment by the

Indonesian Company Commander. Their freedom of activity was

severely restricted. There was no medical attention, and they

were subject to rigid discipline. Bong deserted and had crossed

the frontier once again in October 1963.'



<br><br>So, Sir, if the Members of the Barisan have any expectation that

the Bung is going to nominate them as Commissars or Ministers, I

think they should meet some of the Members of the C.C.O. who had

unpleasant experiences of what the Indonesians' real intentions

are in regard to Malaysia. They will be lucky if they can become

junior doormen in an Indonesian Malaysia. So it is true, Sir,

they have no choice. As a Communist outfit they carry out orders

regardless of the consequences for themselves, regardless of

whether that is the right policy to advance even Communism in

Malaysia. They are the instruments of Indonesian expansionism.

They talk about military expansion and war by the Alliance

Government, but the truth is, there is Indonesian expansion and

they are the instruments of Indonesian imperialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing about the Indonesians, and that is, they are

more open and frank about what they want. In May 1945 the late

Professor Yamin made it quite clear what are Indonesia's

ultimate objectives in this part of the world. It is published

in booklet form which has been reproduced in local publications.

In May 1945, at a meeting of Bagan Usaha Persiapan Indonesia -

Investigating Committee for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



the Preparation of Indonesia's Indedence - Mohamed Yamin said,

amongst other things, as far as he could see it, independent

Indonesia should be grouped as follows - first, the former Dutch

colonies comprising Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Celebes and so on.

Then areas within the war zones - Papua and so on. Third,

Portuguese Timor and North Borneo. Fourth, the Malay Peninsula

(including the island adjacent to it), that is, the following

four States - Trengganu, Kelantan, Kedah and Perlis. The

adjacent island is Singapore. In his speech he said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To separate Malaya from the rest of Indonesia amounts to

deliberately weakening, from the outset, the position of the

people's State of Indonesia. To unite Malaya to Indonesia would

mean strengthening our position and completing our entity to accord with our national aspirations and consistent with the

interests of geo-politics of air, land and sea.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Soekarno at the same meeting endorsed Professor Yamin's

thesis. He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I have never said that Indonesia comprises only those

areas which were ruled by the Dutch. In fact, I have on one

occasion in my life dreamt of a Pan-Indonesia which would

include not only Malaya and Papua (that is, New Guinea) but also

the Philippines. For that reason, I am in full agreement with

the stand taken by my colleague, Mr Yamin, who said yesterday

that neither on moral grounds nor on the grounds of

international law are we obliged to be the inheritors of the

Dutch.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`God in his wisdom has mapped out this earth. Everyone

looking at the world map will understand what God has ordained

as is shown on the map. God has determined that certain parts of

the world should form single units. God has also determined

that, on the map which he has created, the Japanese Isles should

form one single unit. And when I look at the islands situated

between Asia and Australia and between the Pacific and the

Indian Oceans, I understand that they are meant to form a single

entity. For that reason, I shall support in this meeting those

who advocate that independent Indonesia should extend to Malaya

and Papua. We are not inheritors of the Dutch. Malaya is already

in the hands of the Imperial Japanese Government, and so are

Papua, North Borneo and Timor.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, right from the start, the Indonesians had expansionist

aims - to include all those islands and territories,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>



to quote Soekarno, "comprised within the Pacific and Indian

Oceans and between Asia and Australia." The Barisan Sosialis

have now become the stooges to carry out Indonesia's

expansionist plan. You will remember, Sir, that the people then

dismissed all these things as a madman's dreams. In China, at

the turn of the century, there was the famous Tanaka Memorial

devised by Japanese imperialists for the conquest of China and

the rest of Asia. And when the plan went through, the Japanese

too had their Wang Ching-wei's. He was killed by the Japanese,

but here in the Indonesian context we have the Barisan Sosialis

playing that role, becoming traitors to their own country. It is

not new in the Communist movement for Communists to become

traitors to their own country. During World War II, I remember

the Communists in Britain and Western Europe were for years

demanding that the Western countries should wage an aggressive

war against Germany and against the Fascists. But when Stalin

signed the pact with Hitler, they switched their line and they

said, "No, this is an imperialist war." And in India, the Indian

Communist Party also said, "Yes, this is an imperialist war.

Indian nationalists should not participate in it. They should

fight the British, and should not participate in an imperialist

war." But when the pact was liquidated by Hitler, and Germany

attacked Russia, once again the instructions came, "No, no, it

is not an imperialist war, hut it is the people's war." And it

is this role that the Barisan Sosialis are playing. They have

instructions from the international Communists - there are two

international Communist forces today - that they are to play the

role of traitors; they are to betray their country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice, Sir, that they have been talking about

coercion, that the Central Government is coercing youths to

undergo military training. They have been criticising that. But

have they criticised their own friends, their own comrades who

go to Indonesia, to the school for training traitors? They have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



never condemned them. They are receiving military training

there, and being sent back. Why have they not a word to say

about Indonesians training our youths to kill our youths'? They

have nothing to say. They are training Malaysians to come back

to kill Malaysians. What have they got to say? Is that not

coercing youths, training youths to murder, sending them as

cannon fodder into Malaysia'? We saw recently in Labis, an

Indonesian, not a Malaysian, who was sent here - what did he

say? He was an Indonesian patriot. At least, I respect him, Sir,

because he was fighting for his country, but not the Barisan

Sosialis. They are fighting as traitors for some other country.

And he, an Indonesian patriot, Soetikno, what did he say, when

he landed in Labis? What kind of war are the Indonesians

fighting here, and what kind of war are the Barisan Sosialis

supporting'? The question was asked of him ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Would the Minister quote the paper and the

date?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I am sorry, Sir.

Thursday, 1st October, 1964, the Straits Times. One question:

"Are you aware that among the political agents in your airdrop

group there were Communists?" Answer: "Not among the military

personnel, but among the Malayan Chinese, yes. They were all

members of the Communist Party."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question: "Just now you said you have known these people for

only a short period. How could you know they were Communists?"

Answer: "My superiors told me. They were brought to Java to be

trained for infiltrating into Malaya."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis talk about oppression, that people do

not support Malaysia. Here is what an Indonesian said, a man who

came, risked his life to fight for Soekarno. He was asked. "How

do you feel towards Soekarno's regime, now that you have been

misled?" "As soon as I arrived here I noticed that the various

races live harmoniously, and I realised that what was told to me

was all wrong. I hope that Soekarno will realise his mistake and

recall the negotiations that have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>



taken place between Indonesia and Malaysia so many times in the

past."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he was asked, "Would you describe the landing as a

complete flop?" "Yes, as we did not get any support from the

people."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have been talking for the last two days that the

people are opposed to Malaysia, that the people are opposed to

this war. Here is an Indonesian who says he is convinced - "Yes,

we did not get any support from the people. My own personal

struggle was an empty one. For 20 days I was in the jungle."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lest they think that this Lieutenant, Soetikno, is a

traitor, let me quote from a recent broadcast from Radio Jakarta

about this lieutenant, before they say that this chap is a

traitor, that the Malayan Government had bought him over. This

is from the Monitoring Digest issued by the Ministry of Culture

on Wednesday, 4th November, broadcast on 3rd November. The

broadcast says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'According to the statement by the Tunku Abdul Rahman

regime, it would appear' -



<br><br>Sir, this is in regard to the recent

dropping of pamphlets -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'as if the pamphlets were signed by an

Indonesian volunteer, Soetikno.'



<br><br>The statement says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Indonesian people' -



<br><br>I hope the Barisan Sosialis Members will take due note of this -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'should feel proud that volunteer Soetikno in the face of

encirclement by 5,000 mercenaries who are stationed in Malaya

could have sustained himself for that long.'



<br><br>At least, Sir, I hand it to the Indonesians. Even their traitors

they praise as patriots. Our friends here, our Malaysians,

consider our patriots traitors. And I notice that every time

Radio Jakarta refers to the Barisan Sosialis, they refer to them

as patriots. When an enemy refers to somebody in our country as

patriots, it must mean that they are traitors. So the

Indonesians themselves have correctly assessed the role that the

Barisan Sosialis play. They are patriots in the eyes of the

Indonesians because they are traitors in the eyes of Malaysians.

Therefore, Sir, this motion by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>



Barisan Sosialis is really an attempt to disarm Malaysians, to

hand them over, to make us defenceless. What they are telling us

is this, "Let the Indonesians fight. If they bomb and kill our

fishermen, bomb our cities, commit sabotage, not a word of

criticism." But if we defend ourselves against the Indonesians,

that is criminal. That is coercion. What does that mean? They

are playing their allotted role. They want to tie our hands

behind our backs and hand us over to the Indonesians to be

raped, to be looted, and eventually to be colonised by their

masters. They are not interested in what the people think of

them. They know what the people think of them. There was a

referendum, there was an election, and the people gave their

verdict. And a month ago in Hong Lim the people melted away. In

fact, there was a reporter there who told me that for the first

time, when the police moved into the Chinatown area to round up

some of the Indonesian sheep, the people were happy. They said

they were trouble-makers. There was not a single protest, not a

single jeer at the police, because for the first time the people

knew about the Barisan Sosialis; that they are the forward base

for Indonesian aggression against Malaysia. So their real reason

for bringing up this motion is not to convince us or the people

but to convince Indonesia, their masters, that they are doing

their job well. I can bet my last bottom dollar, Sir, that

tomorrow's Monitoring Digest will contain all the speeches from

the Barisan hut not a single speech from this side. And Radio

Jakarta will come out and say that the patriots in Malaysia

condemn conscription. That I say, Sir, might be commendation for

them from Indonesia, but it will be condemnation by the people

of Malaysia of the Wang Ching-wei's created to their own folly,

to their own stupidity. And as the lieutenant from Indonesia

said, he discovered that he had wasted his life on behalf of

Soekarno.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, when we analyse

the motion of the Barisan Sosialis, we will find that they do not

wish Malaysia to exist. If at all it is to exist,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>



it must be subservient to Indonesia. Therefore, they do not

recognise Malaysia as an idependent nation. They do not like

Malaysia to exist as an independent nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last 140 years, we have been subjected to colonial

rule but now we are independent. But the Barisan Sosialis

Members are still subservient-mined. The Britishers have gone

but the Barisan Sosialis want us to be subservient to Indonesia

because they cannot get rid of their subservient attitude. In

order to guard and defend our nation, the Government has brought

in national service but these people, who are the agents of the

Indonesian Government, want to oppose it to prove to their Indo

nesian masters that they are good servants. The Member for Paya

Lebar claims that Indonesia is helping to liberate North Borneo.

As far as the Singapore Government is concerned and as far as

the Central Government is concerned, the people of North Borneo

have chosen to be independent under Malaysia. The Indonesians

send their lackeys; but the Barisan Sosialis do not understand

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar is proud of Indonesia but he

forgets the treatment the Indonesian Chinese received from the

Indonesian Government. The Chinese from Indonesia ran out of

Indonesia to Singapore. If these Barisan Members still want to

side with Indonesia, it is a wonder! If we do not defend

ourselves from Indonesian infiltration, if we do not stop

Indonesian troops from coming in, and if Soekarno succeeds in

controlling us, he will bring about the economic stagnation that

already exists in Indonesia. Because we do not want to be

subjected by Indonesian forces and the Indonesian Government,

our Government is taking steps to train our young people for

national service. We, along with other nations, do not want to

wage war, but if foreign nations want to carry out aggression

against us and control us, we cannot wait and allow them to

swallow us. We must defend ourselves. The defence of our nation

is not contrary to the maintenance of peace.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister has said that because of our long

relationship with Britain, we have a defence pact with her. Just

because of that, no one should accuse us of being a neo-colonialist country. When Indonesia gained independence from the Dutch,

it broke off friendly relations with Holland. Now, the

Indonesian Foreign Minister flies to the Dutch capital to have

meetings with the Dutch Foreign Minister to beg for help. Can we

therefore claim that Indonesia is now again a neo-colonialist

country? Now, we in Malaysia are faced with emergency

conditions. Enemy troops have invaded our territories.

Therefore, it is the duty of every loyal citizen to defend this

country. No country in the world does not recruit its youth for

military training. The Member for Bukit Merah stated certain

pre-conditions for the country to be independent. Indonesian troops

must clear out of this country and then only can our people live

happily. We can only pay full attention to our economic

development when Indonesian troops are cleared out. The Barisan

should understand these pre-conditions for our peace and

prosperity. Therefore, they should inform their master,

Soekarno, that he must withdraw his troops. To muster our

forces to defend our country does not mean that we are

war-mongers. As far as Malaysia is concerned, there is no ground for

this accusation. It would be difficult to accuse a small nation

like Malaysia of wanting to crush Indonesia. Just because we are

small the Barisan want us to be subjected by Indonesia. Even big

nations like Russia enlarge their forces and acquire nuclear

weapons to defend themselves. Our case has been brought up in

international councils and we have gained a lot of sympathy. But

here, in this House, some of our own people's representatives

attack us for resorting to national service to defend ourselves.

These are the traitors that we have in this country and in this

House. The Barisan should be ashamed of themselves for this. It

is the Indonesians who attacked us. If they had not done so

there would have been no need for national service. In order to

defend ourselves, we have to resort to national service. Instead

of supporting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



the Government, the Barisan are opposing national service. Even

if they do not want to help the Government, they should stop

opposing national service and hindering the efforts of the

Government. Therefore, I call on them to be more reasonable and

patriotic.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, yesterday and today we have heard statements made

by the Barisan Sosialis which show that they are acting as

agents for the Indonesians. It would not be far wrong for us to

say that they are actually the henchmen and lackeys of the

Indonesians. The Barisan Sosialis have played an active part in

the cause of Indonesian confrontation. They spread false

propaganda to instigate the various races in this country to

fight one another, to instigate the people against the police,

and to train people to become guides for Indonesian soldiers.

The reason why the Barisan Sosialis are against conscription is

that they can demoralise and weaken our country to enable them

to carry out their nefarious designs in league with the

Indonesians. If it is true that they are working for the

interest of our people, then why do they not blame the Indonesians

for the atrocities that they have committed? Instead,

they blame us for wanting to defend our country. It is only

insane people who believe in the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, originally I did not wish to speak because many of my colleagues have spoken. But in view of the

speeches made by the Barisan Members, I have to say something.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the people of Malaysia and Singapore have the

interests of the nation at heart, they should all condemn the

Barisan Sosialis for the shameless speeches that they have made

in defence of Indonesian atrocities committed in our territory.

The people who have the interests of the nation at heart will

never excuse them for what they do. The Member for Paya Lebar

shouted yesterday in this House that they wanted peace, that

they did not want war.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



His behaviour was very much like that of a comedian on the stage

shouting words which do not mean anything. They say they are

against war, that they desire peace, but they open the back-door

secretly to let in the Indonesian troops who are carrying out

incursions at places which are within 25 miles of Singapore,

namely, Muar, Pontian and Malacca. And even in Sarawak Indo

nesian troops are killing our people, wrecking our installations

and damaging our property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of our nation suffer misery. Their families have

been broken up by the Indonesian troops. Despite all this, the

Barisan still want us to get foreign troops to withdraw from our

country. The Indonesians have already pointed their guns at us.

Perhaps the guns are not being pointed at the Barisan Members.

That does not matter to them. Because of this they hope that the

people of our nation would be devoured up and handed over to

Soekarno. They say that the P.A.P. describes all those who are

against the P.A.P.'s policy as anti-national. But we have ample

evidence to show that the P.A.P. has not smeared the Barisan

Sosialis when we call them anti-nationals. Who does not want

peace? Who does not want to live in peace and happiness? All

along it is the policy of our people to live harmoniously with

our neighbours. All along we have been adopting a good neighbour

policy. We want to talk peace and we have broken away from

colonial rule in a peaceful way too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong spoke yesterday in this House in

defence of Indonesian atrocities. He mentioned the third landing

by the Indonesians in Malaysia. He was taking the matter rather

light-heartedly, as though to suggest that the, invaders were

coming here for a holiday, like American tourists. I would like

to ask him whether he knows that the Indonesian terrorists who

have come here fully armed are not holiday makers. Does he not

know this is a fact? I am quite sure they know this in their own

heart of hearts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Member for Tampines is not only against

conscription but he also goes to the extent of saying that

Malaysia is not fully independent. I feel it is a pity that he

should have said such words, that Malaysia, which has been

accepted by the people, does not enjoy full independence. And

yet he is paid out of public funds to be in this House. We have

seen the provisions of the Constitution. And in this Chamber he

tries to deny us our sovereignty and our independence. He is

behaving like an Indonesian and any other Communist. According

to what he says, "Malaysia is not an independent and sovereign

nation."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sin Chew Jit Poh made a report of his speech, which

shows that he was speaking in his capacity as a national

traitor. What is more absurd is the speech made by the Member

for Bukit Panjang. He quoted a Chinese proverb to the effect

that "Good iron is not meant for making nails." He also quoted

another Chinese proverb that "Good boys are not meant for the

army." This is fantastic and out-moded. They talk about wanting

peace and are against war. If the Member is really sincere

about his pursuance of the policy of peace and opposition to

war, then I would suggest to him here, in all earnestness, that

they should ask his old friend Soekarno of Indonesia to make an

appeal to the able-bodied youths in Indonesia not to join the

army for the purpose of invading Malaysia. They should ask

Indonesia to stop sending their armies to our country and

causing damage to our property. They should also ask their good

friends not to change the good iron into weapons and use them

against us. This in fact is what they should do. If they can do

what I have suggested, that is by appealing to Indonesia not to

turn able-bodied youths into soldiers, then they will prove

themselves to be nationals instead of anti-national elements.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, the Member for Jurong and the Member for Paya Lebar

have jointly tabled



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>



this motion. This is a matter of regret, for this motion amounts

to abetting the Indonesian aggression against us. I am wondering

whether these two Members have already forgotten their

allegiance to Malaysia and to Singapore when they took their

oath in this House. Otherwise they should not make such state

ments and speeches in their capacities as Members of this House

which will help the Indonesians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to their speeches and their reasons for

opposing national service, we are saddened by their stubbornness

and dogmatic analysis of events. They could only recite those

hackneyed speeches made by their foreign masters. They have not

been able to advance any convincing reasons. Their subjective

and irrational speeches do not deserve our rebuttal, but in

order to enable the people to understand their conflicting

analysis and to see through their falsehood, it is necessary for

me to make a reply to their speeches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar said yesterday that the formation

of Malaysia was contrary to the aspirations of the people in

Malaysia. His contention is that the people in Singapore do not

have the same citizen status and, therefore, the Barisan

Sosialis elements will not be able to take part in the Federal

elections and also that there is not enough freedom of

expression, assembly and publication so as to enable them to

serve the cause of the Malayan Communist Party and to expand

their anti-national activities. Because the formation of

Malaysia has conscribed their anti-national and traitorous

activities, they say Malaysia is against the wishes of the

people. I would like to ask the Member one question. Whether he

has forgotten that merger and Malaysia have been brought about

after the Referendum in which 75 per cent of the people in

Singapore cast their votes in favour of merger and Malaysia? And

in last year's general election in September, the great masses

once again cast their votes for the P.A.P. when they went to the

poll on a Malaysian platform.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Members claim that they always abide by the wishes

of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



people. In actual fact, they are going against the wishes of the

great majority of the people on the Malaysia issue. How can they

explain away their stand? Are they of the view that only those

who support the Barisan Sosialis represent the wishes of the

people and that those who are against their traitorous

activities are not the people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar also touched on the question of

loyalty and on the various kinds of war. He said Indonesia's

aggression against North Borneo is anti-colonialist, anti-imperialist, and is a just war. As such, the people in Malaysia have

no obligation to defend their own country and their territorial

integrity. His speech negates the fact that Sabah and Sarawak

are part and parcel of the Malaysian territory. This goes

directly against their Oath of Allegiance to Malaysia in this

House. Is there anything more shameless than their attempt to

hand over our land to our enemy, a land to which they have sworn

their allegiance? Is this not a traitorous act and high treason?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members of the Barisan Sosialis, in order to cover up

their traitorous nature and to confuse the people, also talk on

the question of loyalty. But what is the object of their

loyalty? According to them, they are loyal only to Malaya plus

Singapore. They even boasted that they were prepared to sac

rifice their lives for the territorial integrity of "our

country", i.e. Malaya plus Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 19th of October last year, the Barisan Sosialis in

the 36th issue of their Party organ, issued a statement in which

they said Malaya should have territorial integrity and

sovereignty, and that this was their basic Party stand. "We are

prepared to give up our lives at any time to go to the forefront

of the battlefield to defend our homeland." This was stated in

their Party organ, The Barisan, in their policy statement. Their

then Party Chairman, Dr Lee Siew Choh, in the form of questions

and answers which appeared in their Party organ of the same

issue, gave his reply to these questions. One question



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



was, "If our country is invaded by foreign powers, is our Party

prepared to resist foreign forces?" His reply:

"Malaya is our fatherland. We will go to war to defend our

fatherland." Another question was: "If Malaya including

Singapore is invaded by other countries, is the Party prepared

to come out to defend it?" Answer: "Since Malaya is our

fatherland and if it is invaded by other countries, of course,

the Party will come out to defend it."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the 38th issue of their Party organ,

published on the 3rd of November last year, there was an article

on the question of loyalty. In this article, the Barisan

Sosialis reaffirmed and stressed that "Malaya is our fatherland.

We shall unhesitatingly sacrifice all our lives and property to

defend our fatherland."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 1964 on New Year's Day, the Barisan Sosialis

Chairman in his New Year message reaffirmed his Party stand. He

said, "Our stand is that we should have full sovereignty and

territorial integrity. If any other nation invades our

fatherland, we will be the first to oppose such an invasion in

defence of our fatherland."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been quoting statements made by

the Barisan Sosialis in order to ask them: Do they recognise

their own Party's policy and statements? Do they admit that

Malaya should have its territorial integrity and sovereignty? Do

they admit that they should be loyal and should sacrifice all

their lives to defend their fatherland? If they do not want to

contradict what they have said and what their Party have said in

their Party statement, then we shall ask them: Is Pontian part

of Malayan territory? Is Labis part of Malayan territory, and is

Malacca part of Malayan territory? I am asking them on the basis

of their own speeches. The Indonesian armed invasions at Pontian

and Labis (recently they have also landed in Malacca at Sungei

Kesang) are acts of open aggression committed by Indonesia

against Malaysia. All nations with a sense of justice, even the

Security Council of the United Nations, have accepted our

complaints against these aggressive acts of Indonesia.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Dr Fong Kim Heng) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Barisan Sosialis Members have sworn loyalty to

Malaya, so far we have not seen that they have shown any

intention to sacrifice themselves to defend their fatherland and

to condemn Indonesia's aggressive acts. 1 would like to ask

them: Why should they not mean what they say? Why do they not

condemn Indonesian aggression? Why do they not adopt concrete

steps to defend their fatherland, that is, Malaya? In view of

Indonesia's aggression and subversion, and in view of the grave

situation arising from their aggression and the loss of lives,

they know full well that Indonesians have carried out their

aggression on Malayan soil. Why did they stage a demonstration

against national service on the 12th of September? Why should

they bring up this motion to oppose national service? In

bringing up their anti-national service motion, do they mean to

oppose the Indonesian aggression in defence of our fatherland or

do they mean to sell out our fatherland to Indonesia by abetting

their aggression? All these facts go to prove that their real

aim of opposing national service is to weaken our defence

against our enemy, so as to allow Indonesia to slaughter our

people. This is an unpardonable act of treason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 62nd issue of their Party organ, which was published on

the 26th of October, there was an article with the heading, "We

must talk about facts and reasons." This article reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We, the people in Malaya, only recognise Singapore and

Malaya as our fatherland. So far there have been no Indonesian

troops in our fatherland (Singapore and Malaya) to attack the

Malayan people. Therefore, we do not think that at the present

moment, Malaya has been threatened with aggression by Indonesian

or North Borneo guerrillas. We have not been attacked by another

country or invaded by other people. How can we keep shouting

that other people have been invading us when their troops are

not here? How can we say that somebody has committed aggression

against us?'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are facts and reasons given by the Barisan Sosialis.

They say that since others have not sent any soldiers to attack

us, we should not condemn them. But now I would like the Barisan

Sosialis to reason with me and talk about truth. Has Indonesia

sent its troops to our territory, our nation, to land on

Pontian, Malacca and Labis? Are Pontian, Malacca and Labis part

of the territory of Malaya, or are they part of Indonesian

territory? Should we not condemn Indonesia? Do the Barisan

Sosialis now dare to condemn Indonesian aggression? Indonesia's

blatant aggression against Malaya is now very clear for all to

see. They are unwilling to condemn Indonesian aggression, on the

other hand, they oppose conscription to defend our country. I

would like to ask them: What kind of act is this? Is it a

patriotic act or a traitorous act? If the Barisan Members think

themselves to be real patriots and their Party a patriotic

Party, then I should say that their patriotic ideology is to

work for the overthrow of the elected Government by force and to

support Indonesian soldiers to raid the Borneo territories. They

regarded Indonesian invasion of Sabah and Sarawak as support and

obligation by the Indonesian people to the just war of

liberation waged by the people of Sabah and Sarawak. That is

their patriotic stand. They do not oppose Indonesian aggression

against Malaya, but they oppose conscription to defend Malaysia.

On the one hand, they encourage Indonesia to invade Malaysia,

and, on the other hand, they oppose conscription in our country.

This is another show of their patriotic act. Let me ask them:

what country do they love and to which country are they loyal?

Obviously it is Indonesia, and not Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Member for Bukit Merah said that Malaysia has been

isolated by Afro-Asian nations, and Malaysia has to ask for

military aid from Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.

This shows that he is stubborn and does not like to face naked

realities. Has he forgotten that the Security Council has

debated the question of Malaysia's accusation of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



Indonesia's aggression? Has he also forgotten that of the 9

countries which supported the draft resolution in support of

Malaysia two were African countries? Indonesia was in fact

isolated because it drew support only from two. And at the Cairo

conference of non-aligned nations, Indonesia wanted the conference to condemn Malaysia in its declaration, but was rejected.

Soekarno was so furious that he left the conference and refused

to sign the declaration. Has the Member for Bukit Merah not read

in the newspapers about the Indian Prime Minister, Mr Shastri's

support for Malaysia?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for requesting military assistance from the

United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand and not from

Afro-Asian countries is very simple. Afro-Asian countries are engaged

in their own internal development, and are not in a position to

provide us with material support. They can only give us moral

support. But in the face of naked aggression, moral support is

not enough. We need guns and soldiers to defend our country. In

fact, many emergent countries in Afro-Asia are in receipt of

foreign military aid to build up their defence strength. India,

Cambodia, Ghana, and even Indonesia are receiving foreign

military aid and no one has accused them of losing their in

dependence thereby.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facts have already proved that the Barisan claim of wanting

to defend Malaya and wanting to sacrifice their lives for Malaya

has all along been a falsehood. They oppose conscription because

they do not want the people of Singapore themselves to defend

their homeland. They want Indonesia to take over our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we cannot support the motion which attempts to sell out our

country. As our bounden duty to our country, we have to move an

amendment to the motion and ask the Central Government to train

our youths to prepare them to defend our integrity and

sovereignty.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

from yesterday until today the debate on our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



motion before this House moved by our Member here has been a

heated one. Members on the Government side have been defending

their position in regard to Malaysia. I do not like to reply to

every point raised by them in their speeches because whatever

they say are all stereotyped speeches, having come from the same

Party. It should be enough for me to deal with the points raised

by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government side did not speak on the motion, they

would feel embarrassed because they are members of the Party.

But whatever they have said today, we already heard yesterday.

And what we heard yesterday, we had already heard last year.

They are just repeating themselves. So it will be enough for me

to reply to and comment on what the Minister for Finance and the

Prime Minister have said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in summing up, they touched on our

argument that Malaysia has brought suffering and misery to the

people, thus causing the present unhealthy situation here. They

also mentioned that we have been collaborating with Indonesia.

If we were to talk about the confusion and Indonesian

confrontation, we can never end, and it is not possible to

arrive at a conclusion because we have to look into the causes

which have led to the present situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should know that without Malaysia, there would not be

this present state of affairs. There is no smoke without fire.

So since there is such a serious situation, we know that it must

have been caused by the formation of Malaysia. That is the

proper approach to the question. This is what we must first

know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has said that troops from Britain, New

Zealand and Australia are here to help us defend our country.

The Prime Minister has even the guts and the cheek to defend

British imperialists in this House. He has even claimed that the

British do not want war. If there is war, then they will lose

their interests. If it is so, then may I ask him why did the

British not grant Sabah and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



Sarawak independence, according to an agreement reached in 1963

which gave Singapore full internal self-government? 1 say let

these States be independent. Give them the power of

independence, and then allow the people of these territories to

decide for themselves whether or not they want to merge with

Malaysia. Why do the British not want to let the people of these

territories do so? Why should the British not allow the people

of these territories to be self-governing and so to decide for

themselves their political destiny? Why should there be

elections under the aegis of the British? Our present Government

is now under the full control of the British. In actual fact,

there is no internal autonomy at all. Why cannot the British

allow the people in these territories to be independent first?

This is the root cause of the crisis in Malaysia now. If any

political Party were to judge the present situation according to

this basis, then it would be fallacious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of North Borneo wanted independence so that they

could decide whether or not they wanted to merge with Malaysia.

That is why Party Rakyat in Brunei has the support of the

majority of the people there. They won the elections and are

also very popular. Why did the British not respect the

popularly-elected Government of Brunei'? Why did the British not respect

the will of the people of Brunei who had elected their own

Government and who had opted not to join Malaysia? Their wish

had been expressed constitutionally. This is the main reason for

the present situation in Malaysia. If we want to discuss this

issue, we must first understand this underlying cause. The

unilateral action taken by the British caused the present

trouble in North Borneo. The people there wanted to decide their

future political destiny by the system of one man one vote. The

people of North Borneo adopted this system and voted in favour

of independence. Why should the British Government not accede to

their wish which was constitutionally expressed? Why should the

P.A.P. now change their stand? But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>



the determination of the people of North Borneo in their

struggle will never change. They will never be as changeable as

the P.A.P. The refusal of the British to allow independence to

the people of North Borneo has given them no alternative but to

resort to force. All other constitutional means have been

closed. That is why there is now a military uprising. This is a

reasonable uprising, internationally speaking. If there had been

no suppression, there would have been no reaction by force from

the people. It is violence meeting violence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the present war in North Borneo has

come about through the circumstances that I have mentioned. Why

do the P.A.P. Government not mention the causes which I have

analysed with regard to the war in North Borneo? It is because

they are afraid to face past history. They are afraid to bring

out the true facts of the past and show them to the people of

Singapore and Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in Singapore, we wanted to have

self-government, but we were forced to go into Malaysia. In 1963,

according to our Constitution, Singapore had the right to send a

mission to England to have further constitutional talks. At the

time such constitutional talks could have been held. Why then

were we denied this opportunity'? Why did Britain refuse to

allow us this opportunity? The British rulers did not want us to

succeed in further constitutional talks for their own interest.

The Prime Minister has said that the British have very little

investment in North Borneo, and there is not much investment in

Singapore too. He says that Britain has most of its investments

in Malaya. But, Mr Deputy Speaker, one must not forget that

North Borneo is a rich country. Everybody knows that it produces

oil, petroleum, rubber and other tropical produce. You cannot

say that because North Borneo is not fully developed, it is a

poor country. You cannot say that Britain has little investment

there. You cannot say that Britain has very little interest in

Singapore. If you ask yourselves in what way Britain can protect

its economic interests in the whole of South-East Asia, you will

then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



realise the value of the British military bases in

Singapore. Are not the military bases in the interests of

Britain? Can they be in the interests of our people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Britain knows that the five territories

in this region are their last colonies in this part of the

world. If they are allowed to gain independence, then the people

will not allow the continued existence of British influence in

this region. That is why Britain, through its agents, took the

opportunity of combining the four territories into one political

unit, so that British interests can be entrusted to the people

in favour of Britain. That is why you can see that the Prime

Minister and the Minister for Finance dare to talk in defence of

British interests in this Chamber. They say unashamedly that

British troops are here in our own interests. This shows how

much trust Britain has placed in them. And how correctly such

trust has been placed in these people! They have been very

clever in combining these four territories into one political

entity. If any people say that we are still under colonial rule,

then Britain will say that we are already independent. They can

say, "What more do you want to talk about? Formerly you were a

small place. Now you are a bigger nation with 10 million people.

What more do you want to grumble about?" In this way, the

British are able to perpetuate their economic interests in this

region. I have to remind the P.A.P. that they should not think

that the British are really giving them all the powers. In fact,

the British are still behind them. The Back-benchers may not

realise this, but the Front-benchers know everything about the

whole scheme. Perhaps they are not willing to let the cat out of

the bag.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the whole situation at the present

moment is closely connected with North Borneo. The Prime

Minister says that, on the one hand, we want to chase away

British troops and, on the other hand, we refuse to serve in the

army. He says that there is inconsistency in our policy. We have

already said time and again that Malaysia has been formed by the

British to look after their own interests. That is why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



it has been formed against the wishes of the people. As far back

as 1961, the question of Malaysia was mentioned in Singapore. At

that time many people in Singapore were against Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng (Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Dr Fong Kim Heng):</b> I would like to

inform the Member that he has up to 8.06 p.m. if he wishes to

make full use of his time. If he does so, then a motion will

have to be moved to extend the time beyond 8 o'clock.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Deputy Speaker, I will try to finish my speech before 8

o'clock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When some people air their views against Malaysia, they are

gaoled by the Tunku and the P.A.P. Even the Afro-Asian countries

described Malaysia as a neo-colonial scheme in those days.

We were warned that we should not fall into the British trap.

Did you not hear of such views? Did you not take heed of the

warning given by the Afro-Asian nations? No. You just went on

your own way and, as a result, Malaysia was formed. Now they say

that we are contradicting ourselves by wanting to chase away

British troops and, at the same time, refusing to serve in the

army. I have to explain our stand here. In the first place we

know that British troops are based here not in our own

interests. I have already dealt with this matter. When we say

that we do not want to serve in the army, they say that by doing

this we are actually inviting Indonesian troops to come over

here. This is what the Prime Minister has suggested, and he has

questioned our motives. We op' pose the stationing of foreign

troops in Malaya. We have already stated our stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will talk about Malaya now. Before Malaysia British

troops were in Malaya. After Malaysia British troops are still

in Malaya. The same has been true in Singapore for the last one

hundred years or so. We do not want to serve in the army

because, in the first place, we want Malaysia to be scrapped and

we want the Borneo people to be independent. We want British

troops to withdraw from this area. We want the abolition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



of British bases too. Unless all this is done, we are not

prepared to take up arms. The P.A.P. Ministers say that there

are countries like Ceylon which have no hostile neighbours, and

that is why such countries do not require foreign troops to help

them. But they forget that countries like Ceylon are pursuing

the neutral policy of the Afro-Asian countries. If we adopt the

same policy, then the Afro-Asian countries will sympathise with

and support us. If we contend that foreign troops should be

withdrawn from our territory, then we will get the support of

the Afro-Asian countries. If we tell the world that we want to

stop aggression, then we will also get support from the

Afro-Asian countries, provided foreign troops are withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, far from doing all this, the Malaysian

Government is implementing a pro-Western policy. It is in

collusion with foreign powers to suppress the wishes of the

people. The Minister for Education has said just now that we

stated in our Party organ that in the event of aggression

against Malaya, our motherland, we would come out to defend it.

And yet he has accused us of not carrying out our promises. We

are now in Malaysia and not in Malaya. You cannot deny that

Malaya is part of Malaysia; you cannot deny that Indonesia is

against Malaysia. The confrontation is directed at Malaysia and

not at Malaya alone. You cannot say that Malaya is a separate

nation as distinct from Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister talks of Indian support for Malaysia. Now, it

is not strange that India should support Malaysia, because

Malaysia has openly supported India against China. So, one good

turn deserves another - the help is mutual and so is the support.

There is nothing strange about it. Mr Deputy Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to talk about the interests of the people of

Singapore, then you have to ask what good has Malaysia done for

the people of Singapore. There is tension and mounting

unemployment in the island. So, as responsible representatives

of the people, we have to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>



speak on their behalf; and speak against conscription, which is

opposed by our youths at large. As a Party of the people, we

have to speak with determination for their interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Back-benchers state that we have not changed our

stand all along. Yes, this is our loyalty and sincerity to the

people of Singapore. We have been consistent all the time. We

think that as long as Malaysia is not scrapped, the people of

Malaya and Singapore will not have any happiness and that so

long as Malaysia is in existence, there will be tension in

Malaysia. We feel that if Malaysia is not scrapped, then the

people in the five territories will not be able to live in

peace. Because of this contention, we shall not give up our

stand. We shall continue to fight for the interests of the

people against Malaysia and against conscription. This is our

attitude and stand. Of course, we cannot behave like other

political Parties which change their stand from time to time

according to which way the wind blows. No, we are not so

opportunistic as they are. But the P.A.P. is. It is so mutable

and opportunistic that it changes its policy from time to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the May 13th incident which was mentioned by the

Minister. This incident was fully exploited at that time by some

of the Ministers. Now they are condemning it because times have

changed and they have changed their stand. At one time they were

in co-operation with Fong Swee Suan, Lim Chin Siong and people

like them. They made use of the influence of these -



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Is the hon. Member talking about conscription or is he talking about

the P.A.P.?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member is quite relevant.

He may proceed. Time is short, so do not interrupt him, if

possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am trying to finish, but if

they want to challenge me to talk further, then the proceedings

will be protracted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For their interests, they co-operated with Lim Chin Siong and

they got into power. And after they had captured power, they

changed their stand to sell away the people. They went into

collusion with Britain. They went with the Tunku to have talks

with Britain and arrested people like Lim Chin Siong who were

anti-colonial fighters. At one time the Prime Minister begged

Lim Chin Siong to help him out of his difficulties. But now he

has changed. He himself has no influence, so he is making of

the influence of the Tunku and Britain to strengthen his own

position. While he is now in the Government, he thinks that by

making use of the Tunku, he may be able to go right into the

Federation Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Barisan Sosialis, which is as

unchangeable as ever, is still against Malaysia which was not

formed in accordance with the wishes of the people. Malaysia

was formed to look after the interests of the British. That is

why we will continue to go against Malaysia. Even if the

Alliance Government puts us all in prison, we will continue to

oppose Malaysia. This shows that our stand is always firm.
