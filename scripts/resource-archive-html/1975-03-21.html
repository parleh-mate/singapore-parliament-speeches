<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this subhead I wish to call for a re-statement of the policy on non-citizen female work

permit holders wanting to marry Singapore citizens  or,

to  be  fair to the opposite sex, the other way  round,

Singapore  citizens wanting to marry female non-citizen

work permit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



holders, in  making a re-statement of this  policy,  I

hope  the Minister can make special reference to  those

female  non-citizens  who are in  the  family  way  and

seeking  licence to marry. I realise that  this  policy

has been stated before, but it has been some time since

and  there  are a number of queries along  these  lines

arising  in  the various constituencies. A re-statement

of the policy will be beneficial.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, last year, I mentioned that the

National Stadium was as good as a `white elephant'. But

surprisingly  it  has  made a  tremendous  improvement.

Football  has been responsible for attracting  the  big

crowds.  At  this particular juncture I should  mention

that it is football alone that has brought in the crowd

to  fill  the stadium, sometimes to full capacity.  For

this,  I  must  compliment the Football Association  of

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>





The  officials and coaches have done a very  good  job.

The  Singapore  team has played great football  against

tremendous odds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me ask, is soccer the only game in Singapore?

What  is  the Singapore Sports Council doing to promote

the  other sports? Surely they are not resting  on  the

laurels  they have attained through football  alone  in

Singapore. To make matters worse, the SSC is trying  to

promote   inter-constituency  sports   without   proper

liaison with the community centres. As a result,  there

is  an  overlapping of activities. Something  is  wrong

somewhere.  This overlapping of activities  will  cause

further  confusion.  The SSC  was  granted  a  loan  of

$1,600,000,  and  I presume it will still  continue  to

receive  aid from Toto. What is being done  to  promote

sports with these funds? It is high time the SSC became

more  realistic and help to promote the  other  sports.

Singaporeans  are  keen sportsmen and sportswomen.  The

SSC  can  become a very useful organisation to  promote

sports in Singapore. Unfortunately, it appears that  it

is  not  doing a very good job in promoting  sports  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come back to the National Stadium. Although

the  stadium has become "alive", the grounds around the

stadium  require some attention. Sir, not only  is  the

lighting very poor, but many places in the grounds  are

very uneven. There are insufficient footpaths, and even

then  these  are criss-crossed with so many  drains  of

various  sizes that they become a hazard and  accidents

are  likely  to  occur. In fact,  many  accidents  have

occurred when people cross these drains. When  a  large

crowd moves, people are not aware of obstacles in their

path. Even the doctors in the hospitals are aware  that

accidents occurring on the grounds around the  National

Stadium are very common.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a very recent case in which a person, after

watching   a   football  game,  had  an  accident   and

dislocated  his  arm.  It was not  easy  to  summon  an

ambulance. Even the police who were on duty controlling

the traffic did not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



have   a   walkie   talkie  to  summon  an   ambulance.

Fortunately, this person was with his manager who later

drove him to the hospital. Such is the state of affairs

at the stadium.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something must be done to remedy this situation. The

Minister may reply that this matter does not come under

his  jurisdiction. But I would suggest to him  that  he

should liaise with the Minister for the Environment  to

cover up these dangerous drains and to install adequate

lighting outside the stadium.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of the security officials of the National

Stadium  should undergo a course on human relations  so

that  they can be polite and helpful to the people  who

go  to the National Stadium. I have received complaints

of  rudeness  and  discourtesy  on  the  part  of  some

officials  towards members of the public.  Furthermore,

those  ticket  collectors at  the  gate  do  not  issue

counterfoils.  As  a  result,  many  people  enter  the

stadium    without    tickets,   particularly    during

interesting  matches,  and  there  are  no   means   of

detecting  them,  because a counterfoil  has  not  been

given  to a person who has bought a ticket. May  I  ask

how  do  these  people  get into  the  stadium  without

tickets?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any major sports game at the National Stadium the

crowds  go  there early, sometimes two or  three  hours

before  the  game  starts. Surely the Singapore  Sports

Council can think of something to entertain the  crowd,

perhaps  a display of bands, some track events or  some

minor games to entertain the crowd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year I mentioned that the grounds of the

National Stadium were like a fish pond. And this year I

noticed  that there is a signboard outside the  Stadium

at  the  east  side  saying  "No  fishing  or  swimming

allowed".  I presume someone had been found fishing  or

swimming there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also notice that the Stadium authorities used a

primitive  method of drain-fling water from the  field.

To  quote an instance, during the football game between

Singapore  and China, where more than 50,000 spectators

were present, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



authorities used towels and blankets to drain off water

before a very large crowd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know why there were only 40

spectators as against 65 officials during the finals of

the  Inter-constituency  Badminton  Tournament  at  the

Badminton  hail last year. I hope the Singapore  Sports

Council  could generate more interest in sports instead

of providing only service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Farrer Park field is used practically everyday

for  football  games.  Many of our  soccer  stars  were

discovered   from   games   played   at   this   field.

Unfortunately,  the  ground  at  this  place  is  badly

maintained. Even with a light rain, the ground  becomes

sodden  with  pools  of water here and  there,  thereby

spoiling  the games played there. The field is situated

in an ideal place, but unfortunately the maintenance is

poor. Toto could help here to remedy the condition.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may `I first reply to the Member for

Serangoon Gardens. There is a restriction in respect of

non-citizens  holding work permits :marrying  Singapore

citizens: This is not found in- our marriage policy but

in the work permit policy. This work permit policy came

into  effect on 1st July. 1973. Under this policy  work

permit  holders must first obtain the approval  of  the

Commissioner for Employment before contracting marriage

with  Singapore citizens. A condition is stipulated  in

all  work  permits that a work permit is  automatically

forfeited  if the holder, having less than five  years'

continuous employment in Singapore, marries a Singapore

citizen  without the prior approval of the Commissioner

for  Employment This provision cannot be evaded by  the

work  permit holder .giving up the work permit and then

contracting  marriage  with  a  Singapore  citizen   in

another country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, a non-citizen female work permit holder who

wishes  to  marry, a Singapore citizen  will  have  to

obtain the prior



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>



approval of the Commissioner for Employment. Where  one

of  the parties to such a marriage is below the age  of

18  years,  then a special licence must be obtained  as

required under the Women's Charter. For this, the  same

criteria  apply  to  all  applicants  irrespective   of

whether  they  are  work  permit  holders  or  not.  We

normally  consider whether the general welfare  of  the

girl will be enhanced by the marriage. We also consider

the   maturity  of  the  couples  and  their  financial

position.   Applications  for  special   licences   are

normally rejected if the couples show no genuine desire

for  marriage or are pressurised by parents,  guardians

or   relatives  to  marry.  We  will  also  reject  the

applications for special marriage licences  if  one  or

both  parties to a marriage knowingly flout  our  laws.

Pregnancy of the girl is one of the considerations, but

certainly  not  the  overriding consideration  for  the

granting   of  special  licences,  though  we  normally

expedite  such cases. The Member for Serangoon  Gardens

can  rest  assured that my Ministry takes a sympathetic

view  of  cases  of  genuine hardship,  either  due  to

pregnancy  or  to  family circumstances,  and  in  many

instances the Social Welfare Department goes out of the

way  to  provide  assistance  to  couples  who  are  in

difficulty.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson made criticisms on the

National  Stadium.  I have this to say.  The  Singapore

Sports Council is not, promoting only football. It  has

given  it  proper emphasis as it is only football  that

will  draw  crowds  to the National Stadium.  No  other

sport  can  pack the National Stadium. This also  helps

the  SSC to earn revenue, besides maximising the  usage

of  the  National Stadium. The SSC has assisted in  the

promotion of a number of other sports by way of  free

usage  of  facilities for training, organisation-,  of

courses  for  coaches and officials, training  schemes

and  instructional lessons. To name  a  few,  they  arc

basketball, sepak takraw, swimming, waterpolo, netball,

badminton, lawn tennis, and athletics.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inter-constituency sports are being promoted by the

SSC  while  intra constituency games (between community

centres) are, at present, being mainly organised by the

People's  Association.  There  is  no  overlapping   or

confusion,  as  there  is very close  coordination  and

cooperation   between   the  SSC   and   the   People's

Association.  The preparation of the Inter-Constituency

Tournament  Calendar is made available to the  People's

Association   which   is  also   represented   in   the

organisation   of   every   inter-constituency   sports

competition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loan of $1.6 million which the SSC received from

Government   is   being  utilised  for  the   following

projects:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to upgrade sports facilities with a view to

maximising usage;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to landscape and develop certain areas at the

National Stadium Complex;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to settle the fees due to Phase 11 Consultants;

and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to pay to Government its share of renovation and

construction  of the car parks at the National  Stadium

Complex for the Park and Ride Scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SSC has the responsibility of upgrading existing

facilities and developing new facilities. For all  such

capital  expenditure, loans and not grants are approved

by Treasury.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue from Toto does not go directly to the

SSC.  The  Government,  however,  after  examining  the

budget of the SSC and offsetting it against anticipated

revenue, makes up the deficit with a direct grant which

includes a donation from Toto.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Situated between the National Stadium and Nicoll

Highway  is  a  parcel of land which is  undulating  in

places.  This  will  be  developed  by  the  Parks  and

Recreation  Division of the PWD into  a  park  complete

with  lighting and footpaths. The SSC will develop,  in

conjunction with the Parks and Recreation Division, the

entire  area including the Sports Garden at  the  East.

Entrance  of  the National Stadium into a  recreational

area.  Also included will be an ornamental pond  and  a

proposed food centre.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SSC will look into the question of lighting up

the area referred to, in conjunction with the Parks and

Recreation  Division, when the area has been  developed

into a park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who fall into drains are those who have

tried to take short-cuts and who are careless. Quite  a

number  of them have even damaged plants and torn  down

chain-link  fences  in order to take short-cuts  across

the   area.  There  are  sufficient  open  spaces   and

footpaths  for  people to walk. The tiny drains  within

the  Stadium grounds do not pose a danger. In any case,

the  SSC will look into this problem more closely  and,

if   there   are  drains  which  need  to  be  covered,

appropriate action will be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The security guards as well as the staff of the SSC

have  always been told to be polite and courteous  when

dealing  with  members  of the  public.  They  will  be

reminded  again of the importance of public  relations.

The  SSC always welcome complaints of discourtesy  from

members of the public and will examine these complaints

impartially.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For football matches where admission charges are'

levied  at  the National Stadium, entry  is  either  by

tickets  or  by  turnstiles for which  no  tickets  are

issued.  When  a  capacity crowd is expected,  pre-game

sales of tickets are carried out. For all tickets sold,

counter-foils are issued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Band music and performances have been and will

continue  to  be provided to entertain the  spectators.

The  organisation of additional activities to entertain

the  crowd will be looked into by the SSC. The  Stadium

gates  open three hours before each game. Usually,  the

more  enthusiastic  spectators may come  in  about  two

hours  earlier before the scheduled time of  play,  and

their purpose is to secure the best seats for the game.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The field at Farrer Park has no underground drainage.

It  is  also subjected to constant flooding  as  it  is

lower  than  the roads surrounding it. Every  time  the

Farrer  Park field is flooded, the top soil  is  washed

away and, moreover, the field

is  heavily used every day. All this accounts  for  its

poor  condition. The cost of raising the level  of  the

field  and  the  provision of  an  underground  subsoil

drainage  is prohibitive. So I am afraid the field  has

to be left as it is for the time being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also referred to the signboard outside the

Stadium-"No fishing or swimming is allowed". He was not

aware  that  he was, in fact, looking at an  ornamental

pond  in  its embryonic stage of development. This  has

been  in-eluded as one of the development projects  for

the new financial year. The Ministry of the Environment

and   the   PWD  are  now  finalising  plans  for   the

development  of  this pond to blend with  an  aesthetic

landscaped area. In order to prevent mosquito  breeding

in   this  pond,  fishes  are  reared  there,  and  the

signboard is to ensure that the fishes can be  left  in

peace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member further referred to the football match

against China when it was necessary to drain off  water

before  the commencement of the match. Pumps cannot  be

used  when there is no more than 1½ inches of  water

on  the ground. The Sports Council only use pumps  when

the  water level is higher, at about 4½ inches.  The

officials  should,  in  fact, be  commended  for  their

keenness  and  initiative  in  trying  to  improve  the

condition of the ground before the match.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finals of the inter-constituency badminton

tournament last year was held at the SBA Hall  and  not

at  the  Gay  World Badminton Stadium.  Obviously,  the

Member  for  Anson was not there. This  tournament  was

organised  by  the Singapore Badminton Association  and

not  the SSC. Admittedly, at this tournament there were

not  many  spectators, but there were  definitely  more

than  40 spectators present. Badminton nowadays appears

to  have  lost  its  glamour because even  at  national

championships  organised by the SBA, spectator  support

has been disappointing. For the tournament in question,

more than 6,000 invitation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



cards had been issued to each constituency  to

encourage  them  to  witness the  finals  and  to  give

support  to  the tournament. The finalists  were  given

extra  invitation  cards as it was expected  that  they

would  bring in their supporters to cheer them  on.  It

would  have been quite easy to fill the SBA  Hall  with

"conscripted" spectators, but this is the  wrong  thing

to   do.  It  is  better  to  have  fewer  genuine  and

interested  spectators  than  to  have  unwilling   and

disinterested spectators. The solution to this  problem

lies in reviving badminton as a sport for the masses. A

long-term  plan will have to be worked out by  the  SBA

with the assistance of the Singapore Sports Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Minister for Social Affairs said that I was

not  present  at  the  finals of the inter-constituency

badminton tournament. It is not possible for me  to  be

present at every sports event to see what is happening.

It  is only when I receive a complaint that I bring  up

the  matter in this House. This is the proper place for

me  to bring up these matters. If the Minister wants me

to  be  present at every sports event to  see  what  is

happening, then I would not have time for other work.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, I agree with the Member. I thought that, since

he  has  made this complaint, he could have been there.

$10 in respect of subhead ACA 1111*.



(*The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Cheong Yuen Chee and Ho Kah Leong).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is believed that the Registry of Cooperative

Societies  is  being reorganised into  the  Cooperative

Development Department. This is indeed a good move.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>



Can the Minister elaborate on the functions of this new

proposed Cooperative Development Department?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently two International Labour Organisation

experts  have  made recommendations to  strengthen  the

cooperative movement in Singapore. May I know what  are

the  recommendations they have made, and how would they

affect  the  state of our present societies?  I  wonder

whether  non-citizens are allowed  to  hold  office  in

these  recommendations. I would also like to  know  how

many societies are in existence at the moment, and  how

many are really active.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, there were proposals by some societies

to  engage  in  multi-purpose cooperative societies  in

order  to  fight inflation. How far has this  programme

been  successful,  and  how many  societies  have  been

converted into multi-purpose cooperative societies?



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Social Affairs, I must

say,  was  quite  aware  of  the  shortcomings  of  the

Registry of Cooperative Societies. It is to the  credit

of the Ministry that an effort was made to rectify this

deficiency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Ministry did was to ask for guidance and

consultation  in  the form of two International  Labour

Organisation experts. With the wealth of their combined

experience and expertise, the two ILO experts made some

rather drastic recommendations on the reorganisation of

the Registry of Cooperative Societies itself and on the

reorganisation   of   the   cooperative   movement   in

Singapore. One of these recommendations is the proposal

to  form an Apex Council to supervise and regulate  the

functions  of  the  various  cooperative  societies  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what has given me cause for concern is the

announcement by the Ministry of the total acceptance of

the  recommendations of the two ILO experts who, I must

acknowledge,  have  spent several months  in  Singapore

before  drawing up their comprehensive recommendations.

I  am not sure that it is desirable for the Ministry to

accept every single bit of the recommendations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>



of the ILO experts. For one thing, I regret to say that

the  staff of the Registry of Cooperative Societies  in

the  Ministry, due to the rather high turnover of staff

in  that  particular  department,  cannot  be  said  to

possess   in-depth  knowledge  of  cooperative  society

affairs in the Republic as to be in a position to  make

critical  comment  in relation to such recommendations.

For   another  thing,  the  concept  and  practice   of

cooperative societies in other parts of the  world  may

not   be   introduced  into  Singapore  without   first

undergoing some form of suitable adjustment.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Members of this House may be aware, the trade

union movement in Singapore, which is comparable  as  a

social  institution  to  the  cooperative  movement  in

Singapore, has prided itself on its refusal  to  accept

unquestioningly  the  concept  and  practice  of  trade

unionism  as  developed in other parts  of  the  world,

particularly  in  the industrialised countries  of  the

West.  The trade unions in Singapore believe that  they

must  develop their own mode and style of operation  in

harmony    with    the   socio-economic   circumstances

prevailing in Singapore. It is also a belief, if I  may

say so, which the Government has shared and supported.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the same consideration should also apply to the

development   of  the  cooperative  movement   in   the

Republic. It is true that the concept and the  practice

of  cooperative societies in other parts of  the  world

are  mostly valid in the Republic. To that extent,  the

recommendations of the ILO experts may be accepted  and

translated  into future reenactment of the  Cooperative

Societies  Act,  so as to improve the  quality  of  the

cooperative movement in the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time certain aspects of cooperative

affairs  in  Singapore  did  not  seem  to  have   been

considered.   For   instance,  the  membership   of   a

cooperative  society is presently confined  to  natural

persons  or  other cooperative societies.  If  a  trade

union  desires to participate in a cooperative  society

the  permission of the Minister has to be obtained  and

published by notification in the Government Gazette.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am of the view that restrictive participation

of  a  trade  union  in the affairs  of  a  cooperative

society  is  neither necessary nor practical.  For  one

thing, it has been forgotten that cooperative societies

in other parts of the world first developed in the form

of  producers'  cooperatives, whose members  are  small

farmers or small businessmen. Such members usually have

considerable   surplus  funds   at   their   individual

disposal.  The cooperative societies in Singapore  have

been,  until  recently,  mainly  consumer  cooperatives

whose  members  are  usually workers  with  hardly  any

surplus  funds at their disposal. It is not  surprising

that,  prior to the participation of the NTUC and other

institutions   in   the   cooperative   movement,   the

cooperative  societies in Singapore  usually  take  the

form of thrift and loan societies with more emphasis on

loans  than  on savings. The trade unions in Singapore,

therefore, can assist in the further development of the

cooperative movement in the Republic. The trade unions,

by  reason  of  the fact that they are  precluded  from

giving  loans to members, have been able  to  build  up

surplus  funds which can be invested in the cooperative

movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is desirable that a trade union should be allowed

to  participate in the affairs of cooperative societies

without having to seek the permission , of the Minister

each  time it wishes to do so. The concept of  a  rigid

and  strict separation between cooperative movement and

trade  union  movement  should be  discarded  as  being

impractical.  If  the  Ministry  is  worried  that  the

unrestrictive  participation by a trade  union  in  the

affairs of a cooperative society may lead to abuse,  it

should  be  noted that the membership, the shareholding

and  the  control  of  a cooperative  society  are  not

synonymous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The control of a cooperative society can be strictly

supervised and regulated by the Registry of Cooperative

Societies without in any way restricting the right of a

trade union to participate in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



affairs of the cooperative societies. I may also  state

that   the   Budget  estimates  for  the  Registry   of

Cooperative  Societies  for  11975  does  not  seem  to

indicate  any drastic change in the staffing  position.

With the range of business conducted by the cooperative

societies becoming more complex and esoteric,  such  as

housing,   supermarkets,   transport,   insurance   and

possibly  banking, it may be necessary to beef  up  the

Registry  with more qualified and competent  staff  not

only to supervise but also to advise the management  of

the various cooperative societies in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like first to congratulate

the Minister for converting his Registry of Cooperative

Societies  into the Cooperative Development  Department

with   a   view  to  coordinating  and  expanding   the

cooperative movement in Singapore. This is commendable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must remind the Minister not to forget

another section of our population which also needs  the

help  of  his  Ministry to form cooperative  societies.

This  section is none other than the farming community.

In  the  past  the farmers tried to form all  sorts  of

cooperative  societies,  but most  of  these  societies

ceased  to  function after a few years, due  mainly  to

poor  management. Now that the Ministry has established

the   Cooperative  Development  Department,  can   this

Department pay special attention to help our farmers to

organise  a Farmers' Multi-purpose Cooperative Society,

with emphasis on production and the marketing side?  If

this cooperative society is formed, I believe that  not

only  the  farmers  themselves  will  benefit  but  the

consumers  as a whole will also benefit. The reason  is

obvious. If the farm produce can be passed on from  the

farmers direct to' the consumers, without having to  go

through  the middlemen, prices will be greatly reduced.

So  it  `is in the interest of both the farmer and  the

consumer, if   an  effective  Farmers'   Multipurpose

Cooperative Society is formed. In this respect I  would

urge  the  Minister  to give serious  thought  to  this

matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the various

hon.  Members who endorse the idea of reorganising  the

Registry  of  Cooperative Societies into a  Cooperative

Development Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Registry of Cooperative Societies,

transferred to my Ministry from the Primary  Production

Department,   is   only  equipped  to  handle   routine

administrative  work such as inspection  and  audit  of

accounts    of   societies,   enquiries,   arbitration,

liquidation and the registration and de-registration of

societies.  The new Cooperative Development  Department

will   be   the   Government  machinery  to   undertake

promotional and educational work

in the cooperative field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cooperative movement had been in the doldrums for

many  years.  Only in recent years, there  has  been  a

spurt in the growth of the movement with the setting up

of the various NTUC cooperatives and the development of

consumer  cooperatives and multi-purpose  cooperatives.

In   the   context   of  the  changing   socio-economic

conditions in Singapore, cooperative societies, rightly

conceived   and  efficiently  managed,  can   play   an

important  part in improving the economic  and  social,

positions   of   persons  of  limited   resources   and

opportunities.  We  have now 80 registered  cooperative

societies with a total membership of 74,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven of these societies are inactive Regarding multi-purpose societies, there are only two, but there are 11

other  societies which are providing auxiliary consumer

services  to their members in addition to their  normal

activities.  These  societies,  in  addition   to   the

consumer'    activities   of   the   NTUC   cooperative

supermarkets  and  consumer clubs, have  helped  in  no

small measure in combating inflation in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Anson and Toa Payoh will recall that

I  mentioned  to  the House during the last Budget

debate  that  my Ministry would seek the  services  of

experts to strengthen the cooperative movement  and  to

re-draft  the cooperative legislation. Since  then,  my

Ministry has appointed an ad hoc committee to study the

cooperative movement and to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



develop  a  Framework  for cooperative  development  in

Singapore.  The  ad hoc committee was assisted  by  two

experts,  Dr  J, von Muralt, ILO Cooperative  Technical

Officer, ,and Professor Hans H. Munkner, 1LO expert  on

cooperative legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Muralt recommended the reorganisation of the

Registry  of  Cooperative Societies into a  Cooperative

Development  Department  and  the  setting  up   of   a

cooperative apex organisation. He also recommended  the

diversification  of  cooperative  activities  and   the

establishment  of  a  Cooperative Education  Fund,  the

setting  up of a Cooperative Training Institute  and  a

programme   of  Cooperative  Education  and   Training.

Similar  recommendations are  also  made  by  Professor

Munkner  who made other recommendations, including  the

complete revision of the Cooperative Societies Act, the

creation of a central audit system, the setting up of a

Cooperative  Training  Centre  and  a  new  system   of

provisional  registration of  societies.  Both  experts

have  worked  closely with leaders of  the  cooperative

movement and NTUC.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based ,on the Framework for Co, operative

development,   the  Ministry  has   worked,   out   the

requirements   to,  be  incorporated   into   the   new

cooperative legislation. At present, Professor  Munkner

together  with legal officers of the Attorney-General's

Chambers  are  preparing the new Cooperative  Societies

Bill.  It  is  expected that the  draft  Bill  will  be

finalised in the middle of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new cooperative legislation will provide a sound

legal  framework  for  the development  of  cooperative

societies   in   Singapore.  It  will   encourage   the

consolidation   and  diversification   of   cooperative

activities  and  the  establishment  of  an  integrated

.system of primary societies, secondary societies,  and

an apex organisation. `



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental change in the new Act is to ensure

that  the  movement  will grow by  giving  emphasis  to

cooperative  development. This is  done  in  two  ways.

Firstly,  the new Cooperative Develop, ment  Department

will help to monitor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>



the  growth  of the movement and foster the development

of  cooperative  societies by  providing  guidance  and

advice as well as training for cooperative officials in

cooperative  subjects such as management of cooperative

societies, marketing, financial administration, and  so

on. The Department will have trained staff to undertake

this  work.  Secondly,  an apex  organisation  will  be

formed to provide the leadership to the movement so  as

to encourage cooperative societies to work closely with

one another to seek improvements through the pooling of

ideas, resources and manpower.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Act will also, among other things, provide

for the establishment of a Central Cooperative Fund  to

finance  centralised services for the  benefit  of  all

cooperatives in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson wanted to know whether non-citizens could be allowed to hold office. It is the

intention  that  non-citizens should be  debarred  from

serving  in  the  management committees of  cooperative

societies unless the prior approval of the Minister  is

obtained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Member for Jurong, the formation of a

farmers'  cooperative is not entirely a  new  idea.  In

fact, when cooperative societies were under the Primary

Production  Department, there were  moves  to  organise

farmers on a cooperative basis. It was found that there

were  inherent difficulties in doing so due to lack  of

interest  among members, poor financial position,  weak

leadership and the resettlement of farmers as a  result

of   rapid   urbanisation.   The   Primary   Production

Department, in fact, has been giving direct  assistance

to  the  farmers instead of encouraging the development

of farmers' cooperatives for which management expertise

is  difficult to develop. Past experiences  have  shown

that  farmers'  cooperatives do not  fare  well.  Since

1960,  nine societies have been de-registered  and  two

have been dormant for some time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, agricultural cooperatives have not been very

successful.  Recently, however,  the  Teachers'  Multi-purpose Co, operative Society has sponsored the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>



formation  of a new Livestock and Agricultural  Farming

Cooperative  Society, which may be the beginning  of  a

new  period  of  modern  agricultural  cooperation   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would assure the Member for Jurong that

should there be a need for farmers to form cooperatives

in   the   future,  the  new  Cooperative   Development

Department would be most happy and willing to look into

the  feasibility  of forming farmers'  cooperatives  in

consultation with the Primary Production Department and

the  Farmers' Association. The Department will  provide

all  the  necessary assistance and guidance to  farmers

for such purposes.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's explanation, I beg

leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampung Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head R be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead BCA 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to congratulate the Minister for Social

Affairs  on his efforts to get the Government to  agree

to  a  scheme  to deduct 50 cents per month  from  each

Muslim   on  a  voluntary  basis  through  the  Central

Provident Fund towards the Mosque Building Fund  to  be

organised  by the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura  (MUIS).

The  idea  of building mosques in satellite  towns  was

mooted many years ago, but the donations collected from

Muslim  donors, the majority of whom were wage  earners

were  made, inadequate for the purpose. Now,  with  the

cooperation  of Government, I think it  should  not  be

difficult  to overcome the other problems as well,  for

example,  compliance with the need for building  plans.

Not only in respect of the construction of mosques but,

in  fact, in any other project, the primary question is

the availability of funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the assistance of the Government forthcoming,

the  idea  to  deduct a small sum on a voluntary  basis

from the salaries of Muslim workers has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



welcomed  by  local Muslims. This will greatly  relieve

the  burden of the Mosque Building Committees.  What  I

wish to suggest to the Minister is that upon completion

of the construction of the mosques, it would be wise to

continue with the deductions for those who wish  to  do

so.  The reason is that upon completion of the mosques,

there  are  recurrent expenditures to be met,  such  as

repairs   and   renovation;  payment  of   PUB   bills,

remuneration  for  the imams and  officials  and  other

miscellaneous   expenditure   which   require    funds.

Otherwise, the mosques which would have been  built  at

very high costs, would fall into a state of neglect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, there is the question of welfare of the

Muslim community, for which assistance is needed in the

matter   of   raising  money  to  finance   awards   of

scholarships and bursaries. In the past, in addition to

Government assistance in the form of special  bursaries

for the Malays, there were voluntary organisations like

the LBKM which collected funds by organising flag days,

to   assist  poor  students.  These  bodies  have   now

coordinated  their efforts with the MUIS. Therefore,  I

think these voluntary bodies need no longer continue to

function because MUIS, with Government assistance,  can

now  collect the funds through the CPF, and the  awards

of  scholarships and bursaries can be effected  through

the  Public  Service Commission to avoid allegation  of

favouritism in such awards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few years ago the Minister made a promise in

this  House, but it has not as yet been fulfilled. This

is  in  regard to haj pilgrims from Singapore. He  said

that they would be provided with medical facilities and

their  welfare  would  be looked  after  by  a  welfare

officer during their sojourn in Mecca and Medina.  Sir,

I  would like to know whether the Minister will  fulfil

his  promise  this year or whether he will  merely  put

this matter in his KIV file.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Kampung  Kembangan referred to the scheme of collecting

50 cents from each Muslim per month through the CPF for

the Mosque



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



Building  Fund and asked whether this scheme  could  be

extended  for  other purposes which would  benefit  the

Muslim community in Singapore. It is necessary to  make

it  clear  that  this  scheme as  well  as  the  Mosque

Building  Fund  are introduced for a specific  purpose,

and that is, to raise sufficient money for the building

of  a  mosque in each new town. The scheme as it stands

is  to  build  four new mosques, each  varying  between

$500,000  and  $800,000 in cost, in Toa Payoh,  Jurong,

Queenstown  and  Chai Chee in the course  of  the  next

three  to eight years. Two other mosques will  also  be

built  eventually in Woodlands or Ama  Keng  and  Telok

Blangah or Pasir Panjang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will review the situation after the

completion  of  these six mosques to find  out  whether

there  is  a  need  for this scheme to  continue.  But,

first,  let us collect the money to enable us to  build

all the six mosques.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share with the Member for Kampung Kembangan his

concern  for  the welfare of Singapore pilgrims  during

their  pilgrimage to Mecca. I have, in fact, asked  the

Muslim  Religious  Council to look  into  this  problem

closely to ensure that our Singapore pilgrims are  well

looked  after  in  Saudi Arabia. For  this  purpose,  a

Pilgrimage Committee was set up by the Council. At  the

same  time,  the Administration of Muslim  Law  Act  is

being   revised   to   place  the  responsibility   for

pilgrimage  on  the  Council.  Even  before  the  legal

framework for implementing various decisions to improve

the  arrangements for pilgrimage of Singapore  Muslims,

the Council has implemented a number of measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore pilgrims now travel with pilgrimage passes

issued  by  the  Pilgrim  Officer  of  Singapore.   The

Pilgrim's  Fund,  Malaysia,  which  has  a  network  of

welfare   and  medical  facilities  in  Saudi   Arabia,

recognise these passes and extend to Singapore  holders

of  these  passes its medical and welfare  services  at

Saudi Arabia. Officials of the Council have checked  on

this  at Saudi Arabia and found that these arrangements

are  very  satisfactory. They have  reported  that  our

pilgrims enjoyed excellent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



health  services  provided  by  the  Malaysian  Medical

Mission.   They   received  prompt  medical   attention

whenever and wherever medical care was required. I have

said  this before in Parliament, and I still am of  the

view,  that  since  the  arrangements  made  with   the

Pilgrim's  Fund,  Malaysia,  to  provide  medical   and

welfare  services  to  our pilgrims  are  satisfactory,

there  is  no  necessity to set up our own medical  and

welfare missions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council is also looking into the activities of

pilgrim  brokers  to  ensure  that  they  provide  good

service  to Singapore pilgrims. As a start, the Council

has  recommended  to the Ministry that pilgrim  brokers

licences  should only be granted to those  who  have  a

good  record of service. Those who are just  interested

in making money and who make empty promises to pilgrims

will   not   be  granted  licences.  The   Council   is

considering  appointing a few reliable pilgrim  brokers

in  Mecca  specially to look after Singapore  pilgrims.

This  arrangement  will ensure that Singapore  pilgrims

will   not  be  neglected  by  brokers  who  are   only

interested in making money and are not really  prepared

to render good service in Mecca, Medina and Jeddah.

country,  why  should  we rely on  another  country  to

this service?



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, there has already been cooperation between the

Singapore and Malaysian Governments on the question  of

looking  after  the  welfare of Singapore  pilgrims  in

Jeddah.  In  fact,  the Singapore  Government  gives  a

contribution  to  the Pilgrim's Fund,  Malaysia,  every

year to look after our pilgrims in Saudi Arabia.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, I think the contribution for last year was over

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whenever the subject of Legal Aid Bureau comes

up for discussion, the only question that is brought up

is  the  delay in the handling of cases that have  been

referred to the Bureau. Sometimes it takes about one to

two years to deal with a simple case. Why is there such

a  delay?  Probably  the  Bureau  is  understaffed  and

overworked. It is useless to discuss year in  and  year

out the same complaint, without any action being taken.

Can something be done to improve the situation, such as

increasing the number of staff?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also observed that the staff at the counters

are unable to assist the public in any way if there  is

no  written information to trace the case, even if  the

person,  who  had previously been there,  was  able  to

recall the nature of the case. This is evidence to show

that  so  many cases have been referred to  the  Bureau

that  the  staff are unable to recollect and trace  any

case even after a short duration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is believed that the Registry Section of the

Bureau is unable to cope with the demand for attention.

Unless  a  numbered card is produced, thus  leading  to

inconvenience to the public, one is not able to get any

attention



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>



thereby  causing the case to be delayed. Can  something

be  done  also to improve the function of the  Registry

and  to instruct the staff to be polite, courteous  and

helpful to the poor and also the illiterate people  who

are   forced   to  come  to  this  Bureau  .for   legal

assistance?



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while I agree with the Member for

Anson that the Legal Aid Bureau is in critical need  of

more  staff,  I  cannot agree with the  statement  that

there  is  undue  delay on the part of  the  Bureau  in

dealing  with the cases. Legal cases are  not  all  the

same.  Some  are  simple cases  which  can  be  settled

straightaway.  Others take a longer time  depending  on

their  complexity  and  the legal  processes  involved.

Cases that require court proceedings normally take some

tithe  to resolve. Take the example of a person seeking

aid  to  claim  damages  for injuries  sustained  in  a

traffic  accident.  In such cases, the  Bureau  has  to

apply   for   police  reports,  medical   reports   and

particulars  of vehicles involved from the Registry  of

Vehicles. The Police would have to investigate the more

serious  accidents and inform the Bureau of the results

of  their investigations. More often than not, there is

a  need  for  applicants  to  undergo  further  medical

examinations. The question of liability would  have  to

be  discussed  and  correspondence  entered  into  with

insurance  companies or their solicitors.  Instructions

have  to  be  obtained from applicants  in  respect  of

letters received, and suitable replies sent. Should  an

offer  be  made  subsequently, this would  have  to  be

communicated  to  the applicants and, more  often  than

not,  the  quantum of damages would be the  subject  of

negotiations  until  a settlement  is  reached  to  the

satisfaction  of  the applicants. Should  a  settlement

fail to materialise, court proceedings would have to be

instituted. Court documents would have to be  prepared,

filed  and served. Thereafter, a date would have to  be

fixed  by  the Court for the hearing of the  cases  All

these take a great deal of time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am more concerned about the staffing position of

the  Legal  Aid  Bureau. As the Bureau is  rendering  a

useful  social  service  for the  poor,  it  must  have

adequate  staff  to carry Out its work  satisfactorily.

The  Ministry  will continue to press for the  required

posts  to ensure that the Bureau functions effectively.

It  is simply up to the Ministry of Finance to consider

the  requirements of the Legal Aid Bureau in  terms  of

funds,  resources and manpower and accord  priority  to

them in relation to proposals in other fields.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the Member's comment on the Registry

Section,  action has already been taken to improve  the

situation.  A  Record Keeper/Paper  Searcher  has  been

posted to the Bureau.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bureau has a system of issuing interview cards

similar  to  what the Member for Anson  suggested.  The

receipt  issued to applicants on payment  of  $  1  for

registration also contains particulars of the applicant

and  the  file  reference. Applicants are  expected  to

bring  these  documents whenever  they  convey  to  the

Bureau.  Difficulty in tracing case files  only  arises

when  the  applicants either do not bring or forget  to

bring their receipts or the interview cards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am satisfied that the staff of the Registry Section

of  the Bureau have been efficient. There have been  no

complaints of impoliteness or discourtesy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Social Welfare Department has done quite a

lot for the benefit of the people. It has, for example,

been giving public assistance to the poor, set up homes

for  the  aged to look after the old and the destitute,

set  up  creches to look after children. All these  are

very   commendable  moves  and  is  evidence   of   the

Government's  desire  to help the people.  However,  it

seems that facilities in the two homes for the aged are

not   adequate.  They  are  filled  to  capacity,   and

prospective occupants are not able to find a  place  or

have  to  wait for a long time before they  can  get  a

place.  I  would  like to ask the Minister  whether  he

would consider setting up another home for the aged  to

look after the old and destitute people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to ask is whether the

Minister would consider setting up a home to look after

those  who  are  disabled  so  that  these  unfortunate

victims can be looked after by the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no long waiting list for

admission into the Social Welfare Department's Home for

the  Aged at Woodlands. There are only 18 aged  persons

awaiting   admission   into  this   Home,   and   their

applications have been proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are a number of aged persons awaiting

admission into the voluntary homes for the aged,  there

is  no  lack  of  initiative and effort  to  meet  this

increasing demand. The Salvation Army's Lee  Kuo  Chuan

Home for the Aged will open sometime in June this year,

while  the  Society for the Aged Sick  is  planning  an

extension  to  its  premises at Jalan  Payoh  Lai.  The

Singapore Council of Social Service is also building  a

home  for  the  aged  in Mandai and  another  voluntary

organisation plans to build a similar home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government agrees that homes should be provided

for  the  aged  who require them and will  continue  to

encourage and support voluntary and community



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



initiatives in the development of more homes for

the  aged.  But  there is also a need  for  a  balanced

approach in the planning and implementation of  welfare

facilities  for the aged. Institutional  care  for  the

aged  is not a substitute for family care. The support.

security and continued interaction with the family  and

the  members of the community are vital elements in the

life  of an aged person. The Government recognises  the

need  for  the  aged to live with their  families.  The

revised  income  tax laws which allow  tax  relief  for

maintenance of aged parents and grandparents is one  of

the  positive  measures the Government has  taken.  The

Housing  and  Development Board is also giving  special

consideration  by providing adequate accommodation  for

large families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those organisations concerned with the care of the

aged  should now consider the alternatives to long-term

institutional  care  for  the aged.  They  should  give

increasing  attention to the development of  facilities

and services which would encourage the aged to continue

living and participating in the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that the long waiting list referred to

by  the  Member for Sembawang may mean the aged chronic

sick who, however, do not come under the purview of  my Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the building of a residential home for

handicapped  people, the Member for  Sembawang  may  be

interested  to  know that in the voluntary  sector,  an

impressive network of services for the care and welfare

of  handicapped  children already  exists.  It  is  the

Government's view that parents should be encouraged  to

keep their handicapped children at home where they  can

provide  them with the love and attention so  necessary

for their growth and development. A number of voluntary

organisations  do provide institutional facilities  for

some  categories of handicapped children.  The  welfare

and training of the physically and mentally handicapped

children   is   a   field   in  which   the   voluntary

organisations have all along excelled.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government does not intend to duplicate the

facilities these voluntary



welfare   organisations  provide.  The  Government

will,    however,   continue   to   assist   these

organisations  so that they can  carry  out  their

welfare  work  among the physically  and  mentally

handicapped more effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Government pays the salaries of

many  of  the  teaching  staff  in  the  voluntary

organisations  and  makes  per  capita  grants  to

approved  institutions  that  provide  residential

care for handicapped children and quarterly grants

to  meet  administration expenses of a  number  of

voluntary    organisations.   In   addition,    it

administers   a  fostering  scheme  for   mentally

defective children and a maintenance allowance  to

encourage parents to keep their mentally defective

children at home. There is, therefore, no need for

the   Government  to  build  an  institution   for

handicapped  children. As for handicapped  adults,

the Government lays emphasis on their training and

rehabilitation  to  enable  them   to   be   self-supporting  and to remain with their  families  as

useful members of the community.

that many voluntary bodies have done a lot to look

after  the  disabled, I think that their  services

are  not  sufficient.  I have received  complaints

from  parents of disabled and handicapped children

that they had to wait for a long time before their

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my constituency - I might as well say Telok

Blangah,  otherwise  the newspaper  reporters  who  are

present  here might report me as the Member  for  Anson

instead,  as had been the case this morning in  respect

of  yesterday's speeches. They have also  passed  snide

remarks in this afternoon's papers; perhaps this is  as

a  result of the Culture Minister's running down of the

press yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Telok Blangah there is an old folks' home in

Bushey Park where the old citizens who are vagrants  or

who have no place to go are sheltered. This Bushey Park

Home   is   spotlessly  clean  and   the   surroundings

reasonably  well maintained for which the  Ministry  of

Social  Affairs and the officials responsible ought  to

be  congratulated.  And  the congratulations  must  end

here. The inmates look after the surroundings well, and

that  is the only good thing that I can say about  this

Home.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the living quarters are terribly overcrowded and

the amenities are terribly poor. The meals provided are

communally  cooked. I went there unannounced  and  have

personally seen the meals cooked and served. I have  no

complaints about the rice that is served. But what goes

with the rice cannot be imagined, unless one personally

witnesses what is served for food. One need  not  be  a

dietician  to  know that a square meal  needs  to  have

protein,  carbohydrates, fat and roughage. The  inmates

are provided with these. Vegetables and fish are boiled

in a large cauldron with water and perhaps some salt. I

would not dare taste it. At the whims and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>



fancies of someone who is supposed to be the cook, this

concoction  is dished out to the inmates  who  are  our

senior citizens of Singapore in Bushey Park. One has to

see this meal to really know what a mess this is, it is

colourless,  tasteless, not palatable, meshed  and,  as

far  as  I am concerned, not fit for human consumption.

[Laughter.]  I  do  not  think this  is  a  matter  for

amusement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is this the way we treat our citizens in one of

our  welfare  homes,  citizens who  perhaps  have  been

neglected  by their children or, in certain  instances,

even neglected by the State? I do not expect the Social

Welfare  Department  to  provide  these  inmates   with

restaurant-cooked meals. I do not expect the old  folks

to  be  provided  with sumptuous  meals.  But  one  can

reasonably expect them to be provided with at  least  a

palatable meal.

are   there  because  they  have  already  made   their

contribution to society in their youth. So  it  is  our

duty  and  responsibility to look after them  now  that

they are old; hence the Home for the Aged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's complaint is that the food provided in

the  food  is tasteless and colourless. I think  it  is

difficult  to  please everybody's  taste.  People  with

different backgrounds have different tastes. If the old

folks there had a background of riches in the past they

must  have  developed a very keen taste for good  food.

But  if  they  had  a poor life, then  their  taste  is

different  from  the  rich people.  The  real  test  is

whether  we ourselves have tasted the food.  Anyway,  I

would like to thank the Member for showing concern  and

interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his complaint we have, in fact,

investigated the matter and found that the  bean  curd,

ikan  bilis  and sambal were served on that  particular

day when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



the  Member  called at the Home. And it was because  of

the  knowledge  that  an MP was coming  that  the  cook

became  nervous, and mixed up all the  food.  The  ikan

bills was put together with the vegetables and the bean

curd.  And so the whole thing became a "concoction"  as

the  Member  has said. Perhaps it was this  nervousness

that caused the food to be so tasteless or "in a mess".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nowadays it is difficult to get good cooks, and

we  must also realise that mass cooking is a problem in

itself.  The cooks do not have to cook for individuals.

They have to cook for many people at a time. Anyway,  I

agree  with the Member that we must look after our  old

people  properly and give them good food and to prepare

the food as palatable as possible. We must realise that

there  are  about 270 inmates in the Bushey Park  Home.

When  they  were  admitted, some of them  were  feeble,

while  others  were sick. But because  of  the  medical

attention and the care given, these old people  develop

a  very good appetite after two weeks of admission.  In

fact, their appetite has increased, and there arc  very

clear   instances  to  prove  this.  Even   the   swill

collectors complain that there is not enough left-overs

for the swill cans. All this goes to show that the food

has  been well consumed. It also goes to show that  the

health  of the inmates has improved to the extent  that

they  are  able to consume all the food provided,  with

very little left-over for the swill cans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I would like to thank the Member for showing

interest  in our old people. We will continue  to  give

our  care and concern, particularly in respect  of  the

food that is provided.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I do not particularly accept the explanation. If

they  had  known that I was coming and yet served  that

mess, I think we can well imagine what sort of food  is

served  if no VIP is present at that place. Sir,  swill

cans  are empty because less and less are being  cooked

and not more are being eaten.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having made the point and having brought it to the

notice  of the House and in particular to the  Minister

and the Parliamentary Secretary, who is responsible for

the  Bushey  Park Home, I hope that there  will  be  an

improvement. I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Ang

Nam Piau -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) That the sum to be allocated for Head R be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BED 1111.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ang is not here to move his amendment. Mr P.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head R be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead BFA 1109.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after the major fire at Robinson's a few years

ago,  it  has  been  compulsory for all  organisations,

government departments, factories, departmental stores,

etc, to  eradicate  all fire hazards  and  to  provide

greater  fire  safety  measures in  order  to  avoid  a

recurrence  of such a disaster. But it is sad  to  note

that  although a large sum of money was spent  on  this

item  of  expenditure, we still hear of numerous  major

and  minor  cases of fire in the last  few  years  with

losses amounting to millions of dollars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What measures are being taken to prevent fires in big

departmental  stores?  After the  Robinson  fire,  many

departmental  stores  have introduced  side-staircases.

But  unfortunately all these exits are securely locked.

What  happens  if there is a fire? If  the  officer  in

charge  of  the keys were to panic or was  not  around,

then  a  lot  of  people would be trapped  and  roasted

alive.  How often are checks and drills carried out  to

ensure  that  departmental stores do not display  their

goods in such a manner as to become a hazard in a  fire

emergency?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to know whether the use of fire-fighting

equipment  and the methods of combating fire are  being

taught to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



workers in offices, factories, departmental store staff

and  school  officials. Because  if  these  people  are

ignorant of the correct use of this equipment, then  it

is pointless to have them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how often are fire-fighting equipment checked to

see  that  they really work, because quite  often  when

they  are tested, some of them are found to be  out  of

order.  I  hope that fire-fighting equipment,  such  as

fire   extinguishers,   in   all   buildings,   be   it

departmental  stores,  theatres,  offices,  etc.,   are

checked regularly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be wise to introduce a helicopter service to

fight  fires in high-rise buildings, i wonder how  this

service  is going to help in fighting a fire.  Can  the

Minister explain?



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore Fire Brigade has

recommended that the first-aid fire-fighting equipment,

such as extinguishers which are installed in commercial

buildings  and factories, should be tested and  checked

at  least once a year, and also immediately after  they

are  discharged. The Brigade provides this  service  to

members of the public at a nominal fee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Brigade conducts regular courses on the

fundamentals   of   fire-fighting,   rescue    methods,

evacuation   procedures   and   fire   prevention   for

industrial personnel, occupants of high-rise  buildings

and  organised  groups. Last year, about 3,000  persons

from   various  sectors  of  our  community,  including

factory  workers, shipyard employees,  safety  officers

and  staff of commercial and industrial establishments,

civic   organisations   and  occupants   of   high-rise

buildings  participated  in these  courses.  Since  the

beginning  of  this  year, over  2,000  persons   have

benefited  from  the Brigade's educational  programmes.

When  the  training wing of the Jurong Fire Station  is

established  in June 1975, the Brigade would  be  in  a

better  position to expand and diversify  its  training

programmes for members of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Brigade also conducts regular fire drills at the

numerous industrial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>

premises, high-rise buildings and fire-risk areas  all

over  Singapore.  Such drills arc  sometimes  organised

jointly   with   the  managements  of  industrial   and

commercial  buildings.  These drills  also  enable  the

firemen  to  be familiar with fire-risk areas  and  the

possible hazards in the various buildings, so that they

can  plan  and coordinate fire-fighting and  carry  out

fire ground operations more effectively in the event of

fire.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Singapore Fire Brigade was actively involved

in   making   recommendations   for   fire   prevention

facilities  in all buildings, they ensured  that  there

were  adequate measures for the protection of life  and

property  in  the event of fire. Stringent requirements

were  imposed  on  high-rise  buildings  including  the

provision of -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) automatic sprinklers for early detection and

extinguishment of fire;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) automatic fire detectors;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) wet and dry rising mains for fire-fighting;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) properly enclosed and protected staircases

for escape purposes;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) ventilated lobbies fire-fighting;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) fire lifts for the use of firemen in

emergencies;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) first-aid fire-fighting equipment such as

hose-reels, and extinguishers; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) the use of non-combustible building

materials to control spread of fire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1st August, 1973, this function has been

transferred  to  the Building Control Division  of  the

Public  Works Department. However, I believe  that  the

high  standards  of fire prevention  advocated  by  the

Brigade have been maintained through a Fire Code  which

was  prepared  by  the  Building  Control  Division  in

consultation with the Singapore Fire Brigade.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire-fighting in the upper floors of HDB flats poses

obvious  problems as HDB buildings do not have built-in

facilities. A fire hose has to be transported  manually

to  the affected level, and it is then lowered down and

connected  to  a fire pump in the fire engine.  I  hope

this  difficulty  can be solved when  the  Housing  and

Development  Board adopts the Safety Code  of  Practice

which  has been drafted in consultation with  the  Fire

Department.   The  proposed  Code  will   include   the

provision  of  rising  mains,  access  ways  for   fire

engines, fire lifts and fire resistance entrance  doors

to fiats in HDB buildings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Search and Rescue Squad has been formed by the

Brigade to effect the rescue of trapped victims in  the

event   of   fire   involving  a  high-rise   building.

Helicopters  will  be used mainly  for  the  rescue  of

people  trapped  in  the roof tops of  such  buildings.

Firemen  will be transported by helicopter to the  roof

top  where they will pacify the victims initially,  and

then   arrange   for   their  orderly   evacuation   by

helicopter. Fire-fighting equipment can also be lowered

down  to  the  roof  top by helicopter  so  that  fire-fighting operations can be conducted from the roof  top

as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helicopters have been used very successfully for

rescue  operations in larger cities such as Tokyo,  New

York,  Los  Angeles and Sao Paulo, and I  am  confident

that we can adopt this method of aerial evacuation with

an equally high degree of success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must, however, warn that helicopters will only be

used  in extreme cases to evacuate people who in  their

attempt  to  escape  by descending the  staircases  are

driven up by heat and smoke to seek refuge at the  roof

top.  They should only ascend to the roof top as a last

resort.

$10 in respect of item (m) of subhead AAA 3020*.



(*The same amendment alos stood in the names of Messrs N. Govindasamy and Ivan Baptist).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this subhead gives me the opportunity to ask the

Minister  what the financial standing of the  Singapore

Sports Council is at the moment, and also to make  some

observations on the objectives of the Council which  is

formulated in Part III of the Singapore Sports  Council

Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main objectives of the Council is to plan

for  sports development and promotion. To-date I am not

aware  of  any comprehensive plan on sports development

and  promotion being produced by the Sports Council.  I

hope  the Council is working towards the production  of

such  a  plan, a plan which is to some extent  a  total

plan  on sports development and promotion, taking  into

consideration   our  population  movement,   population

concentration,   age   groups,   residential    status,

occupational patterns of residents in various  ages  in

the  State and also the physical development of  sports

facilities  that  are  being  undertaken  by  statutory

boards  like the HDB, Ministry of Education, maybe  the

Urban Redevelopment Authority and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, is the Council also working towards the

planning  of sports at the management level?  Here,  it

may  be  a  little complicated, but if the efforts  are

directed towards coordinating the management of  sports

that are being undertaken by bodies like the SNOC,  the

sports organisations, and Ministry of Education, then a

kind  of  effective plan of sports management might  be

achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I also would like to enquire of the Minister

what  the  Sports  Council is doing  in  the  field  of

physical education, which is another objective  of  the

Council described in the Sports Council Act. I am aware

that  there  are two other sources that  are  concerned

with physical education. One is the Institute of Edu-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>



cation  that  is  worried over it.  The  other  is  the

Physical  Education  department  in  the  Ministry   of

Education.  Has the Sports Council involved  itself  in

physical  education and undertaken efforts  to  promote

physical education? Has it coordinated a plan among the

two  other  institutions in order to  promote  physical

education in the State?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr N. Govindasamy and Mr Ivan Baptist are not here.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, the Singapore Sports Council, which was formed

through   the  amalgamation  of  the  National   Sports

Promotion  Board  and the National Stadium  Corporation

took  over the assets and liabilities of the two former

sports organisations. Though efforts are being made  by

the management of the Council to make a good number  of

its  sports  projects economically viable, most  sports

facilities  and activities co-ordinated by the  Council

have to be heavily subsidised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example is the seven swimming pools which are

being  administered by the Council.  Subsidy  of  these

pools  ranges  from  45%  to  92.5%.  The  charges  for

admission  to the swimming pools and for the  usage  of

other  sports  facilities such as playing  fields,  are

low,  and have to be so, if we are to encourage  people

to take part in recreational sports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial standing of the SSC is as follows. The

SSC carries loans, for the construction of the National

Stadium, totalling $15.15 million at 5¾ and these  are

fully  repayable.  The interest payable  from  1975  is

$238,438 and this will increase proportionately in  the

coming years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The income of the Council which includes a projection

of  revenue  up  to  the  end  of  the  financial  year

(31.3.75)  will  be  in the region of  $5.101  million,

while   the   expenditure,  including   the   estimated

expenditure  up  to  31.3.75,  will  be  around  $5.058

million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue includes a $2.5 million grant from

Government  and  a  $800,000 grant from  the  Singapore

Pools.  The  reason for the likely excess revenue  over

expenditure is due to the Council earning more  revenue

for  1974 than had been anticipated. However, there has

been  no provision of payment of interest due to loans,

or  part-payment of the loan itself. SSC cannot see how

it can ever pay these outstanding loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SSC is currently planning a sports programme which

will provide sports development in the country over the

next 5-10 years, in conjunction with the Master Plan on

Sports  Facilities. This planning is now  at  the  data

collection  stage,  after which  consultation  will  be

commenced   with  all  departments  and   organisations

involved  in sports promotion, such as the Ministry  of

Education,  Ministry of Defence, People's  Association,

the  Singapore  National Olympic Council  and  national

sports organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan will examine the integration of all sports

promotion  projects and activities from the schools  to

the  national  level. It will cater for all  grades  of

participants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some areas of development in this plan which will be

examined by the Committee to be set up, are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A comprehensive physical education curriculum from

kindergarten   through  university   to   ensure   that

meaningful  activities  and continuity  throughout  the

years  of  formal education and carry-over  value  into

adult years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Systematic establishment of a network of

recreation  and sports centres throughout the  Republic

in   conjunction  with  the  Master  Plan   on   Sports

Facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Preparation and training of physical recreation

and  sports  leaders  at a rate commensurate  with  the

growth  and  requirements  of physical  recreation  and

sports centres.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Provision of a comprehensive sports service

through  which  the  public  is  provided  with   ample

opportunities to learn sports skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the implementation of such a plan

will  depend primarily upon how the various  ministries

anti  organisations  can shoulder the  responsibilities

and respond to the overall plan. The role of SSC is one

of coordination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Ministry of Education and the Singapore

Sports  Council have looked into the respective  sports

promotion   programmes   in  their   areas   and   have

independently come to the same conclusion that  popular

demand   for  sports  promotion  involves  15   sports,

including  sea sports. These sports are being  actively

promoted  in  schools, SSC will develop programmes  and

facilities to ensure that continuity is provided for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon is right in stressing the

importance of physical education. Both the Ministry and

the Singapore Sports Council recognise that a programme

of  mass  participation and involvement  in  sports  is

needed  to raise the level of physical fitness  of  our

people, particularly our young. Planning for sports  by

the Council and the schools and educational authorities

will   he  based  on, the  philosophy  of  encouraging

participation in sports and games by both the  talented

and the untalented, the strong as well as the weak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council is now studying the requirements

pertaining to physical education. A Committee has  been

appointed to look into the necessity and feasibility of

establishing  an  Institute of Physical  Education  and

Sports  in  Singapore.  Two  senior  officials  of  the Ministry of Education are now serving as members of the Singapore  Sports Council, one of whom  is  the  Deputy

Director of the Ministry of Education and the other  is

the   Chairman  of  the  Extra  Curricular   Activities

Advisory Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Association is also represented on the

Singapore Sports Council, and it has been given the res-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



ponsibility  for the co-ordination of intraconstituency

sports.  The Council will effect co-ordination  between

the  People's  Association, the community  centres  and

their  sports  organisers  with  the  various  national

sports  associations to ensure that  suitable  sporting

activities  are planned at the grass-root level,  which

are of appeal to young and old alike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, sports promotion is a

community  obligation.  The Sports  Council  cannot  be

expected to achieve its objectives within a few  years.

Sports consciousness needs a long time to inculcate.

various methods of fire prevention and in case of  fire

the best means of escape, instead of sheer

displays  were held during the Fire Brigade  Week  last

year,  emphasis  was in fact placed on fire-prevention.

The  fire-fighting displays attracted huge  crowds  and

helped  to  arouse  greater fire-consciousness  in  the

people, while a massive programme



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



to educate them on fire hazards and the methods of fire

prevention  was being mounted. Booklets, brochures  and

posters  on  fire prevention in the home  and  industry

were   printed  in  the  various  languages  for   free

distribution  to  the public, and the  Brigade  visited

some schools and community centres to give lectures  on

fire  prevention.  The  week-long  exhibition  at   the

People's  Park  Concourse also  provided  a  wealth  of

information on fire prevention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Fire Brigade had, in fact, proposed an

ambitious programme for this year involving a total sum

of $27,550 to educate our population on fire prevention

methods and what to do in the event of a fire. However,

owing  to  the  constraint on public expenditure,  only

$8,000 was approved for this project. The bulk of  this

provision   will  be  spent  to  expand  the  Brigade's

educational   programmes  for  every   level   of   the

community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr L. P.

Rodrigo -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11) That the sum to be allocated for Head R be

$10 in respect of subhead BBA 8101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first time I visited the Registry of

Marriages  was some nine years ago when I got  married.

The  second time was two months ago - of course, not  a

second  marriage  - but to witness the  marriage  of  a

friend of mine who is a foreigner at the Registry. I am

ashamed of the poor condition of the Registry building;

it is small and unsuitable as a Registry of Marriages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this year's provision, we are given to

understand  that  the  Registry of  Marriages  will  be

renovated. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>



Minister  must be congratulated on this  after  such  a

long  duration. I would like to suggest to the Minister

that  at  least  a  decent  reception  hall  should  be

provided  in the Registry of Marriages. In  Hong  Kong,

which  is  a British colony, the Registry of  Marriages

has   a  decent  and  beautiful  reception  ball   with

facilities for the holding of small receptions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I am pointing out is that the Government is

asking  the people not to spend and throw unnecessarily

big parties on such occasions, and it is also educating

our  people to cultivate the habit of saving. With  the

facilities  of a decent reception hall, I am  sure  the

young  married  couples could save a lot  of  money  by

making  use of such a reception hall to give small  tea

reception to their relatives and friends after they are

married by the Registrar of Marriages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also request the Minister to consider the

provision of a reception hall not only in the  Registry

of  Marriages  but also in the Shariah  Court  for  the

Muslims.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Changi may wish to

know that my Ministry has given considerable thought to

the  need  for  a  new  building for  the  Registry  of

Marriages. The present Registry is crammed and  not  so

well  located.  The  ceremony at  the  Registry  leaves

little  for  the married couples to treasure  in  their

memories. Furthermore, the present site is affected  by

the  development project to convert Fort  Canning  Hill

and  its  surrounding slopes into a  Central  Park-cum-Cultural Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has considered a number of sites as

alternative  accommodation for the  Registry,  and  has

decided  to  house  the  Registry  of  Marriages  in  a

building at Fort Canning, which is now occupied by  the

Singapore  Command and Staff College. As  soon  as  the Ministry  of Defence finds another place to accommodate

the College, renovation works will begin to convert the

building for use by the Registry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Registry of Marriages building will blend

with  the  scenic beauty of the Central  Park  at  Fort

Canning.  It  will  have  proper  facilities  for   the

solemnisation   of  marriages.  There   will   be   two

solemnisation halls, a notice section and  one  waiting

room.  In  addition,  there will be  a  large  marriage

ceremony hall with space for musical hands, which could

be  used  by  couples  for  reception  to  he  held  to

entertain their friends and relatives. Other facilities

in   the   new  building  include  restaurants,  shops,

photographic  studios, piped romantic music  while  the

couples  are waiting to be married as well as a chamber

for brides.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the subject of Jurong Fire Station has been

brought up in this House on many occasions. I hope this

will  be the final one. Every year the Minister or  his

Parliamentary Secretary says that the fire station will

be  ready  the following year, but up to-date the  fire

station is still not operational.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past year, as far as I know, several

factories in Jurong had been burned down; so  there  is

an  urgent need for a fire station in Jurong  Town.  In

this respect, I would urge the Minister to expedite the

matter  and  to  ensure that the fire station  will  be

operational as early as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now in reply to a query by the Member for Anson,

the Minister said that the Jurong Fire Station will  be

commissioned  sometime  in  June  this  year.  Can  the

Minister  confirm this? I would also like to  find  out

from  the Minister how will this fire station  be  run.

Will  it  be operational round the clock, and how  many

fire engines will be stationed there?



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Jurong never gives

up. The Fire Station will be completed

next  month  and  it is expected to be  operational  in

June,  as  I have said earlier. It will have  two  fire

engines  and an ambulance and they will provide  a  24-hour  round-the-clock service to the  public  and  give

fire  cover to the western part of Singapore including,

of  course,  the  Jurong  Town, the  Jurong  Industrial

(*The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Ang Nam Piau, P. Govindaswamy, L. P. Rodrigo, Cheong Yuen Chee and Ong Teng Cheong).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President mentioned in his speech that there

would  be  much  in 1975 to keep Members  busy.  It  is

fitting   and  honourable  for  us  to  be  given   the

opportunity of having a greater share in the affairs of

our  country. We sincerely accept this noble  piece  of

encouragement.  However, it cannot be denied  that  for

any  kind of work to succeed, a stable, reasonable  and

cooperative  environment  is  necessary.  A  Member  of

Parliament is the representative of the people  in  his

constituency.  So  it is reasonable to  expect  him  to

serve the electorate; in fact, it is his duty to do so.

However,  there are many matters which,  with  adequate

cooperation  from  Government officials  concerned,  we

could  save a lot of trouble and be able to  make  more

and better contribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past there was a period when officers of

various  departments  under the  Ministry  of  National

Development  had  shown some degree of courtesy  toward

members  of the public. But in recent years there  have

been  criticisms again that officers in  that  Ministry

have   resumed  their  old  weakness  and  have  become

bureaucratic  again. Their attitude now is  even  worse

than  before.  This is most regrettable. For  instance,

the  Ministry of National Development has been  issuing

decrees  to  tenants ordering them to remove  within  a

given  time.  No sympathetic consideration  was  given.

There   are   some   small-scale  industries,   cottage

industries  and  store  houses  which  have   been   in

existence  for  a  few decades. The occupiers  suddenly

received orders to remove by a certain date and time as

specified.  They were unable to remove  to  a  suitable

place immediately. They have been depending on the  use

of  their buildings for a livelihood and if they cannot

find  alternative accommodation to carry on with  their

business  operations,  their  livelihood  will  be   in

jeopardy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the development plans of the Ministry of

National  Development  for the  various  constituencies

relate   to  the  promotion  of  social  and   economic

interests  of the whole country. At the same time  they

are  aimed at improving the living environment  of  the

people. This had originally been well-received  by  all

the  people  generally. However, what  is  bad  is  the

urgent order to quit, which is inhuman. We reckon  that

the  Ministry of National Development should  at  least

first  arrange for alternative accommodation for  those

who  are required to quit under urgent orders, and they

would  surely  have  accepted  it.  In  this  way,  the

development plans of the Ministry could be carried  out

smoothly. Moreover, the people affected will  also  not

have any complaints against the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Ministry continues to disregard the feelings

of  the  people  and persists in cowing the  people  by

decrees  which  they have to obey, it will  not  be  to

anybody's  advantage. Our system is a  one-man-one-vote

democracy.   I   believe  the  Ministry   of   National

Development will not want to turn it into a one-man-one-gun society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally I would like to touch upon the

development   plans  of  the  various   constituencies.

Perhaps we all know that many constituents on receiving

notices to quit would go to their respective Members of

Parliament for advice. But the MPs themselves are  kept

in  the  dark  about such notices. If  the  authorities

concerned  could  notify  the  respective  Members   of

Parliament  in advance about any removal  or  plan  for

development  to  be carried out, then things  would  be

much  better and results can be achieved with half  the

effort.  This would be similar to the practice of  PUB,

where  it  would notify the consumers concerned  before

cutting  off  electricity and water supplies.  If  this

arrangement  could  be  adopted by  the  Ministry,  the

Member  of  Parliament concerned can  also  assist  the Ministry or the constituents to solve their problems so

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>



both sides concerned can cooperate and the task can  be

carried  out  smoothly. This would save much  time  and

trouble  for  all.  I  hope the  Ministry  of  National

Development will follow the example of the PUB  or  PWD

so that in the implementation of any future development

or  resettlement  schemes,  the  authorities  concerned

would  notify the MP concerned in advance and cooperate

with him in order to help solve or expedite the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point. Recently some of my

constituents have been asked to remove because the site

was required by the HDB for a housing development.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member has half a minute more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): But before any alternative accommodation could be

allocated  to  them,  the  authorities  concerned   had

already  forced  them to sign documents  to  move  out.

Perhaps   the   Minister  concerned  does   not   fully

understand the difficulties of the rural people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the allocation of Housing Board

flats  is  made  on a "first come first  served"  basis

according  to  the  registration  of  applicants.   The

applicants  have  to wait for at least  three  to  four

years before a flat can be allocated to them. Moreover,

priority  of  allocation  is given  to  those  who  are

affected  by resettlement schemes, and also  to  police

personnel  and  National Service personnel.  This  will

cause an applicant on the register to wait even longer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Government officers are public servants who

render  service to the people. Government  officers  in

Singapore have also been acclaimed to be among the most

efficient. However, they are not given priority for HDB

flats.  However,  the national service  reservists  and

police  personnel are given priority. This is  contrary

to  Singapore's principles of justice and equality. So,

in order to be fair, I hope the Minister concerned will

consider the suggestion that all public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>



officers who have served for more than three years

should be entitled to priority in the allocation of HDB

flats.

Regulations, 1971, were revoked and in their place  the

Sand  and  Granite  Quarries  Regulations,  1974,  were

introduced. Clauses 13 and 18 of the 1971 Regulations - very  important clauses, mind you - were  deleted  when

the   1974  Regulations  were  introduced.  Clause   13

requires the licensee of a quarry to ensure that  every

employee  and  worker on his premises shall  undergo  a

full chest X-ray examination before he is employed, and

that no person found to be suffering from any pulmonary

disease is allowed to work on his premises.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well known that the incidence of silicosis or

pulmonary  fibrosis  caused by the inhalation  of  dust

containing free silica, a dreaded occupational disease,

has been on the increase in Singapore over the last few

years.  By  1973, out of 461 notified cases,  185  were

confirmed. This constitutes more than 10% of the mining

and quarrying industry workers in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 of the 1971 Regulations took cognisance of

the  dire  need  to  ensure that the condition  of  any

individual affected by the pulmonary disease should not

be worsened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 of the 1971 Regulations required that a

record of X-ray examinations be kept by the licensee in

an  approved  register. Although the  1974  Regulations

require a yearly X-ray examination of all employees  in

a granite quarry, and a biennial X-ray exami



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>



nation  in  the  case of a sand quarry, no  records  of

these examinations are required to be kept. By deleting

clause  18  of  the  1971  Regulations,  the  competent

authority   cannot   check  immediately   whether   all

employees   have   been  X-rayed  in  accordance   with

legislative requirements. The long process of having to

consult  the  medical practitioner or practitioners  to

obtain  details  will  mean  extra  cost,  delays   and

additional  exposure of affected workers,  if  any,  to

greater   risk  of  contracting  silicosis.  The   1974

Regulations have indeed taken a dangerous retrogressive

step. I wonder why such a callous step was taken.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I deal first with the Member for

Paya Lebar who has made general accusations against  my Ministry. He said that my officers were cooperative and

courteous  in  the past and they have "suddenly  become

bureaucratic and even worse than they were  before".  I

hope  this  is  only confined to Paya Lebar.  Something

appears  to  have gone wrong somewhere. We  do  consult

Members  of  Parliament when there  are  large  schemes

affecting certain constituencies. In Paya Lebar itself,

the  Perseverance Estate was acquired in two  parts  in

1971, which means something was on. It is only recently

that  a  survey  was taken of part of  the  estate  and

resettlement  started. Surely the  Member  should  have

known  what  was  happening.  He  wants  priority   for

alternative accommodation perhaps for everyone. He says

we  issue decrees. We do not. We issue notices to quit.

Decrees  telling  people to move out immediately  is  a

waste  of  time, and issuing a notice to quit asking  a

family to move out immediately is also a waste of time.

Because  they never move. The notice to quit is usually

a  one month's notice to quit, and it is several months

before  they  are  moved out. Resettlement  is  a  most

difficult  and  unpleasant business  where  people  are

moved  out  of their homes. Wherever possible,  if  the

occupiers  are  eligible, alternative accommodation  is

provided.   No   one  is  kicked  out  of   his   house

immediately.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Member is referring to some squatters in

the estate who have erected unauthorised structures and

extensions and have sublet or assigned their houses  to

operators of various small scale industries.  In  order

to  reduce  the  magnitude of the resettlement  problem

when  the  estate is redeveloped, the Board  has  taken

enforcement action on these illegal operators.  Perhaps

the  Member may be referring to this problem. But  even

in  those  cases an adequate grace period is  given  on

appeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I go on to the complaint of the Member

for  Thomson,  may I just assure the  Member  for  Paya

Lebar that if there has been no cooperation between  my Ministry and his constituency or with him, it  will  be

done in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson wants priority for Housing

Board  accommodation for civil servants. All  sorts  of

people  want  priority. The question is,  who  deserves

priority?  We are giving priority to a small percentage

of  national  servicemen  and  a  small  percentage  of

policemen.  The  reason  is that  if  you  have  a  few

policemen in one block and some national servicemen  in

another  block, then the gangsters will keep away.  For

civil  servants,  those  who are  occupying  Government

accommodation because of the nature of their  work  and

are  asked  to  move  out when they  retire  are  given

priority.  The others are not. But we have been  giving

consideration to this matter from time to time.  If  we

give  priority  to  more  and  more  sections  of   the

community,  it  means  that the  waiting  list  becomes

longer and longer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir referred to the deletion

of  two  important  clauses in  the  Sand  and  Granite

Quarries  Regulations  of  1974.  There  seems  to   be

substance  in  what he says. I was  not  aware  of  the

deletion  of these two clauses. Perhaps there  is  good

reason,  but there does not appear to be.  But  I  will

look  into  these  regulations and reinsert  these  two

clauses if that should be done.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now the Minister mentioned that I have some

prejudice   against  the  officers  of  his   Ministry.

Actually  it  happened yesterday. After the  Parliament

sitting, when I returned to my constituency for my Meet-the-People  session, I found to my surprise that  there

were about 30 constituents waiting to see me to seek my

help.  They said that in the morning the officers  from

the  Ministry  of National Development went  there  and

asked  them  to  sign their names  on  a  document  and

thumbprints were taken from the old folks who could not

sign, and they were told to quit. If they did not  want

to  move,  the  officers said that they did  not  care.

Perhaps  the Minister does not understand the  problem.

It  is  difficult  for old people  to  get  alternative

accommodation.  Even  if their thumbprints  are  taken,

they  cannot  move out if they do not have  alternative

accommodation.  I  wish  to make  a  request  that  the

officers should be more considerate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituents are not dissatisfied with the Ministry of National Development. They are only asking

for    Satisfactory   alternative   accommodation   for

resettlement and they will be satisfied. For  instance,

at  Bartley area in Paya Lebar, some families have been

told to quit. There should have been prior planning and

alternative  accommodation should have been  found  for

the  affected  families.  A  survey  should  have  been

conducted to find out the number of families  who  will

be   required   to   move   and  suitable   alternative

accommodation should be found for them. If they do  not

have  alternative  accommodation, surely  the  Minister

does  not expect them to sleep on the roadside! If  the

Minister is a kindhearted person, he would not do  such

a  thing  on these unfortunate people. But I know  that

the  officers  in  his Ministry have such  an  attitude

which is most oppressive to others. I hope the Minister

can try to understand the matter deeper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin(Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to support what the

Member for Paya Lebar has just said. Last night I  also

had the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



experience.  When  I  turned up at  my  Meet-the-People

session,  some constituents in my area reported  to  me

that  they  were forced to sign a certain  document  by

officers of the Ministry. All those poor people are not

literate in English. They were not even told what  that

document  was supposed to be. When they put it  to  the

officer concerned whether they were to be evicted or to

be  resettled and whether the Government would  provide

them  with alternative accommodation, the reply  given,

to  my  mind,  was unfortunately a very heartless  one.

There was an elderly lady. She has got only a daughter,

and  the reply given to her was, "No, you are not going

to  get  any accommodation. We would only allow you  to

apply  if  you  can  get  two more  elderly  ladies  or

persons, and then we would consider your application."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this is not the only complaint. Two weeks ago I

had  a  similar  experience  in  another  part  of   my

constituency.  Some of my constituents  were  presented

with  blank forms. I was shown one. It was supposed  to

be  a  form used for an offer of compensation, but that

part where the quantum of compensation was supposed  to

be  indicated was left blank and the people were  asked

to  sign  the blank forms. Thus they did not  know  how

much  they  were going to get. I think  this  is  quite

unfair. Surely the person who signs should be told  how

much he is going to get.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. The Member for Paya Lebar was

not  exaggerating when he stated that there was a  lack

of consideration. I had an experience recently. Quite a

number  of  families were suddenly served with  notices

advising them to register for alternative accommodation

within  24  hours.  For  some of  these  people,  their

menfolk  were  away from home at work.  How  were  they

going   to   get  their  menfolk  to  come   back   for

registration? Surely 24 hours is too short a time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the support given to Members of Parliament, I

think  the  Minister is aware of the case  I  mentioned

here. I said that recently when I heard of some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



projects going on I asked for plans to be supplied, and

I  was  told that I would be given the plans if I  paid

$30.  Well, we are not asking for the plans to  do  our

own  business.  We are asking for plans  to  serve  the

people  and  to help the Department to explain  to  the

people  what  is involved. We are not even  given  this

support.  I  finally got the plans and I said  I  would

take  up  the  matter of the payment of fees  with  the

Minister. Sir, to be fair to the officer, he  was  very

sympathetic.   Unfortunately,  when  the   matter   was

referred to the Ministry of Finance - the Minister  for

Finance  is here today and I think it is an appropriate

occasion for me to raise it --- the Ministry of Finance

said,  "No, the MP should pay for the plans." It  is  a

very simple photostat plan costing $15 a copy. Does  it

make sense? A similar photostat document costs only  50

cents  if you get it done in a shop outside. I think  I

have stated enough, Sir.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification. The debate now

appears  to  centre on resettlement. I  have  filed  an

amendment   on   the   Development   Estimates    under

Resettlement. Can 1 raise the issue now, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You might as well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, there is a major project of clearance going on

in my constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, with your permission, I should like to be given

the  opportunity to reply to those two  Members  first,

before some other Member starts on something else.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right, Mr Barker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I hope the Member for Jalan Kayu is not complaining

of  non-cooperation from my Ministry. Of course,  there

are resettlement officers going on their rounds, and if

his  constituents  are asked to sign  blank  pieces  of

paper, his advice to them should be, "Do not sign".  It

is dangerous to sign a blank piece of paper. But surely

they are not given 24 hours to remove from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



these  houses.  I remember the Member  for  Jalan  Kayu

himself  inquiring from my Ministry what was  happening

in  Jalan Kayu when a survey was being taken.  We  gave

him  full  details of what was going to take place.  So

there   was   cooperation.  But,  as  E  said   before,

resettlement  is  unpleasant. Naturally  he  will  have

angry  constituents in his PAP branch premises  looking

for his help when resettlement officers go round to his

constituency. But surely if they are asked to  register

within  24  hours  for alternative accommodation,  that

does  not  mean that they arc debarred from alternative

accommodation if they do not turn up in 24 hours. There

might  be cases where those who are about to be evicted

are  not  entitled to resettlement benefits for various

reasons.  First, they might not be citizens.  Secondly,

they  might have just moved in, after the cut-off date.

And  there may be other reasons. But wherever possible,

we provide alternative accommodation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I think I ought to make further clarification. I

did,  in  fact,  write  to  the  Ministry  on  the  3rd

December,   1974,  asking  for  details   as   to   the

development.  I did not get a reply till February  this

year.  In the meantime, before I got my reply,  letters

were  sent  Out  by  the Resettlement  Department.  The

letters state very clearly:



If you do not turn up for registration within 24 hours,

it will be presumed that you will take care of your own

alternative  accommodation. The letter  is  a  printed,

standard form of letter. It is in black and white.  How

do  we  expect the people to feel? They naturally  feel

nervous. The Government always mean business. Does  the

Minister mean to say that what is stated there does not

mean anything? That is not our Government. Whatever  we

say, we mean it. It is stated in black and white, and I

still have a few copies in my possession.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Will you send me a copy?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> I will be very happy to do that. There is perhaps a

breakdown in communications. It might



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



be  that  the officer lower down the line  is  given  a

certain  order to carry out, and he is anxious to  push

it.  But  in the meantime he has forgotten that, those

individuals affected are also human beings. We have  to

try to minimise the inconvenience to them. Naturally we

have  to  look  after the majority of people.  To  that

extent,  the  minority might be affected.  But  in  the

process it is our job to make sure that we minimise the

sufferings  and inconveniences. This is not asking  for

too much, is it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rodrigo.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> On second thought, Sir, I think I will move my

amendment when the appropriate time comes, because this

subject  of  Resettlement appears to  offer  tremendous

scope  for  further debate. By that time, I am  sure  a

number of MPs will also be raising it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, before I withdraw my amendment, I would like to

express  the hope that the Minister would advise  those

pompous, bureaucratic and haughty civil servants to  be

more  courteous to our people and to look  after  their

interest  with some sincerity and sympathy.  I  believe

that  the  civil servants in the Ministry  of  National

Development  also have some kindness  in  their  heart.

With that, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head S be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead BBA 1108.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to draw the attention of the Minister

for Law and National Development to the unfair award in

respect  of  land  acquisition by the  Commissioner  of

Lands.   Sir,   arising   from   urban   renewal,   the

Commissioner  of  Lands has acquired three  shophouses,

all  of  which  were  owned by the same  person  in  my

constituency. These three shophouses have a total  area

of  1,985 sq, ft. They were acquired by Government  for

an  award of $28,750 which amount, if divided by three,

is equal to $9,583.33 for each shophouse.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the acquired shophouses was occupied by

the  owner himself who runs a grocery, while the  other

two  were let out: one a bookshop and the other a  clan

association. What is unfair is that, while the property

was  being  acquired, the tenants of the  bookshop,  as

well   as   the  clan  association,  were   offered   a

compensation  of  $15,000  for  each  premises  or   an

alternative shophouse, whichever is preferred. But  the

tenant  of  the grocery, who happened to be the  owner-occupier, was unfortunate as he received only $9,583.33

for  his  grocery shop, which was acquired with  vacant

possession.  It is a common practice in Singapore  that

if  you  sell  your house with vacant  possession, the

value  of the property is always higher than if  it  is

encumbered,  everything being equal. But in  this  case

the  reverse  is true. I can vouch that  everything  is

equal  in  this particular case that I have  mentioned,

whether  in  terms  of land area or  condition  of  the

buildings.  But unfortunately in terms of compensation,

the  owner  is  worse  off than the  tenants  by  about

$6,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the glaring anomaly, I

respectfully  request the Minister  concerned  to  look

into  this matter and see that justice is not only done

but must be seen to be done to the aggrieved party.



<br><br>5.39 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the three properties referred to by the Member

for  Bras  Basah  were Nos. 7, 9 and 11 Holloway  Lane,

which  were acquired for urban redevelopment  purposes.

They  all belonged to one land owner. Premises  Nos.  7

and  11  were tenanted by a bookshop and an association

respectively, whilst No. 9 was occupied by the ex-owner

himself.  The total award was $28,750 paid to the  land

owner  for  his  three properties,  and  was  based  on

encumbered  values for No. 7 ($5,750)  and  No.  11  ($

7,280)  and a much higher vacant possession  value  for

No.  9  ($15,720),  which are the two  distinct  issues

raised in the Member's query.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Act compensation is paid to persons having

a legal interest in the acquired properties, that is to

say,   the   landowner   or  lessee.   Computation   of

compensation will be governed by the prevailing  market

value,  which  must be higher in the case  of  premises

where  vacant possession can be given by the  landowner

than  in  the  case  of  premises which  are  tenanted,

especially  premises  which  are  rent-controlled.   An

unencumbered  award  under the Act takes  into  account

encumbrances  and tenancies, which are  liabilities  to

the   acquiring  authorities  and  for  which  exgratia

resettlement  benefits  or compensation  (such  as  HDB

shops at concessional rents or cash grants ranging from

$5,000  to  $15,000) have to be given to the  displaced

occupiers  in  accordance with the current resettlement

policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the particular case raised by the Member, an offer

has  been made by the Resettlement Department of a shop

with  a flat above provided the landowner refunded  the

sum  of  $10,000 from the award made to him, which  was

based on vacant possession value. It is understood that

the  Member's  constituent  is  still  considering  the

offer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the complainant refunds

the sum of $10,000, then the position is that the house

is  not  acquired with vacant possession. It  would  be

acquisition with an encumbrance. That being  the  case,

then  the  tenants and the sub-tenants must be  offered

alternative   accommodation,  because   the   land   is

encumbered.  In this case, the tenants  have  not  been

offered  alternative accommodation. So they arc waiting

to find out whether upon the refund of $10,00() the HDB

will    be    willing   to   offer   them   alternative

accommodation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I think it is better that this matter is settled

outside the House. To debate the matter further in this

House  will  not get us anywhere. Raising a  particular

case, I think, is better done by correspondence, unless

this is on general policy.

(*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ho Kah Leong).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would be very grateful if the Minister could

enlighten  this  House  of the policy  on  agricultural

land,  with special reference to the Bedok resettlement

area. I would like to know whether the policy has  been

changed recently, and if so, what are the changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Land Office has been issuing about 60

notices  to repossess lands which are either leased  or

occupied   by   Temporary  Occupation   Licences.   The

occupants received the notice of repossession from  the

Land  Office.  This  notice creates great  anxiety  and

concern  among these people over their future. I  share

the  same view with the Member for Paya Lebar  and  the

Member   for  Jalan  Kayu  that  in  any  exercise   of

repossession or eviction, the Members of Parliament are

kept  in  the  dark. When these people  received  these

notices  they approached me but I was unable to explain

to  them  and  I  had  to  write to  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  (National Development) for  an  explanation.

Sir, this state of affairs must be remedied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously there were a number of cases of

repossession of land. The usual procedure was that  the

Land Office would send out their land inspectors to  go

round  and  inspect  the site. If the  land  inspectors

found  that  the  land  was  not  being  utilised   for

vegetable growing or farming, they would issue a letter

warning  them  that if they did not do any  farming  or

vegetable  planting, their land would  be  repossessed.

The  inspectors did not find out the actual reasons why

the  licensees did not farm the land. It might be  that

salt water had seeped into the land and they could  not

plant  any  vegetables.  But these  people  obeyed  the

warning of the land inspectors and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



resumed  their  farming. But after a  month  they  were

again  issued  with another notice stating  that  their

land would be repossessed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is rather unfair on the part of the Land

Office, if there is a major change in policy,  the  MP

should at least be given a chance to know about  it  so

that  he  can  be  equipped  with  answers  if  he   is

approached  by  his constituents. I hope  the  Minister

will investigate into these irregularities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, as a Member of Parliament from a rural

constituency, it is my duty to reflect in this House to

the   Minister   concerned  the  various  difficulties,

hardships and grievances of the rural people.  On  this

basis I would like to endorse the views expressed by my

colleagues from other rural constituencies,  because  I

too  have  come across similar problems as  they  have.

Perhaps the Minister might not understand the situation

in  the rural areas as well as we do, and therefore  it

is   our   duty  to  point  out  to  him  the   various

difficulties  so that he would be able  to  direct  his

officers to handle the problems of the rural people  in

a  proper  manner. It is my belief that  a  kindhearted

Minister  like the one we have now would  certainly  do

so,   because  every  time  I  write  to  him  he  will

personally reply to me and for that I am very  grateful

indeed.  Some  other  Ministers, or even  Parliamentary

Secretaries for that matter, do not regard  Members  of

Parliament  with  due  respect. Whatever  letters  they

receive  from the MPs, they will direct their  officers

to reply instead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform time Minister that there are

some  unauthorised structures in the rural  areas.  MPs

from rural constituencies will share my view that there

is  no  place  in a rural area without any unauthorised

structures. Why should there be unauthorised structures

in  the first place? Therefore, we have to get down  to

the  root cause of the appearance of these unauthorised

structures. Only then would we be able to handle



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



the problem with consideration and sympathy, instead of

ordering  them  about like criminals - asking  them  to

demolish their unauthorised structures within 24  hours

or  within  a  specified period, and if  they  fail  to

comply,   action  would  be  taken  to  demolish   such

unauthorised structures and to charge them the cost  of

demolition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that in rural areas there is always a

need  to  renovate  old  buildings  or  to  repair  old

structures.  And  sometimes  because  the   family   is

increasing  there  is need to extend  the  building  to

accommodate  the family. In my constituency  there  are

cases  where 20 people live in a small attap house.  In

the  circumstances, there is always a need to put up  a

lean-to  to  provide an extra room to  accommodate  the

increasing  number  of people in the  family,  or  some

partition may be required to make another room. If such

alterations  or  lean-to  are discovered  by  the  Land

Office,   they   will  be  regarded   as   Unauthorised

structures  and action will be taken to demolish  them.

The demolition squad does not come from the Land Office

alone;  the  Building Control Division as well  as  the

Primary  Production Department also take  part  in  the

demolition process. I have seen notices served  by  the

Primary  Production Department to the rural  people  to

demolish  their unauthorised structures.  So  the  poor

rural  people are confronted with three big  Government

departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest to the Minister that the

Land   Office  should  handle  such  cases  with  great

sympathy and consideration. They should make a  distinc

tion  between  the  various  cases.  If  the  so-called

unauthorised  structures are put up  under  extenuating

circumstances  in  which the people concerned  have  no

alternative  but  to  add to,  change  or  alter  their

existing  structures, then proper  guidance  should  be

given to regularise the unauthorised structures instead

of  just  issuing  a  notice  to  demolish.  But  where

unauthorised  structures have been put up  for  profit-making,  then no sympathy can be expected from  Members

of Parliament. I am sure the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



concerned will have nothing  to  say  if such unauthorised  structures  are pulled down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next matter I would like to raise concerns

absence  of records in the Land Office of existing  old

buildings.  There  are cases of people  who  have  been

living  in old buildings for many years. When the  Land

Office  discovers that such a building is  not  on  its

record, a demolition order is issued. In such cases the

Member  of  Parliament  or  members  of  the  Citizens'

Consultative  Committee can certify  the  existence  of

these old buildings although they are not on record  in

the   Land   Office.   But   such   certification   and

representation by the MP and CCC are not considered  at

all. As a result, the poor rural people have to live on

the  roadside. I think liberal consideration should  be

given  to  such  cases.  I  would  therefore  urge  the

Minister  once  again to consider sympathetically  such

representations by the MPs and CCCs, or even  from  the

rural people themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Member for Changi has not only been beating

about the bush but he has also been rather unfair to me

when  he  said  that he was not informed  of  what  was

happening in the Bedok resettlement area. Unless he has

got  a  poor  memory, I informed him on  25th  October,

1974,  of  Government's decision to recover vacant  and

under-utilised land in this area amounting to  a  total

of about 47 acres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member is aware, a survey of land utilisation

in  that  area had shown that there had been widespread

breaches  of  the terms and conditions of their  leases

and  the  Temporary Occupation Licences issued  to  the

settlers. It is Government's intention to recover  such

under-utilised  vacant land from the  lessees  who  had

breached  these  terms and to use  this  land  for  the

relocation  of cottage industries and other appropriate

uses.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of a total of 58 cases affected in this exercise,

39 were previously on 16-year agriculture leases and 19

were on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



TOLs.  Notices to revert the whole of the land  to

agricultural use, in accordance with the terms and

conditions of the leases, were served  on  the  39

lessees in November, 1974, and on failure to do so

within  an  agreed  period the Land  Office  would

formally  repossess the land on 31st January  this

year.  The Land Office has, however, not yet taken

physical  occupation of the repossessed  land  nor

served  notices on the ex-lessees  to  vacate  the

land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of TOL holders, notices of

termination  of licences were served in  December,

1974,  and the land repossessed from 1st  January,

1975.  In  the  case  of  those  whose  TOLs   had

terminated,  the following action has been  taken.

Licensees who are required to give up part of  the

land  have  been so informed, and site plans  have

been  sent to them showing the portion of the land

to  be  recovered. They have been told  that  they

could  retain  the balance of the  land  on  fresh

licences, the terms and conditions of which  would

be made known later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the entire holding has been repossessed,

licensees  have  been  told  that  they  would  be

advised   in   due   course  whether   alternative

accommodation  would  be  given.  They  have  been

informed  that no compensation would be  paid  for

ancillary  structures,  crops,  etc, which   they

should  remove  from  the  land  immediately.  Ex-licensees   who   have,  in   violation   of   TOL

conditions,  allowed  other occupiers  to  operate

factories,  workshops  and  holdings   have   been

informed   that  the  Land  Office   had   resumed

possession  of the land, and the actual  occupants

have been told not to pay any further rent to  the

ex-licensees.  The Land Office  would  then  issue

separate  TOLs to occupiers who would, be  allowed

to   continue   operating  their   factories   and

workshops.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Resettlement Department is presently

investigating  to  find out whether  occupiers  or

dwellers  on  land  recovered, which, were  held

previously  under lease or TOLs should  be, given

alternative accommodation. Resettlement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



questions  are  still  under  study  by  the

Resettlement    Department.   No   workshops    or

industries  have yet been moved into the  area.  I

can  assure the Member that consideration will  be

given to regularise existing non-agricultural uses

which  can  be tolerated on the basis  of  revised

TOLs.  But  no  compensation  will  be  paid   for

ancillary structures or crops found on the land to

be  recovered, as the owners have been given ample

time to remove such structures or crops. I believe

that  the Land Office had informed the Member  for

Changi on most of the matters which I have set out

in a letter dated 20th February, 1975.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has spoken generally about

resettlement,  and  he  has complained  about  the

Land  Office.  According to him, we must  be  more

human towards cases of families growing bigger and

extensions made to accommodate them. As is  usual,

if  only repairs are done to the premises, nothing

happens.  But  when a structure is enlarged,  then

the  land  bailiffs will be on them either  asking

for   more   premiums   or  demanding   that   the

unauthorised  alterations are pulled  down.  These

are  matters on which, as far as possible, we  try

to  be as humane as ever. But when extensions  are

made  and other families move in, then we have  no

alternative but to take action. Usually  TOLs  are

granted to the persons in actual occupation so  as

to  prevent the chief licensee making money out of

subleasing  TOL  land  to the  persons  in  actual

occupation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir just now I raised the

point  about  old  structures and the absence  of  such

records  in  the  Land  Office  It  is  possible   that

these  records  could  have been lost  or  mislaid  But

if   Members   of   Parliament   or   member   of   the

Citizens'  Consultative  Committee  :could  certify  as

to  the  long-standing  existence  of  such  houses,  I

wonder   whether  sympathetic  consideration   can   be

given    to    prevent   the   demolition   of    these

structures.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, consideration is being given to such cases.

However, the members of the CCC and some of the MPs are

new,  and some of the houses may be even older. But  if

someone  occupies land on TOL from the Land Office,  it

is  usually known. It would be on record as to  whether

it  is a house or what kind of a building is there.  If

it is private land there may be no record, but if it is

Government land let out on Temporary Occupation Licence

the record is there to say what type of structure is on

it.  But  in  doubtful cases we would have to  consider

them.  If the MP has been there for many years, and  if

he  certifies its existence we will take his  word  for

it.  But, as I have said, even the CCC started only  in

1964.  Of course, ten years have passed, but they might

claim that the house is 20 years old.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister said just now

that  applications for repairs to houses would be given

sympathetic consideration. I would like to know whether

in  the  case  where the land is private land  and  the

landowner refuses to approve or endorse the application

for  repairs, I would like to know whether the  repairs

can still be carried out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Yes, they can. If they are structural alterations to

the  house,  then the occupier must get the landowner's

permission. But if it is just a case of repairs, he can

get  the  Department's approval,  not  necessarily  the

owner's approval.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, I think the Minister is mistaken when he said

that  I  was being unfair to him by saying that he  did

not  tell me about the project that was going on in the

Bedok  resettlement. Perhaps the officers  who  briefed

the  Minister  could have made the mistake.  The  first

case  of repossession of land was at Lorong Dangai  and

Koh  Sek Lim. But I was referring to a very recent case

which  was  not  acquired  for the  Bedok  resettlement

purposes.  In  this case the notice is for repossession

of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>



TOL  land  and the lessees who have been there  for  16

years  were from the Paya Lebar International  Airport.

That is why I am asking the Minister that whenever such

an  exercise  is to be carried out, the MPs  should  be

informed  beforehand, as was the case  with  the  first

repossession of land in Lorong Dangai and Koh Sek Lim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> As far as my memory goes, the MP was informed before

we  took  one  step. And when the Government  made  the

decision, I told him personally.

he will have 20 or 30 persons running to the PAP branch

to disturb his Saturday nights. But I cannot inform him

of every little thing that goes on in his constituency.

Wherever possible, we give MPs advance notice  so  that

they know what to tell the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, I am still not satisfied with the Minister's

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head S be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead CAA 11O5*.



(*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ong Teng Cheong).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at present there are many people living in attap

houses  in  the rural or suburban areas. Some  of  them

have  applied  for  HDB flats. In the  meantime  before

flats  are  allotted  to them, they  have  applied  for

permission  to  repair  their  attap  houses,  but  the

landowners did not give their approval. In his reply to

the  Member for Jurong just now, the Minister said that

even  if  landowners  did not give their  approval  for

repairs, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



village  dwellers  could carry on  with  the  necessary

repairs. So I think half of my problem has been solved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that these attap houses may not last for

another  10  or 20 years. Now if there are  people  who

live  in  dilapidated attap houses, can they  be  given

priority  for  HDB flats? Again, if after  these  attap

house  dwellers have moved in to the HDB  flats,  would

the  authorities put such attap houses in the  category

of  premises which cannot be rented or sold? If  so,  I

think the landlord or the attap house owner may not  be

too unreasonable or cruel to the tenant by refusing him

permission to repair or attempting to evict  him.  This

would be good to both landowner and tenant so that  the

landowner would not be overbearing on the tenant or not

allowing him to do this or that.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that many people who live in very

clean  HDB fiats have applied for larger flats  because

their   families   have   grown   bigger,   and   their

applications have been approved. What 1 regret is  that

the   Government   or   the  HDB  has   approved   such

applications.  HDB flat dwellers are allowed  to  apply

for  bigger flats whereas the attap house dwellers  who

do  not  have  a  decent accommodation  are  not  given

priority  for  flats. So I hope the Minister  can  give

special consideration to the attap house dwellers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, I shall wait until the Minister has replied to

the Member for Paya Lebar.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> It will probably be more convenient, Sir, if I deal

with  one  Member at a time. The Member for Paya  Lebar

wants  priority to be given for all dwellers  of  attap

houses which are about to fall down. This will lead  to

complications because more people will move into houses

that are dilapidated or attap houses that are about  to

fall  down. He wonders why we allow people to move from

one-room  to two-room or three-room flats - the  answer

is that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



families  have  grown bigger. When  they  move  into  a

bigger  flat,  the  smaller flat is available  for  the

accommodation  of some other family. That  follows  the

law.  When  the  poor attap house dweller  extends  his

house  without permission, then he is breaking the  law

and  either  the  Land Office or the  Building  Control

Division serves him with a notice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it does not mean that dwellers of attap houses

are  not  granted  priority. Where the  Government  has

acquired  the  land  for  some purpose  and  wishes  to

demolish these attap houses, they arc given alternative

accommodation provided they are eligible. But  for  the

Government to grant priority o, accommodation to  attap

house  dwellers  on  land which belongs  to  a  private

developer, Government will be only helping the  private

developers.  Surely the Member does not  consider  that

desirable - I take it that his suggestion is that every

attap house dweller must be given priority.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, if we give priority to dwellers of dilapidated

attap houses, it does not mean that when these families

move out, their houses cannot be used any more even  if

they are on private land. I believe the Government  can

resort to the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act to

acquire  the land. That is a very simple way  to  solve

the   problem,  and  it  will  not  give  the   private

landowners  any opportunity to speculate. Is  that  not

quite right?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Member may be right if he wants us to

acquire  all  the land in Singapore. We  have  acquired

large  portions of land in Singapore and the landowners

are getting a bit tired of our acquisition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, there have been grouses and complaints about

unreasonable charges and fees which one has to  pay  to

the   various  Government  departments  and  regulatory

agencies in the Ministry concerned when he submits  his

application for development, alterations and renovation

works, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, he has to pay a processing fee to the

Development Control



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>



Division,  and  this  fee  was introduced,  I  believe,

sometime early last year, or perhaps a bit earlier.  At

the same time, he has to pay another similar processing

fee to the Urban Redevelopment Authority in respect  of

car  parking  requirements. The  Minister  may  perhaps

recall that when the Urban Redevelopment Authority  was

first  established  in April, 1974,  it  introduced  an

exorbitant  charge  or fee on car parking  requirements

which  must  be  paid  by  the  applicants  before  the

applications  could  be considered  by  the  Authority.

These car parking charges often amount to thousands  of

dollars,  and  in  some instances  up  to  hundreds  of

thousands  of  dollars.  This  has  created  a  lot  of

unhappiness and had discouraged some would-be investors

in  proceeding  with their development projects.  After

numerous   complaints,  these  unpopular  car   parking

charges  were  then  waived and  replaced  later  by  a

nominal  processing  fee to the  satisfaction  of  most

people concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides the above, there are other fees to be

paid, for example, plan fees, consent fees, search fees

and  other fees. Even to look at the Master Plan at the

counter  on  the 3rd floor of the Ministry of  National

Development   building,  a  $2, fee   is   levied.   I

understand, Sir, that some charges and fees have to  be

levied in order to prevent or discourage abuses of  the

services provided. But they must be reasonable. I  only

wish  to  urge the Minister to review the  charges  and

fees  currently  chargeable by the various  departments

and  statutory bodies in his Ministry, and to  disallow

further  introduction of new levies  unless  they  have

been carefully examined and proved to be reasonable and

absolutely necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, I also wish to request the Minister to consider

waiving  the  current charges or  fees  in  respect  of

reapplications or resubmissions which are  necessitated

by  changes in Government policies and standards or due

to   the   necessity   to  comply   with   departmental

requirements.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the levy of fees for the processing of planning

applications was introduced in January, 1974,  in  line

with  the  policy  that any service  that  is  provided

should  not  be free of charge. This is  not  just  the

policy of the Ministry of National Development. It  has

been  found  that, with the introduction of  processing

fees,  architects  have  taken  greater  care  in   the

submission   of   proper  designs  and   layouts.   The

developers  also  have  been  more  definite,  as   any

subsequent  amendment would entail payment  of  further

processing fees. The introduction of these fees has, in

fact,  cut down the number of frivolous and speculative

applications.  But, as the Member has  rightly  pointed

out, sometimes this can be taken too far. Where another

fee has to be paid because the developer has to send in

amended plans to comply with Government's requirements,

then  I  am inclined to agree with the Member that  the

second  fee  should not be charged. These  are  matters

which  1 am grateful to the Member for raising in  this

House  and  which  I promise him will  be  given  every

consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of the clear explanation of the Minister,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head S be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead CCA 1109*.

(*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the Land Titles (Strata) Act, Part IV,

(Management   of   the  Building  and  the   Management

Corporation)  it  is mandatory for  the  proprietor  or

subsidiary   proprietors  to  establish  a   management

corporation upon registration of the strata title plan.

Among the duties and responsibilities of the management

corporation   is   the  maintenance   of   all   common

properties.  This is usually done by a council  elected

from among the subsidiary proprietors



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



of  the  management corporation. Of course,  the  money

required  to  maintain the property  is  paid  by  each

subsidiary  proprietor  of the management  corporation.

This  is  in  the  form of maintenance  fees  collected

monthly,   half-yearly  or  yearly  as  the  management

corporation decides. The amount is also decided by  the

corporation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, I am sure, is well aware that there

is   always  difficulty  in  obtaining  payments   from

individuals  and  so  many laws have  been  enacted  to

ensure such payments. This difficulty is also faced  by

management  corporations. However,  unlike  Government,

management  corporations  have  no  power   to   ensure

payments  of maintenance fees. There is, of  course,  a

possibility  of  management corporations  resorting  to

legal  action.  But, as is well known,  this  is  time-consuming, protracted and costly. Simple folk  live  in

strata land, and it is hardly worth the additional cost

and time to recover maintenance fees which generally is

no more than $25 to $50 per mensem.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is most depressing is that although Government

has  made  it mandatory to have management corporations

formed,  Government  is  not bothered  to  ensure  that

management   corporations  function   effectively.   To

function  effectively, a major  necessity  will  be  to

ensure the easy collection of maintenance fees. Members

serving  on  the  council  of  management  corporations

usually do so on a gratis basis. Most of them are  wage

earners and have very little time at their disposal  to

enable them, if given the power, to go round soliciting

fees  from subsidiary proprietors. I must again  stress

that  since Government introduced this legislation  for

the formation of management corporations, powers should

be   given   to  the  Building  and  Common  Properties

Maintenance and Management Unit to take action  against

subsidiary  proprietors who fail to make  the  required

maintenance payments. Penalties such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



as  fines should be introduced to enable the management

corporations to speedily recover maintenance  fees  due

to  them  so  that properly maintained properties  will

ensure a cleaner and greener Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, under the Land Titles (Strata) Act, owners of

flats registered under the Act are automatically formed

into  a  management  corporation.  The  corporation  is

required  to  elect  a management  council  to  perform

duties   and   conduct  business  on  behalf   of   the

corporation.  The corporation is required  among  other

things  to  control, manage and administer  the  common

property and to establish a fund for such purpose.



It  is  empowered to levy contributions  from  all  the

owners. If any contributor is at default, this  can  be

recovered   as   a   civil  debt  by   the   management

corporation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some management corporations have been unwilling to

take  court action against recalcitrant owners  because

of  the  reasons set out by the hon. Member for  Potong

Pasir.  There  is  now a proposal in  the  Land  Titles

(Strata) (Amendment) Bill to make it an offence if  the

subsidiary owner fails to pay or make his contribution.

I  hope this measure will succeed. But I can assure the

Member  that  if  it  is  the  Government  that  passes

legislation to form management corporations,  then,  of

course, it is our business to make them work.



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Sir, when will this Bill be presented to Parliament?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> If not during this Sitting, it will be soon after.



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Sir, the Minister says that since

Government  is  introducing this legislation,  it  will

ensure  that this legislation when passed will  empower

management corporations with tools to succeed.  On  the

tone of his reply then, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head S be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead CDA 1105*.



(*The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs P. Govindaswamy and Ho Kah Leong)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I discover that certain roads which have been

constructed   to   public   standard   are   far   from

satisfactory.   Roads  like  Lorong   Marican,   Lorong

Marzuki,  Lorong  Malayu, Lorong  Mydin,  Jalan  Ishak,

Jalan  Daud  and others, which were built according  to

public  standard, already have potholes within a  short

space   of   five  years.  If  these  roads  had   been

constructed  according to specifications,  surely  they

would not be so badly damaged within such a short time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of these roads was the

responsibility of the owners of land fronting the road.

They   were  obliged,  to  pay  to  the  PWD  for   the

construction  of these roads. On rainy days  water, is

collected  in  these  potholes. On such  occasions  the

dwellers feel that instead of getting benefits for  the

money .they have paid for such facilities, they have to

suffer.  They are dissatisfied and angry because  water

is  splashed on them when vehicles pass by. Ever  since

Changi Road, from Still Road to Geylang, was made a one-way street, these roads have been used as shortcuts for

vehicular traffic heading towards Paya Lebar.  Lorries,

motor  cars and buses all use these roads. Jumbo  buses

heading  towards  Jalan Eunos and Kaki  Bukit  terminus

from  Changi  Road  depot also use these  roads.  As  a

result  these roads, already damaged' and deteriorating

with  potholes, become even more congested,  especially

during the morning and afternoon rush hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to know whether proper supervision had been

carried  out  when  these roads were  constructed,  and

whether  the contractors had built the roads  according

to the correct specifications. .1 hope the Minister for

Law, and  National  Development  would  contact   the

Minister  concerned to ask the Traffic  Police  not  to

allow'  vehicles to pass through Lorong Marzuki, Lorong

Malayu and Lorong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



Mydin by putting up "No Entry" signs along Changi  Road

at the entrances to these roads so that they do not get

any  worse and there will not be any traffic congestion

in the morning and afternoon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Barker, as the matters raised seem to be local in

nature,  would  you like to reply first before  I  call

upon Mr Ho Kah Leong?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Yes, Sir. The Member complained about several roads

in his constituency which were built sometime ago. I do

not  know the exact reasons why they have deteriorated,

but  the matter will be looked into and the roads  put'

into proper order again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally there has been so much digging in

Singapore. There were complaints last year about  roads

and  road  surfaces and we had a whole island programme

to resurface and recondition most of our major roads. I

was  shocked  to  learn  that  in  the  course  of  the

financial  year some departments were going to  dig  up

about  80%  of  our roads, leaving only 20%  untouched,

scattered  all  over. It is no use  reconditioning  and

resurfacing  our roads, which cost so much  money,  and

then having either the PUB or the STB moving in to dig.

On the other hand, if no roads are dug up it means that

development in Singapore has come to a full stop! It is

because  of  more houses and more factories  that  more

water  pipes and more electric cables have to be  laid.

As  the  Minister in charge of roads, I feel  disgusted

when half the whole stretch of a road is dug up just to

lay  a  50-foot diameter pipe, which takes nearly  one-third of' the road. That done, a couple of months later

they do it on the' other side of the road. I have given

directions that an intensified programme to improve our

roads  be instituted,, and because taxes on motor  cars

using  the  roads  have gone up I  do  not  expect  any

difficulty in getting the necessary finance from -  the

Minister for Finance. .



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the suggestion to make the lorongs a one-way

street or to put up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



"No  entry" signs so that lorries and jumbo  buses

cannot use some of the roads that are close to the

heart  of the Member for Kampung Kembangan, I  can

only   tell  him  that  we  will  look  into  this

possibility and let him have the answer later.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, under this subhead I would

like  to ask the Minister a few questions.  As  we

all  know,  Jurong Town is the largest  industrial

town in our country. There are about 500 factories

and  the  working population number about 100,000.

But  of  all  the roads leading into Jurong  Town,

only  one  is a main road and that is Jalan  Ahmad

Ibrahim. Therefore, there is bad congestion during

peak   hours  and  even  during  non-peak   hours.

Although  the  factories in Jurong have  staggered

their  working hours in answer to the Ministry  of

Communications' request, traffic congestion  there

is  still  not alleviated. I think the Member  for

Bukit  Panjang  can  confirm this  because  he  is

working there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would like to ask the Minister what plans

are there to build other roads leading into Jurong

Town.  If it is just a question of expanding Jalan

Ahmad  Ibrahim, it will not solve the  matter.  At

the moment at the mouth of Jurong River there is a

bridge built by a contractor. The bridge links  up

Jalan Buroh and Jalan Penjuru, and the other  road

along  the  west coast. I would like  to  ask  the

Minister whether he will permit vehicular  traffic

to   make   use  of  the  bridge  built  by   this

contractor. I feel that the bridge must be  strong

enough  because  it has been used  by  lorries  to

carry earth. If the PWD thinks that the bridge  is

not  strong  enough,  then I  would  like  to  ask

whether  this  department has any  plan  to  build

other  bridges. In my opinion this bridge is  very

useful in helping to solve the traffic problem  in

Jurong.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is in regard to traffic lights.

A request has been made to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



the  authority  concerned for the installation  of

traffic  lights  along Corporation  Drive  at  the

junction of Yung Kuang Road. Up to now, there  are

still  no  lights. I would like  to  know  whether

traffic lights will be installed there and at  the

junction  because traffic accidents have  occurred

there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the last question first. At the moment, the

junction at Corporation Drive and Yung Kuang  Road

is  controlled  by stop lines and stop  signs.  At

Yung  Kuang  Road, which is a minor road,  traffic

lights  will be installed at this junction  during

this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the bridge in question, it was built by a

JTC contractor in 1970 for its earthwork contract.

On completion of the contract, the central pontoon

stand  of  the  temporary bridge was removed  last

December.  In  fact,  JTC is  in  the  process  of

dismantling the rest of this temporary  bridge.  I

am  not  in  charge of JTC, but I  understand  the

Member has suggested that we build another bridge.

Is that correct?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> We will look into it. As for major roads leading

to  or  out of Jurong Town, there are no plans  at

present.  There  have been complaints  of  traffic

jams  within Jurong Town and of traffic congestion

along  the  approach road, Upper Ayer Rajah  Road,

leading   to   Jurong  Town  during  peak   hours,

especially  when ice-skaters are on their  way  to

the rink. The PWD is now widening Upper Ayer Rajah

Road  to  a  six-lane carriageway to ease  traffic

congestion.  The work is expected to be  completed

in October this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other bottlenecks on the approach road to

Jurong  Town  are at the Ayer Rajah/Clementi  Road

Circus  and Jurong Town Circus. The conversion  of

the   former   into  a  traffic  light  controlled

intersection is in progress and is expected to  be

completed  by  the end of June. The  PWD  is  also

looking  into a similar conversion of  the  Jurong

Town Circus.
