<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Nobody ever

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> - under the Standing Order. Sir,

in  rising to move, "That the Bill be now  read  a

Second time," I want to stress, first of all, that

it is not normal government practice to compensate

its  officers  for loss of expectation  of  career

where such officers are prematurely retired. It is

common knowledge that all Government officers hold

office  at  pleasure, and so long as the requisite

notice  is  given for termination of service,  the

person can have no claim on the Crown. This  Bill,

Sir, to compensate expatriate officers for loss of

career as a result of Malayanisation of the public

service, is therefore an unusual measure  to  meet

changes    brought    about   by    constitutional

advancement in Singapore. Up to now, the Secretary

of  State  has been responsible for the expatriate

officers  who  came  out  here  expecting  a  full

career,  that is to say, a career in  the  service

until  the  normal  retiring  age.  Constitutional

changes  have brought about a frustration of  this

expectation  of  a full career,  for  one  of  the

fundamental rights of a self-governing country  is

that  it  must have control of its public  service

and no outside authority must be in a position  to

determine  appointments, promotions and discipline

in  respect  of the civil service. The  Government

not  only cherishes this right of determining  its

own  civil  service matters, but is  of  the  firm

conviction  that true self-government means  that

the  entire  control  of the government  machinery

must  vest in the local people. The people of  the

country   must   solve  their  own  problems   and

determine  what is best for them. A civil  service

staffed and dominated by expatriate officers  will

make  self-government a mockery.  We  are  on  the

threshold  of  self-government and it  is  of  the

greatest  urgency that we must prepare  to  govern

ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said yesterday, in moving the adoption of the

Government's policy on Malayanisation, that it  is

the  Government's  firm view  that  the  principal

civil  service advisers of Ministers must be local

men. The most effective way of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>

achieving  the  objective in the determination  of

our  own  civil  service is  to  remove  from  the

Secretary  of  State  and the Governor  the  final

control over those officers who were appointed  by

the  Secretary of State, and this is brought about

by   the   establishment  of  a   Public   Service

Commission  with  executive powers.  Hon.  Members

will hear from the Hon. the Chief Secretary in due

course how the new Public Service Commission  will

work  before our present constitution is  amended.

To  all  intents  and  purposes,  the  new  Public

Service Commission will be executive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these measures, Sir, have brought about a

change  in  the  conditions  of  service  of   the

expatriate  officers, and it is for these  reasons

that a compensation scheme has been negotiated and

agreed  with  the Staff Associations  representing

them.  During the negotiations we were in constant

touch  with  the Federation Government  to  ensure

that their scheme and ours were as nearly the same

as  possible. The only material difference  is  in

the  ceiling of the compensation, and this is  due

to  the  generally  higher  emoluments  ruling  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is urgency in bringing this scheme into

operation  as  soon as possible,  for  without  it

planned Malayanisation cannot proceed, and  we  do

want  early  Malayanisation of the public  service

which,  as I have pointed out, is both a political

and  an  administrative necessity. I do urge  hon.

Members  to  view the need of this  Bill  in  this

setting,  and  not to make it more  difficult  for

officers whose careers are already frustrated as a

result  of  constitutional progress in  Singapore.

Let  us  not look back into the past, but  let  us

look  forward to the future to see how we can make

these   expatriate  officers  go   willingly   and

cheerfully.  Our task will be made  all  the  less

difficult if during the interim period both  local

and  expatriate officers will co-operate  fully  to

make  the  change-over as smooth as  possible  and

with  the least friction. I have said that we must

look  forward to the future to see how we can make

these   expatriate  officers  go   willingly   and

cheerfully. I should have also said, Sir, that  we

should  also look to the future to see how we  can

make these expatriate officers remain willingly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>



and  cheerfully where we need them. I said  in  my

speech  yesterday, in introducing the White  Paper

on the Government's Malayanisation policy, that it

is better to be without an officer than to have an

unwilling one. An officer who is retained  in  the

service  against his wish is not only  useless  to

the  service,  but is a potential  danger  to  the

service. I fully appreciate that there is always a

danger of a mass exodus of expatriate officers and

that  it  might  have a deterrent  effect  if  the

scheme   now   before  the  House  provides   half

compensation instead of full compensation to those

officers   who   wish   to   leave   without   the

Government's  permission. This principle  of  half

compensation was recommended by the Malayanisation

Commission  and  was supported by a  statement  in

this  House  in June this year by the  then  Chief

Minister,  the Member for Cairnhill.  Since  June,

Sir,  we  have given further careful consideration

to  this  question of half compensation  and  have

come to the conclusion that although it may have a

deterrent effect on officers going without  the

Government's permission, the result  may  well  be

that we have a service staffed with a large number

of  discontented officers. Discontentment added to

frustration of a full career may well be  the  end

of  efficiency in the government machinery. It  is

also clear that any half compensation scheme would

have  met  with firm resistance from the Secretary

of  State.  In  view of Her Majesty's Government's

declared  policy  that once  an  executive  Public

Service   Commission  has  been   introduced   and

conditions  of  service have been changed  by  the

removal of ultimate control from the Secretary  of

State, officers will receive compensation for loss

of  career. Also, Sir, other colonial governments,

seeking  to introduce a compensation scheme,  have

accepted   the   principle   that   no   clear-cut

distinction  can  be  drawn  between  the   actual

termination   of  a  career,  through   compulsory

retirement,  and an officer's right  to  terminate

his own career once his conditions of service have

been  materially  altered.  The  career  of  every

officer  in  the  service, even if the  Government

wishes  to  retain  him  for  several  years,   is

automatically  prejudiced  from  the  moment   the

Government's intention



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>



is made known. There can be no guarantee that he

will be able to get the job if he stays for as

long as the Government wants his service, and he

must have the right to go after giving reasonable

notice at the time most convenient to him. A more

satisfactory result is likely to be achieved under

the present scheme which I consider gives every

expatriate officer a fair deal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have stated earlier, Sir, that there have been

very   close  consultations  with  the  Federation

Government.  A  similar scheme  has  already  been

approved by the Federation Legislative Council. We

are  now on the threshold of self-government.  Let

us  show the world that in our attainment of self-determination  the  people of Singapore  can show

understanding  and appreciation  of  the  services

rendered  to Singapore by expatriate officers  who

will  suffer a loss of career resultant  upon  our

gain towards nationhood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some hon. Members will like to know how we

arrived  at those figures shown in the  tables  at

the end of the Bill. On this, I would like to draw

the    attention   of   hon.   Members   to    the

Malayanisation  Commission's  recommendation  that

the  services of an actuary should be enlisted  to

compute  the amount of compensation and  that  the

main basis should be the capital value of loss  in

respect of future salary and pension less that  of

prospective future employment. The calculations by

actuaries,  both  those  briefed  by   the   Staff

Associations and by the Government, indicate  that

any  scheme  based on a pure actuarial calculation

of  loss will be completely out of line with other

schemes and would produce compensation at  a  rate

very   much   in  excess  of  that  now  proposed:

something like a factor of seven at the  peak  age

of  loss  compared with 4.96 that has been  agreed

with the Staff Associations. The figures, Sir,  in

Table B of the Second Schedule to the Bill are the

result   of   hard  bargaining  with   the   Staff

Associations.  Under  this scheme  any  expatriate

officer  who retires during the operative  period,

which  is  five years from 1st January, 1957,  may

have  his  compensation calculated at any  interim

date  between 1st January, 1957, and his  date  of

retirement which is most



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>



advantageous  to  him. This is not  an  ungenerous

inducement  and  I  hope  that  members   of   the

expatriate service will take advantage of this and

give their co-operation during this interim period.

Let us part as friends and not as enemies, so that

when  we  do meet again, we shall be able to  look

back and smile and say the job was well done.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Who is going to pay their

passage out to the United Kingdom?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Some hon. Members, and indeed

some  members  of the public, may be staggered  at

the  total  cost of compensation and  the  highest

amount  which an expatriate officer may expect  to

get  under  this scheme. The total  cost  of  this

scheme,  Sir, will be approximately $21.4  million

which  will be spread over a number of years until

the  last expatriate officer leaves these  shores.

Against this expenditure of $21.4 million, we must

not forget the amount of savings that we will have

as a result of dispensing with the services of the

expatriate officers. The estimated saving is about

$5 million a year when the last expatriate officer

leaves  this  country.  The  savings  will  be  in

expatriation  pay, passages and hotel  allowances,

plus  the number of man-days saved, because  there

will  be  no  long furloughs every  two  or  three

years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Now we know what has been going on!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If the -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would like to remind hon.

Members of a Standing Order which says that  while

a  Member is speaking, all other Members shall  be

silent. I have allowed interjections in the  past,

but  these  interjections have become  longer  and

longer.  If there is to be an intervention,  there

is a Standing Order which allows an hon. Member to

get  up and if the Member speaking gives way, then

that hon. Member can make his intervention.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Thank you, Sir. As I said just now before the interruption, the

savings will be in expatriation pay, passages  and

hotel allowances,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>

plus  the number of man-days saved, because  there

will  be  no  long furloughs every  two  or  three

years.  If the expatriate officers go as  we  have

planned  in  accordance with the  picture  in  the

White   Paper   on   Malayanisation   adopted   at

yesterday's  sitting,  the  savings  that  can  be

effected on account of Malayanisation will be half

a  million dollars per year by 1st January,  1958;

by  1st January, 1959, it will be $1.1 million per

year:  by  1st  January, 1960,  it  will  be  $2.3

million;  by  1st January, 1961,  it  will  be  $3

million;  by 1st January, 1962, it will be  nearly

$4  million,  and so on until the last  expatriate

officer  leaves  our  service,  when  it  will  be

approximately $5 million a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the ceiling of £11,900

receivable  by an expatriate officer on retirement

under Malayanisation, I would like to stress  that

very  few officers will, in fact, get this amount.

To  be  exact,  the  number of  officers  in  this

category  is  12,  and  other  officers  will  get

varying amounts from £11,900 to £534.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the amount of pensions payable in addition

to  the compensation, I would like to remind  hon.

Members  that  we must pay these pensions  in  any

case when the officers ultimately retire from  the

public  service. By the premature retirement,  the

total pension bill will, in fact, be reduced.  If,

therefore, we now strike a quick balance, we  will

have an expenditure of $21.4 million spread over a

number  of  years against savings of $5 million  a

year plus a smaller pension bill, and I am sure in

the  end we will not be badly off. Sir, I  beg  to

move.

this House to recognise the fact that they have no

alternative, I fully support, without reservation,

the Bill before us. But I think the Chief Minister

and  his  colleagues will be at  one  with  me  in

understanding  the cry of pain of  the  people  of

Singapore  at  what many deem to  be  extortionate

compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said that the basis of this

compensation is for termination of the expectation

of  a full career by the civil servants. Sir, most

of  these  500  civil  servants  who  are  sharing

between  them the $21.4 million, averaging $43,000

per  person - a  sum, Sir, which not  many  in  this

country  can  save  in a lifetime - $43,000  without

income  tax plus pension - I say that many of  those

who are sharing this have been appointed since the

liberation.  It  is  my  impression,  Sir  - I   am

prepared to be corrected by the Chief Secretary if

he  can - that Her Majesty's Government, through her

Secretary  of State for the Colonies  and  through

her Prime Minister, have repeatedly indicated that

it is the intention of Her Majesty's Government to

see  that the Federation and Singapore should soon

achieve self-determination. Consequently, if it is

suggested  that cadets of the ages  of  20  to  23

appointed around 1946 to 1956 were told that  they

could  expect a full career in Singapore, it would

mean  that  there  has been a fraud  perpetrated - a

fraud  perpetrated either on them by the  Colonial

Office  which,  if  it  intended  to  fulfill  the

undertaking of Her Majesty's Government  to  grant

self-government, must have known  full  well  that

none  of these officers could expect a full career

in  the  colonies, or a fraud perpetrated on  this

territory - the fraud being, Sir, that they  led  us

to  believe  that  it was the intention  to  grant

early  self-determination when there was, in fact,

no  such  intention at all and in practice.  Civil

servants             were             continuously

recruited - youngsters - and  told  that  they   could

expect  a  full career of more than 40  years.  In

these  circumstances, Sir, on whoever  it  may  be

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>



the fraud has been perpetrated, it is obvious that

the  fraud is at the door of the Colonial  Office,

and  I ask the Government of Singapore to consider

sending this bill to Her Majesty's Government  for

payment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have but one other comment to make, Sir. As I

say, though the sum is large, the conditions under

which  we are compelled to fork out are such  that

we  might even consider ourselves lucky that it is

only $21.4 million. I would also draw attention to

the fact that those whose careers are supposed  to

be  terminated are in some instances granted  back

their careers of more than five years and in  some

cases  ten years. Therefore, Sir, they are  really

getting double payment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask whether it is possible to reconsider

the  question of limiting payments in  respect  of

those  who seek to leave the territory when it  is

not  convenient  to Government's phasing  plan.  I

would  ask Government, even though it may be late,

to  consider this aspect, because otherwise it may

mean  that not only do we spend $21.4 million  but

we  may  have to spend a great deal more in short-term  contracts,  which are never  attractive,  to

bring  out specialists to fill the technical posts

which I have in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, Sir, that there will be criticism of this

measure,  but  I  do ask Members on  the  opposite

side,  when  they consider it, to  appreciate  the

acute  difficulties  in which the  Government  has

found   itself  and  of  which  they  have   ample

indication.



<br><br>10.32 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  this  Bill  has been termed the  "Retirement

from  the  Public Service (Compensation) Bill".  I

think it would be more appropriate to call it  the

"Public Service (Sweepstake) Bill". Judging by the

nature  of  the give-away prizes, I  should  think

there are now three ways in which an Englishman in

tax-ridden Britain can get rich:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Win a football pool;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Be a barrow boy and not pay income tax;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Go to the colonies and be abolished.



<br><br>We  were told, when we wanted these men - or  rather

when our masters wanted these men to come - that  we

had  to  pay  the price for them, to  attract  and

retain  their rare qualities. Now that we have  to

get rid of them for the excellent reasons given by

the  Hon. the Chief Minister, we are told that  we

have  to pay through our noses to get them out  of

the  place. We could wax quite eloquent and bitter

about  this  if we went on and recounted  all  the

dirty  tricks that have been going on in the past,

all  the  machinations,  all  the  fictitious  and

fabulous  reasons why we should have  these  white

men  rule  us. But it was not really the fault  of

this   handful  of  white  men.  They  just   took

advantage  of  the  situation.  They  were   human

beings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what does trouble us is, who is going to pay

for  this?  The  Chief Minister gave  us  logical,

coherent  reasons why we are, in  fact,  going  to

save, and why, by implication, we have been losing

millions of dollars every year. But let me compute

the figures in a way which the people of Singapore

will understand better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$21.4 million - what can that money buy for the

people  of  Singapore?  We  were  told,  when  the

Government  was putting up their housing  schemes,

that  one  housing unit would cost $4,000.  Divide

$21.4  million  by  $4,000 and  we  get  somewhere

around 7,100 housing units. Seven people at  least

can  be  housed  in one housing unit.  That  means

50,000  people  could be housed with  this  money.

Those  are  the  terms in cost to  the  people  of

Singapore.  The  white man's  burden  is  becoming

somewhat heavy for the black taxpayer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present Chief Minister is a much more

modest  man  than his predecessor. His predecessor

always  went gallantly out in front and got  shot!

The  present Chief Minister carefully chose to  go

behind  the  Tunku's sarong! First,  he  gets  the

Federation  Government to say that $74 million  is

the price for freedom. I wish I could believe that

$74 million is the only price for freedom.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>



Then, that having become a fait accompli, he comes

before  this  Assembly  to  tell  us  how  careful

consideration,  careful co-ordination  and  careful

husbandry has produced these fantastic figures  at

the  end  of  the  table.  He  says  he  willingly

undertakes the burden because he wants  the  white

men  to go willingly and cheerfully and hope  that

those   who  remain  behind  will  remain   behind

willingly  and  cheerfully. We  like  willing  and

cheerful people, but not at this expense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is going to pay for this? We are told that it

is  going  to be a phased programme and  that  the

cost will be spread over many years. Be that as it

may,   someone  must  find  the  money.  If   this

Government  wants to show the people of  Singapore

that  it is not throwing away the people's  money,

that  it  is  not  acting like  company  directors

giving  large bonuses to themselves and all  their

friends  at the shareholders' expense, they  might

consider  a  capital levy on white  enterprise  in

this  country to pay for this. I do not think  the

suggestion  of  the Member for Cairnhill  that  we

should present the bill to the Secretary of  State

for the Colonies would be a practical proposition.

Britain, on the verge of economic bankruptcy after

a  gamble on the Suez Canal, is not likely  to  be

able  to  afford anything like the  fabulous  sums

their  white  agents require. But  we  have  white

vested  interests in this country subject  to  our

fiscal laws and I am all in favour of their paying

off  this  handful of European civil servants  who

have  held  the  ring for this group  of  European

enterprising businessmen to make money out of this

country.  I think it is only fair and decent  that

they  should  share their spoils  with  all  these

honourable,  hardworking, efficient administrators

who  have kept the shop going while their  friends

do  business.  I  have looked up  the  income  tax

figures  on public limited companies. I think  the

majority  of  the  public  limited  companies,  as

opposed   to   private  limited   companies,   are

European.  The  Chinese, and I think  the  Indians

too,  prefer  not to publish their accounts  every

year.  They prefer to form little family concerns.

The returns of a straight levy of 20 per cent just

for one year on profits would produce the required

sum. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>



Financial Secretary will correct me if I am  wrong

and  give  us  the correct figure. My  computation

shows  that  a  straight levy of 20  per  cent  on

profits  for  one  year would produce  this  $21.4

million  which  will keep all the  European  civil

servants  happy. We also will be happy, and  those

who  are unhappy we can afford to ignore. That,  I

think,  is the spirit in which we should  approach

this problem. We do not really want to take it out

of  this hard-working group of guardians who  have

been  looking after our interests. We wish them  a

happy  retirement. We hope they will  be  able  to

find  their  way to some other colonial  territory

from  which  they will be abolished at some  later

date,  so  that they will again have  another  big

sweepstake with which to buy a little house in the

south  downs  of  England and  live  happily  ever

after.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

said yesterday during the debate on Malayanisation

of  the  civil  service,  "Let  us  part  as  good

friends"; but at the same time I would not like to

incur the wrath of the taxpayers who have sent  me

to  this Assembly. It is possible that most of the

Members  on the Government Benches may  not  stand

for  the next election. This may be the reason why

they   are   putting  before  us   such   a   huge

compensation Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Minister said that we must satisfy

the  frustrated men. I do agree with him that  the

local  men  should get their rightful  place.  The

Chief  Minister also said that we do not  want  an

unwilling civil servant to work for us. The remedy

is   to  dismiss  him  if  he  is  unwilling   and

discontented.  The  third  thing  that  the  Chief

Minister said was that he thought there might be a

mass  exodus. Why? After all, the expatriates  are

paid  to serve us. It is for us to say who are  to

leave and who are to stay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the compensation that we are

proposing to pay to those who would like to leave?

Is  there  any  comparison?  Have  we  taken  into

consideration the terms of compensation to be paid

in the other British colonies?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>



I understand Nigeria paid £5,000 or something like

that  to  each  expatriate.  As  far  as  we   are

concerned,   I   believe  we   are   copying   the

Federation's  scheme. Even then  I  think  we  are

paying  more than what the Federation pays.  I  do

agree  in  principle that when we do not  want  an

expatriate, we must give him abolition terms which

are  reasonable; but if we go beyond that, I think

we  will  only be hurting ourselves as we have  to

pay out from the taxpayers' money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has touched the right

note   in   his   speech   when   he   said   that

Malayanisation  was  coming.  Sir,  the   Colonial

Office  knew  very  well that  Malayanisation  was

coming.  In  1952  when  the previous  Legislative

Council  passed  my motion on Malayanisation,  the

expatriates knew that in a short time  they  would

be  going out. How many have been brought in since

then  and joined the service as newcomers?  Should

they  get  such  a big sum - as my good  friend  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar has said - a sweepstake  or

a lottery?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do say, "Let bygones be bygones." But we

have to look to the future because we have to  put

up   the  money.  In  this  connection  the  Chief

Minister has said that he has done a lot  of  hard

bargaining  with  the  expatriates.  Is  it   hard

bargaining  when we are paying the most  that  any

British  colony has ever paid to the  expatriates?

Sir, after gaining a lump sum in compensation, the

expatriate   who   leaves  will  certainly   serve

somewhere   else.   Has  that  been   taken   into

consideration? Has the Government also  considered

the fact that these expatriates will still be able

to  serve in other places for many years? I wonder

whether  the Government has considered the  points

which I have raised.



<br><br>10.47 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, in the old days the colonial  rulers

had  a  theory to explain why it was necessary  to

pay  higher  and  fatter  salaries  to  expatriate

officers. It was claimed that expatriate officers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>



had  to be paid more because that was the only way

to  attract and retain them in service. They  were

hard  to  come  by. It was therefore necessary  to

compensate them for self-exile in the outposts  of

the  Empire  by  rewarding them with  expatriation

pay,  better conditions of service and  so  forth.

That was the theory before Malayanisation. We  had

to attract and retain expatriate officers who were

most reluctant to bear the white man's burden.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have a new theory. Now that Malayanisation

is  on  the  cards, the theory is that  they  need

inducements  to leave this attractive country.  To

judge by the abolition terms now being offered, it

appears  that it is more expensive to get them  to

leave their jobs than it was to attract and retain

them. We must pay them handsomely to take jobs  in

the  colony. We must pay through our noses to  get

them to give up their jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scale of compensation being offered by the

Singapore  Government  is  far  higher  than  that

offered  by  any  other country so far,  including

India.  Let  us  be clear about the  right  of  an

expatriate officer to abolition terms. It is not a

legal  right.  An employer does not  guarantee  an

employee a job for life. No firm in Singapore, not

even   European  firms,  can  guarantee   that   a

discharged employee must be compensated  for  loss

of  a  career. I cannot understand why this  vague

moral  claim  should  be  made  an  occasion   for

outright   plunder  of  the  taxpayer.  Generosity

towards  its  employees  has  not  been  a  marked

feature of Government. Certainly when postmen  and

daily-rated workers of the Government asked for  a

miserable  addition  of  one  dollar  a  day,  the

Government  never failed to beat  its  breast  and

mourn  about impending bankruptcy. But $21 million

is being gladly given away to highly-paid European

officers. I cannot be a party to this.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>



attention  of  the  House  the  rather  Gilbertian

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Yes, Sir. Sir, in my opening

speech just now, I made reference to the Report of

the  Malayanisation Commission. This is to be  our

Bible. On this Commission were the representatives

of various political Parties. Although they sat on

the  Commission  not as representatives  of  their

Parties,  they  were  and  still  are  members  of

Parties represented in this Assembly and each  and

every one of them did say in this Report that,  in

fairness  to the people who have served  us,  they

should be paid some measure of compensation.  They

did even recommend that the services of an actuary

should be obtained, and I did say earlier in  this

debate  that the Government as well as  the  Staff

Association had briefed actuaries to work out  the

factor on the basis recommended in this Bible, and

the actuaries, on that basis, recommended a factor

of seven; and here this Government negotiated with

the Staff Associations representing people who are

now going to lose their careers in the service  of

this Govern-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>



ment, and both of us agreed that a factor of  4.96

would  be  fair  to the people of  Singapore.  Yet

these  people are being maligned in this Assembly.

If  they had stuck to their guns, they might  have

obtained a factor of seven as recommended in  this

Report.  They felt that they had to play the  game

right to the end to the people of Singapore.  Sir,

we  have  two Members in this House who  claim  to

represent  the workers of Singapore. Yesterday  we

heard the Member for Tanjong Pagar raise a hue and

cry  because  the  workers,  he  felt,  are  being

intimidated  and exploited by the employers.  Sir,

his  warped mind seems to think that workers,  and

only workers, are black people-

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I withdraw it. The Member for

Tanjong  Pagar,  Sir,  has  a  peculiar  sense  of

appreciation of the justice that should  be  meted

out  to workers. On the one hand, there should  be

would  get the same amount of compensation. It  is

not so, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir, I

have  the Governor's consent under Standing  Order

33  to  move, "That the Bill be now read a  Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Chief Minister mentioned just now, Sir,

this  Bill  is designed to introduce an  executive

public  service  and thereby enable  Singapore  at

this  stage to obtain control over its  own  civil

service.  The Bill, in the main, Sir, incorporates

the   recommendations  on  the   Public   Services

Commission  which were made by the  Malayanisation

Commission  in Part VI of its Majority Report.  As

hon.  Members will no doubt recall, there were,  I

think, two main recommendations which were made by

the    Malayanisation   Commission.   The    first

recommendation was that the Public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>



Services Commission should have executive  control

over appointments, promotions, dismissals, and the

discipline  of government officers in  the  public

service.  That, as I will explain in a moment,  we

seek to achieve through this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second major recommendation was that the

composition  of  the  Public  Services  Commission

should be changed in that the Chairman should be a

Malayan  and that the membership of the Commission

should be enlarged from two to five members. As  I

have  said,  Sir,  with some few exceptions,  this

Bill incorporates the recommendations made on  the

Public Services Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, one very obvious peculiarity

about  this Bill, and that is, although as I  have

said  it  seeks  to  establish  a  Public  Service

Commission  with executive control, in fact,  that

is  the one thing which is missing from the  Bill.

Clauses 13 and 14 of the Bill, which lay down  the

functions  of the Commission, prescribe  that  the

Commission  shall  only advise the  Governor.  The

reason for this apparent contradiction is that  at

the  present stage, when we are still governed  by

the present Singapore Colony Order in Council,  it

would  not be proper by legislation here to  over-rule the provisions of section 11 of the Singapore

Colony Order in Council; but, as was explained  in

the  White  Paper on Malayanisation, the Secretary

of  State has agreed that, save as regards  a  few

specified appointments, the Governor shall act  on

the   advice  of  the  Public  Service  Commission

subject   only   to   the   right   to   refer   a

recommendation  back to the Commission  once,  and

once  only. The Secretary of State has agreed  and

that  agreement  will be embodied in  Instructions

sent  from the Secretary of State to the Governor;

and  in  due  course we expect that a  new  Colony

Order  in Council will be made, and when  that  is

made,  then  it will provide formally and  finally

for   the   Public  Service  Commission  to   have

executive authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The functions of the Commission, as set out in

clauses  12, 13 and 14 of the Bill, can be divided

into  two  types. There is, first, those functions

in which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>



the  Commission's advice will be accepted  by  the

Governor.  Those  are the functions  specified  in

clause   13,   namely,  appointments,  promotions,

transfers,   dismissals  and   discipline.   Other

matters such as schemes of service, qualifications

for  appointment, which are dealt with in  clauses

12  and  14, will  not be matters  for  executive

decision by the Commission. I think the reason for

this  should  be  apparent in that,  for  example,

while   it   is  proper  that  a  Public   Service

Commission  should apply a code of  discipline  to

individual   officers  and  that  it   should   be

responsible for enforcing that code, it should not

be responsible for drawing up the code itself. The

code  itself  is  at  present  prescribed  in  our

various  Government  regulations  and  that   code

should   be  subject  to  the  decision   of   the

Government  and  not  to  the  decision   of   the

Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another field in which also it would not

be right that the Public Service Commission should

have  the  final  word. I refer, Sir,  to  matters

which are the subject of negotiation between Staff

Associations and the Government: such matters, for

example,  as  rates  of  pay  where  we  have  now

established   a   machinery   for   the   officers

concerned,  through their Staff  Associations,  to

make  their claims and do their negotiating direct

with the Government. It would not, in the view  of

the  Government,  Sir, be  right  that  the  Staff

Associations  should in any  way  be  deprived  of

their   right   to  negotiate  direct   with   the

Government on matters such as pay, and indeed  the

Staff  Associations have already got the  ultimate

right to go to arbitration on those issues. It  is

true   that   certainly  in  one  other   country,

Australia,  the Public Service Commission  or  its

equivalent  has  been  given  authority   by   the

Government  to  fix rates of pay, but  we  do  not

think  that  we  should, at least at  this  stage,

adopt that procedure here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matters which are the proper field for

negotiation between the Staff Associations and the

Government  have  been defined in  the  agreements

which  now  exist between the Government  and  the

Staff Associations covering the Civil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>

Service Joint Council and covering the arbitration

agreement,  and  I  would like to  make  it  quite

clear,  Sir, that nothing in this Bill will affect

the  existing  rights and procedure of  the  Staff

Associations in those matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should perhaps draw the attention of hon.

Members   to  the  fact  that  the  judiciary   is

deliberately excluded from the operation  of  this

Bill.  As  was  explained by  the  Chief  Minister

yesterday,   the  question  of  appointments   and

dismissals   of   Judges  is  a   matter   to   be

incorporated in constitutional arrangements and it

is  a  matter which will be for discussion at  the

constitutional  conference  in  London,  and   the

results  of  that  discussion  will  no  doubt  be

incorporated  in  a new Order in  Council  in  due

course.   So   it   is  that  the   judiciary   is

deliberately  excluded from the field  covered  by

this  Bill and it may be that a separate  Judicial

Service Commission will ultimately be agreed upon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think there is any other particular

point  that I need mention at this stage,  Sir. I

would,  in conclusion, repeat that this  Bill  re-enacts   the  provisions  of  the  present  Public

Services  Commission Ordinance with the amendments

which  follow  from  the  recommendations  of  the

Malayanisation Commission. The reasons for  asking

that   the  Bill  should  be  put  through  on   a

Certificate  of Urgency are, of course,  that,  as

Members  will have seen from the White  Paper,  we

wish to start Malayanisation if possible from  the

1st  of  January next year and we wish to get  the

new  Public Service Commission established so that

it  can  start its task at the beginning  of  next

year by selecting the first local officers to take

over the nine posts of Permanent Secretary grade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one further point which I think I should

mention,  and that is that it is the intention  of

the Government that the contents of this Bill will

be  included  in the new Colony Order  in  Council

which  the Chief Minister hopes to obtain  in  the

near  future.  There again, that is in  accordance

with  the  recommendations of  the  Malayanisation

Commission   which   was   emphatic    that    the

composition, establishment and the working



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>



of   the  Public  Service  Commission  should   be

enshrined  in  an  Order in Council  so  that  the

Commission  is shielded from day-to-day  decisions

in the Legislative Assembly. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.14 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, we support the

principle of the Bill. The proposed Public Service

Commission differs from the previous one  in  that

it  will  serve  different ends and  work  towards

different goals. The old Commission was  a  purely

advisory  body  and unless the Governor  chose  to

accept its recommendations, its deliberations  and

decisions would come to nought. Now for the  first

time  we  shall have a Commission whose  conscious

aim  would  be  to  select men  of  integrity  and

ability  to  work the apparatus of state,  men  on

whose  integrity and ability the future  efficient

administration of this country depends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whilst we are all in agreement with the

machinery which this Bill proposes to set  up,  we

have very grave doubts as to the intentions of the

Government, or perhaps it may be of the  Governor,

with  respect to the men to be chosen to fill this

Commission.  Singapore is a small  place  and  one

hears  all  kinds of curious goings-on. There  are

even  rumours that a distinguished record  in  the

field of sports might win somebody a seat on  this

Commission. There are also rumours that an  office

in  some established church might entitle a person

to   a   seat   on  this  Commission.   There   is

considerable dissatisfaction over the  person  who

is   unofficially  the  Chairman-elect   of   this

Commission. Sir, if this group of five men are not

people  with  imagination, ability  and  learning,

they  will  not be able correctly to appraise  the

candidates  and choose the men who  will  run  the

government machine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absolutely vital that the features which

have  marked the old Commission - feeble and  flabby

men  chosen  to sit on the Commission  because  of

their   docility  and  servility  to  a   colonial

government, men who dare not take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>



over  the chairmanship of the Commission  until  a

white  man  has shown them how to do it - should  be

wiped out. In the proposed Commission we must  put

men who are going to choose the future workers  of

the  State  on  the  basis of ability,  integrity,

drive  and a spirit of independence, not a  spirit

of servility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the service today is filled by the English-educated elite. Most of the people in the service

are either our friends, our neighbours or were our

class or college mates; and we know the gibes that

are going on amongst the student generation - if you

want a good cushy job in the service, then be nice

to  your  professor, be nice to your  master,  and

keep  clear  of  politics and other dangerous  and

controversial issues. The result is that  we  will

have,  at  best,  an able but a docile  instrument

with no imagination and no guts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another type of students, those who have

rebelled  against the system, those with  a  great

deal of drive, impatient and exasperated with  the

existing system, so much so as to want to go  over

to  the  other  extreme and to destroy  the  whole

machinery of government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question of the Public Service Commission

was  one of the issues which divided the political

Parties  when they went to London. We stated  then

and we say it now that we will not be bound unless

it is done with scrupulous honesty. We will not be

bound  by the men whom the Governor may choose  to

put  on  this Commission. If we are going to  have

people   who  have  distinguished  themselves   by

looking after the sporting interests of the Colony

of  Singapore to sit on this Commission, then  let

us scrap the whole thing. Let us have the boldness

and  courage to choose men who, whether  we  agree

with  their political views or not, are men  whose

spirited opposition to colonialism, whose  fervent

desire  to see an independent and vigorous country

free  and absolutely divorced from all those evils

of  colonialism, will be able to choose other  men

who  will  be as equally spirited and  as  equally

determined to build this independent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>



State.  With  this one reservation concerning  the

personnel  of  the Public Service  Commission,  we

support the machinery which this Bill proposes  to

set up.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, in clause 14 (b) it is

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Commission shall advise the Governor on all

questions relating to the following matters:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any representations concerning Schemes of Service

which may be referred to the Commission by the  Governor;".



<br><br>In the previous Public Services Commission

Ordinance (Chapter 59), section 11(1)  (e)  says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Commission shall advise the Governor on all

questions relating to the following matters:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any representations concerning terms of service which

may be addressed to the Commission by any body of

officers;".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the Staff Associations

have  expressed  considerable  opposition  to  the

alteration  made  to section 11  (1)   (e)   of  the

Ordinance now to be repealed. I would like to hear

the  reasons  for the alteration in the  terms  of

that particular provision.



<br><br>11.26 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> The hon. Member, Sir, is correct that

the  old  Ordinance  included section  11(1)   (e) ,

which  meant that any body of officers could  make

representations to the Public Services  Commission

on  any  matter, and we have been in  consultation

with the representatives of the Staff Side on  the

Whitley  Council over the appropriate  wording  in

this  Bill. I think I can say with confidence that

there  is  no  divergence  of  views  between  the

Government Side and the Staff Side in this matter.

We  are  agreed  that there are certain  important

matters  which now should not go to  an  executive

Public  Service  Commission,  as  I  indicated  in

moving  my  motion. We are also agreed that  there

are  other matters, such as representations on the

general  principles of promotion, over  which  the

Staff  Side  should still have the right  to  make

representations  to  an executive  Public  Service

Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government came to the conclusion that

they  could  not incorporate in the new  Bill  the

very  wide wording which appears in section  11(1)

(e)   of the existing Ordinance, because that would

lay  open the possibility at least that the Public

Service  Commission would infringe on  this  field

with  executive decisions where we and  the  Staff

Side  are  agreed that they should  not  infringe,

namely, matters for direct negotiation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it would not be improper for me to add

that  we did attempt a new wording to go into this

clause  of  the  Bill,  to try  and  define  those

matters on which it is quite proper that the Staff

Side  should  make representations to  the  Public

Service Commission and those matters which  should

be excluded. We have not, unfortunately, been able

to  arrive  at  a definition which is satisfactory

and we have therefore not attempted any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>



definition  at  all.  I have tried  to  cover  the

matter  to some extent in speaking on the Bill.  I

would   just   add  that  if  we  could   find   a

satisfactory  definition, working in  consultation

with the Staff Side and indeed with any assistance

which  the hon. Member could give us, then I think

we  could certainly get that additional clause put

into  the Order in Council in due course to  cover

the point which the hon. Member raised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Could the Chief Secretary

explain  to us what is intended by the  change  of

the  phrase  "terms  of service"  to  "schemes  of

service"? It seems to me that there is very little

difference  in the actual meaning of  the  phrase,

but  some  difference in meaning  must  have  been

intended before the phrase was altered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> To me, Sir, as a government officer,

there  is  an  essential  difference  between  the

phrase   "schemes  of  service"  and   "terms   of

service". "Terms of service" primarily mean things

like  rates of pay. "Schemes of service" primarily

mean  things like the qualifications required  for

entering a particular service, the length of  time

you  will have to be in it, the opportunities  for

promotion, the pyramid from the number of posts at

the  bottom up to the top and so on. They are,  to

me  at  any rate and I think to the public service

generally,  quite  different.  Perhaps  the   hon.

Member will accept that assurance from me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> There is one further point on

the  same  clause, which I wish to direct  to  the

Hon. the  Attorney-General. In every one  of  the

clauses  where there are sub-clauses and  sub-sub-clauses, it is the practice to put clause 14  (1) ,

then (a) , (b) , (c) ; then 14 (2)  (a) , (b) , (c) . But

it  is  not the practice in this Bill and in every

other  Bill  before this House to put a sub-clause

using  the  alphabet when there is  no  sub-clause

using a number. Perhaps the Attorney-General would

like to correct me.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Sir, I have His Excellency's consent to

proceed with this Bill and beg to move, "That  the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.   Members  will  recall  that  in  a  public

statement  issued on 19th November, attention  was

drawn   to  the  need  to  conserve  supplies   of

petroleum  fuel  in view of the situation  in  the

Middle East and the possibility that deliveries of

petroleum  products from normal sources of  supply

might suffer a slight decrease in frequency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also pointed out in that statement that

the  Governments of Singapore and  the  Federation

would be most reluctant to introduce rationing  of

petroleum products but that it was desirable  that

steps should be taken to review the administrative

arrangements  necessary for  the  introduction  of

rationing so that a suitable scheme could  be  put

into  effect  with  the minimum of  inconvenience,

should such a step ever become necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the preliminary measures to be taken,

this  Bill,  Sir,  has been  drawn  up  to  enable

control  over  the distribution and  rationing  of

petroleum fuels and lubricants to be brought  into

effect  if  and when required. This  is  solely  a

precautionary  measure  and  it  does  not  mean - I

repeat,   Sir,   it   does  not   mean - that   the

introduction of rationing in the immediate  future

is   contemplated.  Before  rationing   could   be

introduced,  it would still be necessary  for  the

Governor  to  bring the Ordinance  into  force  by

notification in the Gazette.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw the attention of hon.

Members  to clause 4 under which the Minister  has

the power to apply, by order, such sections of the

Ordinance as might be necessary. This would  mean,

Sir,  that  the Minister, if and when he considers

it  necessary that rationing should be introduced,

would make such an order applicable to any of  the

items



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>



or all of the items stated in the Schedule to this

Bill. Rationing would then come into force at that

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position, in brief, Sir, therefore is that we

must be ready to ration should the necessity arise

and that it will not be possible for us to do this

unless this legislation is passed. I repeat,  Sir,

that  the presentation of this Bill does not  mean

that  there is any present intention to  introduce

rationing. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.38 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, in no independent

territory  in South-East Asia has there  been  any

need  for  hasty legislation precipitated  by  the

adventures of the British and French armies in the

Middle  East. If ever anybody doubted that we  are

tied up with the destinies and the misfortunes  of

the  British  and their Empire,  this  Bill  is  a

timely reminder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had in the past few weeks a stream of

reassuring   statements  as  to  the   supply   of

petroleum  from  all  the  distributors   of   oil

products.  We  were, in fact,  reminded  that  our

source  of petroleum comes from the East  and  not

from  the Middle East. But it was pointed  out  by

some  Government  spokesmen that it  might  become

necessary  to  divert the supplies available  from

the Indonesian islands to Britain, because Britain

might  be short. As far as I know, neither  Ceylon

nor  India  nor  Pakistan nor Indonesia  has  been

affected by what has been termed "Eden's war".  As

a  gesture  of protest, we will vote against  this

Bill.  We are against British imperialism. We  are

against British militarism. We are against Britain

anywhere in the world where she tries to subjugate

other people, let alone try to re-subjugate a once

subject people who have become free. We will  not,

I  repeat not, share their misfortunes as a result

of  their  stupid and brutal acts  in  the  Middle

East.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Sir, I would like

to  know  where we get our supplies of petrol  for

our requirements. Is it from the Middle East or is

it from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I would like to get an

answer  from  the Minister before  I  go  further.

Without his answer, I am in the dark.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Can the Minister give that

answer now?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, as I understand it, most

of  our  supplies come from Indonesian territories

and  from Borneo, but we do draw a certain  amount

of supplies from the Middle East. Certain types of

fuel come from the Middle East. The refineries  in

Borneo  are,  to a certain extent,  supplied  with

petroleum from the Middle East.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Does the Member for Telok

Ayer want to continue now?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I might want to later on, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, I really do not understand  why  we

should  have  this  Bill before  us  now.  Britain

blundered in the Middle East. Let Britain pay! Why

should we suffer for Britain's blunder? Enough  of

this stuff about the British Commonwealth which is

a  symbol of the brotherhood of nations within the

British  Commonwealth and which was  displayed  by

the   British   Canberra  bombers  over   Egyptian

territory!  We cannot take the blame of  the  weak

and stupid man, the Prime Minister of Britain, who

has blundered. If there is any shortage of petrol,

the  petroleum  companies should inform  us.  Only

very  recently  these  companies  have  issued   a

statement  in  the  Straits Times  that  there  is

enough petrol for the consumption of this side  of

the world. If we take the blame or share the blame

for the crime committed by Britain, it is up to us

to make it up to our victim



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>



also  , I would suggest, Sir, that we should  make

up to the Egyptian Government -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Hear, hear! Get the Governor's

consent!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> I will! Sir, I suggest that this

Government  make  a  cash  gift  to  the  Egyptian

Government of £1 million.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. May I ask the hon.

Member to confine his speech to the Bill?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Sir, I am confining myself to the

Bill  because  the  Minister, when  he  moved  the

Second  Reading, said that this Bill was necessary

because  of  the crisis in the Middle East.  I  am

only  referring  to  that. So I  give  you  formal

notice,  Sir, that I am going to move a motion  at

the  next sitting of the Legislative Assembly that

this  Government  must donate £1  million  to  the

Egyptian Government as a relief fund. This is more

or  less  conscience money because we are  also  a

part   of   the   British  Commonwealth.   Britain

blundered   and,   as  a  result,   the   Egyptian

Government suffered, and this £1 million  will  be

in   the   form  of  a  relief  to  the   Egyptian

Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I should like to

remind  the  hon. Member that he must confine  his

speech to the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Sir, I have said what I had to say

and  I  just wish to remind the House  that  I  am

going  to move a motion. I do not think Mr Deputy

Speaker  will stop me by saying that this  is  not

relevant.  I wish to point out that if this  House

is  competent  to  debate an issue  which  is  the

result of the Suez Canal dispute, then this  House

is  also competent to debate the motion which I am

going   to  move  at  the  next  sitting  of   the

Legislative Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

understood from the answer to my question that  we

get  our  supplies of petroleum from  our  nearest

territory. If that is so, I do not think we should

be  deprived  of our share of petroleum  which  we

have been regularly getting. If England and France

have made mistakes in the Middle East, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>



their  problem.  We should not be made  to  suffer

here.  If  the  oil  companies do  take  away  our

portion of supplies and send it elsewhere, I think

it  will  not  be  fair  to this  colony.  Sir,  I

understand  that this Bill is only a precautionary

measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Minister, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, Sir. The arguments that

have  been put up against the introduction of this

Bill  were  political arguments and did  not  have

much  bearing on the Bill. I did not say  that  we

are   getting   our  supplies  from  the   nearest

territory.  What  I  said was  that  most  of  our

supplies come from Indonesia and Borneo, but we do

get a certain amount from the Middle East.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park mentioned that Britain

blundered,  so let Britain pay. That,  Sir,  is  a

matter  of  opinion  of individuals,  but,  in  my

opinion, that has no bearing on this Bill which is

a   precautionary   measure.  Whoever   blundered,

whoever  has to pay for it, is one thing,  but  we

must be ready to see that there is no chaos in our

petrol supply position, and that is why this  Bill

is  necessary,  as  it will enable  the  necessary

machinery  to  be set up so that we  will  not  be

caught  napping in the event that it is imperative

that petrol rationing should be introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer mentioned that we

should  not  be made to suffer and be deprived  of

our petrol supplies because of Britain's action in

the  Middle East. I repeat, Sir, that  it  is  not

contemplated   to   introduce   petrol   rationing

immediately, but this Bill is to enable  machinery

to  be  set  up  so  that if and when  it  becomes

necessary, because of conditions which are  beyond

our  control,  we  would  be  ready  to  meet  the

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petroleum supplies to Singapore are controlled

from  Britain.  There  is  also  the  question  of

tankers.  We do not own any tankers, and we  might

find  that,  because of the diversion of  tankers,

the reduced tanker-carrying capacity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>



may  not bring us sufficient supplies of petroleum

in  the future; and whether we like it or not, and

whether we agree as to who is to blame or  who  is

not  to blame, we will have to face the situation,

and  that  is  why this Bill has been  brought  up

before this Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had reminded hon. Members that on 7th November,

1956,  the rates of duty on unmanufactured tobacco

were  raised from $4.40 per pound full  and  $4.20

per pound preferential to $6.00 per pound full and

$5.80  per pound preferential by virtue of Customs

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now say, Sir, that subsequently representations

were  made  by the trade to the effect  that  this

increase  of duty on leaf tobacco would  adversely

affect the local cigar manufacturing industry  and

increase  the  cost of what was  mainly  the  poor

man's   smoke.  The  Government  considered  these

representations and, as I reported to the Assembly

on  20th  November, agreed to reduce the rates  of

duty   on  unmanufactured  tobacco  to  pre-Budget

levels. A Gazette Notification to this effect  was

published on 3rd December, and the object of  this

motion,  Sir,  is  to obtain the  consent  of  the

Assembly to this reduction in duty. Sir, I beg  to

motion  moved  by  my  hon. Friend  the  Financial

Secretary. Sir, when the Financial Secretary  laid

his  taxation proposals before this House  at  the

Budget sittings, the rate of duty on this item was

proposed   to   be  increased.  Later   on,   Sir,

representations  were made to me by  manufacturers

that  the  local industry dealing with  this  item

would   suffer   and,  as  a   result   of   their

representations, the Government has  taken  action

in  the interests of the local industry and of the

poorer  section  of the community who  smoke  this

type  of  cigarettes and cigars. I would  like  to

emphasise,  Sir,  that Government  has  been  very

democratic   in   having   listened    to    these

representations.  Sir,  there  have  been  charges

levied  against  the Government in  the  past  for

being undemocratic, but this is one instance where

the  Government  shows  that  it  does  listen  to

representations if they are genuine.

7 of 1956, be referred to this Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this motion, I would like to

refresh  the memory of hon. Members that, pursuant

to  a resolution passed on 9th February this year,

a  Select  Committee  was  appointed  to  examine,

report upon and make recommendations in respect of

matters necessary to enable effect to be given  to

the  proposal  that,  for  the  purposes  of  oral

debate,  the languages of the Assembly  should  be

English,  Malay,  Mandarin  and  Tamil.  You  will

remember,  Sir,  that  you were  Chairman  of  the

Committee  and  a  report of  that  Committee  was

tabled as Sessional Paper No. L.A. 7 of 1956.  The

Committee  was unable, within the little  time  at

their disposal,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>



to  conclude their investigations, and recommended

that  a  similar Select Committee be appointed  in

the  next session of the Legislative Assembly, and

that  Paper  S.C. Languages No. 3 annexed  to  the

Report   should   be  referred  to   that   Select

Committee. The purpose of this motion, Sir, is  to

give effect to this recommendation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, enough has been said on the need

for  multi-lingualism in an Assembly  in  a  place

like  Singapore.  Certain objections  were  voiced

during  the debate in February this year,  one  of

which   was   that  the  introduction  of   multi-lingualism   would   tend  to   encourage   racial

consciousness and racial antagonisms.  I  consider

that objection to be a very dangerous one, putting

ideas into people's heads. After all, language  is

a  means of communication of ideas and to say that

it will tend to encourage racial consciousness and

racial  antagonisms is deliberately putting  ideas

into  people's heads. Is multi-lingualism  not  in

use  in  our everyday lives, since the  people  of

different races came to live in Singapore? I speak

at  least  three  languages  with  members  of  my

family, with my friends and with my staff  in  the

office, and I am sure other Members of this  House

also  do  the same, and indeed, some may be  using

more  than three languages in their everyday life.

It  is grossly unfair that a man born in Singapore

with all his birthrights or is otherwise qualified

cannot  sit  in this House and help  in  governing

this  country simply because he is unable to speak

English. Let us all not pretend in this House that

it  is  only  through English that we can  express

ourselves  clearly and forcefully. I am sure  that

at moments some of us feel that if multilingualism

were in use we would have put more force into  our

arguments and with a firmer conviction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope that the day will not be

far away when every person born in Singapore or is

otherwise qualified will be enabled to sit in this

Assembly irrespective of the language in which  he

was  educated.  It is also my fervent  hope,  Sir,

that  the  Select Committee to he appointed  under

this motion today



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>



will  deal with this matter expeditiously so  that

multi-lingualism  will become a  reality  and  not

remain  as an academic discussion. Sir, I  beg  to

move.

Singapore Youth Sports Centre Incorporation  Bill,

as  contained in Sessional Paper No.  L.A.  13  of

1956, be adopted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Youth Sports Centre

Incorporation  Bill  was  committed  to  a  Select

Committee and from Sessional Paper No. L.A. 13  of

1956,  it  will be seen that the Select  Committee

held three meetings. The minutes of these meetings

can  be  found in Appendix III and in Appendix  IV

Members  will find the minutes of the  meeting  at

which  the  Committee  heard  evidence  from   the

President of the Singapore Youth Council, the Hon.

Secretary  of the Federation of Boys'  Clubs,  and

the pro. tem. Secretary/Organiser of the Singapore

Youth Sports Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due regard has been paid to the representations

made both orally and in writing, and, as a result,

the composition of the Board detailed in clause  3

(4)  has been altered. The number of members to  be

nominated  by the Minister for Labour and  Welfare

has  been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>



reduced to one, and the Singapore  Youth

Council now has the right to nominate four instead

of  two members. In addition, the Singapore Junior

Chamber  of Commerce has been given the  right  to

nominate  one  member.  These  changes,  as   hon.

Members will realise, make certain that youth will

be well represented on the Board of Management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining amendments are either consequential

or  for  the purpose of improving the drafting  of

the Bill. Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the Report of the Select

Committee be adopted."



<br><br>2.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, I have a

very  small  point  to make.  I  think  that  many

Members  of this House are conscious of  the  fact

that  in the City Court every day there are  about

800   cases  of  hawkers,  and  a  very   material

proportion of the number of hawkers are  juveniles

under the age of 16 and youths between 16 and  25.

The   City   Magistrate,  Sir,  has   considerable

experience  of  the youths who appear  before  him

hawking  without  a licence, and every  Magistrate

sitting in that Court has expressed concern  about

the  activities  of  these youths  who  learn,  so

young,  to  flout the law because of the necessity

of  living. Sir, it is true that it might not seem

within  the scope of the Bill that will be  before

us  to  consider  the youths who hawk,  but  I  am

conscious that the City Magistrate is very anxious

to  try and do something for these youths;  and  I

would  like to suggest that when Government  makes

its  appointments to this Board of Management,  it

will  consider nominating the City Magistrate pro.

tem.,  whoever he may be, so that that portion  of

the  population  with which he is  in  contact  by

virtue  of  his position can have some  assistance

through him, and he can give guidance to the Board

of  Management in its activities to  give  helpful

opportunities for the young.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my hope, Sir, that the Government will

consider the whole problem of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>



the  welfare  of these youths in the  not  distant

future  and the possibility of the creation  of  a

Young  Hawkers Welfare Board which would  utilise,

as  a  commencement,  the  quarter  of  a  million

dollars  or  more a year in fines from hawkers  in

order  to rehabilitate the youths. But I think  we

can start now if the Government would consider the

appointment to the Board of Management of the City

Magistrate  in  order to assist the activities  of

the Board.

which  we  are  considering at the moment  is  the

Singapore  Youth Sports Centre Incorporation  Bill

and  is  in  connection with a sports  centre  for

youth. While I do share the feelings of the Member

for Cairnhill for the welfare of young hawkers and

while I do agree with him that the City Magistrate

is  in  a  position  to assist the  Government  in

looking  after their welfare, I find it  difficult

to   see  how  his  membership  on  the  Board  of

Management  of a sports centre can be of  help  to

the  persons  whom he has expressed  a  desire  to

help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the welfare of youthful hawkers is

concerned, I have taken note of all that the  hon.

Member has said and will direct the Department  of

Social  Welfare  to  make a  close  study  of  the

problem and put up suggestions for the improvement

of these people.

<div align="center"><b>APPLICATION FOR DRIVING LICENCES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Minister for Communications  and  Works

said yesterday that he would prefer a debate on my

question    rather   than   answer   supplementary

questions, and in reply to that question, Sir,  he

stated  that a language qualification is necessary

to  qualify for a driving licence, that is, either

English or Malay. In my opinion, Sir, there is  no

connection between a language qualification and  a

driving  licence. As long as the applicant  for  a

driving  licence is competent to drive  a  vehicle

without  jeopardising the lives of the public  and

he has some knowledge of the Highway Code, I think

he   should  be  given  a  licence.  Sir,  if  the

applicant  is  going for a job  where  he  has  to

control labour, speaking either English or  Malay,

then he has to have a knowledge of these languages

in  order to make himself understood. Or if a  man

is  applying for a special language appointment in

an academy, then I have no reason to disagree with

the  Minister that that language qualification  is

necessary.  But in this instance, it  is  entirely

nonsense   to  enforce  a  law  where  a  language

qualification is necessary for a driving licence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if in the opinion of the Minister a

language qualification is necessary, why should it

be  in English and Malay only? What is wrong  with

the Chinese language? What is wrong with the Tamil

language?  As the Minister has said,  we  here  in

Singapore  speak  so many languages.  So  what  is

wrong with languages other than Malay and English?

By  this, I hope the Malays will not misunderstand

me  or that I am casting any reflection on them or

their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>



language. What I am trying to point out,  Sir,  is

the  language  concerned which an  applicant  must

know  before he can qualify for a driving licence.

As  we  all know, Singapore is a place where there

are  many  nationalities - the English, the  Malays,

the  Chinese, the Tamils, the Eurasians and so on.

If  Singapore  has  a  state  language,  then,  of

course, we have to speak that language. I remember

the   Chief  Secretary  at  one  time  said   that

Singapore has no state religion. So if we have  no

state  religion and no state language, why  should

Malay be a compulsory language qualification for a

driving licence?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the local district councils come into

being,  there  will  be  four  languages  for  the

purpose  of oral debate. In this Assembly we  have

just  appointed a Select Committee to go into  the

question  of  languages for the  purpose  of  oral

debate.  The Chief Minister has just said that  he

hopes  the  day will not be far off  when  several

languages  will be used in this Assembly  for  the

purpose  of  oral  debate so  that  we  could  all

express our views in a more forceful way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should say that the present Road Traffic

Ordinance  is  out  of  date.  This  Ordinance,  I

suppose,  was framed by the colonial officers  and

not  by an elected government. Now, sitting on the

Front  Benches, we have a row of elected Ministers

with  the  exception  of  three  ex-officios;  and

unfortunately, Sir, the Minister who is in  charge

of  this matter is a Nominated Minister and not an

elected  one.  I think that is the reason  why  he

cannot understand the views of the general public.

He  has his own views as a Nominated Minister,  so

he can have his way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister may put forward one reason for this insistence on Malay as a language qualification, and that is, most of the police constables are Malays, and as such applicants for a driving licence should be able at least to speak Malay. If that is so, then I think it is entirely wrong,

Sir. In the Courts, we have Court interpreters and

in   some   offices  I  think   there   are   also

interpreters  who  are  engaged  for  the  job  of

interpreting for the benefit of the public. Can we

not have Chinese or Indian testers, instead of confining ourselves to Malay and English



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>



testers?  The Government should try  to  help  the

applicant who comes to apply for a driving licence

and  try  to  understand his  language.  Even  the

"Safety First" literature issued by the Government

is  printed in four languages! So why should there

be this insistence that an applicant for a driving

licence  must be able to speak either  English  or

Malay?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one more comment I want to make on the

Traffic Department, and that is an application for

a  date  for a driving test. I have here,  Sir,  a

licence  which  was issued on 14th January,  1956,

and  the  learner in question applied for  a  test

yesterday,   i.e.   5th   December.   On   it   is

endorsed - "Test booked for 17th May, 1957".  So  it

takes  the Department five months and twelve  days

before  it  can test the applicant. Is that  fair,

Sir?  A provisional licence is only valid for  six

months  and  it  costs  the applicant  $10.  After

applying  for a provisional licence,  the  learner

will  have to take up a course of driving under  a

tutor. It does not mean that by just applying  for

a  licence he is fixed for a test. When  he  feels

that he is ready for a test, which may be in three

months'  time,  he goes to the Traffic  Department

and  applies for a date for a test. This will take

another five months and twelve days plus the three

months  during which he is learning how to  drive,

which  makes  it  eight months  and  twelve  days,

before he could sit for a test. By that time, Sir,

the  licence has already expired and the applicant

will  have  to  pay  another $10  to  get  another

provisional  licence. If he is  fortunate  enough,

Sir,  within  that eight months he  may  pass  the

test; but if he is unfortunate because of language

disqualification,  he  may  fail  the  test,   and

because  he has failed, he will have to  wait  for

another month before he can apply for a date. Then

again  he will have to wait for another six months

before  he can have the actual test. All  in  all.

Sir,  it  may take 16 months before a learner  can

qualify for a test: three months learning  how  to

drive a vehicle; six months for the first booking:

a wait of one month because of his failure to pass

the  test  the  first time; and then  another  six

months  before  he goes for his second  test.  And

having to wait all this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>



time,  I am afraid he will have forgotten  how  to

drive!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from all this, Sir, there is the question

of  cost  to the learner. As I have said,  Sir,  a

provisional licence is valid for only six  months,

and  in  this  16  months the  licence  will  have

expired  three times. All in all, he will have  to

pay  $30 for the licence. On top of that, when  he

applies for a test, he will have to pay $5 for it,

and if he takes two tests to pass, he will have to

pay $10. So the total cost will come to $40 for  a

provisional  licence, and all this is  apart  from

the  fee that he has to pay his driving tutor  and

the  cost  of petrol while he is learning  how  to

drive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest, Sir, that all bookings for a

driving test be cancelled immediately and that  as

many  applicants  as  possible  who  come  to  the

Department  be tested. In the morning  they  could

register those who have come to register and  test

them  and  those who have not been tested  in  the

morning  could  be  tested in the  afternoon,  and

those  who  have not been tested in the  afternoon

should get priority for a test the next morning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason that the Minister may give to

account  for  the applicant for a driving  licence

having  to wait such a long time before he can  be

tested  is that there is a big backlog of work  in

the Department. I think it is all wrong. It is the

inefficiency  of  the Department rather  than  the

backlog that is at the root of all this delay. The

backlog  is caused by bookings because a  learner,

as  soon as he gets a provisional driving licence,

books for a date irrespective of whether or not he

is  ready  to  go for a test. The reason  for  his

immediate booking is that he wants to catch up  on

the  time that he is forced to wait before  he  is

tested.  Unless he books immediately, he may  have

to  pay  $40  or $50 before he finally passes  his

test.  Now after booking that date for a test,  it

may  be  that when the time comes he is not  ready

and  he consequently fails to pass the test.  Then

another  booking  date  is  given.  So  if   these

bookings are allowed to carry on and on, it is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>



Department which is creating a backlog and not the

public. The public are forced into it. So  if  the

Minister  could  arrange for all  bookings  to  be

cancelled  and the applicants tested  as  soon  as

they  come  to the Department, I think that  would

help to clear the backlog.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one other comment to make, Sir. If a

learner fails a test, I think he has the right  to

demand  why he has failed the test or how  he  has

failed the test. Sir, there is a printed statement

to  the  effect that testers are not  required  to

give  reasons for failing an applicant.  I  wonder

who    has   given   that   authority    to    the

Department - that testers are not required  to  give

reasons  for  failing an applicant?  When  I  went

through  the Road Traffic Ordinance, I  could  not

find anything at all to indicate that that is  so.

How  come  then that this statement  is  there?  I

cannot understand. Is it on the initiative of  the

officer in charge, or is it with the permission of

this  Assembly  or  the  Minister  himself?  As  a

learner who has failed his driving test, he should

be told where and how he has gone wrong so that he

will  be  able  to correct himself,  and  when  he

appears for the next test he will be able to guard

against his faults and drive properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, Sir, I feel that the applicant's

tutor  should  accompany him when he  goes  for  a

test,  because the tutor should also know how  his

pupil  failed. According to law, only two  persons

are  allowed in the vehicle, that is,  the  driver

(in this case, the learner) and the tester. But  I

have  seen many cases, Sir, where the tester takes

the learner out in his vehicle and he brings along

a police officer or another tester who sits at the

back  of  the car. If the law only says  two,  why

then allow four where the police are concerned? So

I  would suggest, Sir, that the next time  that  a

learner   goes  for  a  test,  his  tutor   should

accompany  him and so would be able  to  know  the

faults of his pupil and then correct him later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is high time that the Road Traffic

Ordinance  be  revised. Whether  the  Minister  is

nominated  or  elected, I think he should  consult

his  colleagues  who are mostly elected  Ministers

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>



revise  the Ordinance which should suit the people

and not the Minister himself.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just to round

off  the  many  points raised by  the  Member  for

Queenstown in his speech, perhaps the hon.  Member

has  forgotten  to mention that if he  wants  this

driving  test  in all the various languages,  then

all the traffic signs should be multilingual.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I think I have pointed out before in

this  Assembly, Mr Speaker, Sir, that Members  of

the Opposition are advised not to get heated until

they  find out what the facts of the case are.  We

have  heard  stirring claims from the  Member  for

Queenstown  about  inefficiency  and  backlog  and

scrap  this  and  destroy that.  He  has  drawn  a

painful picture of a man who has bought a car  and

has obtained a provisional driving licence and has

started  practising. After three months  he  says,

"Well,  I can go ahead now and apply for a  test."

After  six months he goes for a test and he fails,

of  course, because he has only had nine months of

practice  and  does not feel confident.  He  tries

again but keeps failing. All that takes 16 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the fact of the matter is that

the  Department  is  working to  capacity  on  the

following  basis. There were six testers  in  1955

and  the number was increased to 12 at the end  of

1955 and to 18 in June of this year. The number is

now  120 persons tested a day and the testers  are

working to capacity. If you want to put your  name

down for a booking, you will get it about 165 days

ahead.  I  am advised that that is the approximate

date  at the moment. But what the hon. Member  has

overlooked and what he could find out if  he  made

enquiries either from the Traffic Branch  or  from

me  is  that, in fact, about 50 per cent of  those

who  put their names down for bookings do not make

use  of  them.  The booking is primarily  a  thing

which  serves the needs of the person who is going

to  buy  a  car and who has a provisional  driving

licence  and who goes to a school of motoring  and

says,  "I will take a six-month course and then  I

will  go for my test." At the same time as he gets

a licence he puts his name



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>



down  for a test, and he knows what date  he  will

have  to  be ready for and then he goes along  and

takes  it. If he has any doubts about his driving,

he  will  write  in and say, "I will  postpone  my

driving test because I do not feel quite ready for

it  yet." Consequently the booking of tests  is  a

real convenience to the public. But if you want to

get a test in a hurry, I am assured by the Traffic

Branch  that you can get one at very short notice,

certainly within one week. So if the hon. Member's

friend,  who  has  applied  and  got  it  on   5th

December, 1956, and got a date for a test on  17th

May,  1957, feels in a hurry, he can go  along  to

the Traffic Branch and try to get a booking. If he

does not get one in a reasonable space of time, he

can   go  to  a  Licensing  Officer,  and  if  the

Licensing  Officer does not give him satisfaction,

he  can  go to the hon. Member and the hon. Member

can  speak to me about it and we will see what  we

can  do  about it. In short, I do not  think  this

backlog  is  a  thing which matters in  the  least

because, as I say, as things are going at present,

there  is every possibility that a man will get  a

test  within two or three days, at the most within

one  week.  If there was any question of priority,

of  course priority would be given to those  whose

needs are obviously greatest, such as the man  who

has  got a car, or who wants to buy a car for  his

business, or a man whose livelihood depends on it,

that  is, a professional syce driver, and  so  on.

There  may be a few cases where there is  hardship

of  some sort or another. That is inevitable  when

you  are dealing with an enormous number of people

who are not subject to orders and you have got  to

get  them through as quickly as you can. If a  man

feels  that  he  has hardship,  he  should  see  a

Licensing Officer, and if he still feels  that  he

is having hardship, he can of course go higher.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About this question of testing, I might mention

that   representatives   of   important   motoring

organisations  with a large Asian membership  were

invited  not so long ago to watch the testing  and

to   express  their  views,  and  they  were  very

favourably impressed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other main question was the question of

multilingualism.  I  will  first  take  the  point

raised by the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>



Tanjong   Pagar  about  traffic  signs   in   four

languages. The object of a driving sign is that it

should be something which can be quickly seen  and

interpreted by a person who is moving in a vehicle

which  is  perhaps going of 20, 25 or 30 miles  an

hour, and he cannot stop and linger and study  the

thing in the way that a pedestrian can. If you are

going to have a notice board with traffic signs in

four  languages, it will have to be a  very  large

board to get the writing big enough to be seen and

even  then it might be confusing because one  goes

up  and  down, one goes across, and one  goes  the

other way. Then, of course, if you do not have  it

big  enough,  it  will  be illegible  for  anybody

except  a pedestrian who goes and stands in  front

of it. The answer to that, I think, is that as far

as  possible all signs should be symbols which can

be  understood by anybody, regardless of language.

It  is not always possible to provide satisfactory

symbols,  but we are frequently making changes  to

them and trying to improve them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is the question of a language

qualification.   I  stated  yesterday   that   the

applicant  for a test has to have a  knowledge  of

either  English  or  colloquial  Malay.  That,  of

course,  is not, to my nominated mind, a brilliant

idea  but it is in the 1948 Rules. I cannot accept

responsibility  for  drafting this  qualification,

but  I  am  prepared to accept responsibility  for

changing  it.  I  should like  to  clear  up  what

perhaps  is a misapprehension in the hon. Member's

mind   that  many  people  fail  because  of  this

language qualification. The qualification is there

because you must have some means of communication.

You  must  have  some means of  understanding  the

language between the driver and the tester and, in

fact,  the traffic police, I am assured, interpret

it very generously and as long as they are able to

understand each other, that is about all  that  is

required. They tell me that, although they do  not

keep  figures  of the people who fail specifically

on  the grounds of language - because the number  is

too small to be worth recording - they do, in fact,

keep figures of the reasons for failure. As far as

they can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>



break  down the figures, they do not think  it  is

more than one or two persons out of 3,000 tested a

month  who  fail because of language difficulties.

That is a very minute proportion and even that  is

a  guesswork figure. The causes of failure are, of

course,    inability   to   perform    the    road

test - starting and parking and turning and all  the

other  things that you have to do in a road  test.

When   a   question  is  asked  of  an  applicant,

allowance  is made for the fact that  he  may  not

speak good English or Malay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of language, there is also the

point   which  the  hon.  Member  mentioned   that

motorists  on the road should desirably have  some

language of communication in case a driver  has  a

minor  accident  or in case he  has  to  be  given

directions  in  case of an emergency,  and  if  he

cannot understand the term "Turn right" or "Pusing

kanan",  or  whatever the policeman says  to  him,

well,  he  is going to be in a difficult position.

No doubt it is an insignificant point because most

motorists do not get into emergencies and  do  not

have to be given instructions by the police. It is

not   that   which   lies  behind   the   language

qualification.   It   is  really   a   matter   of

administrative efficiency. The system  of  testing

is  that  every  one of the 18 testers  can  speak

English  and Malay and consequently can  take  any

applicant for a driving licence. The applicants do

not know beforehand who is going to test them.  If

you  are  going  to  introduce  a  Hokchew  or   a

Cantonese  tester, or whatever  tester  you  like,

then  everyone  who is going for a  test  in  that

language will know that Mr So-and-so is  the  man

who  is  going  to test him and nobody  else.  The

effect  of  that  would be that they  would,  from

experience in the past, put very great pressure on

him  or temptation in his way so that he will pass

them  through  the  test.  That  is  a  matter  of

experience.  I  do not remember any allegation  in

the  past  that there had been corruption  amongst

the  testers. I am happy to say that I am  assured

again  that  there is no question at  all  of  the

complete  honesty of the testers now,  and  in  my

view  it  is  very important that public  servants

doing this difficult job should be protected



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>



from any allegation that they have been corrupt in

their  contact with the "testee". If  you  put  it

down that Mr So-and-so is the man who is going to

test  all  the  applicants speaking his  language,

then allegations of corruption and, of course, the

possibility  of  real  corruption  will  certainly

start.  That is a very important point,  I  think,

for  making  sure that the applicant  cannot  know

beforehand  who is going to test him. Moreover  if

the applicant fails, he goes to a different tester

on his second test, and if he fails again, he goes

to  a  different tester again. This is  partly  to

protect  him just in case there was some  personal

dislike on the part of the tester, or on the  part

of the "testee" for that matter. The simple answer

to  all  this,  of  course, is that  every  tester

should be able to speak every language or dialect,

but  it  is  not easy to get testers of the  right

character  and  ability and  education  and  other

qualifications required, and if we were to  insist

that  they  also had to be fully multilingual,  it

would  be  almost impossible to get the number  of

testers you need.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just mentioning these difficulties because

the  effect  of  the  language qualification  lies

largely in the administration



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>



of  these  tests, the need to see  that  they  are

efficiently  conducted and  do  not  lead  to  any

allegations of unfairness. I do not say  that  the

difficulties   which   I   have   mentioned    are

insuperable  and  I propose to try  and  get  them

overcome. I am going to give instructions that Kuo-yu  should  be  allowed as a  third  language  for

testing, and I think suitable arrangements can  be

made  to deal with that at present. If we can  add

further  languages or dialects  at  a  later  date

without  damaging the efficiency or  lowering  the

standards   of  driving,  then  I  will  certainly

consider  them further. I think Kuo-yu  will  meet

the  major needs at the moment and if we find that

that  is successful and if there is a clear demand

or  reason for further languages or dialects to be

added to meet the needs of the public, I think  we

can consider them further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.
