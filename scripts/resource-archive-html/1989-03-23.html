  <br>
  <!-- Encik Abbas Abu Amin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Encik Abbas Abu Amin</b> asked the Minister for National Development what is the future development plan for the former Singapore Armed Forces camp area in Dover Road and the vacant land near the Buona Vista Mass Rapid Transit Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of National Development is preparing a plan to guide the long term development of the Ayer Rajah area bounded by Clementi Road, Pasir Panjang Road, the railway line and Alexandra Road. In this plan, we will take advantage of the special assets of the area, ie, the National University of Singapore, Science Park, the greenery and hilly terrain of the area. We will develop the area for medium density housing, business parks and some commercial development. The former Mindef Camp is earmarked for medium density housing and the land next to Buona Vista MRT Station will be zoned for commercial and residential development to take advantage of the proximity to the MRT Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Abbas Abu Amin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Abbas Abu Amin (Pasir Panjang GRC):</b> Sir, the SAF camp has been there for the last two years, unattended, as the Minister said. I would like to know whether
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font>

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Tang Guan Seng) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am answering on behalf of my Minister. Three secondary schools and a primary school are currently under construction in Eunos GRC. One of the secondary schools is expected to be completed in December 1989 and the other two secondary schools and the primary school by mid-1990.

   <b>STATUTORY LIMITATION ON TAXIS</b>
  </div>

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Mr Lew Syn Pau</b> asked the Minister for Communications and Information if he will consider extending the 7-year statutory lifespan of taxis.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Tanglin):</b> Sir, in asking Question No.3, may I also declare my interest in this subject.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong (Minister for Communications and Information) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Communications and Information (Dr Yeo Ning Hong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, taxis are used very intensively for many hours on our roads each day. Therefore, for the safety and convenience of taxi commuters as well as other road users, they should be roadworthy and well-maintained.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual mileage clocked by a taxi is on the average about 138,000 km, that is seven times that of an average car which is about 19,000 km per year. In other words, a 7-year old taxi would have covered as much mileage as a car in its 50th year and would be subjected to corresponding wear and tear on parts that are not replaced. The percentage of 3-year old taxis which pass their statutory inspections at first inspection is 67%. That is about the same as that for 9-year old private cars. Similarly, the passing rate for taxis in their sixth year is much lower than that of cars much older than 10 years old. In view of that, the Government does not intend to extend the 7-year statutory limitation on taxis.

   <b>SALARY REVISION FOR POLITICAL,</b>

   <b>JUDICIAL AND RELATED APPOINTMENTS</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Statement by the First Deputy Prime Minister)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Trade and Industry announced the salary revision for the Civil Service last Friday. Along with it, the Government has decided to revise the salaries of political, judicial, and other statutory appointments. I shall deal first with the political appointments which include the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Ministers, Ministers, Ministers of State, Parliamentary Secretaries,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Political Secretaries and Members of Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Need for the best to form the Government</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 81 Members of Parliament, excluding the Non-Constituency MP. From them, we appoint the Prime Minister and other Cabinet Ministers. Presently, the Cabinet has 13 Ministers. These 13 men are responsible for policies which affect every aspect of our lives. Their decisions determine what kind of homes we live in, what kind of education our children have, and whether we receive good medical treatment should we fall sick. Their economic and financial policies affect our job, and our take-home pay. Their effectiveness in maintaining security and upholding law and order enable all of us to sleep soundly at night. Their foresight and judgment and their ability to solve acute problems, both long term and immediate, determine our future. If we want the right decisions to be taken for Singapore, we must continue to get the right people to do the job.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me illustrate this with a simple example. Almost every Singapore family has savings in the CPF. Our total CPF savings amount to a colossal $33 billion. To let you understand what this size means, let me give you their equivalent of housing units. This sum of money can buy 626,000 4-room type HDB flats, at a price of $54,000 per flat. This is equivalent to our being able to buy all the HDB flats that have been built so far by the Government. Suppose we have an incompetent, dishonest, spendthrift, Government. They may fail to attract investments, and then economic growth will falter. They will not balance the budget year after year, and we have to dig into the reserves. They may invest the reserves unwisely or they may dip their fingers into the till, as Marcos did in the Philippines. Then, your CPF savings will be devalued, or even wiped out, long before you can get them on retirement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Singaporean has a vested interest in making sure that the honest and the able stand for elections and that the best of them form the government. Every one of Singapore's Ministers must come from the top of their cohorts, not just academically-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> although this is definitely useful-but also in proven performance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At each General Election, we need 15 to 20 new Members of Parliament, just to replace those who are getting older. Amongst the new MPs, we need two or three who will make good Ministers. These two or three must be amongst the best in Singapore, in terms of ability, character and motivation. They must have the intellectual and moral calibre to govern Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 50,000 babies are born each year. We are looking for two or three Ministers every five years, which means in between elections we are looking for two or three Ministers out of an election cohort of a quarter million Singaporeans - 50,000 times five. That means we are looking for that one man in every 100,000 Singaporeans. When it comes to the Prime Minister, we can count ourselves lucky if we can produce one in every 10 or 20 years!
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By dint of enormous effort, we have succeeded in building a small team of Ministers, just a small team. I can say that nearly every Minister in the present Cabinet was among the top 50 students of their year. So were many of our MPs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the Ministers were, in fact, President Scholars, which means that they were among the top 10 of their year. Let me give you some names. Dr Yeo Ning Hong- he was one of the nine State Scholars (this was the predecessor to the President Scholarship); Lee Yock Suan- one of nine President Scholars in 1966; Mah Bow Tan-one of seven President Scholars in 1967; Lee Hsien Loong-one of eight in 1970; George Yeo-one of 11 1973. And they were at the top of their class in the best universities, competing against the best in UK and, in some cases, Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Difficulties of Recruiting Political Talent</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need more Ministers like them, more at each election. But such men are increasingly difficult to recruit. I know the difficulties because I have been talent scouting for the Government ever since I was elected in 1976. Those whom we want
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> in the Cabinet are invariably successful people. If they were not successful, why should we want to invite them to join us and enter politics?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, successful Singaporeans are seldom eager to enter politics. That is a fact of life in Singapore. They do not believe that the future of Singapore depends on their being in politics. They are content to leave the country in the hands of other honest and capable people so that they can follow their own private careers in peace. They know that however successful they may have been in their careers, going into politics is a risk, the risk of failure to meet a challenge of an altogether different kind. Because even if they can manage a Ministry well, they may not be able to handle the sensitive political issues dealing with people's lives, their hopes and fears. The brighter they are, the more clearly they understand that to succeed they must have that feel for people, that ability to sway people and galvanize them into action, that something called political leadership.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting aside any loss in salaries, why should they give up the certainty of a good career and a good future in a profession, or a bank, or a big company or the Civil Service, for the uncertainty of ministerial office? Why should they give up their privacy and subject themselves to the glare of publicity? Why should they spend more time with voters when they need the time to spend with their families? Why should they be called upon when others can do it? Why should they do it when others are running the government so well, and they, like everyone else, are enjoying the fruits of economic progress?

  <i>Examples of Reluctant Politicians</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know how many times I had to see Dr Richard Hu, Wong Kan Seng, George Yeo, Mah Bow Tan and Seet Ai Mee before they said "yes"? At least three times each, and over many months. I remember Richard Hu seeing me in my office, looking thoroughly miserable, and I was looking just as miserable because I was not able to get good men (this was in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 1984). I told him I needed a Finance Minister. He said, "But you have got Dr Tony Tan." Dhanabalan, and Dr Goh Keng Swee were still around at that time. I then explained that Dr Tony Tan, then Finance Minister, would be needed him to run the Education Ministry. I think Dr Tan was the Finance Minister at that time. Then, it dawned upon Dr Richard Hu that Dr Goh Keng Swee was retiring because I talked about Tony Tan going over to the Education Ministry.And I think that gave him little choice. He said "yes". He realized I could not just find a Finance Minister in 1984 to take over from Dr Tan. Dhanabalan was required in the Foreign Ministry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got them to say "yes"-Dr Richard Hu, Wong Kan Seng, and the others because I persisted and appealed to their sense of duty, duty to their fellow citizens, to their friends and relatives and to their own family. They did not volunteer to serve. They were called up. They finally agreed because of a sense of service to the nation. Evenif we had paid them more than what they were earning, they would still not have come in without intense persuasion. It is therefore necessary to minimize the sacrifice that a person is asked to make, and minimizing the financial sacrifice is the least we should do.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter Sung was persuaded to stand in a different way. Dhanabalan recruited him. Dhanabalan asked Peter Sung in 1984; Peter declined. Then Peter was sent to the Philippines as our Ambassador. Whilst he was in the Philippines, he realized that if good men did not come forward to serve, the country would go down. So when Dhanabalan approached him again in 1988, Peter said yes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I am a persistent person when it comes to talent scouting for the Government, I have not always been successful in recruiting good candidates. For example, there is a young man out there in the private sector who would make a top-rate Minister. He works for a multi-national company. I failed to persuade him to stand in the last General Election. I must have tried over half a dozen times, but he stood firm. One of the reasons was the heavy sacrifice this would mean to his family life. He does not like publicity, and neither does
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> his wife. And they saw no reason whatsoever to forgo privacy for the family. But another reason why he was reluctant was because he was locked in by his company's stock option scheme. And he would have lost several hundred thousand dollars had he resigned to stand for elections. Why should he resign? Why should he? I do not blame him for saying no. But I have not given up yet. I am going to send Peter Sung to see him and bring him to the Philippines, if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also failed to persuade a public accountant to stand as a candidate for elections to be a Member of Parliament. He works in an international firm. His firm disallows its employees to take part in politics, as a matter of policy. To contest the elections, he had to resign and forgo an annual income of over half a million dollars. It did not make sense to him or to me that he should resign just to be a Member of Parliament. The sacrifice is simply too great.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Rationale for Salary Revision</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who enter politics in order to get rich are unfit to be Ministers. Let me make that quite clear. If you think that the salary is so attractive that you want to be a Minister because of the salaries, you are unlikely to pass our screening test. We are not interested in people who come into politics because of what they perceive as a handsome salary. But why should we require able Singaporeans who are fit to be Ministers to make a large financial sacrifice in order to enter politics? If we demand this of them, why should able men enter politics at all? If Singapore is to continue to have able men in Government, we must at least ensure that after having sacrificed their privacy, leisure and family time, such people do not also have to make too large a financial sacrifice. This is the rationale for the current salary revision.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Salary Revision of Political Office-Holders</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salaries of political office-holders were last revised in 1981. But because of rapid
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> economic growth, they still lag well behind incomes in the private sector. I shall now ask the Clerk of Parliament to circulate a table which I call Annex A*. It is the same table which was released when the Civil Service Pay Revision was announced last week. But I think it is useful to refresh your memory. [Copies of table circulated to Members].
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table shows typical salaries of top executives and professionals in the private sector in 1987. If you look at the table, you will notice that not only are these numbers much larger than civil service salaries, they even exceed the salaries of Ministers. This disparity will make it harder for us to recruit men and women of ability and integrity into Government, and to maintain the quality of political leadership. This is the reason for adjusting the salaries now.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Structure of Salary Revision</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now deal with the structure of the salary revision. The components of the salary revision parallel those for Superscale officers in the Administrative service, namely:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Higher salary grades for each appointment;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A half-month increase in the existing end-of-year non-pensionable variable bonus, bringing it to 1ª months;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) A new discretionary non-pensionable performance-based bonus of up to two months of salary; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Promotional grades for Senior Parliamentary Secretaries, Ministers of State, Senior Ministers of State and Cabinet Ministers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Higher Salary Grades</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I shall ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute Annex B (Cols. 833 - 834). Annex B gives the details of the new basic salaries. Salaries of political office-holders are expressed in terms of Civil Service Superscale and Staff Grade points. The Government will now attach higher grades to the various
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> appointments. For example, let us look at the Ministers. Ministers are now on Staff Grade I plus 5%. They will move to Staff Grade II plus 10%. In addition, the new grades will carry the revised Civil Service basic salaries, so that they will be worth 7% more than before. You remember that the Superscale Civil Service salaries were revised by 7%. These two changes will increase the basic salaries of the various posts.
  <br>
  <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1989/19890323/19890323-HA-0530833.htm">Annex B - MONTHLY SALARIES (Cols. 833 - 834)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have raised the grades for Ministers, and this will give more room for promoting civil servants. By creating the new Staff Grades IV and V, we will preserve the existing correct relativities between top civil servants and political posts. After the revision, a Staff Grade V Administrative Officer will earn more than any Minister except the Prime Minister, just as a Staff Grade III officer does today. In other words, we are retaining the relativity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In percentage terms, this increase in basic salaries may appear to be large. But in spite of this increase, Ministers' salaries will still be modest compared to the professions listed in the table which I handed out earlier, Annex A.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Minister's revised monthly salary at $22,100 basic, which when you gross up becomes $28,644, including NWC, is less than the top incomes in any of the professions in Annex A. Even the Prime Minister's revised salary at $38,275 basic, which when you gross up becomes $49,608 per month, will still be far less than what a top doctor or lawyer can earn, and no more than what the Chief Executive Officer of a large local manufacturing company can expect. Top doctors earn on average $93,000; top lawyers over $100,000 per month. So the Prime Minister's salary falls far behind them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Variable Bonus</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On variable bonus, political office-holders will get the same additional 1/2 month of variable bonus. This, of course, depends on the state of the economy, just like civil service salaries on the variable bonus.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Performance Bonus</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have introduced a performance bonus for Superscale civil servants. Ministers, Ministers of State, Parliamentary Secretaries and Political Secretaries will likewise receive a performance bonus of up to two months of salary, varying from individual to individual, like the Superscale officers in the Administrative Service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister will receive the full two months as a fixed arrangement. He will decide how much each Minister, Parliamentary Secretary and Political Secretary should receive. And his decisions will be kept confidential. So would the amount paid to each person.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Promotional Grades</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to promotional grades. The Government has also decided to create promotional grades within the ranks of Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Minister of State, Senior Minister of State and Minister. Why are we doing this? It is because promotion from Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of State, Minister and upwards is a route which few can take. The leaps in responsibility are just far too large. Promotion grades within each rank allow us to reward a Parliamentary Secretary or Minister by promotion to a higher salary grade when he does his job well. Despite providing for promotion grades, let me say that a political career is not iron-clad. It is fraught with the vagaries of the ballot as well as the risk of making political blunders. In other words, you cannot plan on the basis of a steady career or progression in your career in the political service. But promotion grades will allow us to reward those who continue, and contribute, in office for many years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I shall deal with the details of the various grades.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Senior Parliamentary Secretaries</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Senior Parliamentary Secretaries. Senior Parliamentary Secretaries are presently on Grade E. This will be revised to E1, and an additional grade point of D will be added.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Ministers of State</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State grade is currently Superscale Grade C, and the Senior Minister of State is Superscale Grade B. There will be three grades for Ministers of State: D1, C and B; and three for Senior Ministers of State: B, A and Staff Grade I. The overlap at Grade B is a transitional arrangement. These additional grades, especially the higher grades for Senior Ministers of State, will enable office-holders to have a full political career without necessarily becoming full Cabinet Ministers. Such men can make important contributions at the Ministry level, managing complex departments and making operational decisions requiring long experience and intimate knowledge of their field. We need more such people to reinforce our team. Hence the provision of promotional grades for them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Ministers</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers will move from Staff Grade I plus 5% to Staff Grade II plus 10%. There is also a promotional grade for Ministers. The promotional point will be Staff Grade IV. Ministers will be appointed to the higher grade on a personal basis. Ministerial responsibilities differ considerably in scope. Those carrying heavier portfolios should be paid more. The higher point will enable us to recognize this and pay them properly without having to move up the salaries of each Minister. We will not be attaching new appointment titles to the new grades. There will be no difference in title or address between those on the higher and lower grades, whether they are Ministers, Ministers of State, or Senior Parliamentary Secretaries. In other words, we will continue to address a Minister a Minister even though he is on a higher grade. We have the term "Senior Minister" but this term will continue to be reserved for special individuals, like Mr Rajaratnam.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Conversion</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this revision, all current appointment holders will be placed onto their corresponding new grade points. I do not intend to promote any Minister, Minister of State, or Parliamentary Secretaries to the higher grades immediately. I will do so only later, when I judge it necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Make-up Pay for Ministers</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the higher salary grades for Ministers, we will still want from time to time to induct successful and able men from the private sector into the Cabinet, men who are earning far more than the revised pay for Ministers, to serve for one or perhaps two terms. If such a person has first to be tried out for a period as a Minister of State before being appointed a full Minister, the problem becomes more acute.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To accommodate these possibilities without upsetting the protocol order, the Government is introducing a system of make-up pay, similar to that practised with reservist national servicemen.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In future when a Minister or a Minister of State is appointed, he may receive make-up pay in addition to his rank pay. In other words, if he earns more than that of a Minister of State and he is appointed as a Minister of State, the difference will be paid to him by way of a make-up pay, but he will not receive the entire difference. He will receive only up to 90% of that difference. The calculation will be based on his income tax returns for the last two years before his appointment. The make-up pay will not be carried on for ever. A Minister can continue to receive this for up to two terms of office. In other words, after two terms the make-up pay will be removed because after that he either returns to the private sector or continues on his rank pay alone without this make-up pay.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are introducing this system of make-up pay because I believe this will enable the country to benefit from the services of those who do not wish to make politics their entire career, but who have a contribution to make to the nation. They can now become Ministers without having to make too much of a sacrifice.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system of make-up pay will not apply to existing office-holders. It will be used primarily to induct successful people between 35 and 45 years of age to be tried out as Ministers of State before they are appointed as Ministers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>MPs' Allowances</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of Parliament currently receive a tax-free basic allowance of $3,000 a month (gross $3,850). This will be increased to $4,000 a month (gross $5,184).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the MPs' allowance, MPs will be allowed to reclaim reimbursement of up to $750 a month, to defray the wages of a legislative assistant and a secretary. Several MPs can club together to engage a young graduate (e.g. one who is doing his Masters or Ph.D) as a legislative assistant, plus a secretary. The legislative assistant can help the MPs to research issues and look up facts, so that MPs can be better prepared for public speeches and Parliamentary debates. The secretary is to help the MPs to despatch constituency work. Such help may make it easier to get good men to run for Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most mature legislatures provide such support to their members. For example, British Members of Parliament and US Congressmen have legislative assistants. They are often bright new graduates, either doing a post-graduate degree, or seeking two to three years of broad exposure before moving on to bigger jobs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will draw up the rules later. The rules will apply equally to both opposition and government MPs. Non-constituency MPs will be eligible to claim reimbursement for 2/3rds of the full allowance for a legislative assistant but not the 1/3rd for secretarial assistance, since they have no constituents to look after.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Judicial and Other Statutory Appointments</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I shall deal with the salaries of the judicial and other statutory appointments. Judicial appointments include the Chief Justice and Supreme Court Judges. Other statutory appointments include the President, the Speaker, Attorney-General and Chairman of the Public Service Commission.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annex B, which I have distributed earlier, gives the details of their salary
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> revision. The components parallel those for Superscale Officers in the Administrative Service, namely:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Higher salary grades for each appointment;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a 1ª months non-pensionable Variable Bonus contingent on economic performance, and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) a fixed bonus in lieu of the performance bonus payable to the political office-holders and the Superscale Administrative Officers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Justice will have his basic salary increased from $18,800 per month to $28,950 per month, and Supreme Court Judges from $13,600 per month to $19,550 per month.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will amend the Judges' Remuneration Act to effect these changes to Judges' salaries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judges are recruited from the Bar as well as the Legal Service. The salary gaps between them and private sector lawyers are especially large. At present, the Chief Justice earns less than 56 other lawyers in the private sector, and Judges less than 86 other lawyers in the private sector. The gap is so wide that few lawyers fit to sit on the Bench are willing to serve as Judges or even as Judicial Commissioners. After the revision, in terms of earnings the Chief Justice will rank behind 25 others, and the Judges behind 51 others in the private sector. This is a substantial improvement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Attorney-General and Chairman PSC will also have their basic salaries increased from $15,900 per month to $21,100 per month.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speaker will also have his salary increased. The Leader of the House will move a motion on this later.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these appointees will receive the same additional half month of Variable Bonus, like other civil servants. This is, of course, subject to the performance of the economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not feasible for these statutory appointments to be paid a Performance Bonus. Supreme Court Judges receive fixed salaries, in order that they cannot be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> pressured by the Executive, or even by their peers, into rendering harsher judgments. It would be invidious to pay them performance bonuses. On the other hand, to leave them out from the scheme altogether would deprive them of a significant benefit. The Government has therefore decided to pay the statutory appointments a fixed bonus in lieu of the Performance Bonus.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President, Chief Justice, Speaker, Attorney-General and Chairman PSC, will receive two months of this fixed bonus. The Judges will receive one month of the fixed bonus.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Cost</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total additional cost of this salary revision is $9 million per year, made up of $4.3 million for the President, Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries, Political Secretaries, and Speaker; $3 million for the MPs, and another $1.7 million for the Judges and other statutory appointments.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Implementation</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised salaries will come into effect on 1st April 1989, together with the revised Civil Service salaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Conclusion</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This revision will narrow the gap between Ministers' salaries and private sector incomes of senior executives, managers and professionals, and between Judges and lawyers in the private practice. It will not eliminate it. The gap still remains significant.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people will try to make political capital out of this revision of political salaries. We must expect it. They will say that those who go for public office should be ready to make sacrifices. This is hypocrisy. People talk of others becoming political leaders and needing to make sacrifices. But will they sacrifice their own comfortable careers for a political life? Will they ask their favourite son or daughter to go into politics? Not just for one or two years but for 10 and more years. Have the Opposition found such noble self-sacrificing people to join them and offer a credible alternative leadership to the PAP?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's future requires us to be hard-headed. In spite of better terms for the MPs and Ministers, I do not expect a rich harvest. Our talent pool is small, and no salary revision can enlarge it. But proper salaries can help us to gather whatever talent we need from whatever talent we have.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know this salary revision is politically sensitive and I think MPs should also know this. It should have been done much earlier, but the Government postponed it because of the economic recession. This time, before proceeding, I discussed this with my colleagues. They agreed that we should act, although they knew that we would have to work hard to win public support for this measure. The Prime Minister was especially supportive and encouraging. In fact, he offered to speak in support of my statement in this House. I thanked him, but I told him that since this is a the decision of my colleagues and I, we have got to carry out the decision both in this House as well as outside this House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers' salaries are a political issue in every country. I do not think I need to tell the MPs this. They know this very well. If you look around at other countries, because it is a political issue, some countries pay Ministers derisory salaries, but give them less conspicuous benefits, some proper, other ingenious, to make up. Other countries have a revolving door arrangement. They allow their Ministers and high officials, after leaving office, to make up, as lobbyists or lawyers, through consultation fees and book royalties what they were not allowed to earn in office. Yet others keep up the pretence that being a Minister is such an honour that salaries are hardly necessary, with the result that able people shun public office, and the country declines.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues and I have decided to tackle this issue directly and openly. We could have avoided this issue by camouflaging Ministers' salaries, through ingenious allowances invisible to the public, like furnished housing, servants and gardener allowances, cars with drivers, and paid annual holidays abroad for the family-or by making the salaries tax-free. But that would not be in keeping with our practice
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of honest and open government. To continue to have a good and clean government we believe our best policy is to pay a person what he is worth, be he a civil servant, a political appointee, or a private sector employee. In the case of Ministers, we are actually paying them less than what they are worth, so that no one can accuse a Minister of profiting from taking office. That is why we decided on 90% instead of 100% make-up pay for future office-holders.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of the salary increases is negligible, compared with the big decisions Ministers have to take. The price of failure to induct the top 0.001% (that is one in 100,000) of Singaporeans to serve the country is incalculable. Just look at what happened to the Philippines under President Marcos. It will be many years before Filipino people stop having to leave home to work in foreign countries and send money home.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we fail to uphold the high standards of government because we have failed to induct the best and the ablest into the political leadership, Singapore's future can be very bleak. Unlike the Philippines, we do not have the land, the rivers and the mountains to grow rice, mangoes, bananas, pineapples and other fruits for export, or dig for gold, bauxite and other precious metals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our best bet is to induct the best, the honest and the able to keep up a clean and effective government, the best that Singapore can field. We are committed to fielding the best national team for the Government of Singapore. You have to support us in this task.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head N of the Main Estimates be reduced by $100.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I first congratulate the First Deputy Prime Minister for his stirring speech on the subject of pay increases for Ministers. Judging the emotion and feeling behind it, I get a clear feeling that it comes from the heart. Indeed, the question of pay increases for political office holders had arisen in 1985. On 22nd March 1985, in a wide-ranging debate in Parliament, the Prime Minister in fact made two points which remain valid today. First, the difficulty in attracting fresh talents to political office. Even in the days of 1985, before the recession, the attractions of private sector had prevented many potential office holders from coming into the political arena. The second point that the Prime Minister made was that in looking at the increase in salaries for Ministers, we should be honest and not hypocritical. It is good to score a political point by saying that Ministers can work a full day's job and not getting a full day's pay. I have also in the same session mentioned that the jobs of Ministers are much more onerous than those of the top civil servants under their charge.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having been an office holder myself and now in the private sector, I can well appreciate that if we want a job done well we must get the best men for the job and pay the going rate. The proverbial statement of "you pay peanuts, you get monkeys" is the kind of situation that we have to face.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, if we look at the First Deputy Deputy Prime Minister's proposal today the pay increases recommended are, in my view, but just one step in closing the gap between the political office holders and those of their counterparts in the private sector. Even a Minister's salary of about $28,000 a month has not gone anywhere near the salary of an average CEO in a manufacturing industry; it is, in fact, less than half that of the top CEO in that category. So we are not talking here about enriching Ministers and other political office holders. We are, in fact, talking about removing one disincentive which deters potential office holders from running for office.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many disincentives facing a person before he chooses to run for office, least of which are family objections, the loss of privacy and so on. The increase in pay, as suggested in today's statement, is just to remove one small irritation and, if I understand the First Deputy Prime Minister well, it will enable him to persuade potential office holders to come in and give them one excuse less. I wish the First Deputy Prime Minister well but I am afraid that the present pay increases as recommended will only go just a small way to help him to recruit new talents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shortage of labour in Singapore, as we can see now, extends not only to industries and services but also to political offices. I think the problem that is afflicting the First Deputy Prime Minister is the same problem that is afflicting us in the private sector. In the private sector, we are facing a severe problem of trying to get young executives to stay with us. They are all anxious to move ahead and they do not seem to be satisfied with the progress that is being afforded them. The First Deputy Prime Minister will find it even more difficult to attract this category of people unless some of the disadvantages are removed and I hope that the present pay
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> increases, especially for the category of Ministers of State, will go some way to help him in this regard.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like just to comment on two particular items mentioned in the First Deputy Prime Minister's statement. First is performance bonus. Perhaps we should not equate Ministers with civil servants. Ministers' appointments are political appointments. It carries with them different risks, different benefits. Civil servants' jobs are permanent. Their salary depends very much on their performance. The judge of a Minister or political office is with the people. If the Minister does not perform well he will be voted out. It may be a bit difficult to give a ranking of Ministers' performance. I do not know whether other Ministers feel the same. But it may be better in the interest of unity in the leadership and collective responsibility that performance bonus, if it should be paid at all, should be paid to all, as in the case of Judges.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point which I would like to make is on make-up pay. Having listened to the First Deputy Prime Minister on the difficulty of getting young executives to run for office, I can sympathize with him that we must find a way of redressing the tremendous gap between the private sector pay and what he is likely to get in office. But I would caution perhaps that we should set a limit to this make-up pay. The rewards in the private sector can be in various ways and it also depends on time. Profit-sharing, for example, fluctuates from year to year. Therefore, it may not be feasible to match the total remuneration of a person. It may just happen that it happens in a good year, whereas if you wait for one more year, the next year may be a bit less expensive.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the concept of make-up pay is a bold and innovative one. But I think we should also allow for some cautionary step to ensure that the system will not be abused at a later stage.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the present package given by the First Prime Minister is the best under the present circumstances and I would like, once again, to compliment him on bringing up a very sensitive issue. He can be assured that he will have my support.

  <!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade GRC)</b>(
  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Chairman, I support the Government's decision to revise the salaries of Ministers and other holders of political appointments. I feel it is important for us to pay our Ministers salaries comparable to the salaries of those holding key positions in the private sector. Only in this way would we be able to attract our top talents to enter politics and take part in the leadership of the country.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, even with the salary revision, we may still find it difficult to attract capable and honest persons who have successful careers in the private sectors to enter politics and lead the country. Nevertheless, I hope that they would be prepared to doso because the success and future of this country depend on the availability of competent and honest leaders. With this salary revision, we would minimize the disadvantageous that they have to suffer. There are other sacrifices which will have to be made by them, like the loss of privacy, something which is beyond measure.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree, Mr Chairman, that our leaders must be persons who have a strong sense of public duty and who genuinely and sincerely committed to serve the nation and the people. We must not use monetary incentives alone to attract them. But what I would like to point out here is that unless we offer them reasonable salaries, our task would be even more difficult. Certainly, we want to attract people who are prepared to contribute their energy in the service of the country and who are truly concerned for our country and our citizens and who are prepared to make the sacrifices. I am confident that our leaders who have come forward to serve the country and the people, are persons who have committed themselves totally to serving the interests of the nation. Otherwise, they would certainly have not been so willing to make the sacrifice. With the talents and capabilities that they possess, they could enjoy a much more comfortable life outside politics. They are willing to sacrifice because they believe that they have a duty
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to look after the welfare and well being of all Singaporeans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Mr Chairman, I fully support the salary revisions for our Ministers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman Sir, at first I had wanted to talk about the salaries of civil servants. But now I would like to touch on the salaries of the Ministers and other political appointees. Both concern money.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me say that I agree with what the First Deputy Prime Minister has said for the increase of salaries of these political appointees, from the Political Secretary to the Prime Minister. Since the Second World War, various countrie have become independent, but after independence, their economies and their societies have not necessarily taken off the ground and make any progress. On the contrary, some countries because of their religious and racial problems, their people have been split and embroiled in turmoil and misery. So from this we can learn a lesson. Those who could create a nation, and achieve independence mightnot be able to govern or manage a country. A revolutionist might not be a good 'governor' of a country.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are foruntate to have among our first generation leaders people who are capable of both creating and governing country. Our first generation leaders have both revolutionary zeal and governing ability. In those earlier years, they even risked their lives and future to achieve independence, monetary rewards were further from their mind. They have brought about our nation to the present stage with results everybody can see
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the first generation leaders have passed their batons to the second generation leaders who should also be the cream of our nation, elites who could administer our country with ability, efficiency, integrity and dedication. They are also engaged actively in the process of recruiting and cultivating out third generation leaders, but they have met with various difficulties as mentioned by the First Deputy Prime Minister. In prosperous and peaceful times, many professionals and management personnel would not like
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to enter the political arena because with the private enterprise they could enjoy more remunerations. Moreover, they need not sacrifice personal and family interests or risk political risks and uncertainties.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister had on the 7th of May 1979 also menntioned in the Parliament about increasing the Ministers' salaries from $2,500 to $4,500 a month. At that time he said that ".... Singapore cannot for the indefinite future, rely on people who are willing to make inordiante sacrifices, particularly when it is at the expense of their families ... No group of men ... are as crucial to Singapore's continued security and prosperity as the eleven who form the Cabinet ...". These words are still valid today!
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruling a country by the judicious and able has a bearing on the well-being and future of the country. There is an ancient book quotation saying that "When a country has many judicious and able persons around, it will be conducive to the good government of the country." In principle, to give commensurate reward to those for their effort and dedication in governing a country, is, I believe, acceptable to many people. Only few people want a horse to serve well but not allow it to eat grass. Ours is a small country with scant talents pool. The present remunerations of Ministers fall far short of those paid to managerial and executive personnel in the private sector. So I agree to what the First Deputy Prime Minister has proposed-raising the salaries of the political leaders.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But giving "commensurate" remunerations must call forth "commensurate" capability and virtues in return. From Ministers down to Political Secretaries, is everyone of them definitely up to expectation? Or is there any one in the midst not up to expectation? This is what the argument is about. The picking of talent and employing the able is a profound skill and art itself. To spot a good champion steed that can run a thousand miles, one needs to be as discerning as a Bo-Le. To take a drop-out horse for a champion steed, one cannot convince people. To regard a champion steed as an inferior horse is equally regrettable.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree to salary increase for Ministers and other political appointees, but I am against make-up pay for them. The use of make-up pay to attract highly paid personnel in the private sector to be Ministers, I think, is based on the concept of "opportunity cost". But in actual practice, the use of opportunity cost to calculate salaries for the Ministers may give rise to certain problems. If a Minister's present pay is higher than his "opportunity cost", should he return part of his salary? Moreover, to use this method to attract "highly paid personnel" may not achieve instant result. These so called "highly paid personnel" in the private enterprises could very well wait until they have achieved success in their careers and when they have accumulated substantial wealth before going for "high price evaluation". This would also be unfair to many of our present Cabinet members who have sacrificed their own careers and families to come forth and serve the country.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go a step further, when spotting talents it should be realized that to some people, money does not take the prime position in their values. Such people do not conscientiously go for "big money raking" professions. These people very often are wrongly regarded as without "bargaining" qualities. This kind of criterion for judging a superior or inferior horse should not only be considered further but also be deemed as contradicting the core value of "placing the greater self over the smaller self". Confucius said: "If you judge a person by his appearance, you may miss the true person". I do not know, to judge a person by his pay, what talent would we miss. Therefore, there must be certain balance between "monetary rewards" and "public service".
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, about giving "performance bonus", it is also not a wise measure. All policies should be formulated by collective decision of the Cabinet members, they shall bear collective responsibility for them. Minor issues like the bonus should not be allowed to cause differences among Cabinet members. That would not benefit our country.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other major question is, why should the Ministers' salaries be linked up with the salaries of top civil servants? The Minister is the formulater of policy, whereas the civil servant is the implementor of the policy. Ministers make personal and family sacrificies and take political risks, whereas high rank civil servants do not have to. A Permanent Secretary is what the term implies-his post is 'permanent'. In the past 10 years, how many Permanent Secretaries have resigned to join the private enterprises? And, how many Permanent Secretaries have been sacked for being inefficient in implementing policies?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the issue is about talent scouting for the political leadership. The task is not easy. Years ago, it was easier because we had not tasted success and wealth. There was a cause then. There was a special calling, an anti-colonial fervour and urgency for independence. Many answered that call. They brought men of many diverse backgrounds into the political arena. In such a situation, many great leaders were thrown up. They were men of the ground, experienced in political craft and committed to the cause of building Singapore. Those who joined the political movement could see the changes they set out to do. I am sure it gave them much pride and satisfaction to see attap huts, laterite roads, turned into HDB flats, beautiful parks, roads and hospitals. It was easier to satisfy Singaporeans. But now with economic success and wealth, the environment has changed, such that there is no cause to fight, no ideological motivation, no reason to throw one's weight into politics. We are not hungry. We are victims of our success.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now consolidating our position. We need men of quality, knowledge, wisdom, to run this place. It is getting more difficult to run because expectations are higher, and often tough to meet. So it is not surprising that many men of talent do not want to be in politics to face the ever demanding populace. I am sure even with this high salary, we will not be able to attract men who are already well estab-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> lished and comfortable in their present jobs. I support this rise with the hope that we may be able to attract the third or fourth generation leadership of men who may be in their middle thirties and who may want to switch career at mid-stream because we are able to convince them of the need to come out and identify themselves as political leaders, ready to take over the helm after Mr Goh and company.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group has to make a difficult decision, giving up the opportunity to be a chief executive of a company to enter politics. I was once told that the most certainty in politics is its uncertainty. And because of this, those who want to join politics must have some form of assurance or attraction to overcome this initial reservation. Salary is one. Exit management is another. Many enter politics with noble dreams. But as the heat of politics hot up, some get disillusioned and want to get out. But getting out of politics in midway is unpleasant and a fear of being labelled a failure, probably deterred many.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exit management is important, more so in today's context because our population is affluent and sensitive. Our past records of MPs and Ministers leaving Parliament leave much to be desired. Let us pay more attention to this and it may help us to get more talent. One weakness in using salary to attract talent is a danger of getting the wrong men in. This is the fear that strikes the minds of many Singaporeans. I too share this fear. However, the one consolation is the very stringent criteria of selection. We must use this safeguard in getting the right people. We must ensure that the other qualities of commitment, loyalty to country, compassion, personal integrity and wisdom are placed much higher in priority in our selection process than salary. Salary is just one criterion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in this selection exercise, not all who want to get in will be successful. It is an honour, a recognition of his exemplar behaviour, character and abilities when selected.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of performance bonus for Ministers in my opinion is unnecessary. I think we should not put politicians in the same category as civil servants, as mentioned by the two previous speakers. The
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Cabinet, I strongly believe, must work as a team. It is untenable and it will create disquiet among Ministers if some get more and some get less bonus. Ministers may be tempted to take short-term views instead of long-term goals. Most of the Government's policy decisions are taken collectively in the Cabinet. In the event of a wrong, how much of the blame can be apportioned then to the individual Minister? Conversely, how much will competing Ministers share their good ideas if by so doing the other Minister is going to look better than himself? I strongly object to this and would encourage the First Deputy Prime Minister to reconsider and, in fact, drop such a move. I suggest he pays all the Ministers the bonuses he wants to give.

  <!-- Mr S. Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das (Cheng San GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in joining in this debate, I would like to say what I said during the debate on the Budget statement, ie, I welcome and support the pay increases for all political appointees as well as members of the Judiciary as stated by the First Deputy Prime Minister in his Ministerial Statement. At the outset, it must be pointed out that these increases will not have 100% support and it is easy to understand why this would be so. For a start, both Mr Chiam See Tong and Dr Lee Siew-Choh will and must oppose this on political grounds, largely to score political points.

  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Chairman:</b> All right. Mr Chiam, you can have your say afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> However, Sir, I am confident that the majority of Singaporeans will understand and accept why we need to pay a fair market wage to attract the best to manage this country properly and honestly. I must say that I cannot foresee in the horizon any Lim Kim
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Sans or E.W. Barkers. And this is a reality and the sooner the political leadership faces the better it is for Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other alternative is to pay political appointees a low salary; in fact, so low a salary that when they leave office or run out of office, they literally leave with billions of dollars in numbered accounts in Switzerland. We have witnessed sufficient examples of this in other countries and it is not necessary for us to repeat this in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am told that the proposed increases will cost the Government about $9 million. This sum is actually peanuts compared to the amount that we can lose if we do not have the right people managing the country. A wrong man in charge of the Finance Ministry can cost us billions of dollars. After all, this sum of $9 million is a small sum. In fact, it is a good insurance and I think it is necessary for all Singaporeans to understand this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with these increases in salary, I hope it will go some way to help attract talent to come and serve Singapore, although I personally believe that many of these unwilling brides merely give money as an excuse to stay out of the political arena. Nevertheless, I feel that this will be an additional weapon in the hands of the First Deputy Prime Minister and enhance his persuasive capabilities and on this I wish him well.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I like to stress two other points which I also made during the Budget debate and I hope the Frontbench will give this some consideration, although the First Deputy Prime Minister dismissed it in his Ministerial Statement. I must say that I am not totally comfortable that paying one salary alone would be sufficient. The salary and terms of service conditions are so closely linked to the civil service. Some of my colleagues earlier had mentioned that this may not be desirable. I accept that there must be some relativity between the civil service and the political service. But what we have now is really an identical service. Maybe too many of our Frontbench Members are from the civil service, therefore they feel relatively safe. My contention is that the political appointee and a civil servant are two different animals and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> they should be treated separately when you consider salary benefits and other benefits.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also spoke about a remuneration package rather than a straight salary for political appointees. We do not have to go overboard on this, as mentioned by the First Deputy Prime Minister that it happens in other countries. Right now, it is a regular spectacle in Singapore to see our First Deputy Prime Minister, Second Deputy Prime Minister and other Ministers driving their SOs around in their cars. This may have been the right thing to do in the 60s and in the 70s. But I would like to question its relevance in the 1980s. I would strongly urge that the Ministers cannot be given houses, at least consider a car and a driver instead.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me paint a scenario to you where a Senior Minister gets involved in a serious road accident. Maybe as a result of negligence, worried about his performance bonus, and as a result he is charged in court, fined over $5,000, and loses his parliamentary seat. This is very costly. You lose a very good man. This has not happened so far. Touch wood, we are very grateful for this. But do we want something like this to happen first before we change? Or do we change now for the better?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like my other colleagues, I am also not in favour of the performance bonus, apart from driving cars. I think performance bonus for civil servants is an excellent idea. But performance, bonus for Ministers should be dropped.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the salary increases announced by the First Deputy Prime Minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Second Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Second Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Ong Teng Cheong)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the First Deputy Prime Minister's proposal to adjust the salaries of Ministers, other political leaders above the grade of Political Secretaries. I only wish to say a few words in supplement. There is a saying in Chinese, "When a nation breaks down, the homes will perish". That is to say, the nation is more
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> important than the home. There is another Chinese saying: "Of the three categories of unfilial sons, the worst is the one who leaves no descendant". Since the question of succession is so important in terms of the homes, what about the succession in the more important role of governing the nation? Just now, Dr Ow Chin Hock mentioned that founding a nation is not an easy task. Yet, not all the revolutionalists who founded the nations can build the nation. Therefore, the role of nation building is even more difficult. We all know, it is difficult to establish a career, even more so to maintain the career. In the case of a nation, after it hasbeen founded, to keep it going, to ensure its prosperity, to maintain and continue the development that we have established, and to govern the nation well, is a more complicated and difficult task. So, we have to attach much importance to this matter, to keep on attracting talented people to contribute to the development of our nation. Of course, the talented people, as the first Deputy Prime Minister said just now, also need to make a living. They will have to make some sacrifices when they go into politics. However, the sacrifices they have to make must not be too great. Otherwise, it will be difficult to attract them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adjustment to the salaries of the Ministers, Political Secretaries, Parliamentary Secretaries has to be approved by Parliament before it could come into effect. Some people say, "Wouldn't it be embarrasing to ask for a pay rise for yourselves?" But, this is the procedure we have to adopt to adjust the salaries. The PAP Government has, all along, been open and aboveboard in all its dealings. No cover-up, no hypocrisy. We want to have an adjustment, we deal with it openly. The First Deputy Prime Minister has made it very clear. The adjustment is made for the purpose of attracting the talented people, and not for the older generation. Our Prime Minister has been in politics for more than 30 years. He has never utter a word of complaint about his personal income. I believe, it is the same for many of the older generation leaders. The First Deputy Prime minister joined politics in 1976. He has made a great sacrifice. Yet, not a word of complaint from him. However, what we are looking after, is the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> future of Singapore. We are concerned with the question of succession in political leadership. The gretest tragedy that could befall a nation is the lack of able successors to its political leadership, to serve Singapore. Whether Singapore will continue to prosper and to advance will depend on how we could solve the problem of attracting talented people to succeed the political leadership, to avoid the tragedy, to overcome the mishap of able successors not forth coming. Thank you.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Thank you, Mr Chairman, for allowing me to speak.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I begin, may I ask the First Deputy Prime Minister to clarify certain points. Other than the amount of salary received as stated in Annex B, whether or not Ministers have other perks. If there are, what are they? Whether Ministers pay income tax? And how does this salary scale of Ministers compare to that of England, Australia and New Zealand, if he has got the data?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I certainly do not have any objection to the increase of salary for the civil servants. But I think the civil servants and the political appointees are distinct and separate. They are two different entities. Normally, in a democratic country the civil servants are a permanent feature. Whatever political party is in power, the civil servants are left intact. There is a sense of continuity. In Japan and in England the civil servants have a very big say in the running of the country. In fact, in Japan, I believe, they not only carry out the day-to-day administration of the country, but they are also responsible for policy. So I do not begrudge them. They are really carrying the burden of running the country.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are talking today is salary revisions of political appointees. I think there are really two principles to be adopted. I am objecting, not as Mr Chandra Das has said, to score political points. I hope I have not spoken in this House just to score political points. I think one must speak of one's belief and of one's conviction.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am objecting to the increase of Ministers' salaries on principle. As I say,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> there are two principles, I believe, which are at issue today. The first is you pay the Minister with a materialistic approach. You pay him his market value, as we have been told in this House. Or we can have the second principle, and that is, to take an idealistic approach - a sense of public service. These are two contrasting approaches to the salaries of Ministers and other political appointees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in most western countries, I think they adopt not the former but the latter - an idealistic approach. Because Mininisters and political appointees and Members of Parliament, they are leaders of the country, whether they like it or not. Sir, they have to set the example; they have to set the mores, they have to set the standard of honesty, they have to set the standard of conduct for others to follow. I think it was Mr Chou En-Lai. He was once interviewed and he said, "Yes, we leaders have to go 100% and if our followers at least keep up to 50% or 60%, we know at least that they are getting on somewhere."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember when I was in England, not in the last general elections of the British Parliament but the one before, Mrs Margeret Thatcher, in her speech after winning the general elections, thanked all voters for returning her to office again, and she said that the appointment of the Prime Ministership is power given to her by the people on trust. It is not beneficially given to her. It is given to her on trust. She is holding that position on trust for the people. It is not hers at all. So that is how politics is approached in England. It is the idealistic approach. She is there to work for the people, not for herself.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the British all these years have the idealistic approach to leadership. If you are in London and you visit the cathedrals or any of the prominent buildings, you will notice that there are many statues, many plaques put up on the walls extolling their citizens who have given public service.
  <br>

  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I believe that was how the British Empire was built, not by materialistic pay. It was the idealism that was built in the British people. In the early days, I believe that if you go into any
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> British classroom you will see a map of the world and you can see the red markings all over the maps, and the teacher will say, "Look, that is a British colony under our domain. And we are there to rule these people for their benefit". Of course, they put it in another way. Whether you agree or not but this is how the British approached it in an idealistic way. And in the public schools they bring up their children to be administrators to their colonies to work for the Empire, not specifically for pay.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> They didn't get paid?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Of course, they get paid. Sir, that is the idealistic approach to leadership. Sir, we can tell countless stories of British administrators, judges, teachers, doctors, who have gone to far-off tropical places. I know, for sure, of two teachers who had taught in a Kuala Lumpur mission school all their life and on retirement they went back to England to spend their last days in a nursing home. This is the sort of dedication they give to their service. They were unmarried; they were ladies. They even had no one to take care of them on their retirement. Sir, this is the sort of idealism that the British were able to build up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are vast numbers of people working in professions, in jobs, which need this kind of idealism. I am thinking of nurses, doctors, teachers, perhaps even our armed forces, people who keep law and order. So how are you going to judge the salary of these people - nurses, doctors, who save the lives of people. What is the value you are going to set for them? You cannot really set a price. It is their dedication to the job that saves lives, that keeps the health service up. And teachers. This Government is moaning that there are not enough teachers. Why? Because probably the system we are building up is based on materialism, on pay. So our young talented people are not idealistic enough to go into the teaching profession and we have difficulties getting our bright young boys to go into the teaching profession. Hopefully, many of our real good talents would not be disappointed with our
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> system and run to places where they feel that they can get a more fulfilling life.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Government I believe takes a materialistic approach. I suppose in the circumstance, if you look at it, if the Government wants this kind of a system, I suppose the people will have to decide whether or not we want the system that the Government is building for Singapore. Pay Ministers, pay civil servants, that amount of salary which the Government thinks should be enough and then no more for you, no more corruption, that is all you are getting. I suppose in a way there are merits in this kind of a system. In other words, you pay the person up to the limit, and that is all he is getting. Unlike other countries, as the First Deputy Prime Minister has said, it amounts to hypocrisy - people coming into politics, get a very low meagre pay and then from the side they make big, big monies by corruption. I suppose that is also a very bad system. So I think we understand what this present system is: to attract, as the First Deputy Prime Minister has said, the people from the limited talent pool to encourage them to come into politics and then, with their eyes open, "This is all that you are getting, and no more."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, but pay is a very subjective matter. How much is enough? You cannot really determine an amount. As I see this Annex B, the Prime Minister is getting $38,275. Is this enough? If you really look at his contributions, it is peanuts. It is really not enough. He has brought Singapore to what it is today (I mean, of course, with the help of others) not he alone, but his leadership. It is not enough. What is enough? Even if you pay him $1 million a year, it is not enough. $2 million?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember a long time ago, I believe the PAP Ministers started off with $3,000 a month, or was it $3,500. That was all. And I remember also reading, when the other Ministers got a pay rise, the Prime Minister voluntarily refrained from getting a pay rise. Why did he come into politics? It is the drive, the urge to contribute to nation building, to make Singapore independent, to make Singapore great. That is the drive, not the pay. I think the Prime Minister himself said pay was
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> irrelevant. That is very true - pay is irrelevant. People who go into politics in the early days did not think of pay at all. They did not think of material benefits. They just had one goal, and that is, nation building.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of course, this is a different era. Today in the eighties, the situation is different from the early days when the PAP started out to strive for self-government and then independence. But it is a pity, really a pity, the PAP has lost much of its idealism. I believe the PAP started out with great ideals. They had democratic socialism in mind. They were working genuinely for the people and the masses of the people supported them wholesale because they had that idealism. They were not working for themselves. They were working for the people. Now the PAP has come to a situation where I think even the old guards say that the PAP is not recognizable to them. It is a differet PAP today.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have this revision of Ministers' salary. As I said, salary scales are subjective. There must be a basis for these salary scales. Of course, the PAP's basis is to attain the market value of Ministers. But there is another way of looking at Ministers' salary, and that is, to compare it to the average salary of the worker. The workers contribute to the creation of wealth in this country. Labour is a true source of wealth - labour, land and of course other resources. I do not know how our Members of Parliament in this House from the labour movement are going to explain to their members. I believe the average worker in Singapore earns not more than $1,000. I think 80% earn less than $1,000 per month. If you look at the advertisements in the papers, you see all kinds of perks given to a factory operator - $560 starting pay and together with this and that, at the most it is $700-plus.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at it another way, a worker has to work 30 months to get the same pay as a Minister if we take the average pay of Ministers as $30,000. A Minister works one month, our average worker has to work 30 months and if our --- [Interruption]. Yes, I think that is a basis of comparison. Can we say that a Minister is so valuable that the differential is so great as far as nation building is concerned?

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how do you pay Albert Schweitzer? Albert Schweitzer was a German philosopher, a great organist of Bach, he was an expert in the works of Bach, and he was also a great surgeon. He went to deep Africa, gave his life to the Africans.

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, can Singapore produce Albert Schweitzers? I think we actually did. [Laughter].Do not laugh. I think we have one. I remember reading in the Straits Times we have got one Dr Ang. I think she went to Lebanon in the danger of losing her life to treat the wounded in the civil war there. How much are you going to pay her? In the case of Margaret Thatcher, she was responsible at least for policy making. I believe she was responsible for the victory in the Falklands War.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Is it?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes, Mrs Thatcher, the English Prime Minister. How much are you going to pay her for that? Really there is no such thing as a pay which is enough. We should look at Singapore's context and look at what philosophy we are applying, whether it is an out-and-out capitalist philosophy or whether there are some socialist principles, which we should adopt. If we are going to adopt the socialist principles, then there must be a lot of self-restraint. Salaries of Ministers appropriately, I think, should not be decided by Ministers as I think the Second Deputy Prime Minister has said, it is embarrassing to give yourself a pay rise. Have I got it correctly?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> I did not say that. People will be asking whether it is embarrassing.

  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> You can refuse it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, now that the Prime Minister has mentioned about my pay as MP, is $4,000 enough? I am not saying that it is not enough. I did not say that. It is very subjective. The Prime Minister has said that this is my 13th year in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> politics. After three tries, the fourth try I was successful. How do you gauge your salary for all those works done and trouble and the sort of uncomfortableness that you have put in. I think it is really difficult to put a peg at a certain pay rise. In Singapore's context, I think Ministers' salary should have a basis, not based on market value, but really what is enough for that standard of living and a bit extra, if you like. Because I think basically Ministers should take the lead, if we really want to build a nation. Of course, if we are running a company, then it is a different matter altogether. The whole idea of going into business is profit. That is the aim. If anybody who says he wants to go into business for public good, I think you had better close your business. That is the main fault of the Malaysians. They get into politics and they want to set up cooperatives. There is a conflict. You cannot go into politics and do business at the same time. Either you go into business or you go into politics. You cannot mix the two. That is their mistake. So if you want to go into business, by all means and if you can make $151,000 a month, I wish him good luck. I do not envy him at all and if they are paid $196,000 per month or even $10 million if he makes in one deal, I do not envy him. That is his aim in business. But we cannot compare political salary with people in the private sector. There is no basis of comparison because the two aims are different. One is public service, the other is profit. How can you compare the two? You cannot. There is no basis of comparison.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to go into public service, go the whole hog. I know in our materialistic society today, probably there are difficulties in getting good men. But in the early days Singapore was able to get good men and I cannot see why we should not strive harder or, in fact, get some of the old guards back.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the army, if you want to be the General, if you want to be the leader, you do not get the best position. You do not adopt the safest position. The leader is the one who, when he says "Charge", he is right in front, charging, just like the Prime
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Minister. But with all these incentives of salary, pay, I do not know whether or not our leaders today, when they say "Charge", will be in front or will they be behind. Because if you are going for pay alone, you have not got that commitment to really be in front. It is those people with the commitment who will, when they say "charge", be in front there. But if you pay them a salary, even a bigger pay, when you say "charge", he will look around and say, "You chaps better go first. I don't want the salary." I think that is a problem there.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we adopt this materialistic approach, in the long run if there is a real crunch, let us say if there is a war, what will happen to our leaders? Will they be here? Like Winston Churchill, he refused to get out of London.In the midst of the blitz he remained there. He was not concerned with his pay and salary. He was there, the leader. The leader must be in the midst of the war.

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I do not know. If you are just going to get men based on just pay, then if there is really a final crunch, will these people stay in the midst of the greatest danger?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I am objecting, as I said, not for political gains or score political points, but based on principles, because I say that Ministers are leaders of the country and their aim is to give public service and therefore our criteria should not be the salary to attract them. There must be something more. I believe in the idealistic approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first a few words on the salary increases of the civil servants. In my short speech on the Budget, I said:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'While it may sound fair to revise salaries for those who carry heavy responsibilities in government work, it is not possible to match salaries in the public sector with those in the private sector. And it is wrong to do so.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we believe that there is a case for salary increases for civil servants on the timescale and also other professional and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> statutory bodies. And we also believe that there is a very strong case for the salary increases for those in the Civil Service at the bottom. But we find it difficult to accept that the salaries for Permanent Secretaries, which are already high, should be further increased. Still less, Sir, do we see any necessity to have so-called performance bonuses and other extra grades for the civil servants right at the top. We believe, Sir, this is merely an attempt to buy their loyalty and to reward their loyalty to the ruling Party. It is basically wrong.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For comparison, Sir, we should think of salaries of Permanent Secretaries in other countries, as mentioned by Mr Chiam, not necessarily of countries around us in South-East Asia but of salaries in other developed countries, like Britain, Australia, New Zealand, elsewhere. And if we want to compare the public sector vis-a-vis the private sector, then we should compare also, very importantly, all the salaries at the bottom. As you all know, 70% of the workers in Singapore earn less than $1,000 a month. They will find it very difficult as time goes by, whereas those at the top will find it only too easy. And if you want to talk of raising salaries of civil servants right at the top, what about having a minimum wage for the workers? The Government has not mentioned that at all. I do not know why the Second Deputy Prime Minister has not mentioned that at all. He is supposed to be looking after the workers. But all I can see is he gets an office which is a sinecure.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Sir, there is also a danger of these general salary increases triggering off a general price increase of all things and of salaries in the private sector. As regards the private sector, Sir, I am sure the Ministers will agree that there are many businesses in the private sector which are not doing well at all. Many of those who are working in business firms do not get a good salary. If you want to compare, compare that as well. Why only compare salaries of those right at the top?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the Ministers salaries, I also agree with Mr Chiam that there is no basis for comparison whatsoever. It is wrong to compare Ministers' salaries with those in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the private sector, as also mentioned by Mr Bernard Chen.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministers have prestige, status and power which no amount of money can buy. You just see how the Prime Minister goes about - cars in front, cars behind. How many people are around him? You don't get such kind of attention in the private sector! And as mentioned also by Dr Tan Cheng Bock, if you give make-up pay, the danger is that you might not get the right people in and instead get the wrong people in. And then we are in the soup. If people in the private sector wants to enter politics because of high salaries (as the First Deputy Prime Minister has already said), then they do not deserve to be Ministers anyway. If they really want high salaries, I suggest that they emulate Michael Jackson - Go and be an actor! Get onto the stage. They can earn much more money. Why don't they?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Deputy Prime Minister spoke about the judges. He said our judges receive very low salaries in comparison with the top 50 or 30 in the private sector. Has he ever compared the salaries of judges in Britain with the earnings of QCs who earn lots of money? Why can't he give us those comparisons as well, so that we can better judge exactly how underpaid our top civil servants and judges are?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also said that if anybody should oppose the salary increases, it is because of hypocrisy. Sir, I have been in politics for quite some time and I am sure the Prime Minister would agree that, whatever name he may label on me, I am not one who is a hypocrite. I have gone into politics because I believe in something. On this occasion, I believe that to increase the big salaries of our Ministers is not correct. How high? How much is enough? There is no proper figure. You just cannot tell. As I have mentioned on other occasions, high salaries do not necessarily give you a clean, honest government. Sometimes you get Ministers who are corrupt and the Government would not know until quite sometime later. In the meanwhile, all the damage has already been done. If you want to talk of high salaries keeping a person honest, then there are lots of people outside who earn very high salaries,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and they keep on being corrupt. The more money they have, the more money they want. We have examples of people who are prosecuted in court - tycoons, stockbrokers, lawyers, bankers. You just name them, you get them!
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On many occasions, Sir, the First Deputy Prime Minister talked about our small talent pool and that we cannot get the people we want. If you pursue a policy of elitism, of course you are bound to get a small talent pool. As the Prime Minister once said (he always believes in things like that, which is wrong), he said that if he and his 300 colleagues should go into a jumbo jet and it crashed, Singapore would perish. Does anybody really believe in that? I do not think the Prime Minister himself believes in that.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other day when I asked questions about why people resign from government service, I already indicated that there are many reasons why people just do not want to take part in politics. Maybe it is because they cannot agree with many of the government policies. They cannot agree with the education policy, for example. The 1DPM speaks of Ministers who were President Scholars and what-nots, doing all their best for the Government. I am sure the Government will that remember not so very long ago Education Ministers had to be changed frequently, and there were about 10 or 11 different Education Ministers all in a span of two or three years. If the policy was correct, then the government would not need to change Ministers. Only recently, Sir, the Ministers also made many blunders, and they had to keep changing policies in order to win back lost votes. Thus we can see that all the talent need not necessarily be with the Ministers. If the government should cast the net wide enough, I am sure it will get many, many more such talents everywhere.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, of course, there is always a fear of the "big brother". I will touch a little more on that. Many people have disagreed with many things which the Government is doing and they are voting with their feet and emigrated, as one Minister of State has said. Therefore, there are many, many
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> other reasons. Among the professionals, there are a number of doctors, and even lawyers too I hear, who are very unhappy with the terms and conditions of service. Of course, they would like bigger salaries. Who doesn't? But then, one very big complaint is that the terms and conditions of service are not good enough. They do not give them freedom of initiative. And in spite of the announced restructuring of the General Hospital, they may still not give doctors such freedom of initiative. So we have to wait and see.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there were also many people who found they had no chance of promotion simply because they could not agree with their superiors. And since all the assessments of officers are done by their superiors, those who found that they could not agree with their superiors would have to opt out-no point of staying on and becoming second-line officers without chance of promotion at all.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then one most important reason why many people have not taken part in politics-the Ministers of course know it- is because of the climate of fear in Singapore. The climate of fear, Sir, has driven many people away from politics. They dare not take part. I myself was afraid! Yes, Sir, I remember in 1958 when the Prime Minister asked me to stand as a candidate for the City Council by-election in Kallang. I told the Prime Minister that I was scared. Scared of what? ISA. The ISA is the trump card of the PAP. That is how the Prime Minister and his colleagues have been able to remain in office all these years. It might have done something good - true. But I would say that if I support many of the government policies today, it is because these policies are the very policies which we fought for in the old days. And I am glad that government has changed them. Govt has realized its mistakes. The Prime Minister himself admits to the Taiwan newspaper that if he had a chance, he might change many things. And already other people have changed some of these policies for him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that is the situation, Sir-the fear. And when it comes to elections, it is always very difficult to get professional people to step foward and stand as oppo-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> sition candidates. They just dare not. They have seen what happened. The moment they oppose the government, they become Marxists. The moment they oppose the government, they are supposed to be linked to some united front activity or other. All sorts of labels have been indiscriminately used by the Prime Minister in the past and by the new Ministers today. All in order to suppress the opposition and to intimidate - that is the word, "intimidate" - all those who would like to contribute their share towards the running of the country. I would suggest that if the Ministers should care to really implement policies that allow all the people to take part in politics without fear, then I am sure there will be many many more people coming into the political arena and the so-called talent pool will increase immensely.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Government realizes that it has difficulty in getting public support for the salary increases. Fancy, 70% of our workers receive less than $1,000 a month. Would they be happy seeing our Prime Minister and Ministers getting $30-$40,000 a month? They work all their lives and they would not be able to amass anything near those figures which our Ministers are going to get in one month. All you need to do is to become a Minister in the Government and at most in two years, you become a millionaire. The salaries are all there, in spite of the fact that Ministers have to pay income tax. Of course, the income tax is paid by us. They get the salaries. So how can government expect support from the people in the circumstances?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people may wonder, and I heard this a little while ago, why people still take part in politics in spite of the ISA and in spite of the danger of being kept behind bars. Well, there are people who have beliefs in certain things. From the beginning, we hold such beliefs. And if we believe in certain things, of course, we see things according to the facts which the First Deputy Prime Minister has outlined, from a slightly different perspective. We do not look at those things in the same way as the Ministers look at them. And we therefore believe that it is more important for people who enter politics to be dedi-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> cated, really dedicated. Some people say that the word "dedication" does not make sense nowadays. It does. If the Minister is really dedicated, he would not think too much about the salary, so long as he is paid adequately. Yes, I agree that we should increase our salaries in general in many ways to make sure that they are adequate. But it is very difficult to hold the level down as to what is adequate and what is not for many people. And if they think only of salaries, then of course however much you give them will never be enough.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government frequently speaks of a clean, honest government. I have already mentioned the fact that high salaries do not necessarily give you a clean, honest government or honest Ministers. And history has proven that what I have said is true. I do not need to go very far back for names. Just the latest will do, namely, Teh Cheang Wan and Phey Yew Kok. Although they were drawing high salaries, nevertheless, something went wrong. Therefore, high salaries need not be such an important factor for recruiting people to become honest Ministers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you prevent corruption? The Prime Minister has given a good talk on this before, and I have tried to look up the old newspapers. But let me remind all in the House that we have a capitalist economy in Singapore. And in a capitalist economy where money is the main criterion of whether a person is a success or not, there is no way, no 100% way, of preventing corruption, however high a salary you may give a person. The only way, as I have seen from the newspapers,is that you have a vigilant CPIB. Yes, that is very important. And equally important is that there must be frequent checking. But how do you check? If the Ministers merely declare their assets to the Prime Minister, alone, only one person can check. I am not saying that the Prime Minister is not honest. But then he may not be the Prime Minister all the time. There may be other Prime Ministers. If you want the assets to be checked, then they should be checked (even if you want to have confidentiality in such matters), by a special committee of honest people whom we all respecst and trust. And better still, of course, if the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Ministers could declare their assets publicly before they take office. That would tell the people exactly where they stand. That allows all the people to check and not only one person to check which, in principle, is wrong, just as in the case of the elected President. One person checking is wrong. You must allow more people to check, as already suggested by a Minister of State - better that checking be done by a committee. And that would reduce opposition from many people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But more than that, as was also previously emphasized by the Prime Minister, there must be public conscience on the matter. The moral values of society must be correct. In China, when they had a slightly different system, there was hardly any dishonesty that we knew of. Nowadays, it is different. Conditions have changed. Singapore is a capitalist country with a developing expanding capitalist system. Giving high salaries, might help. If you have severe laws and penalties, that also will help. But most important of all is open public surveillance and it is important that we all have the correct social Asian moral values.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government now stresses a lot on moral values. I agree with many of the moral values that they have suggested. But the point is how do they carry out the teaching of moral values and how do political leaders actually carry them out in practice, so that everybody is imbued with those moral values, and so do not go corrupt or things like that? We have seen examples of people who have high moral values, taxi drivers, chambermaids, and who have found lots of money and giving them back to the owners. They do not want to take the money though they do not have high salaries. They do not need high salaries in order to be honest and not be corrupt. Wonderful people we have in Singapore and they are honest not because of high salaries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarize, Sir, leadership is all important in this kind of things. In this instance, the Government has set a poor example. Ministers should, in fact, lead in not drawing high salaries, and as far as

  <br> possible inculcate the moral values of dedication to service for the people by setting examples themselves. Otherwise, we will be following what Mr Rajaratnam had once said - moneytheism. We do not want that in Singapore. Ministers then become ugly Singaporeans, not pretty ones.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we believe that the gap between the salaries at the top and at the bottom should not be too wide. If it is already wide, then the gap should be narrowed. At the present moment, the proposed salaries will make the gap wider still. I do not think we want that.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, may I just remind the Minister that their salary increases can trigger off a lot of unnecessary side-effects. Mr Bernard Chen has already warned of the possible effects this might have on the economy. And already the Singapore economy is supposed not to do as well this year as last year. So when the economy goes down, more people will be affected. Those people who are sitting pretty at the top are those who have high salaries. But let them think also of those people at the bottom, those people who have very low salaries and who can hardly make ends meet. We asked for an increase in the personal allowance for those who are in the lower income group. What did the Minister say? Nothing doing. How then can you help them? Yet those in the low income groups are the people we should help. All the incentives given in the budget so far are incentives which give more benefits to those people who are very well off. They do not benefit those at the bottom.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not agree with all the salary increases that have been given and I hope that the Government would do everything possible to narrow the gap. If the PAP Government should still follow the old principle laid down in 1959, than what we want today is a really more equal and just society. If you increase salaries for those at the top and ignore those at the bottom, or merely give them a very small increase, then you are increasing social inequalities and increasing social injustice. I hope that is not what the Government wants to do.

  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Education (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of the measures announced by the First Deputy Prime Minister to revise the salaries of the political and judicial office holders and to revise the MP's allowance. As much has been said on this matter, I do not want to repeat what has already been said. But I want to make a few remarks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people including the Member for Potong Pasir and the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament have stressed the point - and our own MPs have also stressed the point - that a sense of mission and a sense of public service are needed for people who intend to go into politics. I agree that these are essential requirements. No one who does not have a sense of mission or a sense of public service should go into politics. While these are two essential requirements and they are necessary, we should ask ourselves whether they are sufficient, not now, but particularly for the future?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first generation leaders were the products of an era of monumental change in our country's history. They faced a great challenge-to found a new nation and to ensure its viability. Against this great challenge, all personal considerations paled into insignificance. I think, quite honestly, all Singaporeans should be grateful that at a critical time in our nation's history, there was a group of men led by the Prime Minister who were prepared to take on this challenge and their success can be seen in the thriving Singapore that we have today.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the second generation leaders? What is there to motivate them? They went into politics at a time when salaries of Ministers were much lower than they are today. What is the challenge which they face? Singapore has had only one Prime Minister since we became independent. I think the challenge for the second generation leaders, above all else, is to show that an orderly transition of power is possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Prime Minister hands over the reins of power to Mr Goh Chok Tong, it is our task to show that the present high
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> standards of administration and honest and effective Government will still continue and that the success of the first generation leaders is not a fluke or an accident of history. But if the second generation leaders succeed, and I am confident we will, what is there then to motivate, as Dr Tan Cheng Bock has said, the third generation leaders, or the fourth generation leaders? With an orderly transition of power, those who come after us should be able in due course to look forward to a Singapore whose viability is not in question. There will be problems. There will be crises ahead. But unless circumstances change dramatically or we do something very foolish, these will not be such as to threaten the survival of our nation. You ask yourself then: what is there to motivate capable young men or young women to enter the political arena, to give up their comfortable lives, their privacy and take office as Ministers of State, or Senior Ministers of State, and get the necessary experience and expertise to become full Ministers? I think that the job of attracting competent and committed young men and women to take office will become more and more difficult in the coming years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sense of mission and a sense of public service is still essential. Without that nothing will proceed. But it is not fair, Sir, that young men and women in future should be asked to take public office at the expense of their families, their wives and their children. They should be able to provide for their families adequately. They should be allowed to do their jobs without feeling a sense of guilt that they have not done the best they can to provide for their own families.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the salary revisions are necessary mainly to ensure that we will continue to be able to attract capable, committed young men and young women to take on public office in Singapore in the coming years. Without these salary revisions, Sir, to expect the best to come forward, I think is simply to leave too much to chance. For this reason, Sir, I support the salary revisions and I urge all Members of this House to have no qualms in supporting them. They are an investment in Singapore's future.

  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I also wish to rise to support the statement made by the First Deputy Prime Minister. My colleague, Dr Tony Tan, has spoken on what motivates the second generation leadership and I want to take this opportunity to very briefly explain what motivated my colleagues and me to come into politics.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were first approached we had to weigh many factors before entering politics. As we began to discuss and think about the prospect of entering politics, we became increasingly aware of the vital importance of continuing good political leadership for Singapore's future. We saw that the progress, the stability that the first generation leaership had succeeded to bring to Singapore had created many avenues for the young and talented to pursue and have a meaningful life. This very success had worked against good people, talented people, honest people coming into politics. There were no great injustices to be put right, no oppression to overthrow, no corrupt and venal leaders to unseat. Things were certainly not perfect. But the path to further economic and social progress seemed unthreatened. Thus the good were not being attracted to politics.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet as we examined the situation it was clear that the first generation was entering the last lap and there was nobody in sight to take over the baton. Having understood the problem, it was not possible for us in good conscience to say that it was up to somebody else to provide the solution. We had to be part of the solution. We were not attracted by money, power, prestige or fame. We were aware of the costs to our personal life, to our family life. But I must confess that in 1976 when I decided, I was less aware of these sacrifices than I am today. We were not fully aware of the demands of the electorate and of the constituents. I am not so sure if I had been so fully aware in 1976 whether I would have come into politics. But I want to say this, and I want to underline this, that having been in politics for 12 years I am also aware of the vital importance of power being in the hands of honest, com-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> petent people. Looking at it today, I would say that though the sacrifice is greater than I ever thought it would be, it is still worth it, in order to have the reins of political power in the right hands.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Chairman, Sir, when I from time to time have to speak to people to persuade them to come into politics, especially those with the potential to become office-holders, I am very very conscious of the fact that I am asking that person to do something that will change his or her entire life. It is not like working for a head hunting firm, just speaking to a person to persuade him to change his career. It is something that will affect his whole life and the life of his family, his wife, his children. There are so many factors that make it unattractive to take up the challenge. There is in fact almost nothing that we can do to mitigate the pressures, the sacrifice in personal and family life that a person entering politics has to make. It is only a sense of service that can make the cause worthwhile. But there is one area that we can do something to mitigate the sacrifice and that is in the area of salary, to make it not much less than what that person would be earning if he were not in politics. Not to do something in this one area where we can do something would be irresponsible. Mark you, I am not saying that we should attract people through high salaries and that high salaries make up for the sacrifices. What I am saying is that this is one area where we can minimize the loss and we should minimize the loss. That is the reason why I support the First Deputy Prime Minister

  <!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Boon Heng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, a question has been asked about how workers in Singapore would view the salary increases that we are proposing for Ministers and other political office-holders. Sir, I submit that the Singapore worker is a very practical minded person. His aspiration is to have a good job that pays him well. What he wants in Singapore is to have a good political leadership that will be able to set the right policies, to attract the right investments, to get him a job. Having come through the recent recession, the Singapore worker knows that if we have the wrong people in charge, we would have a far worse recession and the alternative to good leadership would be not two years of wage restraint but perhaps several years of unemployment. The Singapore worker also knows that in the context of Southeast Asia and South Asia it is very important to stress on good leadership to create the right employment. Otherwise the Singapore worker would be like the Filipino maid, going overseas to look for jobs. Otherwise the Singapore worker could find himself in the same position as some of the Thai workers today. Perhaps if we do not have the right leadership to create the right policies, to formulate the right policies, to create the right employment, the Singapore worker himself will be forced to go overseas and perhaps to work illegally. Do we want our Minister to go overseas in order to bail them out to avoid their being punished by the laws of a different country? I think that is the price of good political leadership and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the right kind of political leadership that we should have in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sumit that the Singapore worker today wants to have a good job, wants to have a good pay and hopes that he shall never have to wander very far to find a job. I think he relishes the position he is in today where he can walk into any factory to get the job that he wants. If he does not like the job, he can walk to the next factory to get a better paying job. So the price we are talking about today of $9 million per year in terms of wage increase for political appointees, for Members of Parliament, is a small price to pay.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore worker also knows that in his own company his managers are paid more than our Ministers of State. Therefore he does not worry unduly about the wage increases that we are talking about giving to our Ministers when in fact they are still below the wages which their own managers are being paid. Our workers also know that in their workplace when the managers get pay increases there is no consultation about how much should the managers' wages be increased, not like what we are doing today of debating how much our Ministers, Ministers of State, Parliamentary Secretaries, ought to be paid. This I hope will be the spirit in which we discuss the subject of salary increases for our Ministers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singaporean knows that in our context, it is the policy maker who decides policy and if the policies are right, things go well for the country and it is quite ridiculous to consider that the policy-makers, the Ministers and Ministers of State, should be paid less than civil servants who in fact are the executors of the policy. If we want, first of all, the policies to be right then we ought to have the right people in those places, then comes the civil service. So our priority must be to make sure that in our system we always shall have the best talent available in the country in political leadership. Ideals are important. They drive a country forward but ideals will only produce certain results and I submit to Mr Chiam that in the days of the Empire it was not pure idealism that drove British people overseas to conquer
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> foreign lands. It was more than just idealism. It was also the rewards that went with it. If there was no reward, would we have gone through a period of struggle for independence, if we did not see the benefits accrued to the colonial power and not to the people? And we all know how the people in charge of the empire lived, even in our own country. Were they not staying in the Istana free of charge? Were they not living in Command House? We all know that the colonial administrator was amply rewarded and perhaps with all the trappings they were much better paid in the past than what is being paid to our Ministers today.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your indulgence, I would also like to touch on another point about civil servants. Although I say that priority should be given to those who set policy, it does not mean that we should forget the civil service because the implementers are also important. We have had the revision of salaries for civil servants but I would like to voice what some of my friends who have been working in the civil service said, and that is, the question of promotion. It is not merely the pay but also the hassle that he has to go through in order to get promoted. Some of these civil servants who were seconded to the NTUC have related to us the kind of hassle that they have to go through in order to get promoted. I think that apart from revising the salaries of civil servants we should look also very seriously into the pace and manner of promotion of civil servants.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, first, may I pick up where the last speaker, Mr Lim Boon Heng, left off about the salaries of the civil service. In 1981, I moved the first major revision. In 1985, I moved a second major revision. In 1989, we are in a third major revision. Why? We can increase the salaries but the progression an officer enjoys depends not just on the salary scale or the value of the superscales but on the rate of promotion and, unfortunately, there was a lack of synchronization between what the public sector did and what was happening in the private sector. I hope we can avoid a repetition of the slow promotions in the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Administrative Service and the general public service which caused problems in the past.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was because of a generation gap in the values and perceptions of the former Chairman of the Public Service Commission, the late Mr Tan Teck Chwee, and the young scholars he recruited and promoted. Mr Tan was a very able man. He rose to the top by sheer ability, versatility, grit, hard work. He had never been recruited into the civil service. At the time when he graduated only the top best two students would get a chance into the Straits Settlement's civil service-the cream of all the jobs available. You began life at $150 a month in the 1930s and on confirmation, after two years, you got $190, the best paid job. No multi-national, Shell or any other company, paid that sum.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his final year in Raffles College he faced family difficulties because his father had died. That affected his examination results and he missed his First Class. So he ended up as a teacher in Raffles Institution, the best he could hope for at that time, at a salary of around $120. After the war he went back to teaching, then he ventured into business as a contractor in the earth-moving business and he proved that he was not only a scholar but a practical and shrewd businessman, one with great foresight and organizational ability. He made a success of his business and he ended up helping the Government run Jurong Shipyard Ltd and Jurong Engineering Ltd and when he retired he took on the Chairmanship of the PSC.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted our scholars to go through life the way he did, that made him. He did not realize or did not acknowledge that, in a fast growing economy, values were changing rapidly and our young men and women were more concerned with getting present recognition and rewards than winning future esteem and security - the security of pensions. The result of this generation gap was many resignations as scholars found promotions slow and careful and their contemporaries doing better in the private sector. Worse, in recent years, there were fewer scholarship takers and new entrants into the service.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hold Mr Tan Teck Chwee in the highest esteem and I reappointed him twice after 1975, first in 1980 and again in 1985, because he had outstanding qualities. He was absolutely superb in assessing and judging the ability, the character, the integrity, the motivation and the intrinsic worth of people. Despite this problem of slow speed of promotions, I concluded that he was the best man for the job. Of course, I had the help of Mr Hon Sui Sen when he was alive. He was a contemporary of Tan Teck Chwee in Raffles College. They were very close and they shared the same generational values. And he could persuade Tan Teck Chwee to go faster on promotions from time to time. But after he died, I found the job was much more difficult alone without Hon Sui Sen. So the last few years became difficult. I hope the new Chairman of PSC, having had many years as the Chief Executive of Overseas Union Bank, understands the market and understands the young that he has been recruiting in the OUB organization and that we will move in keeping with the times.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good administration is essential but in a developing country, let me add, a good political leadership is critical. It is life and death. In a developed society, you can have mediocre indifferent Ministers and the country will get by. France had over 31 governments in the 13 years from 1945 to 1958, revolving doors. Every four to six months a government collapsed. But a good administration of the graduates of the Grande-ecole, the grand colleges that you get into only if you are from the very best and can get through a competitive examination. They kept the business of government going. But that was with Marshall plan, a settled population established, no basic contradictions in society. In a developing society, if you have a weak political leadership, the best of administrations will not rescue you.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the first question we have to ask ourselves is: how do we continue to enjoy stability, good government, good policies, growth? We leave aside the civil service. I hope the necessary conditions are in place that we will continue to get into the public sector out of the best 100 each year- each year's cohort of 50,000 pupils-out
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of 100 of the best, the public sector should get at least 30 in all branches, whether in the administration, medicine, engineering, architecture, accountancy, law, etc. If we cannot, the Government will not function at a level it must in order to provide the private sector with the conditions to flourish. To have 30, we have to recruit about 50 and allow for an attrition of 20.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me recount a conversation I had with an ASEAN Minister just over a year ago. He had just left office and he came to Singapore for the first time in many years as a private citizen - knocking around, golfing, shopping. At the end of his stay of over a week, he paid me a courtesy call that went on for about 50 minutes. I was asking him about his experience and he was unburdening himself of all the problems that they faced, and the root cause of these-a young society, too many conflicting goals, an unstable situation at the top; money politics, a very big problem. And he complimented me on having established a political culture in Singapore where people can go into politics without having to spend much money. They can get themselves elected without heavy financing and they will have no obligations after they are elected. No obligations to discharge, which is not the case in his country. And they can therefore, in Singapore, be above board, strictly impartial, because they have no favours to return. It was a very big tribute from a very experienced political leader, because it was sincere. He was out of office; he had nothing to gain. He was just letting his hair down.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: how do you, the younger generation, continue this? Sir, by a curious turn of history, I have in this Chamber another man who was here in 1959, Dr Lee Siew-Choh. He will remember 1959-51 of us, totally different. And in his heart of hearts, he knows that Singapore has done well. Or he would not be here! And what is more, he knows, having been here now for three months debating and arguing, that this is by far a superior Chamber than it was in 1959. The quality of the debate, the quality of the minds surpasses that of 1959; integrity equals that of 1959; commitment could equal that of 1959. We will know when there is a real
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> big explosion. I am convinced there are enough here who will survive and lead.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did we get here-from a revoluntionary situation in 1959 to a settled, more or less steady state? We got here because we made changes as our situation and our society changed. Yes, I held down wages. When we ran into the British withdrawal, it was stupid and would have been lunatic not to have held down wages until the economy lifted. When it did in 1970, I made the first major revision, both public service and ministerial. I held mine down because I did not want any wrong ideas. And an adjustment every now and again. But the major ones were in the 1980s, because then the private sector had lifted off.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government used to be the biggest employer of graduates and of workers, easily 50% in the 1950s. Today, the private sector sets the pace. If you do not pay that wage, you get what is left behind.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we will never have an end to this-how many times more does the man at the top get compared to the man at the bottom? In China, Chairman Mao (I don't know what the present rate is, but this was in 1985 and I did my calculations), he was paid some 38 times. But does that mean anything? Can you buy anything with Renminbi in the shops? If you are ill, an ambulance will take you to hospital. Which hospital? What surgeon? It is a very stratified system. If you are that rank, you are entitled to these shops, you are entitled to these services, you are entitled to these quarters. What does modernization mean?- That the system did not produce the best results for everybody. Everybody became poor-the iron rice bowl. And now we have the Soviet Union admitting that the system has failed-change!
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are McEnroe, or Borg, or Boris Becker, and you go to Wimbledon and win. Between No. 1 and No. 2, there is a difference of multi-millions of dollars. Nobody wants No. 2's name on his racket or his shirt, or his shoes. So you will fight your guts out to get there. If you watched Navratilova, you will know that she is not
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> going to give up the royalty on signing her name on rackets, tennis balls, and shoes, and shirts until age refuses to give her that bounce. Between her and the ball picker, what is the difference? Does anybody want to watch a ball picker play tennis, or how to pick balls? Who decides? Who decides what an Olympic champion gold medal is worth? It is the market. That is the system. You want maximum results, you let the market decide. Lou Retton, the American gymnast at Los Angeles made multi-millions just a few minutes on television a few nights of the week-jumping, bouncing, turning, twisting. And Lou Retton was what you want on your tracksuits or whatever gym kit you wear. If you are No. 2, it is not the same. How long you stay No 1, that is uncertain. They go very quickly. That is the market. You can get a gold medal for hurdles, like Moses did. Nobody wants his name. They are not interested in hurdles, they were not watching. One had multi-millions of followers, the other did not. Who is to judge? Both are gold medallists. Both went up the podium, both went up to the top, the band struck Star Spangled Banner for the USA, but the one who bounced away on the wooden horse and the parallel bars was worth many, many times more than the other.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, why is Mr Chiam doing so well in Singapore? It is the market. We are not giving him special government contracts to do. He does not need it. And I am cheered by the debate this morning because in spite of pretending he does not understand, he does in fact. He knows. Even Dr Lee Siew-Choh. He lacks that fire, that real outrage at the iniquity of it all. He knows it is fair.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This system has produced for Singapore the best of possible results. I have been in nine general elections, one before Dr Lee Siew-Choh got into this House; in 1955, the first elections ever. And this is the best Chamber since 1955. How to keep it that way? You have heard Goh Chok Tong tell you how much effort went into talent spotting and persuading. And he did much of it. Because once we move into the 1980s, the old guard like myself, we only met limited numbers of young scholars, potential candidates, maybe 50, 60 a year. But the younger generations are out-on
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> walkabouts, meeting, talking, assessing. He has done it, 1980, 1984, 1988, with the team. Even after you persuade the man, it is a difficult problem because the wife has to be persuaded. And she does not want her family to be sacrificed. It is not just money. It is time, it is privacy, leisure together, holidays together. And in a small society like Singapore, 2.5 million in a compact area, 620 sq km, you knock into each other in the same clubs, restaurants, reunion dinners and, inevitably, lifestyles are compared, if not openly, mentally. It is in the nature of our society. Even their children, our children, they go to school, they compare lifestyles. What watches? I think it is a stupid thing to do, value watches. And the latest vogue, I am told, is: "Where did you go for your holidays? Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand?" That is passe. "Have you seen Disney World? Or Disneyland? Europe?" It is not easy in a developing country-and we still are, perhaps for another 10, 11, 12 years-to make a living in politics. It is a very difficult and complicated business.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have heard references to Margaret Thatcher, to Albert Schweitzer. I did not know he was an organist. I think Mr Chiam got them mixed up. He was a doctor. But never mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr S. Dhanabalan:</b> He was also an organist.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> I stand corrected. But I do not think the Africans were interested in carrying heavy organs where he was!
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it relevant to us? How do we move forward? To get good Ministers, you must have good MPs because they come from the MPs. Without good MPs, good Parliamentary Secretaries, good Senior Ministers of State, you do not have good Ministers. It is a progression.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain the difference. Margaret Thatcher, as Prime Minister, is paid half the salary of the Head of the Civil Service. The Head of the British Civil Service is paid, speaking from memory, some o90,000, (o89,000 something or the other), and Margaret Thatcher is paid half of that. The Head of the Civil Service gets the same pay as the Lord Chief Justice, which
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> is the same pay as 5-star Field Marshalls, Admirals of the Fleet, Marshall of the Royal Air Force, only one at any one time. Then you retire but you remain a 5-star General or Admiral or whatever. That is a different system.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir John Hoskin, who was Margaret Thatcher's management consultant, in a speech to the Directors' Institute in the early 80s said that the talent of that government [of the first Margaret Thatcher government] was not enough to fill one multi-national management. But that is the system. The Permanent Secretaries are brighter, abler, than the Ministers, better minds, no doubts about it. You do not get into the British Civil Service unless you have got a First at Oxford or Cambridge or some top university and sit for a competitive examination. Your First just qualifies you to take the examination.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theory was that you enter politics as a public service, that you should really have your own income. You are not living off your salary or your MP's allowance. And indeed such was the case right up till World War II, 1945, and I arrived in Britain in 1946, shortly after. A transformation took place and Britain has never ceased to change since then, in many ways for the better. Because that old class society was pushed aside. But they never changed this. It was politically too difficult. They had to keep up the myth that you entered public service to render service, that you have somehow a private income. They do not.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tories looked after their Ministers or their leaders through the old boy network. There are bankers, heads of various corporations. They look after them. The Labour Party has the union and co-op network. So they look after them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know the American system. When you are in office, you are in contact with all the decision makers. And then you leave. You are a lawyer, you can do it as a lawyer; or you join a firm of consultants and you do it as a lobbyist. Or you just go into Wall Street as David Stockman did, who was Reagan's first Budget Director. You write a book for US$2 million and you get a salary of a million dollars. So four years was worth it. But it is always changing. Because that is his price, after 4 years
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> or 3 years. So why serve 8? The value in Wall Street does not go up. Maybe for Americans, it is a good system. But there is no way in which we can divorce the political leadership from the permanent service. It is linked in every country. I have looked into it, because I thought of delinking or decoupling.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was reading this just yesterday in the International Herald Tribune centre page, by David S. Broder, one of the more thoughtful American columnists. He was talking about an unprecedented situation which has now arisen because their judges are about to leave. They cannot carry on. And the Chief Justice, William Rehnquist, called a press conference, unprecedented, to talk about the plight of the Federal District Judge in Laredo; Judge Kazen, in Texas. And it is representative of what is happening in America.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was earning $120,000 a year in private practice when President Carter appointed him to the Bench 10 years ago. Today he is making $89,500, in inflation-shrunk dollars. And he said:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I feel that serving my country for 10 years has cost my family $1 million. And what really hurts is when you're told: "You are in a fat, cushy job".' When he announced that he was looking for another job, that he may leave, he said:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I started getting feelers for jobs starting around $200,000. ... so what the hell. I tell you, we're the lost battalion out here and .... I'm very frustrated, very bitter.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Broder says:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Neither President Bush nor the Democratic leaders of Congress have stepped forward on the pay-raise issue since last month's fiasco.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of you who followed the American brand of politics will know that they contrive a politically ingenious low-cost solution for giving everybody a pay rise. They had a commission to deliberate and recommend what people should be paid, President downwards, and everybody got about 50%, some 80%, pay rises. And all the President need to do is to sign it, present it to Congress and if both Houses, the Senate and the House of Representatives, do not reject it, it is automatically
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> law. In other words, if one body stays neutral and only one opposes, it becomes law.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senate is selected once in six years. So they said, "Well, we oppose." Not that they do not believe they ought to get a pay rise. But they said, "Well, the other chaps will not oppose and we'll all get our pay rise." Whereupon, the radio talk shows, DJs worked up feelings and everybody got inundated with letters. So they got nervous and the Speaker also got the wind up and he decided to call for a vote, overwhelmingly turned down. So both Houses turned it down. The commission's report was rejected. And the Judges were in there.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the question is: should it not be decoupled? What is interesting is this. Mr Broder says:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Many members of the commission favour "decoupling" congressional pay from that of judges and top executive-branch officials, and taking immediate steps to deal with the crises in the Judicial and the executive branches. But most Congressmen simply do not seem ready to take up the issue.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Broder goes on to say:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Congress deserved - and deserves - a pay increase. But the crisis is greater in the other two branches, where salaries cannot be supplemented by honoraria or other outside earnings.' If you meet a group of lobbyists - let us say you are in the Banking Committee of the Senate or the House and you have a breakfast meeting with 20-30 of them and you say a few words - in fact, what they want is to get a few words into your ear to decide how you vote in the Committee. That is a lecture and you are entitled to $10,000, besides the breakfast. And so it goes on.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we want that? I believe, and I am encouraged by the mood this afternoon, that we are getting the message across. Let us be honest. Let us stop the hypocrisy. Let us be practical. Do you want good men? Can you afford not to have good men? Can you afford somebody coming here and telling you that the Ministers in the Singapore Government will not fill one MNC here, not equal to it? I say this without any immodesty-that if our Permanent Secretaries were better than
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> us, we would have failed. They were competent men, able. But you need more than just ordinary competence. We were presented with unique problems that required a mind that gropes for the underside of a problem, turn it upside down and make an egg stand on its head. And I had five Ministers (and I can name them) who at any one time were better than their Permanent Secretaries-Goh Keng Swee, Hon Sui Sen, Toh Chin Chye, Rajaratnam, Lim Kim San. You can look up the records, look up their Permanent Secretaries. If these men here are only as good as their Permanent Secretaries, I would be worried. Because in a developing country situation, you need a leader of a Ministry or a department who not only understands the ordinary arguments for or against, but at the end of it says, "Look, will this work, given our circumstances? Never mind what the British, what the Australians, what the New Zealanders do. This is Singapore. Will it work in this situation?" And it is the leader with the political touch, with the rough and tumble of people, who has to decide.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had to build an Army, Navy and Air Force from scratch from a population of 2.1-2.2 million, at the time we started. I took my best Minister and said, "I'd stop Finance. We'll make a living. Lim Kim San, you take over. Keep it going. Goh Keng Swee run it. Build it from scratch." His only experience was as a corporal in the Volunteers. But I would like to see any Chief of Staff stand up to him and argue on hardware, on strategy, on tactics. He taught himself. And to make sure that I understood him, he made sure that I also read at least the basics of what he has read. I was inundated. What is a company, what is a platoon, battalion, brigades, divisions, who does what? You get a Permanent Secretary to do that? We studied systems-Israel, Switzerland, Sweden. But finally we worked out our own, and it is working.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most difficult part is to find new Goh Keng Swees, new Hon Sui Sens, new Rajaratnams, Toh Chin Chyes, Lim Kim Sans. Because if you lose that sharp cutting edge, your Permanent Secretary cannot save you. It has happened over and over again. Why are we different? Because we fielded our best team in the political
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> hot seat. It is much easier to be a Permanent Secretary. "Don't have to worry about answering either the Member for Potong Pasir or the Non-Constituency Member. These are my recommendations. They are logical. It's been done in these following countries. That is your choice, Minister. Choose." The theory that you can have anybody elected to office in Singapore and it will carry on is just stupendously stupid. It will not. And the Permanent Secretaries are the first ones to tell you that. They know. You can have it in Britain and America. Their leaders are good communicators. To be elected you have to be. But they make no bones about it. You see the way the American Press treated President Reagan. Hands off President, dozing off at Cabinet meetings, not interested, goes to sleep early. That is not the point. In that system, do you want to be President? For years you go around the country pumping hands, making speeches, to get support, and if you are no good at the television screen you are out. Good PR, then you win. The rest, you pick bright Secretaries who are prepared to give up their jobs. Like George Schultz who gave up his job as Chief Executive of Bechtel in California to become Secretary of State for 6(r) years. For a pittance. Yes, but then that is their system. I urge you to take a hard headed approach.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few points which deserve reply. Is it an abandonment of the idealistic approach for the materialistic? No. It is an adaptation to new conditions. Tan Teck Chwee refused to accept that the younger generation had different options from his. They defeated him. Let me recount one example. He was able and determined. We were short of good teachers. So he persuaded a young man, a President's Scholar, to take up Mathematics, sent him to a top university and be a teacher. The young man came back and said, "I want to join the Administrative Service." He said, "No, teaching is a good profession. I started life as a teacher. You see where that got me?" So the young man became a teacher, not at the university but at a junior college. Within a few years the young man had arranged for somebody to buy him out. So we lost. We had a teacher for a paltry few years and a big company got a man of some worth. I can repeat that umpteen
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> times, the market decides it. We had created a situation in which it is no longer possible to tell the young man: you will follow this. Indeed that was what was available to Tan Teck Chwee - there were two jobs in the Civil Service and only two a year. Other than that you are a teacher or you try and run a small shop. Chou En-lai, 100% and others 50%? Chou En-lai and China are in trouble. A generation that sacrificed everything, finds its children vulnerable to the good things in life, and finds their successor-generation also wanting the good life; and they do not know how to stamp out corruption. It is so vast. Anybody who goes to Hong Kong regularly, as I do, knows that if you want to do business you must learn to do what? The Hong Kong merchants and entrepreneurs arrange, they have to arrange, for many things, including the education of the top cadres with whom they deal, education of their children in America, because that is what they want. Says Dr Lee Siew-Choh, but that was only because they decided to follow capitalist methods, that in the days of Chairman Mao things were much better. That just is not true. In the days of Chairman Mao there were less opportunities because there were very few avenues for enterprise but the people who will return you, your discarded old sock or your ball pen, are specially selected to look after foreign guests, foreign visitors. We are all the product of our times and indeed not to recognize that would mean a collapse of what we have achieved so far.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee says it is wrong to compare the public sector with the private sector. Are we differently wired in our minds? One does not need to eat, to live, to send his children to university? The other does? You are born differently, one AC, the other DC?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talks glibly of British judges and QCs. I happen to know because that was my profession. You got a top QC to become a judge after he has had his innings at the Bar, and at the ripe old age or young age of 50+, before 60, he takes his last top income, tax free, and then goes on the Bench. That got cancelled when Labour got into office in the 1970's, and they had
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> problems. So now they have upped the salaries and they give them handsome pensions. So you take on a judgeship and carry on till 75, and you live happily ever after and you live for a very long time on indexed pensions. But those are the values of another society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried to get people to be judges in Singapore. Again and again I poured through the list. It does matter, and to pretend that it does not is to make the system malfunction. In short, this will not be the last time you are going to face it. In three to four years time, Goh Chok Tong and his committee will have to find another 15 to 20 good men and women to replace those who are older, and amongst the 15 to 20 there should be three potential Ministers. In the end, if one survives the attrition, that is not bad, because there is no guarantee that because you are a successful executive, therefore, you are a successful Minister. They are different. Aptitudes are required. You have to be good plus a touch not only with a camera but with people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam may not be able to add or subtract quickly, but he can get a pocket calculator to do that for him. But he knows that if he starts looking very sincere and raises his voice, then a lot of people in Potong Pasir will cheer for him, whatever he says. Our job is to slowly educate the people so that finally they know that this is all a charade, that this is a joke, that he is going through the motions. He cannot get anybody worthwhile to stand for elections for the SDP. He knows that. He has admitted that as much. It is a problem. Yes, I concede it is a problem for him as it is for us. More difficult for him, of course, because he is a committee of one; we are a committee of 20, 30, on our side. Dedication? Albert Schweitzer? Don't bother. Start off with a ball picker and maybe, if he picks good balls, you might make him into a tennis star for the SDP! Or better still, get a few good caddies, and you might turn up for the Singapore Open in golf. But for the PAP, before we take them in, we like those whose score should be at least below 80 for one round. Otherwise, don't try.

  <!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar GRC)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman, during the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> debate on the budget statement I stated that I support the move to increase the salaries for the Ministers. We must change the strange mentality of some people like Mr Chiam See Tong and Dr Lee Siew-Choh of "wanting the horse to be good, yet not wanting the horse to eat the grass." If we want to attract talented people to serve the nation we must not expect the Ministers to make too much sacrifices. Today in the big companies and in the banks, the salaries of the Chief Executives are many times more than those of our Ministers. Most people feel that under such leadership if the company can prosper and do well, then the future is promising. As such, it will not only be good to the company, it will also benefit all the workers. To such people, paying high salaries to these executives is justificable! However, once we talk about increasing the Ministers' salaries, some people like Chiam See Tong and Lee Siew Choh will say that we should not talk about money. "If we talk about money we lose our feelings for each other." But we must not forget that the Ministers' duties and responsibilities are very heavy and difficult. They have to look after not just a company, a clinic or a law firm, but a country with 2.6 million people and the survival of the country. Let us just put aside their heavy responsibilities for the time being and just take a look at our reserves. We have $33.3 billion in our reserves, but now we are only increasing their salaries by $43 million. It is only 0.012% of our reserves. We must change this strange attitude of "No to Ministers' pay rise, but all right to an increase of salaries for others" in order to attract more talented people to serve the nation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, if we compare the value of our Singapore dollars which has been enhanced and strengthen from year to year and the interest enjoyed by our reserves, we would realize that 0.012% increase in the Minister's salary is indeed negligible! No doubt, in many countries, their Ministers' salaries are very low, yet their currencies are being devalued again and again, to the extent of 30 to 50%, in the end it is the people who suffer! In order to have an honest, frank and efficient government, I support the motion to increase the Ministers' salaries. However, I
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> hope the First Deputy Prime Minister will reconsider the two following points:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the system of "make-up pay" to attract talents. Why don't we have a higher and uniform salary for Ministers to attract them, because with such a "make-up pay" it will result in a lack of uniformity in the Ministers' salaries and the difference can be very great. Although the second generation leaders are agreeable to this monetary incentive scheme of "giving heavy rewards to attract courageous people". I fear that the 3rd generation, 4th generation or even our future poliical leaders may, as a result of which be at odds with each other and be uncooperative with each other. There may even exist the feeling of being "lost". If there is such a phenomenon, then it will greatly reduce the cohesiveness among our Cabinet ministers, and it will do our nation no good.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, about the performance bonus of two months' salary to the Ministers, it may also give rise to some problems because if we award some ministers and do not award others, then there may be problems because performance appraisal is quite subjective. Because some human weaknesses, some Ministers may have some feeling of discontent and indirectly resulting in the lack of cohesiveness and coordination in the Cabinet. For this reason, I suggest that we award a fixed performance bonus to the Ministers. If possible, give the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Ministers and Senior Ministers a fixed bonus of two months, 1(r) months bonus for the Ministers and one month for the Ministers of State. This is certainly better than causing bad feelings among the members in the Cabinet as a result of some subjective appraisal system. I believe, by so doing, we would be able to maintain the spirit of cooperation which we have enjoyed all along in the PAP Government. Thank you.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, before I make my observations, I just want to make a couple of points in reply to the Non-Constituency MP, Dr Lee. He said that in 1958 when he was asked to stand as a PAP candidate in Kallang he was afraid of the ISA. I do not think that is quite correct
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> because in 1958, Sir, there was no ISA. There was the PPSO (Preservation of Public Security Ordinance).
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Splitting hairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am not splitting hairs. That is what he said-"the ISA was used as a trump card." These are his exact words. So he cannot deny that. Strange enough, Sir, in 1959 he stood as a PAP candidate and that was when the PAP came to power. However, in 1963, he led the Barisan Sosialis and I, for the first time, stood as a PAP candidate in the 1963 general elections. This has got something to do with what he said-"that he has never changed." I will show that he has changed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1963, the results of the general elections showed that the Barisan captured only 13 of the 51 seats. They became an Opposition but the NCMP himself was not in this House. In 1966, the Barisan went out of Parliament and took up extra parliamentary struggle, and for some time the NCMP decided not to take part in elections. But strange enough in the 1970s, he stood again. But when he said he did not change, I do not believe him because in the 1988 general elections he led his Party into the Workers Party and stood as a Workers Party candidate. I leave it to the House to see whether what he said is correct or not.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, let me come to the substance of today's debate. I have had a look at the last few copies of Hansard on salary increases for Ministers, MPs' allowance, judiciary and the lot. Therefore, I wish to commend the First Deputy Prime Minister for being frank and forthright in putting this problem in the right perspective by coming to grips with it and putting it to the nation. We all know that the second team led by the First Deputy Prime Minister-he was elected First Deputy Prime Minister after the 1984 elections by his peers and unanimously endorsed by all the PAP MPs-is now well placed to see Singapore through into the 21st century which is some 10 years or less to come.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in tabling the recommendations, effective from 1st April, the First Deputy
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Prime Minister pointed out the difficulty in recruiting fresh talents. By "fresh talents" I think he meant, amongst other things, getting younger men and women into the political leadership and that was the problem he and his team faced in the last two general elections.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, these recommendations for a revision in the salaries have got something to do more with the building up of a third team. I have spoken to quite a number of Ministers whom I know very well. They are not very particular about the salary revision for themselves but I can foresee that the problem is getting the third team. Before coming to the third team, may I say something of the second team because I know quite a number of the Ministers who helped to form the second team.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I recall to mind, in 1970, the PAP took on self-renewal, how to replace themselves by injecting fresh blood, better men and women into the Party. Looking at the second team, I would just like to describe a few of them. In 1972, the Second Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Ong Teng Cheong, a successful architect came in. So 1972-89, he and Dr Ahmad Mattar. In 1976, we had the First Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong. He was, I think, holding the post of Managing Director in Neptune Orient Lines and we also had the Minister for National Development, Mr Dhanabalan, who was Senior Executive Vice-President of the DBS. So 1976, two. Then in 1979, we have the Minister for Education, Dr Tony Tan, who was then General Manager of OCBC. Then, of course, in 1980 we had a couple more, the Minister for Home Affairs and Law, Prof. Jayakumar, who was also Singapore's Permanent Representative to the United Nations when he gave up his professorship at the Law Faculty, and also the Minister for Communications and Information, Dr Yeo Ning Hong, who was holding one of the top posts in a multi-national company. If we add them together, the Front Bench has 13, there are six with the Prime Minister, who of course is from the first generation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I am trying to say is that this process of a self-renewal and a careful and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> cautious selection of a team takes a long time, more than 10 years, to get a second team in place. But, that is not the end of it. What is more important is how this team will gel to become one team and to lead the nation forward. In my view, the problem that the second team under the charge of the First Deputy Prime Minister, who will in time to come take over as Prime Minister, will then have to settle the problem of looking for a third team. I do not think that within a span of five-seven years he could get that third team in place. But if he could, as the Prime Minister has said, for Ministers of State up to Cabinet Minister, maybe with a low attrition, yes. But if the salary revision is not realistic enough to make it more bearable and more acceptable to those who want to come into the political leadership, I think it will be more than hypocritical of us to just ignore this change of time. Time continues to change. It is never static. Situations will change. Societies will change. But the basic foundation, I submit, and that is, the political stability-honest, efficient and an incorruptible political leadership-is paramount to the future well-being of Singapore, and that is, if we are to continue to enjoy our good standard of living, our good government and of course as an independent, sovereign entity or nation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully subscribe to what the First Deputy Prime Minister has said earlier this afternoon, that he will take those suggestions and comments into consideration vis-a-vis the make-up pay, the performance bonus and so on. These are technicalities. I think what is important is to get that team and that is where we should never be deflected from. The third team is important. The dollars and cents, the technicalities of it, I think, are not. But I accept what he has brought up this afternoon. Thank you, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Clarification, Sir. Mr Ng Kah Ting mentioned something about my mistake concerning the PPSO and ISA. I believe he must know that the essence of the PPSO and ISA is the same-it is the special branch. I mentioned the ISA merely to make it easier for the people present here in the Chamber to understand what it is all about. The other thing he mentioned was that there were no trump cards being used. Maybe he has forgotten that Mr Lee

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font>

  <br> Kuan Yew used the PPSO to arrest many of our colleagues in the Operation Cold Storage in which more than 140 or 150 of our leaders were arbitrarily arrested. And, of course, we found it very difficult after that.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I knew that the NCMP would come out and say that-don't mix up the ISA with PPSO because basically it is the same. I say, no. Because in 1958, PAP was not in power. It was the Lim Yew Hock government. That is the difference I am trying to make. So let us not go around in this wild political rhetoric. I understand that. That is why I have deliberately made that point.

  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Minister for Trade and Industry and Second Minister for Defence (Services)) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry and Second Minister for Defence (Services) (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, several of the Members have laid stress on the importance of idealism as a value in public service. I agree with them. It is important-if we believe this is just a job to be done, we should not be here. And I think most of us would not be here were it not for a sense of service, mission, a sense of duty, something which has to be done. I say that not only of the Ministers but also of the MPs, and even of the Opposition MPS and the Non-Constituency MPs, who have clearly put considerable heart and soul into their political careers, successful or unsuccessful as they may have been.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is idealism. I do not think anybody in Singapore joins politics for salaries. I suspect in other countries too, they do not join politics for the salary; sometimes they do it because they mix business with politics. But that is an extra-curricular remuneration, not a formal salary; it does not apply in Singapore. In Singapore there are many easier ways of earning a living and having a peaceful life, doing well for oneself, without engaging in acrimonious discussions and soul-searching debates as to what is the right thing to do for the country.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idealism is a good word. Will it, by itself, be a sufficient policy guide for establishing a workable system? I do not think so. Whether idealism, by itself, will bring in the right people into politics, is not a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> matter of theory and rhetoric; but is an empirical fact. If what you say is true, are the right people coming in?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our society has changed. We are no longer in a revoluntion situation. We do not have riots and great uncertainty every day. Able young men do not fear for their entire futures, if they do not do something about the destiny of the nation. It is so peaceful that many people believe nothing need be done in order to maintain it like this. It will of its own accord sail on calmly, minus auto pilot, and never hit a rock.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such an environment, nobody believes that Singapore's future depends on his entering politics or not entering politics. They have options. They can calculate. You have so many Ministers, why don't you continue? You are doing a reasonable job. From time to time, we may be unhappy with what you do, but overall, please carry on. Leave us to look after our own careers. We are grateful that you have created so many opportunities and so many attractive routes of advancement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very natural, reasonable, understandable human reaction. We see it each time we look for an MP. We see it even more each time we look for Ministers, and I think the Opposition Members know this. Dr Lee said, if we need good people in politics, why not get the old generation leaders back? Because that was a different generation, a different situation, different compulsions, and different results. But are the young men the same?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have heard the Prime Minister talking about the Civil Service. The argument of service applies not just to politicians, but the civil servants too. It is the same argument - that civil servants ought to feel a sense of mission, purpose, making a difference; charting policies, being close to the centre of power, psychic pleasures and fulfilments, empty stomachs go unnoticed. If that were so, why are the civil servants leaving? Dr Ow earlier asked how many Permanent Secretaries have left-fortunately, none. But unfortunately there may not be many Permanent Secretaries left, because they are leaving long before they become Per-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> manent Secretaries or, for that matter, Deputy Secretaries. Likewise, with Judges. It is an honour to serve, yes. You have heard how it works in Britain. In Singapore, Mr Goh has shown you how the CJ ranks about 50th amongst lawyers, Judges rank about 80th, in terms of remuneration. So, what do we do? Have national service for lawyers? Draft them to serve as judges? We appoint Judicial Commissioners. Even Judicial Commissioners feel the same pressure to return to the Bar to practise, because under the rules after three years on the bench they can no longer practise. Therefore, "let us get back because, otherwise, I lose my ability to make a living for myself." That is why the Minister for Law some weeks ago informed the House that we are considering amending the Legal Profession Act to allow Judicial Commissioners to go back to practice, even after more than three years as JCs, provided they do not then appear before the court, because that is awkward - having sat on the Bench, to appear before ex colleagues and argue cases before them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the individuals, this is the society, from which we have to find leaders. You may call it materialism. But it is the motivating force which has pushed Singapore forward and made Singapore different. Our people want to get ahead, they fight for the best for themselves and their family, and calculate their career options rationally. Therefore, we have growth and progress, and therefore we can afford to pay those whom we need to enter the public service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam raised the question: What is the basis for paying those who enter the public service? I think he has a point. What the Minister can contribute is huge compared to what you can pay him. He makes one wrong decision, 30,000 workers will go unemployed for three or four years. We just had one recession. 30,000 times three or four years to one, and the NCMP cavils over salary ratio of 30:1. The contribution, and for that matter the potential subtraction from the national wealth and welfare, is enormous compared to what you can pay.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is not an argument therefore to pay Ministers billions of dollars a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> year, or even millions of dollars a year. What is a fair basis? We believe the fair basis is, roughly speaking, opportunity cost. What is the man earning outside? How much can he earn? We offer him about that, probably a little less. He does not come in to get wealthy, but he comes in without suffering too much pain. Is it a ratio-30:1? Yes, as it is in China. But let me ask the question a different way. If workers had money to put into a bank, do they put the money into a bank whose managers is paid peanuts? Or should they put their money into a bank with a top manager paid, maybe as these figures show, $200,000 a month, in order that their money be well looked after and safe, and the workers' savings are protected? If that is so of their savings, what more of their future?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other people have tried to limit the ratio of top to bottom salaries, Vietnam for one. I do not know if the NCMP might have read what one Vietnamese Minister said recently. It would have made painful reading for him, but I think it was Nguyen Van Linh in Delhi who said: "What's all this? People are criticizing us (speaking about Vietnam) for having differentials in salary. We have had 30 years of equality in salary, and all it is has led to is misery, stagnation and decay. So let's not talk about equality of salary." This is a Politburo member speaking, another fallen idol. Do we have to go through the same trauma to reach the same conclusion?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some would object that if you pay Ministers the right pay, you might get the wrong men in. Maybe. Those who cannot make a living elsewhere would like to come in at that salary. But at least we will have the choice of turning them away and choosing the men who are fit to enter. If we pay peanuts, and why stop at whatever it is ($20,000 now), why not push it back to $2,000 and make a greater show of sacrifice? You will still find an applicant knocking at your door saying, "I would like to become a Minister." Do you take him for his great nobleness of heart? Or do you wonder why he needs a job? Should you not ask what he intends to do after becoming a Minister? There are countries where Ministers are paid very little. They have no shortage of applicants, nor do
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> those who become Ministers particularly suffer from poverty.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what should we do? I suggest the right thing to do is to be fair, and watch what the private sector offers. We do not have to match the top banker for all Ministers. But if we have to pay one key man to get him to serve , for example, as Minister for Finance, then even if we have to offer something like it, we should.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have spoken up against performance bonuses and make-up pay. We have discussed this in Cabinet. The First Deputy Prime Minister has asked me to explain this because he will speak about other subjects later. The Ministers work as a team. Everybody on the team performs and contributes. Those who do not should be out. But those who are in, while all work, not all carry equal load. It is a reality. I think it is known, it is acknowledged. And if we are honest with ourselves, it is so. Therefore, we need mechanisms to distinguish between those who carry the heavier loads and do more than the rest. Hence, promotion grades for the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministers of State and Ministers. Similarly, we have performance bonuses in order that in between promotions, and from year to year, we can make a distinction between the man who is doing all right and the person who is doing outstanding, but is not due for promotion yet.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it mean hard decisions? Yes. It is always awkward. But it is no more awkward than for Permanent Secretaries. They also have this official myth, if you like,that every Permanent Secretary is equal to every other Permanent Secretary. It does not matter whether the Ministry is huge or tiny, it is supposedly the same job, the same status, and the same importance. It is no different from distinguishing between officers on the General Staff, between the person who is in charge of operations, or plans, or manpower. There are differences in the responsibility, in the judgment required, in the size of the job. If we want civil servants to evaluate officers honestly, then politicians ought to have the courage and the integrity to have ourselves also similarly judged. I do not believe that either the Prime Minister or the First Deputy Prime Minister would
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> have the slightest hesitation in implementing this scheme and judging his Ministers, to their faces. And I think, likewise, the Ministers and the Parliamentary Secretaries are man enough to accept such assessments and know where they stand. To pretend otherwise is convenient, but I do not think it is honest.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for make-up pay, there are circumstances when we will need it. In recent general elections, the only Ministers of State who have come in and received a pay rise are the ex -civil servants or ex-Army officers. Everybody else who has come from the private sector has done so at a pay cut, in some cases, a substantial pay out. All right, we have managed to do it with these few. Do we want to continue doing so?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have revised the Minister of State's pay somewhat. But we cannot push it all the way up. Neither do we want to appoint such a person to be a Minister straightaway, because a successful executive might not make it as a Minister. So when he comes in as a Minister of State in his mid-30s or early 40s, make-up pay provides one way to bridge the gap and ease the transition.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other circumstance in which we will need it is when we have a key Minister's post vacant and we must bring in somebody from the very top of the private sector pinnacle. We need a Minister for Finance. We need a Minister for Law. Not any Minister can do the job. You need in one case a lawyer, in the other somebody who is very familiar with the world of finance. And if he is anywhere on this table, how will you persuade him to enter? In fact, if he is not on this table, questions should be asked why we are taking him at all! Why should we, in order to accommodate such a person, correspondingly inflate every other Minister's salary to the same level? Is it necessary? Is it justifiable? We do not think so. Therefore, a system of make up pay is established. Of course, if we bring in a top banker and then leave him as Minister of State for two terms, say in the Ministry of Education or Law, questions might be raised why the Government
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> is doing such a thing. Is he really worth all that money? But I do not foresee this Government acting in such an irrational way.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, relativities with the Civil Service. The Prime Minister has already touched on this, so I do not want to go into detail. But there was a piece in the Sunday Times on 12th March by Tan Sai Siong, which said that basically civil servants were pencil sharpeners for Ministers. So why not just pay Ministers and skip the pencil sharpeners?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true that in Singapore the Ministers take the lead and the civil servants provide the support. I think that is right, and it will continue. It can, provided we continue to get Ministers who are fit to give instructions to Permanent Secretaries. If the Minister is not fit to give instructions to his PS, the relationship will change overnight. The PS will not be making speeches here and neither are the same policies going to be presented, because if the speech cannot be made, the policy cannot be carried.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, it is important for Ministers to be backed up with a strong staff from the Permanent Secretaries downwards. They are not pencil sharpeners, but provide proper staff work, research and well-considered options. Then the political direction can be interpreted and implemented in sensible, rational ways, which will leave MPs with a minimum duty of writing letters to Ministers on behalf of their constituents. To do that, the Administrative Service cannot be at two-thirds strength. The Ministry of Trade and Industry cannot have Administrative Officers with an average seniority of 2(r) years, as it does today, and try to operate like MITI in Japan.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To change that, let us remunerate the officers correctly, promote them rightly, and bring the correct people in. One Member, I think Mr Peh Chin Hua, said that this is a policy of heavy rewards in order to find desperadoes: Zhong shang zhi xia bi you yong fu. I do not know if the interpreter gave you the same translation. But we are not looking for that. We are just looking for fair rewards, an adequate mix of incentives, so that despite the sacrifice
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and restrictions, some of the right people will come in, and give of their best for the benefit of all the rest of us.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> A clarification from the Minister, Sir?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, all right.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> He has commented on what a Vietnamese Politburo leader has said. Would he also like to comment on what a Japanese economist and industrialist has said, namely, that Singapore is a country of high salaries and low wages?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no idea which Japanese said that. But I do know that in Japanese politics, money is not an insignificant factor. The Member might perchance have heard of Recruit Cosmos. That is such an awkward and prickly pear because it is only one pear out of a whole orchard full of such pears. That is how the whole system works. Politicians need to visit constituents, whether for funerals or weddings. Token contributions are essential. It is routine. If you attend a funeral, you bring bai jin. I do not know what they call it in Japanese. If you attend a wedding, a gift is in order. There are 130 million Japanese and about 300 Diet members. So each Diet member has 300,000 constituents, quite a fair number of weddings and funerals. Where does the Diet member get his white gold from? From his faction leader. Where does the faction leader get his resources from? His salary? In many ways. Fund-raising breakfasts for one. Recruit Cosmos was merely thought up as some of the more ingenious approaches.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Chiam and Dr Lee citied examples of advanced western democracies, the US, the UK, Japan. Each has it own problems. We had better find our own clean way to proceed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not propose to speak at length on the subject because it has been well debated and discussed. However, we owe Mr Chiam an answer. He has raised some queries and I should provide him with the information.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked three questions: what are the perks, if any, of Ministers in addition to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> their salaries? Secondly, are the salaries tax free? Thirdly, whether I can provide some figures of Minister's pay in UK and Australia. First, on the perks. Ministers do not enjoy perks other than the car allowance which is similar to the civil servants'. I do not know the exact formula. I think, it is two months of basic salary for every year of service, quite like the civil servants. But there are no other perks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salaries are taxable, like any employee's in Singapore. So whatever increase the salaries which Ministers may get as a result of the revision, a portion of this will go to tax. It goes back to the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Ministers' pay in other countries, I did not provide them earlier because I thought they would not be relevant for our discussion. What Ministers get in each country depends on the political culture of the country. UK has a different culture; Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, they have different political cultures and the pay is therefore not really relevant to our discussion today. Anyway, if you have a good man available somewhere else, you cannot get hold of him, whatever his worth to us. But I will provide the figures since Mr Chiam has asked for them. I do not have the figure for Australia but I have it for Britain, Japan and some Asean countries. We do not know the supplementary income because in other countries they have other less obvious ways of remunerating the Ministers. The figures I am going to quote are published figures available from documented sources.
  <pre>

              Indonesia             $1,700 p.m.

              Philippines           $2,300 p.m.

              Thailand              $5,000 p.m.

              Malaysia              $6,700 p.m.

              Britain               $10,000 p.m.

              Japan                 $31,000 p.m.

</pre> You should ask yourself the reasons for the differences in pay in different countries and see whether the system in each of these countries applies to Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am gratified by the overwhelming support given by Members of Parliament to the need for us to revise Ministers' salaries in order for us to have good men and women to carry on with the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> job which the Prime Minister is handing over to us. Personally, I feel it rather awkward that we should be talking about our own salaries. But I am not at all defensive on the need to revise salaries. We are doing this not for ourselves. The Ministers are already in Cabinet. We do not have to revise salaries for ourselves, but we have got to look forward.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our main mission now is: how do we keep Singapore going after the Prime Minister steps down? That is my main preoccupation at this stage. Can we shoulder the burden of government and ensure that Singapore continues to prosper and grow for the benefit of Singaporeans? That is my number one worry. It is not just taking over from the Prime Minister, drawing a handsome salary and enjoying the power, the status and the prestige. It is what do we do from now on, and how do we discharge our responsibility to Singaporeans. I think the answer boils down to whether we can succeed in getting good Members of Parliament and from the Members of Parliament whether we can draw up a team that is as good as the Prime Minister's, if not better.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will illustrate the importance of having good people in charge from the number of courtesy calls which foreign visitors made on me. Many of them have nothing to do with my Defence portfolio. They are trade and industry matters. For example, the President of a Japanese computer company and the President of an American Bank, asked to make a courtesy call on me. We discussed internal and regional situation and world events. Why did they want to call on me? And why did I want to see them? Each time such a foreign visitor makes a request, I will check first with the Ministry concerned as to whether I should see them or not. In these two cases, I was advised to see them because I was told that one has plans to extend his factories - he has more than one factory in Singapore-and the other his banking operations; he is thinking of making Singapore his regional headquarters. No decision has yet been taken as to whether they would or would not expand their presence in Singapore. We chatted for half an hour or so at
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the end of which they told me that they enjoyed being in Singapore, they have benefitted from their presence in Singapore, and they would like to extend their operations in Singapore. Why did they want to call on me? I think it is to size up whether the next person who takes over from the Prime Minister shares the same kind of outlook in economic philosophy, in political ideology, in dedication and motivation to serve the country, whether he can deliver the goods because they are going to sink in millions of dollars in Singapore. They want to know.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what do I do from here? I do not believe in re-inventing the wheel all over. So I study the Prime Minister. Learn from his experience, how did he bring Singapore into today's state, how did he achieve progress for Singaporeans? The key lies in his having assembled a good team first for the Government and secondly, for the administration, that is the Civil Service. Of course, the Prime Minister has a commanding intellect, and is a man of exceptional ability. But despite his own ability and competence, he still needs to assemble a team of excellent administrators and dedicated and highly motivated Ministers. That is the key to his success, and I would be foolish if I did not follow the same formula. I believe that that is the key to Singapore's success and we have got to follow the same formula. In other words, target the top 0.001% or the top two or three Singaporeans per ª million Singaporeans to join us in Government. And of course also the others to join us in the Civil Service. If we do not not succeed in getting them to join us in Government and the Civil Service, I think we cannot succeed in carrying out our responsibility of bringing about a better life for Singaporeans. The Prime Minister mentioned Dr Goh, Lim Kim San, Hon Sui Sen, Mr Rajaratnam, Dr Toh Chin Chye. I have worked with Dr Goh Keng Swee, the late Hon Sui Sen and Lim Kim San. I know the quality of the men, not just in Cabinet; I was a civil servant at one time, working with them as my Ministers. I know that they are sharper than any Permanent Secretary and they did have very sharp Permanent Secretaries - Joe Pillay, Sim Kee Boon, Ngiam Tong Dow. But they were better than their Permanent Secretaries and they were also bolder. They
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> were in a position to take decisions, innovate and they did their job beautifully.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have got to find, as PM put it, another Goh Keng Swee, another Hon Sui Sen, and so on, and that is my job, as well as the job of my colleagues. The present Cabinet is not yet a complete team. There are still some empty slots. Prof. Jayakumar, for example, holds two portfolios: Minister for Law and Minister for Home Affairs, We have got to find a potential Minister for Law to succeed him or a potential Minister for Home Affairs to take over from him. Wong Kan Seng, two Ministries: Ministry of Community Development and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. So likewise we have got to find a Minister who can take over one of his two Ministries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been looking for people for the Party and for the Government, since 1976. Soon after I was elected, I got involved in this talent scouting. The Prime Minister wrote me a note right away: Do you know any people who could become Members of Parliament? So I learnt early the importance of getting good men and women to join us in Government and in Parliament. I have been at this for quite some time. It has not been easy, and it is not going to be easier.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My job now is not just to complete the team in Cabinet. It is also to look ahead and to ensure that there will be others coming forward to take over from us. Dr Richard Hu, I think is over 60 and many of us are getting on to 50, and in this process of learning how to govern, I can tell you that it is stupidity to think you can just get somebody elected, make him a Minister and he can govern effectively right away. It is not possible. I have been in this for quite some years. It takes many years for us to learn what government is all about and how to discharge our duties effectively and competently.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take a practical approach. I recognize that idealism is very important and, in fact, it is important because all of us who are in government did not come in because of the salaries which we will get. There is a certain sense of mission in us and, as Mr Dhanabalan put it, this mission grows with time. When I got involved in 1976 at the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> invitation of Mr Hon Sui Sen, I do not quite understand what the job was all about. I did not feel that passionate about the job. Mr Hon asked me whether I could be considered as one of the candidates for the PAP. You know that before this I was not very keen on politics. I never took part in community service or join the PAP or what have you. But I asked myself: why did he ask me when there are others in Cabinet, there are so many others in the PAP, why did he ask me, a person who has not shown any interest in politics? I came to the conclusion that by the time he asked me, it meant that the Government would run into trouble unless people like myself made a contribution. I am not a natural politician but I believe that I have got to give my best to the country. It took me only three days to say yes. I said, "Yes, I will try. If I do not make a success of it, if I cannot succeed, let me know. I am prepared to leave the political scene." I give it a try and the more involved I got, the more strongly I feel that we have got to do our duty for Singaporeans. And one of these important jobs that I have got to do is to build a team to take over from the Prime Minister, and later to build a team to take over from us. If I can do this without having to offer high salaries, why should we offer an attractive salary? Why should we talk about market forces and so on? Just offer them a proper salary, one which is not much higher than what the workers earn, and they will come forward. Why are we being so stupid as to risk incurring political cost to revise salaries of office holders openly? Why do we do that? It is because we are now entering a different era. There is a vigorous private sector doing very well and Singaporeans in the private sector are earning handsome salaries. I know that many Singaporeans are reluctant to come in and I am not sure, as I said just now, even with the revision that we can get them. But I believe that we should revise the salaries not just because we need to minimize the financial sacrifice for them but to give a signal that we are doing all we can to minimize their sacrifice, and that they should come forward to help us discharge our responsibility to our country and people. If as a result of this discussion, we can find two or three potential Ministers to join us between now and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the next election, this debate would have been worthwhile. We know that it is a great drain on our personal resources in terms of time which we have for ourselves and our family. I know that many of us will not like the glare of publicity, but what choice do we have if Singaporeans who are able and honest do not come forward to keep up the high standard of clean and effective Government. What choice do we have? Do we want to end up with a wrong Government with many of us becoming mere statistics of either being a foreign worker, an illegal immigrant, or worse, a refugee in some forgotten refugee camps. I think we cannot allow that. This discussion is in a sense to reach out to Singaporeans outside who can serve, whom we know have got the character attributes, the intellect, ability and motivation. If we can get them, I would regard today's discussion on the salary revision as a huge success. And that is what we are aiming for, get two or three more potential Ministers between now and the next election.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir.
