<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Up to 28th February this year, there were 5,968

marriage applications from male Singaporeans;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Of these, 4,649 applications have been approved;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) 1,319 applications were rejected because the work

permit  holder did not meet policy requirements, i.e.

working  in  Singapore for less than five years  where

the work permit holder was an unskilled worker;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) So far 1,107 marriage cases have been approved

contracting parties have accepted sterilisation on the

birth of the second child;

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development and Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development and Communications (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Public  Utilities Board has started work  on  what  is

known as the Pulau Tekong Reservoir Scheme. This calls

for the construction of an impounding reservoir with a

storage  capacity of 1.4 million cubic metres  and  a

water   treatment  plant  of  6,800  cubic  metres/day

capacity  on  the  island.  When  this  $6.23  million

project is completed in 1979, piped water supply  will

be available on the island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board undertook a survey which

shows  that providing piped water to Pulau Ubin  would

be  uneconomical.  It would also  be  uneconomical  to

provide island-wide electricity to both Pulau Ubin and

Pulau  Tekong  as  the  houses on  these  islands  are

scattered  and the expected demand too low to  justify

the  cost  of  installation of electrical distribution

equipment.  The  Urban  and Rural  Services  Committee

concurred  with these findings and informed the  Board

that no action need be taken until more information on

the development of these islands is available.

Perseverance  Estate.  Development  of  the  area   is

Site   investigations  have  shown  that  at   present

pedestrians are crossing mostly in front  of  Block  2

and Block 10. However, a traffic count at the site  on

15th March, 1977 revealed that vehicular

traffic volume along Marsiling Road was very low  with

only 236 vehicles per hour against 192 pedestrians per

hour.  In  view  of  the  low traffic  and  pedestrian

volume,  there  is no immediate need for  an  overhead

pedestrian bridge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present situation, however, will be kept in

Admiralty  Road, between Marsiling Lane and  Marsiling

Drive.  The flats which are now occupied are  situated

within a quarter mile or 400-metre radius from the bus

terminal  and  are  within walking distance  from  two

pairs of bus stops from Admiralty Road. In view of the

close proximity of the existing terminal and bus stops

will  bring  residents from various neighbourhoods  to

the  proposed  town  centre  terminal  where  external

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Social

Affairs if he will consider introducing legislation to

amend  Section  82  of the Women's  Charter  to  allow

couples to take divorce proceedings after a separation

period  of  three  years instead  of  seven  years  as

provided in the law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng) (for the Minister for Social Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposal to reduce the

waiting  period for divorce is controversial, and  the

rising divorce rate clearly indicates that we need  to

be  circumspect before introducing amendments  to  the

Women's  Charter to permit divorce on the ground  that

the  parties  have  lived separately  for  any  period

shorter  than the present period of seven years.  Over

the last five years, the rate of divorce has more than

doubled  -  from  304 cases in 1972 to  803  in  1976.

Although  the  figures  for  divorces  are  low   when

compared   with   the  total  number   of   marriages,

nevertheless they indicate an unhealthy trend. We will

have  to  continue  to  monitor the  situation  before

considering a reduction of the period during which the

parties have lived apart as a ground for divorce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since it became publicly known that my Ministry

appointed  a Committee to review the Women's  Charter.

the  press  and some individuals have been speculating

on the changes that would be made in our divorce laws.

Some  well-meaning, but obviously not really  down-to-earth, suggestions  have  been  made  regarding   the

waiting period for divorce. Strangely, a proposal  was

made by some women's organisations to amend the law to

permit  divorce to be granted on the ground  that  the

parties  have been living separately for a  period  of

only one year. Mr Speaker, Sir, as you are aware,  the

Women's Charter permits a divorce to be granted  where

the  parties have been living separately for a  period

of  not  less  than seven years and reconciliation  is

unlikely. At a time when we should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>



strengthen  the  family unit, will  it  help  to  make

divorce easier?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some countries where the laws have been changed

to  make  divorce  easier, the  rate  of  divorce  has

multiplied. In certain western countries where divorce

can  be obtained easily, marriages appear to have lost

their  sanctity,  but  it  is  the  children  of  such

marriages  who  always suffer. A united  family  gives

strength  to  our  social fabric and a  marriage  must

therefore  be  regarded  as  an  institution   to   be

cherished  and preserved. For this reason,  we  cannot

afford  to  make changes in our marriage  and  divorce

laws  without careful deliberation. If after  thorough

investigation  we find amendments can  be  made  which

will  ease irreconcilable couples in getting  divorces

earlier  but without weakening either the family  unit

or the institution of marriage, we shall do so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Social

Affairs if he will consider introducing legislation to

amend  the  Women's  Charter  so  that  no  order   of

maintenance  or alimony will be made by the  court  if

the  husband  commits no matrimonial offence  and  the

divorce is on the ground of seven years' separation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng (for the Minister for Social Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when any decree absolute

for divorce is made by a Court, the Court has power to

make, if it thinks fit, an order that the husband pays

to  the wife a gross sum of money or an annual sum for

any  term  not exceeding her life. In making  such  an

order  of alimony, the Court wilt have regard  to  the

wife's property, if any, to the ability of the husband

and  to the conduct of the parties. The Court also has

power  to  make  an order, if it thinks  fit,  on  the

husband  for  payment to the wife during  their  joint

lives  of  such  monthly sum for her  maintenance  and

support as the Court thinks reasonable. The order  for

maintenance may be either in addition to or instead of

an order of alimony. In making an order of maintenance

or   alimony,   the  Court  is  guided  by   equitable

principles. In general, a Court does not make an order

in  favour of a guilty wife who is responsible for the

break-up of the marriage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the application by a wife, upon

divorce, for the payment of alimony or maintenance  is

decided  according  to the merits of  each  individual

case. The hon. Member for Khe Bong is suggesting  that

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>



law  be  changed so that we take away the jurisdiction

of  the  Court to grant alimony or maintenance  simply

because  the  parties are divorced on the ground  that

they had been living apart for a period of seven years

and  the husband had committed no matrimonial offence.

The  law,  as it stands, enables the Court to exercise

its  discretion  after examining the circumstances  of

each  case, and it is undesirable to amend the law  to

introduce such an inflexible rule.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, if the husband had not

committed  any  matrimonial offence during  the  seven

years that both parties were separated, why should the

husband  pay  alimony  to the  wife  on  a  decree  of

divorce?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Song:</b> Sir, the Court will decide on

that.

                      1973 - 505

month  annual  wage supplement to civil  servants  who

retire  before  the  31st  of  December  or  to  their

dependants  if they die during service,  even  if  the

quantum  of payment is proportionate to the number  of

months they have served.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I am not quite sure I

understand  the  gist  of the Member's  question.  The

present position is that all serving officers  on  the

31st December get the allowance, and all officers  who

are  not  serving on the 31st December do not get  the

allowance.  Under  the  present  system  there  is  no

question   of   any   one  being   entitled   to   any

proportionate payment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, I am aware of that

provision.  That  is  why  I am  asking  the  Minister

whether he will consider removing that stipulation.  I

am  aware  that  there  is  a stipulation  at  present

barring  these  people from enjoying the  benefit.  My

question   is,   will   he  consider   removing   this

stipulation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> The answer is no. The allowance is

not  a  bonus. I think I must stress this. It  is  not

payable like, say, bonuses, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>



companies  where maybe a proportionate amount  can  be

paid,  because it is for services rendered during  the

year.  The intention of the non-pensionable  -  annual

allowance is to reward officers who are still with  us

on 31st December and who will continue in service with

us  for the rest of the year, and to give their  loyal

service to the Government.



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi (Kampong Kembangan):</b> Sir,

what  about  those  officers who retire  on  the  30th

December, subjected to one day's break in service  on

the 31st December, and re-engaged on the 2nd January?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> The answer is simply no. It does not

fall  within  the  definition. But the  terms  of  re-employment  are such that they can be renegotiated  to

include whatever may be necessary - a higher salary or

a  lower  salary; or a salary to include consideration

for whatever he may have lost.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, does the Minister not agree

that  the 13th month annual wage supplement is a  form

of  deferred  monthly  wages,  as  he  has  stated  in

Parliament when this was announced? If so, should  not

the civil servant who retires or dies while in service

be entitled to at least part payment of the 13th month

annual wage supplement?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to also ask the Minister if it is not

true  that  civil  servants who have just  joined  the

civil  service are entitled to a proportionate  amount

of the 13th month payment in the first year. If so, is

it   not  only  fair  and  equitable  that  the   same

entitlement be extended to retiring civil servants  in

their  last  year  of service, or to their  dependants

should they die while in service?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> The answer is no. It may be that

there  should be a pensionable allowance based in  the

manner  in which the Member suggests, but we  did  not

frame  it  in that manner, and therefore there  is  no

entitlement.  I do not think we would be  prepared  to

change  the  nature  of this concept  of  annual  non-pensionable allowance to the nature suggested  by  the

Member concerned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>



In  fact, the first idea was that this would be in the

form of a wage increase except that, instead of giving

it  in 12 instalments for the year, we suggested  that

it  may  be  desirable to give  it  in  one  lump  sum

payment, and therefore the first annual allowance  was

given  to officers serving on the 31st March.  Members

may  note  that it was not intended that it should  be

for  service for the calendar year. The first  payment

was  made  on 31st March and subsequently  we  thought

that  perhaps  the end of the year  would  be  a  more

desirable  time to pay because that is the time  where

there  are  festivals - the Christmas and the  Chinese

New Year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> The Minister has, in fact,

confirmed what I said, but my question has  not  been

answered.  As  he has agreed with me that  this  13th

month  payment is actually a form of deferred monthly

wages -



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I did not say that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Well, he said that it should be

a  wage increase and that it should be paid at the end

of  the  year instead of monthly. That is  a  deferred

monthly  wage increase to be paid at the  end  of  the

year. My question earlier was, if this was so, then if

someone has served seven months in the year, he should

be  entitled  to  seven months of that wage  increase.

That  is  my  question. Sir, unless the Minister  said

otherwise.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am not sure whether you are asking

questions or making a speech. Mr Sia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, my question is simply this.

If a person has worked for 20 years and, just short of

a  few days before he qualifies for it, he should kick

the   bucket, should  we  not  be  more  humane   and

sympathetic and pay pro rata to his dependants?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, that is another question. If he

suggests   that  some  gratuity, pension,  or   other

allowance should be given, let us consider it on  that

basis,  and  not  make  the non-pensionable  allowance

which  is not intended to be a gratuity, a pension  or

an exgratia payment to him under those terms.

the  CPF or the gratuity or ex-gratia payment. In this

allowance  is not a pension. In fact, it is  called  a

non-pensionable allowance. It is an allowance and  the

terms  of  this  allowance are stated exactly  in  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in this Debate on

the Budget estimates for the Ministry of Education,  I

wish  to  point  out  the remarkable  success  of  the

bilingual education policy implemented by the Ministry

of  Education. This remarkable success is  evident  to

everyone at home and abroad. The successful effort  of

the  Ministry of Education in this respect  should  be

recognised and widely acclaimed by us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I now wish to bring up a problem, also a

fact,  which  is  right before us. This  concerns  the

successful  candidates in the Government Secondary  IV

examination for the Chinese stream, who have entered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>



Pre-U  I  classes. It was not until the 9th  of  March

that  the Ministry of Education released the  list  of

successful  candidates  to the  various  schools.  The

successful  students then reported at their respective

schools on the 10th of March. They attended classes on

11th  of  March, but found that the first school  term

ended the following day, the 12th of March. They  have

paid a month's school fees for only one day's tuition.

What is the rationale behind all this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government Secondary IV examination for the

Chinese stream was held in mid-November last year  and

the  results were released on 5th February this  year.

The  results,  unlike  in  previous  years, were  not

published  in  the press and the candidates  concerned

had  to  return to their respective schools  to  check

their  results. The successful students were  required

to  return to their respective schools on 7th, 8th and

9th February to fill up the relevant application forms

for  admission  to the schools of their choice.  These

forms  had  to be submitted by the various schools  to

the Ministry of Education for processing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The processing is said to be done by computers and

as  such, in our mind, it must be time-saving,  highly

efficient  and  fast, and the newly admitted  Pre-U  I

students should have been able to begin classes  seven

or  ten days later. But, alas, they have to wait until

two  days  before the end of the first term  to  start

their first lesson. Just how much, may I ask, can they

learn in the circumstances? What kind of education are

we promoting?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions I wish to ask are firstly, the results

of  the  Government Secondary IV examination  for  the

Chinese  stream  were  released on  5th  February  and

completed application forms (for admission to Pre-U I)

were  all  submitted to the Ministry for  computerised

processing  on  9th  February.  But  the  Ministry  of

Education  had to drag on until 9th March  to  release

the  lists  of the newly admitted Pre-U I students  to

the various schools. What is the cause for such a long

delay?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, does the Education Ministry know that much

precious time of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>



students had been wasted? Or was there anything  wrong

with  the  Ministry's administration in  dealing  with

this matter?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, is it not a fact that the way the matter

was  handled  had  caused much precious  time  of  the

students  to  be  wasted? Pre-U  I  teachers  in  many

schools  had no classes to teach. Is this not a  waste

of   the  taxpayers'  hard-earned  money?  Singapore's

population is just over two million people,  and  with

so   many  people  being  employed  by  the  Education

Ministry  yet  the Ministry is so inefficient  in  its

work.  If the Education departments in countries  like

China  and  the United States, with large populations,

were  to follow our Education Ministry, then it  would

not be difficult to imagine how many people would have

to  be  employed.  However,  the  efficiency  and  the

performance  of  the  Education departments  in  these

countries are not difficult to see.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educating the young is a long term process and an

arduous task. It is the mainstay of State policy, with

politics,   national  defence,  social  and   economic

development  and communications as its  ramifications.

In  the  early 1960s Western sociologists  discovered,

after  much study and research, that education is  the

motivating force of national progress. The long  delay

by our Ministry of Education in handling the admission

of  Pre-U  I  students not only runs  counter  to  the

guiding  principle of education but it also makes  the

Ministry  guilty  of  dereliction.  I  hope  that  all

Members  of the House will take note of this.  I  also

hope that the Education Ministry will pay attention to

the work of students by exercising greater supervision

over  its  staff,  tightening its  administration  and

raising efficiency.



<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek Bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek Bin Saniff (Kolam Ayer):</b> Sir, one of the

most  important instruments of national endeavour  for

the  progress  of  a  country  is  education.  Radical

changes  will be present in a country because  of  two

vitally  important factors: (1) its political  system,

and  (2) within which is entrenched the values of  its

education policy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can justly feel proud that our country's

education  policy is one of the best in the world.  It

has successfully met the demands of the nation and the

world,  particularly in this part of  the  world.  The

implementation of our education system  or  policy  is

going  on quite smoothly, starting from 1959 with  our

acceptance  of the 1956 All-Party Report  followed  by

the   1963  Lim  Tay  Boh  Report  and  the  Five-Year

Education   Development  Plan   (1966-70)   aimed   at

producing quality students rather than quantity.  1966

saw the coming into operation of the bilingual policy.

In  1968,  as  a  manifestation of  a  more  effective

integration,  integrated schools came into  existence.

In  summary  in the implementation of the first  five-year plan, 1961-65, and the second five-year plan,

1966-70,   emphasis was laid on increasing the  number

of secondary schools, free education, extra-curricular

activities,  better  teachers, adequate  paraphernalia

and  spacious  buildings where academic and  technical

students were accorded the opportunity to move  on  to

Pre-university or junior colleges after 1969. Students

from vocational schools had the opportunity to proceed

either  to the Singapore Vocational Institute  or  the

Polytechnic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, a programme for the restructuring of

primary  education was put forward in 1975 for reasons

known   only   to  the  authority.  The   restructured

education system, which was the result, I was told, of

two   years'  painstaking  study,  was  rescinded  and

replaced by a system currently in force and, that  is.

the  streaming of primary schools, a move  that  gives

two interpretations:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) firm belief in their decision for something

better or meritorious will emerge;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) it shows for the first time that there is an

absence of "continuity" in the implementation  of  the

whole policy. We have made the decision. It is now our

responsibility to see that this system  works  in  the

best  possible manner. Towards this end.  I  would  be

most  grateful if the Minister could reiterate to  the

House the criteria for the channelling of pupils, with

particular reference to Primary I.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the shortage of teachers, especially

English language teachers, I think that while we  need

teachers  from overseas it is worthwhile  to  seek  an

alternative to resolve the problem. For example:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) provide a re-employment scheme for retired

teachers;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) persuade housewives to resume employment;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) train teachers from the non-English streams,

especially  the Chinese and Malay streams,  which  are

now  in excess in that particular subject and also  in

other  appropriate subjects so that  the  position  of

these teachers will become more viable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, meanwhile, I feel that it is the responsibility

of the Ministry to monitor the response or reaction of

pupils  as well as teachers towards overseas  teachers

and  also  their relationship with local teachers.  We

certainly  hope  that  something positive  can  emerge

arising from our efforts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shortage of teachers has necessitated in the

recruitment of relief teachers. These relief  teachers

have  helped to tide over the lack of teachers.  Their

contributions cannot be denied. At the same  time, as

an  educationist. I think we must direct  our  efforts

towards producing sufficient trained teachers at  some

future date. In this respect, I would like to ask  the

Minister  whether  he  has  set  any  target  date  in

resolving this problem in this connection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we interminably hear that teachers grumble when

Ministry officials visit their schools. They are quite

unhappy  with the attitude adopted by a few  of  these

officials. This must be checked. At the same  time,  I

notice  that last year when such visits were  made  by

senior  Ministry  officials headed  by  the  Permanent

Secretary,  they were well received by principals  and

teachers  alike. I feel that it would be a  source  of

great encouragement if the Hon. Minister concerned can

enlighten the House as to what extent such visits have

helped  to  boost  the morale of our  teachers.  I  am

confident  that a good policy, a good system  executed

in a proper manner, particularly with regard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>



to  human  relationship, will  produce  more  fruitful

results. I would like to suggest that a study be  made

by  the Hon. Minister of these visits, that is by  the

Education  Development Officer (EDO) and the Permanent

Secretary.  The results will be worth  our  while  for

future reference and guide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy to note that there will be a

promotion exercise this year. My ardent hope  is  that

the  Minister  will  pay special  attention  to  those

teachers  whose  salaries, if I may  be  permitted  to

borrow  the  words from the Minister for  Culture  and

Science and Technology, are "the lowest of the low" in

the  teaching  profession. These are the teachers  who

have stagnated at lower than $1030, the maximum salary

for  an Education Officer. Group III. I earnestly hope

that these teachers could be emplaced on EO III scale.

Most  of them are over 40 years old and do not possess

certain  required qualifications, but one thing  I  am

sure  is that they have contributed immensely  to  the

progress of our education.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Chai Chong Yii)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, last

Friday when the House adjourned there were two Members

who  spoke on this same item. This item relates to the

administration   of   the   Ministry   of   Education.

Educational  administration is a  very  difficult  and

sensitive  matter as it will easily arouse  criticism.

Furthermore,  if  the criticism is  not  proper,  then

although the intention may be good, the result will be

bad.   I   feel   that  to  do  well  in   educational

administration, it is necessary to follow what Lu-Shun

had said: that one should be stout and cool enough  to

face  the criticisms of a thousand men, yet be  humble

and  willing enough to serve even a child. I think  if

the  principle is practicable, then it may  yet  serve

the   purpose  somehow.  About  educational  officers,

although   they  do  not  profess  to   be   education

specialists,  they do know a lot about education.  So,

if  there is anything that the newspapers like to play

up  the  result will be that the aim of such criticism

is not achieved; on the contrary, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>



mood  of the teachers is adversely affected. Thus,  in

the end the children in our schools suffer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an example. The Member for Bedok

attacked  the Ministry of Education when he  spoke  on

the estimates on the Ministry of Home Affairs. But  he

forgot  to  mention in the House that he was  speaking

only  in the capacity of an MP because he was  also  a

school  principal  himself. Therefore,  the  next  day

there  was a big headline in the Straits Times to  the

effect  that  somebody had said that the officials  in

the  Ministry of Education were not cooperative in the

anti-drug  campaign,  and  that  they  even  tried  to

frustrate the efforts of the Central Narcotics Bureau.

If  he  had  any  information he should  give  me  the

details,  that is, the name of the principal,  and  so

on. When he spoke of this in this House the debate was

on the Ministry of Home Affairs. That is why I did not

reply.  The next day there was a big headline  in  the

press. So the parents were confused and worried. I  do

not  mean that he cannot speak on such matters. But  I

do  not  think  there  are instances  of  Ministry  of

Education officials trying to frustrate the efforts of

the   Central  Narcotics  Bureau  to  stamp  out  drug

addiction.  If there is any such instance, please  let

me know and I will take immediate action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now let me answer questions raised by various

Members. The Member for Kallang appealed on behalf  of

those  disabled  children and urged  the  Ministry  of

Education to pay greater attention to this category of

children.  With regard to these handicapped  children,

their  education  has  all along  been  undertaken  by

various voluntary organisations. They were well looked

after  by them. But it does not mean that the Ministry

of  Education  does  not  concern  itself  with  their

welfare.  It  is very concerned with their educational

needs.   But   things  differ  in  their  degrees   of

importance and there is different priority with  every

matter. Up to the present time what I can say is  that

these voluntary organisations have done quite well  in

looking after the educational needs of these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>



handicapped children. The Education Ministry  is  also

helping  them in all possible ways. This Ministry  has

sent  out  60 teachers to help these organisations  to

run  the  classes and their salaries are,  of  course,

paid  by  the Ministry of Education. Apart from  this,

every  year  the  Ministry  of  Social  Affairs   also

provides  grants  to  help them.  This  has  been  the

policy,  though I do not say this is an ideal  way  of

doing it. Before this question was brought up, we have

already talked with the Ministry of Finance on how  to

solve this problem and whether these classes for  such

children  should  be  taken over by  the  Ministry  of

Education or whether they should be treated  as  aided

schools  and assistance rendered to them as such.  But

the question is not so simple. In principle, there  is

no   great   problem.   But  in  actual   fact   these

organisations  are  quite  different  from  the  aided

schools. So this matter requires further consultation.

His  suggestion is quite agreeable to  me  in  certain

aspects  and I will continue to pay attention  to  it.

But there are many ramifying problems which cannot  be

solved  now  and  here.  The schools  for  handicapped

children  run by these organisations have accommodated

1,126  students and we have sent out 60 teachers  to

teach  in  these  classes, 22 of  whom  have  received

specialised training in educating handicapped children

and   the   rest   have  received  other  professional

training.  I  do not want to spend too  much  time  on

details  as  there will not be enough time  to  answer

other questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the various questions raised by the Member

for Changi. He talked about the Ministry's recruitment

of  teachers from England and other countries and  put

forward  certain  advice.  On  Friday  I  had  already

clarified the postion in this regard that we would pay

special  attention to this matter. But there  are  not

many  such  teachers, and their  number  will  not  be

allowed to increase very much. I must stress that this

is  not  the  only  way to solve the  problem  of  the

shortage  of  teachers. This is only a short  term  or

make-shift measure to solve the problem. The long-term

solution  chiefly lies in a greater intake of  trainee

teachers into the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>



Institute  of  Education. In  1976  the  Institute  of

Education  recruited a total of 547 trainee  teachers.

out  of  which 272 were graduate trainee teachers  and

275  were non-graduate trainee teachers. In the  first

half of this year. 276 were recruited, out of which 115  were

graduate  trainees and 161 were  non-graduate

trainee  teachers. In July this year the Institute  of

Education will take in more trainees to be trained  as

teachers. This is the main counter measure. Apart from

this,  we  also  provide  an  unrestricted  number  of

scholarships and bursaries for university  studies  to

those  youths  who  like  to take  up  teaching  as  a

profession.  We  have also had arrangements  with  the

authorities  concerned in England, Australia  and  New

Zealand on teacher exchange programmes so that we  can

send teachers in Mandarin in exchange for teachers  in

English. These are some of the measures we have  taken

to solve the shortage of teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned about a teacher who was recently asked

to   leave   Singapore, who   had   taught   in   the

International  School,  now called  the  United  World

College.  I would like to stress here that this  is  a

private school. The teachers were not recruited by the

Ministry of Education. If they were recruited  by  us.

they  would have to go through certain procedures.  Of

course,   we   cannot  guarantee  that  one   or   two

undesirable elements will not infiltrate our  teaching

profession.  However, this possibility is  not  great.

But  we will pay attention to his advice as to whether

such  teachers would produce any undesirable influence

on our teachers and students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kolam Ayer also enquired about the

teachers' and pupils' reaction. I can say that up till

now the reaction is quite positive and favourable, and

they  have carried out their duties as teachers  quite

well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi touched especially on the

lowering  standard of English in schools. As a  matter

of  fact,  I  have read certain reports that  even  in

England the standard of English has gone down.  So  it

is  not  just  in  Singapore. On  Friday,  the  Senior

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour has

also referred to a drop in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>



standard of Chinese. It is a matter of opinion whether

or  not  there is a drop in the language standard.  In

the past our forebears probably read only one book  in

school.  Therefore, they had higher demands and  could

be  very  strict  and meticulous about  the  form  and

grammar  of  the language and tolerating no  mistakes.

However, in the modern society this has changed.  With

most  of  the  young people, their attitude  is  quite

different.   They  are  quite  tolerant  of   language

mistakes. The problems of examinations and others  may

have some bearing on this. But I believe the change in

attitude is a crucial factor. However, we do  not  say

that  we condone a low standard of English. Of course,

we  should  at least strive for a minimum standard  to

ensure  that the language used is not faulty,  if  not

excellent, and would be sufficient for one to  develop

and build on. That is one chief reason why recently we

issued circulars to schools stipulating that from 1979

students  wishing to go to the pre-university  classes

or  junior  colleges  must attain  a  certain  minimum

standard  in language. We believe that if the attitude

is correct the language standard of our youths will be

gradually raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem touched on by him and which was also

touched  on  by the Member for Kolam Ayer, relates  to

relief  teachers. A few of these relief  teachers  are

teachers  trained by the Institute of Education.  They

will  eventually take up teaching as their profession.

But   for   the   time  being,  because   of   certain

administrative problems, these teachers  are  not  yet

able  to fill up suitable posts, so they remain  where

they  are. Sometimes this is because the subjects they

mastered  do not fit in with the requirements  of  the

school.  This  is  only  temporary.  In  other  cases,

certain  trained teachers have given up teaching.  But

in   the  meantime  because  of  good  ties  with  the

principal  or of other reasons these teachers  do  not

mind  going  back to the schools to help do  a  stint.

Most of the relief teachers do not teach for long.  It

is  not possible to give all of them training. I  must

inform  the  House that before these  relief  teachers

take up teaching we have instructed the principals  to

brief them on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>



professional guidance wherever possible, so that  they

can  cope  with  the  job more  efficiently,  and  the

principals have also complied.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kolam Ayer also touched on this

point.  He  asked  when we would stop engaging  relief

teachers.  I  cannot  give  him  a  date.  Under   any

circumstances, we will need relief teachers unless  we

employ  far  more teachers whose sole  purpose  is  to

temporarily fill up vacant posts whenever the  serving

teachers go on leave or fall sick. We cannot  do  that

financially. Therefore, under these circumstances,  it

is  not  possible to stop recruiting relief  teachers.

There can be no fixed date, in fact, the date to  stop

engaging such relief teachers will be remote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching on the Member for Khe Bong's criticism,

this  relates to what I said just now. The speech  was

full of exaggeration. I do not deny that recently  the

Chinese Secondary IV students had started their school

term  late  by  five  working  days.  Last  year,  the

examination  results were announced  on  6th  February

1976  and the school commenced on 1st March. This year

the  results were announced on 5th February and school

commenced on 10th March. The delay was partly  because

of  the Chinese New Year holidays. This year the  time

taken  was 24 working days against 19 days last  year.

In fact, we do not want to delay and waste even a day.

The  delay  for this year was due to several  reasons.

First, there was a greater number of applicants.  Last

year  there  were 2,500 applications. This year  there

were 3,100 applications. The second reason was due  to

wrongly  filled  forms. There were 500  of  them.  The

applicants filled up subjects which were not  provided

by the schools concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also alleged that computerised processing

was faster. I am not a computer expert but I have some

knowledge about computers, because I have gone through

some  courses.  I  know  that  the  computer  is   not

infallible or cannot do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>



everything.  If  you  do  not  know  how  to  use  the

computer, it cannot help you at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The computer can facilitate or expedite the

processing of application forms, only if the data  and

programming  are correct and proper. Any  delay,  even

for one day, is not good. However, we must look at  it

from  a wider angle. I must thank him for bringing  it

up  here. But if his criticism is highlighted  in  the

newspapers  the  next day, and my answer  is  given  a

small  space  in  the newspapers the  result  will  be

misleading.  I do not think this is his intention.  Is

it?  Therefore,  although the intention  is  good  the

result may not be good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kolam Ayer touched on several points

and  I have answered some of them. He asked why before

the    restructured   education   system   was   fully

implemented it was superseded by the new system.  This

restructured education system had engaged much of  our

time  in its planning. Basically this education system

was  still  geared to the needs of average  and  above

average students. There was no provision for retention

classes.  However,  before implementing  this  system,

some  very important information had come to hand.  We

found that the automatic promotion system had produced

a  backward  symptom  among many students,  especially

those below average intelligence. They were very  weak

in mathematics and language. They become the so-called

"educational  illiterates".  They  could   not   speak

Mandarin  or English. This is a very serious  problem.

We  therefore  did  not  implement  this  restructured

education  system  but straightaway  reverted  to  the

traditional  system  with  certain  modifications   in

streaming  to  meet  educational requirements  of  the

below-averaged. This is well-known to all and  we  are

not  ashamed  about  this. Since the  system  was  not

practicable and had we persisted, it would not  be  in

the interest of education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also enquired how the streaming of

students was carried out. I would stress that there is

no  streaming  at  the  Primary I  level.  Because  in

Primary  I  we just take in pupils without  regard  to

their intelligence or their capability. They are just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>



taken in at random. There is no bio-data streaming  in

Primary  I. Actual streaming only takes place  at  the

Primary II level according to their scholastic results

and  performance. If there is only one  class  in  the

school,  of  course there is no streaming. It  chiefly

depends  on the number of classes available.  It  also

depends  upon the facilities and the type of  teachers

in  the  school. Basically, the streaming is dependent

upon their results in mathematics and languages, first

language and second language, for Primary II and  III.

For  Primary IV, V and VI, science is also taken  into

consideration when streaming them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also enquired whether we intended to

recruit  those teachers who had retired  to  meet  the

shortage of teachers. In fact, we are doing so.  Those

who  are  good  in teaching, physically  fit  and  are

willing  to stay on, and the subjects they  teach  are

those  that we require to meet the shortage,  then  we

welcome  them back. But it sometimes happen that  they

do  not want to come back. And sometimes what they are

able  to teach are not the subjects for which  we  are

short of teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also suggested whether we should employ

married lady teachers who had given up teaching in our

schools. He may be surprised to hear the figures I  am

going  to give. At present 42% of the teachers in  our

schools  are married lady teachers. Therefore,  it  is

not  the question of all married lady teachers  giving

up  teaching. Actually I would like to see  more  male

teachers  in the secondary schools, because  they  are

dealing  with  adolescents. I think male teachers  are

more  suitable  than lady teachers for the  boys,  and

vice versa for the girls. Generally boys have problems

that  require  male  teachers to  tackle  while  girls

prefer lady teachers for help. So teaching should  not

be  confined  to either male or female  teachers.  The

present  trend is that the number of lady teachers  is

increasing.  There  are more and more  lady  teachers.

Among the present group of serving teachers, more than

60%  are women, speaking on a national basis. Most  of

these  lady teachers are in the primary schools  where

they account for about 67%.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kolam Ayer also asked whether we were

retraining  those redundant Chinese and  Malay  medium

teachers. Yes, we are doing this. Those who possess  a

certain  passable standard of English  will  be  given

retraining,  so  that they can be  sent  to  teach  in

another  medium. Those who are not so good in  English

will  be  deployed to the type of work that  does  not

require a high standard of English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned another point. He said

that the Education Officers' visits to schools had led

to  storms of complaints and dissatisfaction among the

teachers.  But when the Permanent Secretary  with  his

retinue  of  administrative  officers  went  round  to

certain  schools,  he  was received  warmly.  This  is

plausible. Yet not quite so. In fact, there were  both

Education   Officers   and   administrative   officers

accompanying the Permanent Secretary when he made  his

round  of  schools.  It was reported  once  that  some

dissatisfaction and complaints had been  generated  by

visits  of professional officers to schools. But  that

had  long since been over, and I am not here defending

them.  He  should make specific references. He  should

not generalise upon some random examples, because this

would   cause   certain  anxiety  among   the   people

concerned. The purpose of the visit was to explain  to

the  teachers and the principals the education  policy

and to enhance the understanding between the teachers,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Permanent Secretary and his senior officials

have   visited  120  schools  to-date.  This  includes

schools,  junior colleges, AEB centres and  vocational

institutes,   and   there  have  been   thorough   and

harmonious discussions between the officials  and  the

teachers, in arriving at a mutual understanding of the

practical problems of education, with the result  that

many  forums and seminars have been conducted  by  the

Ministry  for the benefit of the teachers.  All  these

are  being done without publicity. We do not  want  to

talk  so much about it because it is not going to help

in our educational



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>



work. So we do not want to publicise our effort unless

we   have   to.  These  are  all  undertaken  quietly.

Therefore,  I  quoted a saying by Lu Shun,  a  Chinese

literatus,  that  we  would just  carry  on  our  work

quietly without pomp.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chai, you have devoted a lot of

time   on   this  amendment.  There  are  another   12

amendments to go.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> I have completed my reply, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In his reply to me

just  now, the  Minister of State  said  that  I  had

exaggerated in what I had said. I can tell  the  House

that I did not exaggerate. However. I feel that he has

exaggerated in his reply, because he admitted that the

school  term had started quite late this year compared

to last year. The date for admission had been delayed.

Therefore,  what  I had criticised  has  not  been  an

exaggeration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I will reply

in  one sentence. The Member said that our educational

efficiency  is very poor when it is well  regarded  in

this region, therefore this is an exaggeration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I think he has

misunderstood me. What I meant was that we  have  only

about two million people, yet we are making use of  so

much  manpower. If we had a population  equal  to  the

United States or China, how are we going to tackle our

educational problems? So comparatively our results are

poor. This is a comparison with other countries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Because of limited time, I do not like to dispute with

him  over this. I would like him to offer me more data

on these countries.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Dhanabalan (Kallang):</b> Sir, since the Senior

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lau Teik Soon (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head w be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CAA 1101*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr J. F. Conceicao).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in relation to the teaching profession, the

role   of   the  Directorate  is  most  crucial.   The

responsibilities of the Directorate would  include.  I

think, the following: to define the specific duties of

primary  and  secondary school  teachers,  to  suggest

improvements in teaching methods and to create rapport

between  the  educationists in the  Ministry  and  the

teachers   in   the   schools.  To   undertake   these

responsibilities,  I would expect that  besides  being

able  administrators, the top men in  the  Directorate

should be persons with a wealth of teaching experience

and   persons  with  pleasant  personalities  who  can

communicate  easily with the teachers  and  impart  to

them their profound knowledge on education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am certain that there are many in the

Ministry who have these qualities but there are one or

two  very senior officials who do not seem to  possess

them,  and unfortunately, the latter seem to  have  an

impact  on  the teaching profession. To  be  specific,

Sir, there are one or two high officials who have been

found  wanting:  they have shown by  their  deeds  and

words  that  they  are incapable  of  making  positive

suggestions  on  how teaching could be an  interesting

and worthwhile profession. Instead, Sir, they seem  to

have  made  ridiculous suggestions and even humiliated

certain  teachers, and  in the  process,  created  an

atmosphere  of  anxiety and loss of morale  among  the

teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lest I be accused of generalising, let me give

you  an illustration. There is one senior official  in

the  Directorate who has been referred to as the  D.D.

To  many teachers, it stands not for "Deputy Director"

but  for  other  things. By his actions  he  seems  to

assume the image of overlord of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>



teaching profession. According to The Mentor, (Vol. 5.

No.  3)  the journal of the Singapore Teachers' Union,

the  D.D. has  been  quick in making  suggestions  to

teachers  on  how  they should perform  their  duties;

suggestions  included the following:  teachers  should

take  turns  to go to school on Sundays,  they  should

help  pay  school  fees, they  should  buy  their  own

textbooks,  they should eat with their  pupils  during

recess and teachers should be tested in their teaching

subjects before their own pupils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Sir, there have been considerable remarks

in  the  teaching community that the D.D. delights  in

humiliating,   harassing  and,   worse,   intimidating

teachers, especially primary school lady teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, isolated or periodic rumours should be

dismissed,  but  if they persist,  there  must  be  an

element of truth in these statements. In my view,  the

key  officials of the Directorate must show an example

of good education and good character to say the least,

and  when the leading educationists demonstrate a lack

of these qualities, then something is seriously amiss.

Sir, I earnestly urge the Hon. Minister to examine the

state of affairs in the Directorate and, if necessary,

remedy  the  ills that have existed for the  past  few

years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of the

shortage  of  time,  may I be allowed  to  answer  the

Member's question first?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is up to you, Mr Chai.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  accusation is quite serious. This  had  happened

quite a long time ago and had since been resolved. The

Member for Serangoon Gardens himself had said that  he

could  not ascertain whether this was true or not,  as

it  was  only hearsay. Since he heard it from  certain

quarters,  he had deemed it to be true.  I  would  say

that this is quite unfair. It is not fair to attack in

this  House  somebody who is outside  this  House.  By

"D.D.",  I  think  he  was  referring  to  the  Deputy

Director  of  the Ministry of Education  who  was  the

former  principal of the National Junior College.  But

opinions differ. Some people criticised but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>



others praised him. So on such matters to criticise

him in such a way will not do any good to anybody -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Sir, may I have your permission to

interrupt? I was not referring to her at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, this matter is

an old issue, so I was making a guess. "D.D." seems to

refer  to  the  Deputy Director. If  it  is  not  this

person, well and good. If it is somebody else, can the

Member  kindly let me know who is that person  in  the

education  profession, and I will be very  willing  to

investigate into the matter?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> In view of what the Senior

Minister  of State has said, my only concern  is  that

there have been considerable statements with reference

to  the person concerned. I shall specifically mention

to  him  the name of the person, and I hope  that  the

Senior Minister of State will seriously look into  the

matter.  With  that,  I  beg  leave  to  withdraw   my

amendment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the establishment of the Extra Curricular

Activities Centre in 1967 a tremendous effort has been

made by those concerned to improve the physical health

and develop the talents of school children both at the

primary and secondary levels. This is evident  in  the

extra-curricular     activities      in      uniformed

organisations,   music   and   dance,   and   physical

education. The enthusiasm that has been injected  over

the  years through the emphasis on ECA in schools  has

brought  about  the  formation of  school  bands,  the

biennial Youth and Music festivals and, most important

of  all,  the physical development of school  children

through  participation in games and physical education

lessons.  In  other words, through ECA the  children's

talents  and potential are being exploited. All  these

are good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I would like the Minister of State for

Education  to inform the House whether (1)  there  is

any  move to establish a Physical Education Institute

or  to  enlarge  the present Department  of  Physical

Education  in the Institute of Education to  overcome

the  present  shortage of qualified P.E. teachers  in

schools.  (2) Has any survey been conducted  to  find

out  the proper utilisation of P.E.-trained resources

among   the  schools?  (3)  What  are  the   required

staffing  needs  for teaching physical  education  in

both  the  primary  and  secondary  schools  in   the

Republic?  Are these needs being made?  I  ask  these

questions.  Sir,  because  there  seems  to  be  some

unhappiness among those teachers -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Haji Sha'ari, guillotine time is at 4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Yes, Sir. Sir, there seems

to  be  some unhappiness among teachers who have  been

asked  to  take  P.E. in schools, when  they  are  not

trained  to do so. Also, there seems to be a  feedback

that  those trained in P.E. are not fully utilised  in

teaching   physical  education.  Could  the   Minister

enlighten the House on these questions?

reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, we do not have

the intention to set up a Physical Education Institute

or  expand  the  P.E, section  of  the  Institute  of

Education at the moment. We will try our best to  make

full  use  of  trained teachers as physical  education

teachers.  We  have made some studies. At  the  moment

there are altogether 826 teachers who are trained  and

are  teaching  physical education in the  schools.  We

shall  make  full  use  of the trainees  for  physical

education  but because of their age some  may  not  be

able  to  do  so. So not every one who is  trained  in

physical  education  will be  put  to  teach  physical

education.  In  the  primary schools  there  are  some

teachers  who  are  not  specially  trained.  We   pay

attention to all these.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Post Office Savings Bank's Giro System is

rendering  a great service to many people,  especially

office  workers,  in settling their  bills,  like  HDB

rentals, property tax, PUB bills, etc. This is  highly

commendable.  I wonder whether this Giro System  could

be  extended  to  the collection of other  taxes  like

income  tax,  HDB conservancy charges,  TV  and  Radio

licences,  etc. This will, in fact, help many  of  the

office workers to settle their bills with much ease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, turning to tourism, the Finance Ministry says

that  it  will  encourage more  tourists  to  come  to

Singapore  and increase the number of group  tours  by

getting  more  chartered  flights  into  Singapore.  I

wonder what is being done to encourage tourists to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>



fly   by  SIA.  How  is  our  national  airline,  SIA.

progressing  and  how is it doing  in  competing  with

other airlines? Could the Minister comment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know how is our trade with the

Western  countries? Are we getting ample markets  from

the West?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on the subject of the Civil Service. It

appears  that many officers have reached  the  top  of

their  salary scale and have stagnated for many years.

If  an  officer's salary has been stagnated  for  many

years  and he has still got many more years to  serve,

then  what  quality  of work can we  expect  from  the

officer?  Human failings will definitely  be  evident.

The  quality  of  his  performance  will  be  affected

because   there  is  no  more  incentive   as   future

promotions  will not be forthcoming, and moreover  age

also  is a barrier. Could the Minister give some facts

and  figures of the number of officers who are in this

category?  For this reason I know that the performance

of  many officers has dropped. I suggest that a  study

should  be conducted of all the officers both  in  the

Civil  Service  and  the statutory bodies,  to  assess

their capabilities and potentialities and to think  of

a way to emplace them on an adjusted salary scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must compliment the Government for paying the

employees of Government and statutory boards the 13th

month   allowance.  This  is  a  step  in  the   right

direction. For a very long time the wages and salaries

of  Government employees have been lower than that  of

the   private   commercial   sector.   But   what   is

disheartening is the conditions imposed on the payment

of  the 13th month allowance. In order to receive this

allowance, an employee should be in service up to  and

including  31st  December of  that  year.  Many  older

employees, particularly those in Division IV, such  as

postmen,  medical and health servants, school servants

and  so on, did not have the date of birth written  in

their  birth  certificates  and  the  Government   has

allotted them 31st December of the year in







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>



which  they  were  born as their date  of  birth.  The

Government,  as  the employer, retires  them  on  30th

December because they would have passed the retirement

age  on 31st December, and therefore deny them payment

of  the  13th month allowance. This is grossly  unjust

and  no  amount of explanation can convince any person

that  this  is not unjust. The Government also  denies

payment  of  the  13th month allowance  to  those  who

retire or die within the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we read in the press and even heard from

the hon. Member for Alexandra of two cases; one was an

employee of the Housing and Development Board and  the

other was employed by the Telecommunications Authority

of Singapore. Both employees died while in service. In

the case of the HDB employee, a technician, he died on

21st December, 1976

Initially,  the HDB demanded the refund of his  salary

22nd December, 1976

the  parents of the late employee. They also  demanded

from, the  parents  the  refund  of  the  13th  month

allowance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after the HDB case, the Straits Times on 9th

March,  1977  stated that the TAS  had  demanded  the

refund  of  wages  from  the  widow  of  one  of  its

30th December, 1976.

Committee of Supply. I am bringing it up now.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> So you are bringing up all the matters

which come under the Minister's charge.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Yes, everything that comes under

the Minister's charge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee was then working in Clementi Park. The

pole  slipped and fell on him and killed him. Here  is

an  employee who was killed while performing his work.

The  TAS  demanded from the widow the  sum  of  $13.98

cents  being  the amount of wages for  31st  December,

1976  which was already paid to him on 20th  December,

1976  since he was a monthly-rated employee.  Is  this

reasonable?  The  man  had died  and  his  salary  had

already  been paid. They wanted to recover the  salary

from  the  widow.  This  is  not  justified.  The  two

statutory  boards have not been sympathetic  in  these

two  cases.  The TAS also demanded the refund  of  the

13th month allowance from the widow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the newspaper reports, I learn that the union

is  contesting the right of the employer to demand the

refund either from the parents or the widow. I do  not

know  the law in this respect but I am concerned  with

the image of the Government in the eyes of the public.

The Straits Times wrote an editorial on 10th March and

I  have  a copy of the editorial here. If the Minister

wants it I will hand it over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nanyang Siang Pau also Wrote an editorial which

was reproduced in the New Nation on 14th March, 1977.

In the last paragraph of their editorial they proposed

that  the  13th  month allowance  should  be  paid  in

proportion  to an employee's service. I  also  have  a

copy of the editorial from Nanyang Siang Pau.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,I do not know of any private employer who has

denied the payment of bonus to his employees because

an employee has died on 30th December and did not work

on 31st December, I have also not heard of any private

employer who has denied payment of bonus to an

employee who, after 30 years of service, retires or

dies before 31st December. The usual practice is to

pay in full or on a pro rata basis. I would urge the

Minister for Finance to seriously consider amending

the rules so that Government and statutory board

employees who retire or die in service before 31st

December will be paid the 13th month allowance on a

pro rata basis.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again, the 13th month non-pensionable annual

allowance which has been given to our workers  in  the

past  few years has caused some administrative problem

in  the  computation of this allowance, as far as  the

daily-rated   workers  are  concerned.   This   annual

allowance  is  normally paid to a worker with  certain

restrictions, like working for the whole  year  before

he  is  eligible for it. The payment is normally  made

towards  the  end of the year. Like the  monthly-rated

workers, the daily-rated workers are also paid at  the

same  time, which is fair to them. But then  when  the

computation of this allowance is made, I believe  many

departments have a cut-off date for the calculation of

this  allowance for daily-rated workers. I  understand

it  is  normally  in the middle of December.  However,

after  the payments have been made towards the end  of

the  year, many daily-rated workers may be absent from

their  place of work for various reasons, thereby  the

question   of  deducting  proportionately  from   this

allowance  comes in for those workers  who  have  been

away for more than 16 days in a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a department where thousands of daily-rated

workers are employed, it appears that after being paid

the  13th month allowance, the authorities have to re-check the attendance of all their workers till the end

of  the  year  and then make adjustments on  the  13th

month  allowance. And when adjustments  are  made,  it

means a recovery of their money. Sometimes, it is  not

an easy business to recover the money, because some of

the  daily-rated workers may not turn up any  more  or

they   will  dispute  it  when  their  pay  is   being

recovered.  This problem has become an annual  affair.

To  simplify the payment of this 13th month allowance.

I  suggest  that  those  who have  worked  up  to  and

including  30th  November, instead of  31st  December,

should be entitled to the full eligibility of the 13th

month allowance and that payment could be made towards

the end of the year.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr P. Govindaswamy, your 10 minutes

are up. Mr Sia Khoon Seong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>



and Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon are not here. Dr Ong Leong Boon.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, last year during the Budget

Debate, I raised the subject of equal medical benefits

for  female Government officers, and I was assured  by

the  Hon. Minister for Finance that he would look into

the matter. He said [Hansard, Vol. 35, col. 936]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`These Government regulations have a very long

standing, and perhaps they may need to be looked  into

again In the Context of our present society, while the

responsibility  still lies with the  husband  in  many

households. I am not quite sure that the guideline  is

still  relevant for others  Obviously we have to  look

into   these   regulations  which  are  of  historical

interest, rather than to meet the present situation'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a full year since, and his Ministry has

shown  once again a propensity for selective  amnesia.

May  I  take  this  opportunity  to  remind  the  Hon.

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, medical care is provided to a Government

officer and his family at all Government hospitals and

clinics - treatment is free at outpatient clinics and a

nominal ward charge is levied for hospitalisation.  As

laid out in the Instruction Manual No. 2:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`an officer means and includes an officer or

pensioner of the Government of Singapore, or  a  woman

officer  who  is a widow or divorcee or who  has  been

granted  a decree of judicial separation, and  is  the

sole supporter of her family.'



<br><br>The term "family" is defined as:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a wife and child (or children) in the case of a male officer; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a child or children in the case of a woman

officer  who  is a widow or divorcee or who  has  been

granted a decree of judicial separation and who is the

sole supporter of her family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what the above amounts to is that male officers

enjoy   medical   benefits  which  are   automatically

extended  to  his  wife and children,  whereas  female

officers  are  entitled  to  such  benefits  only  for

herself.  Her  husband and children are  not  accorded

medical benefits, and they will have to pay. Only if a

female  officer  is widowed or divorced  are  benefits

extended to her children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it unacceptable that this Government regards

female officers as less equal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>



than  men, for in almost every way they are  equal  to

men, in their work performance and productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the pattern of the family unit has changed over

the  years, and today the male may not necessarily  be

the head of the household. Again, large and increasing

numbers  of females are employed in the civil service.

In   keeping  with  the  Government's  philosophy  and

practice  of equal treatment for both sexes and  equal

rewards. I hope the Hon. Finance Minister will rectify

the  anachronistic  instructions  which  dictate  that

female  officers  shall be less  entitled  to  medical

benefits  in  respect  of her  family  than  her  male

counterparts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a year is a fairly long time to address one's

mind  to  the matter and I trust the Finance  Minister

will have more to say on this subject this time.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to join the hon. Member for Anson and  make

some comments on the regulations governing the payment

of  the  13th  month allowance to civil  servants  and

employees  in statutory boards. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

Member for Anson has gone to great lengths to describe

the  different  situations  in  which  employees  find

themselves  without  being  awarded  the  13th   month

allowance.  He has also taken great pains to  describe

the  situations of families of employees who  died  in

service and who faced the heartless officials  of  the

Government  who  came calling on  them  asking  for  a

refund of the 13th month allowance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulations also do not favour those who retire

from  service before 31st December. To take an extreme

case,  an  employee  whose  birthday  falls  on   30th

December, will therefore reach his retirement  age  on

30th  December. He automatically retires and  forfeits

his  13th month allowance. He loses it not through any

fault of his own



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>



but  simply because he had the misfortune to  be  born

one day earlier. It also does not favour those who opt

for early retirement from service if they tender their

resignation  before  31st December  even  though  they

continue  serving up till 31st December. It  does  not

seem  fair  that  a person should be denied  his  13th

month  allowance just because he is simply abiding  by

regulations governing notice of resignation even if he

is still in service up till 31st December. The present

regulations  obviously leave much to be  desired.  The

13th month allowance is an incentive for those who are

in  service  to continue being loyal to the Government

but  it is also an appreciation of service put  in  by

employees during the past year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 13th month allowance is not a bonus such as that

granted  by  commercial  firms,  but  in  essence   it

operates  like one. It contains two elements; firstly,

one  of  providing further incentives  and,  secondly,

appreciating  past services. It is the latter  element

that  is  important for appreciation for past services

in itself contains a built-in incentive to an employee

to  strive harder in the coming year. But just because

one  chooses not to continue in service or has to  opt

out of service or because fate has played a cruel hand

does  not  mean  that  his  past  services  cannot  be

appreciated.  The  Government awards  the  13th  month

payment to an employee who enters during the course of

the  year on a pro rata basis. Cannot this be  applied

also  to  those who leave the service in the year?  It

seems  that the fairest solution, therefore, would  be

to award the 13th month allowance on a pro rata basis.

As  an example, an employee who retires at the end  of

September  should be paid three-quarters of  the  13th

month allowance for that year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the Government has made rules to suit

its  own  pocket:  "Pay when you have  to  pay;  avoid

payment  when  you can." No doubt it is  a  very  wise

policy to adopt by any government. But cannot we  just

show some appreciation for those who leave? Cannot  we

show some compassion for those who die? The Government

seems to take the stand that, "Since you are no longer

going to be with us,' we are conveniently going to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>



forget   what  you  have  done  in  the   past."   The

regulations  were  first  made  when  the  13th  month

allowance  was first introduced. Those who made  these

regulations did not foresee the situations that  would

arise  as  a  result  of rigid interpretation  of  the

rules.  But  now that many actual cases have  appeared

that  have  led  to many disputes, caused  anguish  to

some,  is it not time for us to make changes to  these

rules?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  the  allocation for the  Main  estimates  is

about  $809  million, for Development  estimates  $659

million,  of  which $105 million is for new  projects.

Jurong  Town Corporation gets $245 million and Housing

Scheme $8.5 million. At the same time $220 million  is

for  loans  to  industrial and commercial enterprises.

$220 million for commerce and industry seems to me  to

be  too small. The other day the Minister for Law  and

the  Environment said in this House that  the  Raffles

Centre Shopping Complex development plan would require

$500  million  and  yet  the total  loan  to  all  our

commercial  and industrial enterprises  is  only  $220

million. How can it be enough?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point I would like to raise. The

Government's   loans  are  mainly  for  industry   and

commerce to the neglect of farming. This is not right.

Since  we  are emphasising on the development  of  our

economy  in  all fields, in other words,  diversifying

the  economy,  we  should also look  after  the  other

sectors and also provide loans to the farming industry

including  pig  and chicken rearing,  orchid  growing,

tropical fish breeding and so on. This will help  them

to generate more income and also enable them to export

their  produce  abroad to gain large sums  of  foreign

exchange.   Therefore  there   should   not   be   any

discrimination by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to raise a few questions to the

Minister. Firstly, the Minister for Finance  has  said

in  his Budget Speech that our economic growth was  7%

last  year and that our economic weather is good,  our

ship  of state is in good shape and the command should

be "steady as she goes". This is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>



stout  slogan meaning that in the coming year we  will

be  having a higher economic growth. I would  like  to

ask  the  Minister  what  is the  expectation  or  the

percentage growth for next year. He has said  that  it

is about 6-8%. This seems to be going backwards. So  I

would  like to ask him on what basis has he made  this

calculation  of  6-8% growth. Is it due  to  increased

foreign investments here or greater expansion  of  our

commerce and industries?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in his Budget it is stated that last year

private  building  construction had decreased  by  3%.

This  is  a  decrease for the third year. In  view  of

this,  I  would like to ask the Minister what measures

has  he  got to help the private building construction

industry.  If  this  sector  can  recover,   it   will

certainly be able to contribute much to our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Minister has also pointed out in his

Budget  Speech  that securing foreign  investments  is

still  a  heavy task for the Government to  tackle.  I

would  like  to ask him what plans he has to  overcome

any   such   difficulties,  how  to   induce   foreign

investments  and what kind of incentives  or  tax  and

other concessions is he going to give.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Minister has said that there is a

shortfall of about $1,500 million in the Budget.  This

will  have  to  be  financed  by  virement  from   the

Development  Fund  and borrowing  or  the  raising  of

bonds.  This is a very judicious plan because  in  the

past  the previous two tax-free public bonds had  been

fully subscribed. If the Minister could plan well  for

development  funds, I am sure it will be  welcome  and

successful.  The  recent $40 million bond  issue  will

certainly be successfully raised. In view of all these

reasons  we  need  have  no  fear  of  getting  enough

development  funds  for  various  projects.  I   would

therefore  like to ask the Minister whether  he  would

assure  this  House that in the coming  two  or  three

years  he  will not levy any more taxes on  road  tax,

property tax, hawker licences, PUB bills, radio and TV

licences,  commercial  or  other  taxes, licences  or

charges  so  as to enable our people to  help  in  our

economic  growth  in a more peaceful  and  undisturbed

environment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly last year, there was a trade deficit

amounting  to $6,000 million, a surprising  sum.  What

remedy does he have to reduce our trade deficit?  When

winding  up his speech on the 14th of this month,  the

Minister  said  that he would consider  setting  up  a

Trade  Development Council to further promote external

trade.  Very  good, I hope practical  action  will  be

taken, not just consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand have

signed  a  10% tariff concession on mutual  goods  for

export  within  these three countries.  What  are  the

reactions  of  other  ASEAN countries?  Has  Singapore

consulted other ASEAN countries on this matter?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, there are quite a number  of  questions

which  I  have to answer. The first one  is  from  the

Member  for  Anson.  He spoke about  the  Post  Office

Savings Bank and the Giro system, and asked whether it

could  not  be  used  for the  purpose  of  a  central

collection  system. The Management Services Department

has  been studying for some time the setting up  of  a

central  collection  agency  with  collection   points

throughout  the  island  to  collect  fees  and  rates

payable to Government and statutory boards. While  the

concept of multi-purpose centres for the collection of

bills  has  been  found  to be  feasible,  the  actual

physical  setup  has not been determined  and  several

possibilities  are being explored. One  of  these,  of

course,  is  the  use of the POSB which  has  branches

throughout the island. However, the POSB Giro  system,

despite the advantages that it has, does not appear to

be sufficiently popular. For example, only about 3% of

POSB  account  holders are paying their bills  through

the POSB Giro system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he asked about tourism and what SIA was doing

to  encourage  tourists to fly by  SIA, and  how  our

national  line  was  progressing,  and  how   it   was

competing  with other airlines. The tourist  industry,

of course, has been very buoyant. We hope to register



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>



an increase of 15% to 20% per year in tourist arrivals

this year. We do not think too high a figure would  be

very desirable because there is already a danger of  a

drop  in  the  standard  of courtesy  in  our  hotels,

restaurants,     shopping    and     other     service

establishments. But SIA is continuing with its efforts

to  promote  tourism.  It has now,  firstly,  a  well-balanced network of services serving 27 cities  in  22

foreign countries. It is constantly striving to expand

this network.



<br><br>4.30 pm,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, SIA spends very considerable sums in

advertising and promotion. During the year ending 31st

March it spent $18 million overseas,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, SIA has invited a considerable number of

travel  editors and travel agents to Singapore to  see

for themselves the attractions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Singapore has developed a package of

holiday  programmes which are targetted for  its  main

tourist originating ideas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, SIA has spearheaded the establishment of

attractive  excursion  fares  in  its  main   tourist-generating areas overseas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum total of SIA's efforts is restricted in the

number  of passengers it carries to Singapore. In  the

calendar  year 1976, SIA carried 541,000  passengers,

excluding returning residents and West Malaysians into

Singapore, comprising 43% of total arrivals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked about SIA's progress and

competitiveness  with  other  airlines.  Given   equal

opportunities, SIA can hold its own with  the  world's

airlines,  Unfortunately, it is not always allowed  to

spread  its  wings. A case in point is the  series  of

traffic  rights discussions with the USA.  After  five

rounds  of negotiations starting as far back  as  1974

there  has  been absolutely no progress. At  the  last

round  of talks, the US delegation made a demand  that

SIA  should  obtain rights for a US carrier  from  the

Indonesian  and  Filippino governments.  This  is,  of

course, absolutely absurd and raises serious doubts as

to whether the US delegation was sincere in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>



its  efforts to reach agreement. A US airline has been

operating flights to Singapore for the last  40  years

but  SIA  is  still denied the opportunity to  operate

even one cargo service a week to the West Coast of the

USA.  However.  I  suppose  we  must  be  patient  and

persistent,  and  we believe that the American  people

who  are fair minded will allow SIA eventually to show

its paces across the Pacific.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also asked about our trade with

Western countries. Trade with the US. Canada, the  EEC

and  the remaining countries in EFTA has expanded from

$4.2  billion  in 1971 to $11.4 billion  in  1976,  an

increase of 160%. During this period, our exports grew

more  than 3 1/2 times from $1.5 billion in 1971 to  $5.5

billion in 1976. Our domestic exports to these markets

have fared even better as they have increased by about

5 1/2  times  from $610 million to $3.4 billion over  the

period  1971  to 1976. Our export performance  is  due

partly  to  the preferential access to the markets  of

the  US  and the EEC we enjoy under their GSP schemes.

It  is also the result of a joint effort by Government

and  the  private  sector to increase  the  range  and

sophistication of our products. However, we  have  our

share  of  trade problems with the Western  countries.

With  high levels of unemployment. Western governments

are   subjected  to  domestic  pressures  for  greater

protectionism.  About  40% of  our  total  exports  of

textiles  and  garments are subject to  import  quotas

imposed by the Western countries. Our more competitive

electronic  exports have also triggered protests  from

some countries as we attempt to upgrade and diversify.

Therefore,  while we have performed satisfactorily  in

these markets, we will remain alert and intensify  our

export promotion efforts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the main query that I have to answer

here  is  the  payment of the 13th month allowance.  I

have  already answered quite a number of supplementary

questions during Question Time. But I notice  that  it

has  not satisfied Members. However. I do not think  I

can  do better than to repeat again. The nature of the

non-pensionable  allowance  is  a  13th  month  salary

supplement payable to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>



people who are in service on the 31st December. It  is

no use suggesting that this annual allowance should be

of a different nature and that it should be a token of

appreciation  to officers who have already  done  some

service  but  are not in service on 31st December.  It

was  not  so conceived and there is no way in which  I

can  change the nature of this allowance to make it  a

matter  of compassionate allowance. The difference  is

like the difference between a cat and a dog. It is  no

use suggesting that the cat should be a dog and should

be friendly and compassionate. The fact is that it was

born  a  cat, and the non-pensionable annual allowance

likewise,  by its very nature, is a payment made  only

to   serving  officers  on  31st  December   and   not

necessarily to officers who have done good service and

should   perhaps   be   considered   for   a   certain

consideration by Government, whether in the form of an

appreciation or by way of ex gratia payment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry would have no objection to any statutory

body  exercising a discretion in special circumstances

of  extreme hardship to waive recovery. Let us not mix

the two matters. One is a matter of ex gratia payment,

and  the  other is a matter of entitlement to  a  non-pensionable annual allowance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there was one other question I have to

answer on the Civil Service. The Member for Anson  has

some doubts whether there is fairness and impartiality

in  the selection of persons who are promoted. I think

we  ensure  such fairness and impartiality by  getting

officers  who  are  carefully  selected  to  serve  on

promotion panels. Promoting authorities are concerned,

I think, only with the attributes of candidates. These

attributes  can  be  grouped  under  three  factors  - qualification, merit and experience. In the nature  of

things, however, in every promotion exercise there  is

bound  to  be a number of unsuccessful candidates  who

become  dissatisfied with the conduct, and outcome  of

the exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Member for Kim Seng who asked

whether husbands of married civil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>



servants could be eligible for consideration under the

medical benefit scheme of the Government. While I  can

appreciate the arguments which he has provided, we are

still living in an age where in any divorce case,  the

woman  is  never asked to pay alimony to the  husband,

and  I  think it is generally considered that husbands

are  capable of taking care of themselves. In the same

way, the regulation has been framed on that assumption

but  in the unlikely event that a woman officer has  a

husband  who is completely dependent upon  her.  I  am

prepared to consider the case for medical benefit as a

special one.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang raised a number of

questions. One was on the real growth likely for 1977.

I  have gone into this in some detail and there  is  a

good chance of our achieving a real growth of 6 to  8%

this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked whether there was any likely difficulty due

to  the  lack  of investments, and what further  steps

were  being taken to attract such investments. We have

tried  to ensure that domestically the conditions  are

conducive to attracting new investments. We  offer  an

attractive tax package and have always given  priority

to   providing  adequate  industrial  facilities   and

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts have also been made to upgrade skills in our

labour  force to meet the requirements of industry.  A

sound  and orderly system of wage increases linked  to

productivity has also helped us to remain  competitive

and,  externally,  key personnel  have  been  deployed

overseas to step up the promotion efforts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also give more assistance from the Capital

Assistance  and  Small Industries Finance  Schemes.  I

know  that  up  to  date the amounts given  have  been

dismal, but that is because we have started with these

two schemes only over the last year or so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked for an assurance that no levy

of taxes be raised for the rest of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>



this  year.  I have already answered that  question  - that   a   Minister  for  Finance  never  gives   such

assurances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked about the trade figures and spoke of

our  trade  deficit of $6 billion. With  a  developing

economy  and  with no natural resources like  ours,  a

trade  deficit is inevitable. We require large imports

of  capital  goods  and  equipment  to  build  up  our

productive  capacity and we are dependent on  external

sources  for  the  bulk of our  food  supply  and  raw

material  inputs  for  our  industry.  We  expect   to

continue  with this trade deficit as we go  into  more

sophisticated  servicing industries.  Industries  like

shiprepairing  which require heavy  capital  equipment

add  to  our trade import bill, but the services  they

render  are  not  shown in the trade  account  as  the

product of these industries is registered only in  the

services account and not in the export account.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, however, as an objective of our trade

policy,  the reduction of the trade deficit. Over  the

years  we have diversified into new products  and  new

markets. We have, for example, gone into production of

television  tubes  and  chassis  and  quartz  crystals

requiring  high levels of technology. Our  exports  to

West  Asia  have also developed by 12 times  over  the

last  six  years. Our Trade Investment and  Diplomatic

Offices  will be strengthened in key centres. We  will

also set up permanent exhibition centres in West Asia.

As  Members  are  aware, we are  not  considering  the

establishment of a Trade Development Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also spoke about the Philippines and

Thailand  and  across-the-board reduction  of  10%  of

existing  tariffs. Our bilateral agreement with  these

two  countries is a concrete step forward in cementing

closer economic ties and we have briefed Indonesia and

Malaysia on these arrangements. Consideration is being

given  now  to the implementation of bilateral  tariff

reductions under the ASEAN Agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered all the questions raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are informed that newly appointed Division I

officers  are  required  to attend  induction  courses

conducted  by  the  Civil  Service  Staff  Development

Institute. Participants in these courses are  assigned

to  attend MP's meet-the-people sessions in  order  to

have  a  better  understanding of  the  socio-economic

problems   that  exist  in  Singapore.  Through   such

assignments  it  is hoped that our top civil  servants

will be able to provide a more courteous and effective

service  to  the public. From time to time  our  civil

servants are subjected to criticisms on the manner  in

which   they   interpret   and  discharge   Government

policies.  I must say that such courses are  necessary

if the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>



Government is to implement its policies successfully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I wish to make is whether there is any

follow-up  action on the part of the CSSDI or  whether

any  assessment is made on the participants to  ensure

that  such  useful  experiences  gained  are  put   to

effective  use.  Do  these civil servants  impart  the

knowledge  gained  to their subordinates?  As  we  are

aware,  not all Division I civil servants have  direct

or personal contacts with members of the public in the

course  of  their duties. In many cases such  contacts

are  normally delegated to their subordinates. In view

of  this,  would it not be desirable for the  Minister

for  Finance  to  provide  such  experience  to  civil

servants  in  other  divisions who are  constantly  in

contact  with members of the public in the  course  of

their  duties?  There may be other  older  Division  I

officers  who  may not have the benefit  of  attending

such courses.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, what has the

Civil Service Staff Development Institute, which is in

Pasir Panjang, done so far? How far has this Institute

been  successful  in helping our civil  service?  What

sort of courses are conducted at this Institute? Could

the  Minister give some facts and figures  about  this

Institute?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a certain amount of frustration

building  up  in the civil service. Quite  often  some

officers  with very little experience are promoted  to

posts  which  they are not capable of  holding  simply

because they possess the paper qualifications but  not

the  experience. Has any attention been  paid  to  the

level of incompetence of an officer?



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I welcome this opportunity to

comment on the courses that Government officers attend

at  the  CSSDI.  The Administrative Officers,  Medical

Officers,  Engineers. Legal Officers,  Inland  Revenue

Officers  and  other  Division  I  officers  who   are

recruited fresh from the University attend a  two-week

induction course at the CSSDI



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>



within  six  months of joining the civil service.  The

object  of the course is to make these officers  aware

of  their role and responsibilities as civil servants,

to  give  them an understanding of Government policies

and  the environment in which the Government operates.

They  are  required, as part of the course, to  attend

meet-the-people sessions conducted by MPs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the course, each participant is asked

to  comment  on  the various elements in  the  course.

Their  comments on the meet-the-people  sessions  have

invariably  been favourable. They found  the  sessions

relevant  and  valuable to their work. In  particular,

the  sessions have given them a much clearer  idea  of

the  various problems confronting our citizens and the

effects  of various administrative acts on the people.

The  participants would be expected in the  course  of

their work to pass on to their colleagues the benefits

of  the  training which they receive. The  Member  for

Anson has also asked questions about this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the objectives of the Civil Service Staff

Development  Institute,  these  are  to  enhance   the

effectiveness  of the public sector by  providing  in-service    training   courses   in   management    and

supervision, Government relations, current affairs and

English language.



The following figures on course attendance in 1975 and

1976 give an indication of the Institute's

activities:-

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institute does undertake course evaluations and

follow-ups on the results of these evaluations to find

out  whether the participants have benefited from  the

courses, and to improve and modify them in the light



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>



of  its findings. For example, participants of courses

on  management do subsequently carry out  organisation

and    system   improvements   in   their   respective

departments.  In the English courses, pre-course  and

post-course   test  results  show  that  participants'

language ability has improved. The Institute's courses

also enable civil servants from various ministries and

statutory  boards to meet and discuss common problems.

This   has  helped  in  improving  communication   and

coordination in the service.

by $10 in respect of subhead CAA 1101*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Phey Yew Kok).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members of the House are well aware of the

political,  economic  and social consequences  of  the

sharp increase in the price of oil since 1972, and the

likelihood  of further increases. I shall,  therefore,

not  touch on this aspect, but instead on how we could

alleviate  the effect of high costs of energy  in  the

interest  of economic development. Before I  do  that,

Sir,  let me briefly explain why I am taking  up  this

subject   under   the   subhead   "Permanent   Staff".

Development  Division, under  Head  X,  Ministry   of

Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some months ago, it was reported in the newspapers

that the Ministry of National Development was studying

the  design and construction of buildings with a  view

to  cutting down unnecessary heat absorption from  the

sun  so  that  expenditure  on  air-conditioning,  for

example, could be reduced. The Public Utilities  Board

has also revised its electricity consumption tariff to

penalise the high consumers so as to cut down the  use

of  energy.  More recently, some hon. Members  of  the

House have suggested that the Ministry of Science  and

Technology undertake research into the capture and use



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>



of  solar  energy, as we have plenty of it. All  these

actions  and  suggestions are sound, but the  point  I

wish   to   make  is  that  there  is  no   nationally

coordinated  effort  to work out a  long-range  energy

strategy  or programme to mitigate the effect  of  the

high price of oil. I think the Development Division of

the  Ministry of Finance is the best place to work out

such  a  national programme, it being responsible  for

the  economic development of the country. I would like

to  know  from  the Hon. Minister for Finance  whether

such  a programme has been or is being worked out;  if

not,  whether  he  would consider  initiating  such  a

programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two main aspects to a long range energy

programme for a country: (1) developing new sources or

alternative  forms of energy, and (2)  conserving  the

use  of  energy. Given a small economy and  a  smaller

geographical  area,  the  first  aspect  is  of   less

relevance  to us. We have no oil, shale  oil  or  coal

reserves.  True,  we have plenty of  sunlight,  but  I

doubt  whether  we  have the energy and  resources  to

undertake  primary research into this area  of  energy

resource.  Take  the case of Japan, for  example.  The

financial   commitment  of   a   MITI   (Ministry   of

International Trade and Industry) sponsored  "Sunshine

Project" inaugurated in July 1974 envisaged a  minimum

expenditure  in constant prices of Yen  4,260  billion

(or  about  S$37 billion) on research and  development

work  for the period 1974 to the year 2000. (The  main

areas  of  research under the "Sunshine  Project"  are

solar energy, geothermal energy, coal gasification and

liquefaction, and hydrogen.) I doubt if we can  afford

that kind of expenditure on research into new forms of

energy.  Nor  is  it  necessary.  Rather,  we   should

concentrate on secondary research to keep  abreast  of

current scientific and commercial development  in  the

use of new sources or alternative forms of energy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect of a long range energy strategy,

that   of  energy  conservation,  is  what  we  should

concentrate  on. We could call it a Long Range  Energy

Conservation  Programme. It  is  long  range  because,

firstly, any conservation programme has a long lead



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>



time,  and  secondly, it must be followed  through  so

that it becomes a way of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Long Range Energy Conservation Programme could

have the following objectives:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To bring about a change in political and

electoral  attitudes regarding the value  and  use  of

energy;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To work with industry to increase the efficiency

in  the  use of energy, i.e, reduce energy  input  per

unit of output; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To exact greater effort to reduce retained oil

imports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservation Programme could include the

following elements:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Differential pricing to discourage the excessive

use of energy;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Selective mandatory energy-saving measures such

as  the maximum amount of lighting for advertisements,

or  minimum  insulation standards for  air-conditioned

buildings;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Building codes aimed at energy conservation;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Financial incentives for investment by industries

in energy-saving equipment; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Financial or fiscal incentives to promote the

setting  up  of  skilled, labour-intensive  industries

requiring relatively smaller energy input per unit  of

output.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not an expert on energy conservation and

hence  could only touch sketchily on some points which

I  think  require further attention by specialists.  I

hope  the Development Division will formulate  such  a

national programme for energy conservation. I am  sure

they have the energy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Sir, the recent

Government's  scheme of financial  assistance  to  the

shipbuilding industry to enable Singapore shipbuilders

to compete in the international market is very commend

able. But I understand that the scheme has been fouled

up by too much bureaucratic red-tape.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of the scheme is a matter of great

concern  to me. Not that I seek to be a spokesman  for

the shipbuilding managements, but I view the scheme as

an  aid  for  maintaining job opportunities.  The  two

unions I am associated with, SILO and PIEU, have a few

thousand members who are employees of the shipbuilding

industry. Their livelihood is being threatened through

the  inability of our shipbuilding industry to compete

on  equal  terms  with their foreign competitors.  The

primary cause of such inability is the difficulty,  or

the red-tape, local shipbuilders have to go through to

secure credit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the normal practice for a local firm, which

has  successfully bid a contract to build a  ship,  to

allow  the buyer to pay only 30% of the total cost  of

the  ship  as  a  down-payment. The  local  firm  then

applies to the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) for

a  loan  equivalent to 70% of the total cost to enable

the firm to build the ship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is when the troubles arise. The DBS requires

the  prospective  buyer  to furnish  in  duplicate  or

triplicate his personal particulars, some of which the

buyer  considers  impertinent  or  irrelevant  to  the

question  of  his credit-worthiness. Fair enough,  the

buyer must answer personal questions to determine  his

financial   status.  But  the  fact  is   that   other

countries,  who are our competitors are  more  lenient

towards  their  buyers and have done  away  with  such

questions. It is, therefore, not surprising that  some

buyers react hostilely and refuse to answer all  these

impertinent  questions, since they can have  the  ship

built elsewhere on not less favourable terms of credit

and  without  the need to answer all these impertinent

questions.  I  was told that some local firms  had  to

give  up  contracts to build ships  because  of  these

impertinent questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of the red-tape problem is that

concerning  the  basis on which the credit  facilities

are  made available only for the contruction of self-propelled   ocean-going  ships  of  more  than   5,000

deadweight tonnes. Our members are not only employed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>



in building ocean-going ships but also in building oil

rigs  and dredgers. The fact that Singapore is one  of

the  biggest oil rig builders seems to be a matter  of

no  consequence to the Finance Ministry  or  the  DBS.

Apparently,  no  credit facilities  can  be  given  to

builders  of  oil rigs and dredgers. A Director  of  a

company  told  our union leaders that he  lost  a  $36

million  contract  because the  DBS  refused  to  give

credit  facilities for the building  of  dredgers.  In

this  instance, the firm had secured 100% credit  from

EXIM Bank of Japan for the machinery. What the builder

needed was credit for labour cost and materials  which

would have been in the region of $3 or $4 million. DBS

rejected the application because the dredgers  had  no

propellers. And, consequently, more than 200 employees

lost  their  jobs. These 200-odd employees  would  not

have joined the rank of the unemployed if the DBS  had

not been so rigid in its adherence to its self-imposed

rules for the granting of credit facilities. Moreover.

such rules do not seem to have taken into account  the

character of Singapore's shipbuilding industry.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of the red-tape problem is that

concerning   the   guarantee  the   DBS   wants   from

shipbuilders. The guarantee is to the effect that  the

shipbuilder  guarantees repayment of the  loan  during

the  seven-year period. Shipbuilders accept the orders

placed with them in good faith. Buyers are required to

make a downpayment equivalent to 30% of the total cost

of  their orders. But it will take one or two years to

fulfil   their  orders.  In  the  meantime,   due   to

unforeseen   circumstances  or  international   events

beyond   their  control,  buyers  may  be  unable   or

unwilling  to take delivery or, after taking delivery,

the  buyers may go bankrupt before repaying the  loan.

Shipbuilders,  therefore, cannot  guarantee  that  the

buyers  will  take  delivery of the  ships  they  have

ordered   or   repay   the   loan   fully.   In   such

circumstances, the  local shipbuilder  is  unable  to

secure sufficient shipbuilding orders, not because  he

cannot  win  such  orders  in  open  competition, but

because   he   cannot  obtain  the  necessary   credit

facilities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I expect the Minister for Finance's retort to be

the  usual platitude - that the red-tape is necessary

if  financial institutions are to be viable. But what

I  am unhappy about is, not that the Finance Ministry

or the DBS do not throw caution to the winds and lend

indiscriminately,  but  that  they   are   not   more

imaginative and realistic in giving credit facilities

to  shipbuilders. Japanese shipbuilders' success  can

in  a  way  be  attributed to the  credit  facilities

provided by EXIM Bank of Japan. Probably the Ministry

of  Finance  can  have another look at  the  Japanese

method when it lays down policies for DBS to adhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tragedy is that Singapore can ill-afford to

lose    all   shipbuilding   orders,   which    local

shipbuilders are prevented from accepting because  of

the red-tape governing credit facilities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

what   steps   are  being  taken  by   the   Economic

Development Board to ensure the smooth and  effective

transfer of technology to our Singapore workers?  Our

industrialisation programme is more than 10 years old

and  to-date  the technology transfer  is  still  far

below that expected. What are the problems preventing

a  faster  and more effective transfer of technology?

Are  we  facing  a  selfish attitude  of  those  that

possess higher technology and grudge passing this  on

to  our  workers?  This  transfer  of  technology  is

without  a  doubt essential for our country  and  its

workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I

want  to  take the question raised by the Member  for

Marine  Parade  on the necessity for energy  research

and conservation of energy supplies. I agree with the

Member for Marine Parade that, as far as research  is

concerned, the size of our economy is such  that  we

cannot  afford  to  spend  large  sums  of  money  on

research programmes which are already being  done  by

countries  like Japan, the United States  of  America

and  other  developed countries.  In  any  case,  the

research in nuclear power and in solar power must  be

on   a  long-term  basis.  As  far  as  Singapore  is

concerned, it is likely that we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>



shall  have  to  rely  upon conventional  sources  of

energy supplies, such as oil and coal. Whilst  it  is

possible  that we can buy nuclear power. I think  the

size  of our country is such that there is really  no

place  where  we  could safely put  a  nuclear  power

station  and, unless  we have  absolutely  no  other

alternative,   we   will  have   to   give   up   the

consideration of nuclear power station as a  solution

to our energy problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as conservation is concerned. I think we can

do  something.  In  fact, when the sudden  and  steep

increase in crude oil prices began in October 1973 we

had  a  national  "Save energy"  campaign.  This  was

conducted on a voluntary basis without any element of

compulsion.  A committee chaired by the  Director  of

Trade   was   set   up.  The  result  was   initially

encouraging.   The   rate  of  increase   of   energy

consumption fell to 4% the following year, that  is,

1974, and  7%  in  1975. As  a  result  of  economic

recovery last year, the rate of increase rose to  10%

but still well below the average rate of increase  of

20% in energy consumption in the years before the oil

crisis. In December 1973 we had, what is called,  the

Restrictions on the Supply, Distribution and  Use  of

Petroleum  and  Electricity Act,  which  was  passed,

empowering  the Government to restrict energy  usage.

This  Act  is  still  in force. Since  then  we  have

continued  to  encourage the conservation  of  energy

through various campaigns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member for Marine Parade has suggested,

amendments  to  existing regulations  to  incorporate

energy  conservation requirements in building  design

would  also help to cut down energy wastage  so  that

now  a sufficiently close and effective vigilance  on

energy usage can be coordinated and sustained through

the  work  of the Department of Trade and the  Public

Utilities Board. But the problem is admittedly a very

complex one requiring a sense of economy on the  part

of  all  energy  users, whether  they  be  Government

ministries, industries, businesses, motorists   or

individual   households.  I   think   our   immediate

requirements  are ensured, however, by the  Agreement

which we signed recently for preferential trading



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>



arrangements  in  ASEAN  which,  under  one   of   its

provisions,  gives us preference to  the  supplies  of

energy from our neighbours. Because of this particular

agreement, I think there should be less worry  on  our

part on the supplies necessary for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Member for Boon Teck. He has

raised  the  question of Government's scheme  for  the

credit facilities to the shipbuilding industry. He has

suggested  that  I  would answer him  with  the  usual

platitudes. I hope I do not, although I could say that

even  if  I  did so in the terms in which he suggested

that  I  would  do. I would only be suggesting  normal

banking prudence. The Member has himself in his speech

spoken  of the difficulties shipbuilders face,  and  I

quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Due to unforeseen circumstances or international

events  beyond their control, buyers may be unable  or

unwilling  to take delivery or, after taking delivery,

the buyers may go bankrupt before repaying the loan.'



<br><br>The   DBS   and  other  banks  also  face   the   same

difficulties when they have to return the money  which

the  Government may have advanced them  so  that  some

caution from them is surely reasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing ship financing scheme of the banks, and

of  the Development Bank of Singapore particularly, is

modelled on the Japanese EXIM bank credit scheme which

in  turn is based on guidelines laid down by the OECD.

The scheme was started in 1971 for vessels above 5,000

deadweight tonnes and subsequently extended  to  cover

also   vessels  of  below  5,000  deadweight   tonnes.

Although  it  is not Government's policy to  subsidise

the   local   shipbuilding  industry.  Government   is

prepared  to  assist the industry wherever appropriate

to  enable  them  to  compete effectively  with  other

countries. At the same time, I ought to say here  that

we  do  not have the same resources that Japan or  the

developed  Western  countries have for  assistance  to

their shipbuilding industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the alleged bureaucratic red-tape, perhaps the

following clarification should be made. The disclosure

of  personal  particulars of potential  buyers  is  an

accepted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>



international practice. Such information  is  required

to assess the debt servicing activity of the borrower.

I  would  be  very happy to learn from the Member  for

Boon   Teck  what  particular  countries  give  credit

without  even  inquiring into the particulars  of  the

borrower.  As  in the OECD schemes, credit  facilities

under  the  Singapore scheme are not extended  to  oil

rigs,  as the amount involved is fairly large and  the

credit  risks  are  different from ship  financing.  I

think  the  financing  of oil rigs  is  a  matter  for

syndication by our merchant banks and other  banks  in

our  financial  centre activities. Dredgers  are  also

excluded  as  they are not ships but  are  specialised

forms   of  marine  and  earth  excavating  equipment.

However. I think such financing can be considered on a

case  by case basis provided borrowers can comply with

appropriate terms of financing.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the case of the dredger referred to by the

Member  was actually considered on the merits  of  the

proposal, but   the  financing   fell   through   as

insufficient  information was disclosed and  the  Bank

which   was  to  provide  the  guarantee  had  already

exceeded its credit lines from the DBS.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Japanese EXIM Bank credit scheme, credit

facilities are generally extended to builders  instead

of  to buyers directly. In our case, direct lending to

buyers  are  considered on a case by case  basis.  The

interest rates of 8% to 8.5% per annum under  the  DBS

scheme  are more attractive compared to other existing

bank   going  rates  of  8.75%  to  9%  per   annum.

Furthermore, the Japanese scheme is only available for

vessels above 10,000 deadweight tonnes. Our scheme is,

therefore,  in  fact  more  liberal  compared  to  the

Japanese  one  in quite a few areas. I would  like  to

say,  however,  that  the  Member's  concern  for  the

shipbuilding industry is shared by the Government  and

that  we will do what we can to alleviate any distress

which  the  shipbuilding industry  is  facing  at  the

moment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question I have to consider is that raised

by  the  Member for Potong Pasir as to what  is  being

done  in  regard  to  the transfer  of  technology  to

Singapore.  In  fact, I believe that the  transfer  of

technology  has been taking place all this while,  for

the  whole  period of industrialisation, and  that  we

have had some success from such transfers through  the

activities not only of our own industrialists but also

those  of the many foreign industrial firms we attract

here. The advantage of the multi-national companies is

that,   we   hope,  they  bring  their  most  advanced

technology  from the West and that in the  process  of

establishing themselves here, the technology rubs  off

on  our local population. I do not know exactly how we

can  speed  up this transfer, There are  a  number  of

other  methods we are able to pursue. One of these  is

that  we should perhaps acquire some of the industries

in the US and other advanced technological centres and

try  and transfer them to firms in Singapore. I  think

some  of our local industries are already doing  this,

and I hope that in the coming years there will be more

and  more  of them doing the same, especially  in  the

products which require not too much capital but a  lot

of  entrepreneurial, scientific and technical  ability

from   the  entrepreneurial  personnel  such   as   in

electronics.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, one point

of  clarification  from the Minister  for  Finance.  I

agree  with the Minister that a prudent banker  should

ensure that a loan must not be granted without careful

consideration and investigation. But I have been  told

that questions on the buyer's personal history and the

number of wives he has have to be answered. What  have

these questions got to do with a person buying a ship?

What  I am trying to point out here is this. Financing

for  the  building  of an oil rig or  a  ship  is  not

successful because the DBS rejects the application  as

some  of  the  impertinent  questions  have  not  been

answered. I was told that the EXIM Bank of Japan  have

dropped these impertinent questions. Would it  not  be

easier  to  grant  a loan or credit  facility  to  the

shipbuilder in Singapore instead of to the  buyer,  so

that a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>



contract to build the ship could be entered into?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Son:</b> Sir, I am really surprised that

there should be any questions raised on the number  of

wives   or   female  alliances  that  any  prospective

borrower  has.  I  do not think that  is  particularly

true.  I think the banks are only interested in  those

particulars  which relate to his financial operations.

It may be that if he has a very, very extravagant wife

or   wives,  this  may  have  some  bearing  upon  his

financial  standing.  But  I  think  in  the   general

instance this is certainly unnecessary. The Member has

said  that  these  questions have been  withdrawn.  So

maybe  this  is only a rumour. If these questions  are

still  in the questionnaire, then they can be  brought

forth and we will examine them very closely.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Sir, the EXIM Bank of Japan has

withdrawn these impertinent questions. But the DBS has

not withdrawn them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Son:</b> I certainly will ask my Revenue

Division  and  the Development Bank of Singapore  that

operates  the  scheme on behalf of the  Government  to

look into this particular matter. As I say, I would be

very  surprised if that should be so and I can  assure

the Member - and I am sure the Member for Kallang will

also be happy to provide the same assurance - that  if

such questions are still in the questionnaire, then we

will withdraw them as rapidly as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, one of the methods to ensure a

faster transfer of technology would be to prepare  our

workers  adequately  for  this  transfer.  I  am  just

wondering whether such steps are being taken, and  if

so what are these steps?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I am not quite sure in what way

we  can  prepare workers for industries that have  not

yet  come.  We  do  have Government industry  training

centres  which train people in tool making and  so  on

and  I assume that the very general training would fit

them  not only for particular industries but also  for

other  industries which have related  technology.  But

the  first  thing  really is  to  have  our  engineers

trained in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>



particular industries. And, as I say, one of the  ways

is, first,  to  acquire a company in high  technology

industry in the developed countries, and then send our

people to this company for training. And, in fact, we

should  still keep that company in existence for  such

training  purposes  and exchange of  information  with

other  companies in the same technological field,  and

then  bring back the engineers and maybe some  of  the

trainees to start similar operations in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I would just like to take

this opportunity to refer to the statement made by the

Minister  earlier  on.  The Minister  mentioned  about

syndication  in financing of large-scale shipbuilding.

I  am just wondering to what extent the Government  is

encouraging this particular approach of financing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the size of the operations in

financing  oil rigs, for example, would be of  such  a

degree that the Government itself would not be able to

assist  very much. If we have to provide the resources

from  which the banking sector, such as the DBS, were

to  lend  to  oil rig builders and so on, the  amounts

would  be  so  considerable that the Government  would

have  to  find greater sources of finance.  And  I  am

already  having difficulty in this House in trying  to

convince  Members that there is a need for  broadening

the base of taxation or in increasing the taxes. So  I

think  on  this  point, perhaps the  financial  centre

should  try and do what it can to finance these rather

specialised  operations. I believe there are  merchant

banks  that  specialise in ship and oil rig  financing

and  I  think we must leave this mostly to  them.  The

Government, of course, is very happy to  provide  the

basis  for  the financial centre operations.  We  will

give  as  many  licences as are  required  for  anyone

wishing to enter into this business. But that  is  all

that we can do. Maybe through the DBS we can take some

part in the syndication, but even in that, there is  a

limit to what we can do.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, can I just add a bit more?

Taxation  is  totally irrelevant to  the  question  of

syndication for the financing of shipbuilding. On  the

question  of syndication, someone should come  forward

to  provide  the positive lead. In this  case,  may  I

suggest  that the hon. Member for Kallang through  the

DBS, should come forward and provide the lead which is

sadly needed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, may I say that some of these

operations involve risks and that, if these risks turn

out  to  be  unacceptable and result  in  losses,  the

Government will have to finance these losses from  its

Consolidated  Fund or Development Fund  or  from  some

other  fund  which it replenishes through  taxes,  The

question  of income tax or other taxes is not  totally

irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, the shipping company which I

work  for  has  built  ships  locally.  We  have  also

borrowed money from the DBS, and I am happy to confirm

that I have not been asked any impertinent questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the Minister's reply, I beg leave to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Dhanabalan:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head X be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead DAA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hesitate to bring up this point because the

Minister   has  just  mentioned  that  he  is   having

difficulty  in  convincing the House on  the  need  to

raise  more  taxes. But I would like to ask  the  Hon.

Minister   for  Finance  whether  he  would   consider

allowing  certain expenses incurred  by  residents  in

condominiums as tax deductible expenses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is Government policy that any housing development

covering  an  area of more than two  acres  should  be

developed  as a condominium. This means, among  other

things, that all the common services within the estate

have  to  be  paid  for  directly  by  the  owners  or

residents  of the estate. The residents pay a  monthly

service  charge  to  cover  common  services  such  as

provision and maintenance of lifts, common staircases,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>



corridors, swimming pools, tennis or  squash  courts,

etc., all of which should properly be paid for by  the

residents.  But the residents also have  to  meet  the

cost  of  providing other services such as maintenance

of  roads  and  drains, provision of street  lighting.

maintenance  of  grass verges and  open  areas.  These

latter  services  are provided by  the  Government  or

related  bodies  in every other part of  Singapore  at

taxpayers'  expense  except in the  condominiums.  The

residents  in the condominiums, in addition to  paying

their taxes like everyone else, have also to foot  the

bills  for these services. The cost of these  services

can amount to as much as $100 per month per household.

Would the Minister for Finance consider allowing these

expenses to be tax deductible, similar to that allowed

for expenses incurred for the maintenance of gardens?



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, at the moment I cannot see any

good reason why the expenses incurred in the upkeep of

private  roads  and  other  amenities  meant  for  the

exclusive  use  of  residents of  condominium  estates

should  be  deductible. Even residents of Housing  and

Development  Board  estates have  to  pay  conservancy

charges for upkeep and maintenance of the estates, and

the   conservancy  charges  they  pay  are   not   tax

deductible.  In  old  housing estates  like  Serangoon

Gardens, they do not pay conservancy charges for roads

which  are  public roads where members of  the  public

have  right  of passage. In a condominium,  I  do  not

think  there  is  a right of passage for  the  public.

Nevertheless if the Member can make out a better case,

we  will be prepared to give consideration as we  have

given  consideration to all the suggestions of Members

here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Sir, the roads in some of the

condominiums are really no different from the roads in

some  estates  like  Serangoon Garden  Estate.  Watten

Estate  or Hill Crest Estate. The conservancy  charges

paid by the HDB cover the types of services which,  as

I said, should be properly paid for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>



by  residents. There are other services which in  most

cases  are  paid for by Government. In the case  of  a

condominium,  there is no provision,  at  present,  to

even  allow the normal $300 tax-deductible expenditure

for  maintenance  of garden that is allowed  in  other

housing estates. But since the Minister is prepared to

consider when the details are put to him. I beg  leave

to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head X be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead DEC 1101*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Teong

Eng Siong).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 2nd September, 1970 [Hansard, Vol. 30, cols. 183-4] when I brought up the question of allowing

contributors  of  private provident  fund  to  utilise

their  deposits to purchase flats under the  HDB  Home

Ownership  scheme,  the  then Minister  of  State  for

Finance  in his reply stated that he was "prepared  to

ask  the  Commissioner of Inland Revenue  to  consider

sympathetically such amendments without affecting  its

approved  status."  Consequent  upon  that  assurance,

contributors of one particular private provident  fund

were  allowed  by  the Comptroller of  Income  Tax  to

transfer  part  of  their  deposits  to  the   Central

Provident Fund for the purpose of purchasing HDB flats

under  the  Home Ownership scheme. However, permission

was  withdrawn by the Comptroller of Income Tax on 4th

June. 1975, without giving any apparent reasons. As an

approved  fund  under the CPF, contributors  need  not

make  any  contribution to the CPF  owing  to  certain

rules,  the concurrence of the Comptroller  of  Income

Tax  must  be obtained before any part of  the  credit

balance can be transferred over to the CPF. May I  ask

the  Minister whether he will consider reviewing  this

matter again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, under this

amendment  I  would like to raise three questions.  On

personal  income  tax  relief  the  request  has  been

rejected. There is no hope for more relief. So I would

like to ask



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>



for  some  other  reliefs. First, can the  relief  for

maintaining parents and grandparents be increased?  At

the  moment it is $750 per year. It is really a  small

amount  of money averaging $62.50 per month. Now  that

prices are rising with inflation, $62.50 is not enough

even for rental, much less to maintain an aged parent.

I  would  like  to  ask the Minister to  increase  the

relief for aged parents from $750 to $1,500 per parent

per year. On average, it will amount to $125 per month

instead  of $62.50, so that one can better look  after

one's  aged parents. This will be in keeping with  the

virtue of filial piety of the Eastern people and  also

in keeping with the principles of care for the aged as

mentioned in the Presidential Address.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is on relief for income tax on

sports  organisations.  In  its  policy  of  promoting

sports  the  Government  has been  giving  income  tax

concessions   to   donors   who   donate   to   sports

organisations.  On  the  other  hand  the  Income  Tax

Department  is  taxing  such  organisations   on   all

donations. For example, the Singapore Amateur Swimming

Association  is  one  sports  organisation  which   is

promoting  sports and has won many laurels abroad  for

Singapore. Therefore, it has the support of the people

of Singapore and large sums of money have been donated

to  this  sports  association  for  the  promotion  of

swimming. Yet the Government taxes the donations. Last

year, the tax on' this Association amounted  to  some

$20,000.  This  should not be so. It  means  that  the

concession  generously promised by the  Government  is

now  taken back by the Government. With one  hand  the

Government  is giving this concession, but  with  the

other hand it is taking it back. This shows a lack  of

sincerity in Government's intention to promote sports.

Therefore, I would like to ask the Minister whether he

will   consider  exempting  taxes  on   these   sports

organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, will the Minister waive income tax on civic

organisations  which  offer scholarships  and  sponsor

welfare  funds,  and give tax concessions  to  donors?

These



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>



organisations  have  contributed much  to  Singapore's

education,  culture and in the social welfare  fields.

They  are  also  helping  the Government  by  awarding

scholarships  to produce many useful people  to  serve

the  country.  In view of this, the Government  should

encourage  these  civic organisations  and  donors  by

relieving  taxes on them particularly  on  scholarship

donations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Son:</b> As was stated in 1970, the

Government  is  prepared to consider  applications  to

amend  approved  private  provident  fund  schemes  to

enable  members  to  withdraw their contributions  for

purchase of HDB flats on terms similar to those of the

CPF. I regret that there should have been difficulties

in  implementing  this intention.  The  Department  of

Inland  Revenue has now been requested to  review  all

outstanding cases, and if the Member would let me know

the  particulars of this withdrawal which he said  was

4th June, 1975, I will send the particulars on to

them.   To   obviate  any  applications   from   being

overlooked,   perhaps  the  Member  can  request   any

particular  interested  fund  to  reapply  for  formal

approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the Member for Sembawang's questions,

the  Member may recollect that when I first  announced

the  relief  to  taxpayers for supporting  parents  or

grandparents,  the  tax deduction was  only  $300  per

dependant.  After careful consideration I  raised  the

relief  by  more  than  the  100%  which  he  is   now

suggesting  I  should  do. I raised  it  to  $750  per

dependant effective from the year of assessment  1975.

I  should point out that the tax inducement by  itself

will  not reverse the trend on the breaking up of  the

extended  family system in Singapore. Social  planners

should  perhaps  now try to find a  solution  to  this

problem.  I  am afraid I will not be able to  consider

raising  the  present relief of  $750  to  $1,500  per

dependent parent or grandparent that he suggests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked that charitable or sports

organisations  be exempted from income  tax.  I  would

point out that charitable organisations generally  are

already tax exempt under Section 13(1)(g) of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>



Income  Tax Act provided they spend 80% of  their  net

income  on approved charitable projects, in any  given

year   of  assessment.  All  donations  to  charitable

organisations  are deemed as income and would  qualify

for tax exemption if the 80% requirement is met.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports organisations are distinct from charities and

are more appropriately termed "clubs" for purposes  of

income  tax.  A club may qualify for tax exemption  if

more  than 50% of its gross receipts are derived  from

entrance  and subscription fees. Some of these  sports

organisations  which are affiliated to  the  Singapore

Sports  Council  or  the  Singapore  National  Olympic

Council receive more than half of their income as  tax

exempt donations from their parent bodies and they may

not  meet the 50% requirement. They therefore  do  not

qualify  for  tax exemption but they pay tax  only  on

their  net  income after providing for  all  allowable

deductions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I think the Member asked about the position

of scholarships on charitable contributions. As I have

said,  charities are exempted from income tax  subject

to certain conditions. It therefore does not matter if

funds  are expended on scholarships provided there  is

provision  in the constitution or in the Articles  and

Memorandum   of   Understanding  for   awarding   such

scholarships.  I  must emphasise that the  scholarship

must have that element of public benefit, must be made

available  to  all  irrespective  of  race,  creed  or

religion  and  should not merely be  confined  to  the

members or their families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head X be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead DEE 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. Minister in his reply to a Question

for  Oral Answer last week said that all HDB dwellings

enjoy a concessionary rate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>



of 23% property tax. This is not correct, Sir. In some

dwellings in St. Michael's and Queenstown estates, the

rate  is  still 36%. Could the Minister enlighten  the

House on this matter?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the Member is correct in saying

that I was wrong when I said that the maximum was  23%

for all HDB owner-occupied properties. The position is

that in those areas which were at 23% before the rates

were  increased, the owner occupiers were  allowed  to

retain  their 23%. That was the maximum for them.  But

in  areas  which have been at 36%, like Stirling  Road

and St. Michael's Road, then there was no question  of

bringing  this  down. They were in an area  which  was

rated  at 36%. All the houses in that area were  rated

at  36%, so they were given the same rate. I think  I

misled  the  hon.  Member. I was  myself  misled  into

thinking that that was the situation: that 23% was the

maximum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, may I make a further

comment?  The reduction in the property tax  rate  was

brought  about some years ago when I brought  up  this

matter  on the need to have a uniform rate of property

tax  for HDB properties. There were at that time other

properties  which attracted the rate of 36%,  and  all

were  subsequently brought down. As we are all  aware,

property tax is based on whether the property is in  a

rural,  urban  or  certain divisions.  This  rate  was

brought  down to 23% irrespective of where the Housing

Board  estates are but, unfortunately, I believe  that

there  may be an oversight on the part of the Property

Tax  Department  in  missing out these  two  areas.  I

wonder  whether the Minister would consider  reviewing

this position once again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir,I think the properties that he

referred  to  were really housing units,  i.e, flats,

whereas  these  are  houses, and  houses  are  treated

differently.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> In view of the Minister's

reply, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head X be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead BAA 8102.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that the provision for "New Projects

and  Under Estimation" has been increased by more than

10  times from $10 million in FY 76 to $105 million in

FY  77.  The  Memorandum on the Main  and  Development

Estimates does not give us any clue as to what the new

projects  are and we must, therefore, ask the Minister

for Finance to give us a breakdown of the $105 million

into  provision  for new projects  and  provision  for

under-estimation for on-going projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding under-estimation for project cost, I would

like to ask a few more questions:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) When funds for projects are under-estimated, is

there  a  re-evaluation of the  cost-benefits  of  the

projects before additional funds are disbursed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Are the reasons for the underestimation

thoroughly  investigated for each and  every  case  of

significant underestimation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In the business world, good estimates are

critical  to  profits. When companies or firms  tender

for  a  contract,  they must stand by  their  tendered

price. Thus, whether they end up with a profit or loss

depends on whether they have correctly estimated their

own  costs in the first place. Part of the problem  in

the  procedure  of  allocating Government  development

funds  is that Ministries and departments do not  have

to   produce   balance   sheets  and   profit-and-loss

statements. Thus, under-estimation, which in  business

normally  results in a loss, is not penalised.  Can  a

system  be  worked out to monitor the  performance  of

departments in estimating the costs of their  projects

with   a  view  to  improving  the  quality  of   such

estimates?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Where departments frequently underestimate, is

any attempt made to investigate and understand the

attitude of the people making the estimates with a

view to establishing a better rapport? In a company.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>



the  financial  controller  or  chief  executive  must

understand  the  ability and  mental  make-up  of  his

staff,  and where cases of non-achievement are  known,

as  in the case of a bad estimate, we must search  for

clues behind the failure to perform. The investigation

into  the  attitude of his managers is often  a  first

task.  I believe the human factor should similarly  be

given due weight in the public service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to make it clear that I am not

criticising  the  Budget Division of the  Ministry  of

Finance  or  the user departments concerned  for  poor

performance  in fund allocation - not in  this  debate

anyway  as  I do not have actual examples  of  callous

under-estimation.  I am just being  academic.  To  me,

under-estimation   is  as  much   a   flaw   as   poor

implementation.  It  suggests a  certain  weakness  in

control. It is a management problem and it would  lead

to  losses in the business sense. If, for example,  we

could  prevent  a loss of $26 million  through  better

estimation and control, we have an additional argument

for income tax reliefs to be increased!



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the provision in subhead BAA

8102  has  been increased because of a change  in  the

procedure   for  submission  of  proposals   for   new

development  projects. Under the  previous  procedure,

proposals  for  new  development projects  had  to  be

submitted  in  time for consideration for  the  annual

Estimates. Owing to the great number of proposals that

were   submitted  for  consideration  and  the   tight

schedule that had to be met to ensure that the  annual

Estimates  were  presented  to  Parliament  in   time,

inevitably only a cursory assessment of the  proposals

could  be  undertaken. For those  that  merit  further

consideration,    the    allocation    was     entered

provisionally in the annual Estimates subject  to  the

approval of the Development Planning Committee. In the

course of the new financial year, the Budget Division,

in  consultation  with the Ministries concerned, then

made a more thorough assessment of these proposals and

appropriate  recommendations  were  put  up   to   the

Development Planning Committee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid the situation whereby projects

involving  Government policy are entered  without  the

proper approval and also to reduce the workload at the

peak  of the Budget period as well as to allow a  more

thorough  assessment of development proposals,  a  new

procedure  has been introduced. Henceforth, Ministries

will submit proposals for new development projects  at

any  time  during the financial year. Such development

projects will then be processed in the normal way  and

because  the rush of preparing the Budget is  avoided,

more accurate estimates can be obtained. The vote has,

therefore,  been increased as funds for  new  projects

are  no longer provided under each Ministry's head  of

expenditure.  Projects  approved  in  the  course   of

financial year 1977 will, therefore, be met from  this

vote  in  the  first  instance and  in  the  following

financial year the approved projects will be shown  in

the  annual Estimates under the appropriate Ministry's

head   of   expenditure.  New  development   proposals

received  before  the  Budget exercise  totalled  $147

million and therefore the provision for this vote  has

been increased by about $100 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the questions which the Member asked,

I am not quite sure whether I have got them correctly.

But  in  the case of under-estimation. I think  a  new

cost-benefit  analysis, if this is necessary, can  be

done  and  is  done before it goes in the  form  of  a

recommendation  to the Development Planning  Committee

for approval of the additional allocation of funds. Of

course,  it is very desirable if one can keep  to  the

prices  which are originally estimated,  but  this  is

very often impossible because certain factors have not

been  taken  into account. For example, if  the  load-bearing   qualities  of  the  soil   are   not   known

beforehand,  there is no way in which we  can  prevent

estimates for piling to be increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to getting a better rapport with departments that

under-estimate.  I hope this will be achieved  by  our

new Budget procedures where we will have a performance-oriented  budget. People in Ministries  will  have  to

explain   why  they  have  over-estimated  or   under-estimated, and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>



failure  or lack of performance will bring its penalty

in  the  appropriations in the  following  year  which

would be in accordance with the performance.

Secondly,  how many units of flats have been completed

in Boon Lay Garden and how many are vacant and for how

long,  and why are they vacant? Thirdly, I would  like

the  Minister to tell us whether action will be  taken

to   improve   the  facilities  in  Boon  Lay   Garden

especially with regard to the lifts. Fourthly, is  the

Minister  aware that the hawker inspectors  there  are

very fierce and unreasonable in their attitude towards

the  hawkers  in Boon Lay Garden? I hope the  Minister

this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  because of time factor  I  would  like

briefly to ask my questions. Firstly, whether the  JTC

intends  to build five-room low cost flats  in  Jurong

Constituency.  Secondly, whether the  JTC  intends  to

publish  for  its  flat-residents a  free  publication

similar  to the magazine. Our Home, published  by  the

HDB;  Thirdly, whether  the JTC  has  been  regularly

cleaning  up  the  water tanks in the  Jurong  housing

estate  because  of the high content of  salt  in  the

water  which  is  corrosive to  the  tanks;  Fourthly,

whether  the JTC is whitewashing the flats  in  Jurong

Town  once every five years; Fifthly, whether priority

will   be   given  to  those  who  are   affected   by

resettlement in the allocation of vacant shop premises

in old housing estates?

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Son:</b> Sir, in answer to the Member for

Boon  Lay, the Jurong Town Corporation's objective  in

constructing  low-cost flats is  to  provide  adequate

accommodation  for  workers to attract  the  necessary

labour to meet the requirements of industry in Jurong.

Thus  the Jurong Town Corporation restricted the  sale

and  rental of its flats to people working  in  Jurong

only.  As  a result of the recent recession,  however.

the  demand for industrial land in Jurong dropped  and

this also led to a drop in demand for housing. The JTC

has,  therefore, offered 730 units of three-room flats

in  Boon  Lay Garden to the Housing Board for sale  to

those on its waiting list for the Telok Blangah. Bukit

Timah   and   the  Rural  West  zones.  In   addition,

recognising   the  increased  personal   mobility   of

workers, the JTC has opened applications for its flats

to  those  working around Jurong, that is, within  the

area  bounded by Choa Chu Kang Road. Bukit Timah  Road

and Clementi Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clogged drains and untidy open spaces were caused by

debris  from  renovation works  carried  out  by  flat

owners  and unsatisfactory performance by the previous

conservancy contractors. Most of the renovation  works

have  now been completed. The unsatisfactory condition

of  lifts in certain flats was due to poor maintenance

services  by  one  of  the  lift  companies.  However.

maintenance  services have improved and the  frequency

of breakdowns reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Member for Jurong, the Corporation

has  no immediate plans to build more five-room  flats

in  Jurong  Town  as  there are now  sufficient  flats

available, including those under construction, to meet

the  demand for the immediate future. Secondly, it may

be uneconomical as well as a duplication of effort for

the  JTC to produce another publication similar to the

Housing Board publication of Our Home. However,  as  a

service to its tenants and lessees, the Corporation is

negotiating  with  the Housing  Board  for  the  joint

production  of the magazine, Our Home. As negotiations

are  in  their final stages, the distribution  of  the

joint



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>



magazine to the residents in Jurong Town may be

expected in the near future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, a programme was drawn up late last year for

more  regular  cleansing of water  tanks.  Under  this

programme water tanks are flushed every six months and

repainted   every  five  years.  Whenever   necessary,

flushing or repainting may be carried out earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, there is a regular programme for

repainting  of  flats every five years. In  accordance

with  the programme. 18 blocks of flats were repainted

in  1975 and 17 blocks of flats in 1976. This year  16

blocks are scheduled for repainting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, resettlement cases are already being

accorded  priority in the allocation  of  shop  houses

that fall vacant. Tendering of shops is done only when

there  is no demand by resettlers or when resettlement

cases  wish  to  use the shops for  trade  or  service

already adequately provided in the area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Anti-Pollution Unit was

set up a few years ago because of the danger which  we

would  face  if initial action had not been  taken  to

check  the various polluting agents that were  growing

in  our  midst. This unit is doing its best to control

and overcome the various problems of pollution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it has been stated recently that air

pollution  in  our  country is on  the  increase.  The

presence of smog has been found in some parts  of  the

island.  This  could  be due to pollution  created  by

smoke from the numerous industries scattered all  over

our   island,  power  stations, vehicles  and   other

polluting agents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe this Unit has set certain guidelines to

industries to eradicate pollution. It is noticed  that

a  number of industries have been reluctant to  comply

with  anti-pollution measures. Why is this so? Perhaps

a study could be made to find out why these industries

are violating the regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps should be taken now to rectify the problem,

otherwise  it would endanger the health of our  people

in  later years, when remedial action may be too  late

or expensive.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, I am replying on behalf  of  the  Prime

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1971 the Anti-Pollution Unit has been

monitoring  the air for various pollutants  which  may

have  direct or indirect effects on health. While  the

smoke  level has decreased, other pollutants  such  as

sulphur dioxide have increased. This is mainly due  to

the   increase  in  the  consumption  of  oil  by  our

industries, power stations and motor vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some factories have refused to comply or have been

reluctant to comply because it increases their  costs.

Because of the bad period in the past year we have not

been  rather strict in enforcement, but in the  future

we will have to take stricter measures.

`The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs

Ivan Baptist and Ahmad Haleem.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1401</b></font><br><br>



Sometimes, of course, air pollution is caused by  poor

maintenance  and operation of plant and equipment.  In

order  not  to affect the viability of some  of  these

industries, adequate time has been allowed  to  comply

with  anti-pollution  measures.  But  Members  may  be

interested  to  know that in 1976, the Unit  inspected

over  900 factories to ensure that preventive as  well

as  palliative  measures are  taken  to  minimise  the

pollution of the air. Tests were also carried  out  in

various  factories to check on dust and acid emissions

to  ensure  that  they  do not  exceed  the  specified

limits.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may be interested to know that the Unit

has recently acquired more sophisticated equipment and

has been able to detect the presence of ozone which is

the  main  constituent  of  photochemical  oxidant  or

sometimes  called  photochemical  smog.  Photochemical

oxidants  are  detected on some hot  days  during  the

afternoon  and  are  formed  by  the  interaction   of

pollutants such as hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen

which  are emitted by motor vehicles, factories, power

stations and all combustion processes. The reaction in

the atmosphere is very complex and it also depends  on

the  condition of the atmosphere such as  temperature,

relative humidity, wind and the relative concentration

of  the pollutants. This oxidant disappears as the sun

goes down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said, the Unit is at present studying

the  position  in  detail and  may  introduce  control

measures  to  reduce  the  emission  of  some  of  the

pollutants  such  as hydrocarbons  which  I  mentioned

before were the precursors to photochemical smog.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, I am befuddled with the way

the   Minister  has  handled  this  matter.   He   has

anticipated quite a number of my questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, water pollution is also another problem that

has  to  be  tackled with redoubled effort. The  Prime

Minister spoke of the possibility of having fishing in

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1402</b></font><br><br>



Singapore and Kallang Rivers in 10 years' time when he

declared  open the $55 million Upper Peirce  Reservoir

on the 27th February this year. Targets must be set to

ensure  a successful programme for unpolluted air  and

water in Singapore. I am sure the House would like  to

be  enlightened on the targets that the Anti-Pollution

Unit  has set itself and the programmes it has in mind

to achieve its targets. What bothers me is haw targets

are  to  be  met  when one compares in  the  Main  and

Development Estimates FY 76 and FY 77 that staff  have

been  reduced by 5.4% and EOM and OOE increased  by  a

mere 6% and 3% respectively. In addition, there is  no

provision in the Development Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, I am not

speaking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Anti-Pollution Unit has

objectives. It has got no targets. The target  in  one

respect  has been fixed by the Prime Minister who  has

asked  to clean up the Singapore River and the Kallang

River and set the target date of 10 years within which

he  wants  to  see fish swimming in these two  rivers.

That settles the water question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for air, again we do not have any targets. The

air  is  not so bad that we have got to clean  it  up,

say, within five or 10 years. The objective is to keep

the  air  we breathe as clean as it is today  or  even

cleaner.  With  the  introduction of  industries  into

Singapore,   the  air  is  being  polluted   by   many

industries  and the work of the Unit is  to  see  that

this  pollution in the air does not become so bad that

you and I cannot safely breathe the air.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Clean Air Act and the Water Pollution and

Drainage  Act set out the requirements on the emission

of  pollutants and effluent discharges from  premises.

Our  basic  approach to the solution of air and  water

pollution  problems  is to deal with  them  at  source

through  preventive and palliative measures.  This  is

complemented  by  public  education  on  the  need  to

control  and minimise environmental pollution  and  by

enforcement action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New industries are carefully screened to ensure that

they are not too polluting and are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1403</b></font><br><br>



carefully   located   in  industrial   areas   without

adversely affecting residential estates. Both new  and

existing  industries  are required  to  install  anti-pollution  equipment, improve on  their  house-keeping

and  operation in order to reduce air pollution.  They

are  also required to use the best practical means  to

control noxious emissions from their factories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On water pollution, the Ministry of the Environment

has  a section in the Sewerage Department to deal with

this problem. For some years now it has embarked on  a

programme   to   prevent  and  control  discharge   of

wastewater  into  the  open  drains  and  canals  from

domestic, trade and industrial premises  as  well  as

from farms. This section also advises house-owners how

to  divert  wastewater  from  their  premises  to  the

sewers,  and the industries on how to deal with  trade

effluent. This keeps the Chairman of the PUB happy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most effective method of controlling water

pollution is the extension of sewerage to all premises

and to ensure that wastewater goes into sewers and not

into open drains.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to use the word "target", the target is to

sewer the whole island finally. But it is not an  easy

process  nor  is it an easy process to  clean  up  the

Kallang and Singapore Rivers. However, the Member  can

rest  assured that a plan is being worked out to  meet

this  target set by the Prime Minister. Many  run-down

areas in the older parts of the city would have to  be

redeveloped. Open markets and street hawkers  must  be

cleared  and resited to proper premises where sewerage

and other sanitary facilities are available. Only then

can refuse be systematically collected and disposed of

and wastewater properly channelled into the sewers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member will agree that though the

Government   can  provide  sanitary  facilities,   the

ultimate  success  in  our  clean-up  programme  would

depend  on  the  cooperation of every  member  of  the

public.  No  litter  should be  thrown  or  wastewater

discharged indiscriminately into our open



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1404</b></font><br><br>



drains.  Only then can our canals and rivers  be  free

from pollution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the employment position, the Member has

quoted  some  figures. I am afraid I do not  have  the

answers to those figures. All I can assure the  Member

is  that there has been no reduction in staff in  this

Unit. There are a few vacancies but the positions  are

still  there. The Unit itself is doing more  and  more

work  and  will be increasing the scope and nature  of

its activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, election comes once every five years or

thereabouts.  Is  it because of this infrequency  that

the  Elections Office bungles? Take the mass  rush  to

community  centres  to check the  electoral  registers

last year. Potential voters had to wait for hours  and

sometimes in the rain as there was little room in  the

community  centres  to cater for such  large  numbers.

Most certainly there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>



could be better planning, or could not a better system

be  devised? In addition to this, many who were listed

in  the  electoral registers did not  receive  polling

cards  and  others  who voted in 1972  were  left  out

completely  in the 1976 electoral registers, although

they voted in 1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you. Sir, further illustrations of the

haphazard  situation that must exist in the  Elections

Office.   Husbands  were  sent  to  different  polling

stations  and  even different constituencies  to  vote

although  they  lived in the constituency  with  their

spouses  for goodness knows how many years.  Why  this

attempt  to  separate  husbands and  wives?  Why  this

inconvenience? It is a well-known and established fact

that  it  is cheaper and more convenient for  both  to

accompany  each other to the same polling  station  in

the  correct constituency, the constituency they  have

established house in and established relationship with

their MPs. I have definite instances. Take Mr Fok  Yew

Woon,  for  instance. He lives in  Potong  Pasir.  14H

Upper Serangoon Road. He was asked to vote in Aljunied

I, Playfair Road School. Burn Road. His wife living in

the  same  house  was  sent to  Upper  Serangoon  III,

Charlton   School.  Aroozoo  Avenue  -  both   rightly

constituents of Potong Pasir, mind you. Sir.  Mr  Sawa

Khan  R, of  127E Upper Serangoon Road  was  sent  to

Potong  Pasir II, Kwong Avenue School, Sennett Estate,

and  this is correct. But his poor wife, Madam Sathewa

binte Abdullah also of 1 27E Upper Serangoon Road  was

sent  many  kilometres  away to Upper  Serangoon  Ill,

Charlton School. Aroozoo Avenue. I could go on and on.

Sir,  but  I know your time and that of the  House  is

most precious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is the great inconvenience to elderly

participate in the polls, have to climb up the  stairs

to   the  first  floor  to  cast  their  votes.   Most

certainly. Sir, suitable ground floor premises can  be

obtained or some other methods of voting,

<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Chong Tee:</b> In the last elections it appeared that the Presiding Officers in charge of polling

stations  did  not execute their duties  strictly  and

effectively,   as  was  expected  of   them.   In   my

constituency  open  canvassing  went  on  in   polling

stations,  with  or  without  the  knowledge  of   the

Presiding  Officers.  In one instance,  the  Presiding

Officer  in  charge was aware of the  open  canvassing

that went on in his polling station, but no action was

taken   against  the  culprit  concerned.  In  another

instance, the Presiding Officer was not only not aware

of  the  open  canvassing that went on in the  polling

station  under  his charge but had  mistaken  the  two

canvassers to be his assistants. As I did not want  to

be  too harsh with the two incidents I encountered  at

these two polling stations. I brought only one case to

the  attention  of  the police who  subsequently  took

action  against the culprit. The culprit was  recently

fined  $300  for  illegally  carrying  out  canvassing

activities  within 200 metres of a polling station  on

polling day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these two incidents that I had highlighted, it

appeared   that  the  Presiding  Officers   were   not

sufficiently alert in enforcing the rules strictly and

effectively to prevent such incidents from  happening.

I  am  sure  that the same incidents also occurred  in

polling  stations  in  other  constituencies  on  23rd

December,  1  976. I wonder what steps  the  Elections

that. As for the future, what can we do? If canvassing

takes  place, as prohibited, then it is  his  duty  to

report  it to the Presiding Officer or to the  police.

and  leave  it to them. This happens in all elections.

People get excited and sometimes they do worse things,

at  least in this country no one has died as a  result

of an election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Potong Pasir, perhaps I could

point  out to him that cases of persons having  to  go

and  vote  in  another constituency  or  of  names  of

persons  not on the register need not arise  if  these

people  had  gone to check the registers  of  electors

when  they were exhibited. The errors in the registers

could  have been rectified then. As the Member himself

has   pointed  out.  "there  was  not  enough   time",

"standing in the rain" and "there is no place  in  the

community  centre",  but as  far  as  I  remember  the

position was this. The registers were exhibited over a

period  of time. People could not be bothered to  find

out  whether their names were there. Then some  bright

spark  started a rumour in Singapore, a rumour to  the

effect  that if you did not vote, then not only  would

you  not have the chance to vote, but cancellation  or

absence of your name from the register of voters would

have   disastrous  results  like  the  loss  of   your

citizenship,  followed by loss of your  Housing  Board

flat, and  followed by lots of other privileges  that

Singapore  citizens have. As a result of this  rumour,

and  rumour spreads very quickly in Singapore, all the

community  centres were jammed with worried  Singapore

citizens.  That  was the position.  They  checked  too

late. As a result the Government had to come out  with

an  announcement that none of these evils would befall

anybody  if his name was not on the register.  All  it

meant was that he could not vote. He could always have

his  name restored in the register if he has  a  valid

excuse for non-voting or pay a sum of $5.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has given the names and addresses of some

of his constituents.

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> It is not possible for me to give an

answer  to his questions as to why they were left  out

or why they had to vote in another constituency unless

the circumstances of their cases are looked into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I should tell Members how the registers of

electors are compiled from the records of the National

Registration Office. Changes of address can be made at

community  centres, the office of the Commissioner  of

National Registration or the Central Manpower Base for

national  servicemen and SAF personnel.  To  effect  a

change  of  address, a form is completed on behalf  of

the  applicant.  At  this stage  possible  errors  can

occur.  It  is  quite  simple. Change  of  address  is

written  as  1411. By an error it goes down  as  1411.

Instead  of  being  in that part of Bukit  Timah  near

Woodlands,  you  end up somewhere near Newton  Circus.

This is only just an example. These mistakes have been

made. There may be a translation error. Au Kang  5  ms

could be either Yio Chu Kang or Upper Serangoon Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These change of address forms at the community

centres  are  then posted to the National Registration

Office. The completed forms are then despatched by the

National   Registration  Office   to   the   Elections

Department for coding. They are then posted.  Some  of

them do not even arrive and hence the husband could be

voting at one place and the wife at another. The coded

data  are  fed  into  the  computer  at  the  Computer

Services   Department  to  update  the  registers   of

electors.  Even in the process of coding and  punching

the  data into the computer, errors of misleading  the

figures could arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many permutations and combinations of

errors  which I need not go into, but perhaps I  could

sum  up  by urging Members of this House that if  they

are aware of such cases they should advise the persons

concerned  to  have  the errors in  the  registers  of

electors  rectified. This can be done  either  at  the

Elections  Department  or at the  next  exhibition  of

registers of electors. I do not know when, and  unless

there  is  a  by-election in Potong Pasir  (Laughter],

they will have to wait five years.

observation.  I  do not quite agree with  the  example

given  by  the  Minister. I agree with him  that  1411

could  become 1411. But if it is 1411 Woodlands Drive.

for  example,  the  worst that could  happen  is  1411

becoming  1411 Woodlands Drive, the "Woodlands  Drive"

would not be affected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Perhaps my example is not the best. Let

me  give  the  Member another one. The number  is  14L

part of the "L" is merged with the bottom line. So  it

is  no  longer 14L. It becomes 141. So instead of  14L

Bukit  Timah  Road, it could be 141 Bukit Timah  Road.

The  result could be that the person with that address

could either be voting in Cairnhill, or Tanglin or Ulu

Pandan. If you take it further, Bukit Timah. Or if the

figure  gets bigger, to 1400, he ends up in  Woodlands

or  Bukit Panjang. But this is just an example.  These

errors  do  happen. I use the letter "I" but  you  can

have  it either way. If the letter "L", it depends  on

which part of the "L" is merged with which part of the

line.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, I did raise another point; the

possibility of introducing, say, postal balloting  for

the old and the feeble.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Perhaps postal balloting for the old and

the feeble who live in Singapore is practical. We were

even  at  this stage thinking of postal balloting  not

only for those in Singapore but for those outside. But

it  could lead to practical problems because we cannot

send  the  ballot  papers out until  we  know  who  is

standing in Potong Pasir, whether it is Mr Baptist  or

his  rival. It is no use having a nomination form  and

just  putting a PAP candidate. So those ballot  papers

cannot go out to the constituents until Nomination Day

and  the  papers  have been printed in the  Government

Printing Office. That having been done, perhaps two or

three days later they are posted out. If the address



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>



is  in Singapore it is all right. If the address is in

New  Zealand or Timbuctoo, by the time the  nomination

paper  reaches the Singapore citizen, elections  would

have   been   over, if  we  confine   our   elections

campaigning to nine or 10 days. In 1968 we had it  for

two  months. If there is a reasonable period, say, two

or   three  months,  then  our  constituents   outside

Singapore will be able to receive their ballot  papers

and post them back in time.

about  it.  But  I do remember old and feeble  persons

being  carried into voting stations by religious  nuns

who  were  there to see that these old people exercise

their right to vote. The Member has a point and  I  am

sure  whoever is in charge of the polling station will

bear this in mind so that in future the voter does not

have  to climb one storey or perhaps even two or three

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the last few years the rates for public

utilities have been revised. This could not be avoided

because  of  the increased cost of production.  Whilst

accepting the reasons for the increased charges, it is

also observed that the PUB has, replaced new meters in

certain homes and places. The reason for changing  the

meters  is  that  they  are not functioning  properly.

However, these new meters have produced heavy bills to

the  consumers. I understand that in every  new  meter

for  electricity an extra 1% is turned on in  the  set

prior  to  installation. Why must  this  extra  1%  be

charged to the consumers whose old meters were removed

by the PUB? Even the gas meters have resulted in heavy

bills. These increases are due to the installation  of

new  meters. Sir, the question is, if old  meters  are

not   functioning  properly,  why   not   repair   and

recondition them, instead of replacing them  with  new

ones?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the PUB gas is frequently used in homes,

there  is a tendency of the gas leaking from  the  gas

pipe  though  the appliance is not in use.  This  leak

will  increase the gas consumption. Could the PUB  not

think  of  a system whereby the gas will not seep  off

when it is not in use?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a speculation that the authorities are

considering the use of only piped gas supplied by  the

PUB  for  cooking  appliances.  This  is  because   of

accidents  or dangers posed by gas supplied  by  other

means. Could a clarification on this be given?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is noted that after a major power failure on

last   Deepavali  Eve,  there  were  scattered   power

breakdowns  in certain areas of the island  every  now

and then. Why is this so? Is it because the faults  of

that  major  power  failure  have  not  been  properly

rectified?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, when the rates of public utilities are

being  reviewed,  I  suggest  that  if  there  is  any

surcharge  on  the new bills, it should not  apply  to

appliances hired from the PUB,



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, it is with considerable interest

that I note the reply to the Oral Question raised by

the Member for Jurong in regard to the salt content of

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>



water  supply  in  Jurong. The Hon.  Minister  on  3rd

September, 1976 replied and I quote: [Hansard, Vol. 35, No. 12, col. 1008]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The water supplied from the Choa Chu Kang Water

Treatment Works is well within the WHO Drinking  Water

Standards and is perfectly safe for potable use."



<br><br>Then  again the Minister for National Development  and

Communications in a speech on the 27th February, 1977

at  the opening of Upper Peirce Reservoir hastened  to

reassure consumers, when he referred to the PUB  being

inundated with complaints about the strange  taste  of

the water from the Pandan Reservoir, that (I quote):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"its quality is well within the WHO requirements for

drinking water."



<br><br>He  went  on  in his speech to, once again, reiterate

that (I quote):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The water is potable and fit for domestic use as it

is within the requirements of WHO. We should therefore

be  prepared  to accept the different  tastes  of  our

water in the future."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that many of us do not know what the WHO

Standard  is.  The WHO Standard. I believe,  does  not

only  speak about a maximum chloride content in  parts

per  million or the total dissolved solids content  in

parts  per million, I believe the WHO must  go  on  to

speak about many other requirements and the methods to

determine  the  bacterial,  biological  and   chemical

purity  of  drinking  water.  I  believe  it  is   not

necessary for water to be only safe to drink but  also

reasonably  attractive to drink. It  should  be  cool.

clear, colourless and free from disagreeable odour and

taste, apart from being free from organisms and faecal

pollution   and   a   control  of  pesticide   levels.

radiological activity and so on and so forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precisely this. I believe, was a matter that was

brought up by the Member for Jurong and there are many

people  who  have  complained to  the  PUB  about  the

strange taste of the water. So while not doubting that

the water supply to the people in Singapore in certain

areas,  especially  that from  the  Pandan  Reservoir,

comes within the WHO Standard, it appears strange that

so many people have complained about the strange taste

of the water. It would be most



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>



informative  if  the  Minister could  tell  the  House

whether  the  WHO Standard does cover this  matter  of

taste  and how did the PUB determine, if such a  taste

criteria were required by WHO, that the water from the

Pandan  Reservoir serving the people, in actual  fact,

comes to within the WHO Standard.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> In my speech during the debate on

the  Presidential Address, I mentioned daylight saving

as  a means of power conservation, and I would like to

elaborate  on  this  and perhaps give  the  historical

background to daylight saving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1784 Benjamin Franklin first proposed daylight

saving  but it was only in 1 907 that William  Willet

wrote  a  small  pamphlet called Waste  of  Daylight. Subsequently, in 1908 Robert Pearce put it up in  the British  Parliament but it failed. In  1915,  Germany

became  the  first country in the world to  introduce

daylight   saving  and  this  was   a   measure   for

conservation of fuel and coal. This was  followed  in 1916  by  Great Britain, 1917 by USA and all  through

the periods between the two world wars -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, on a point of order, I

do not see the relevance in this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I suppose the relevance is that it

would  be a saving of energy, and the Public Utilities

Board also generates electricity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> But, Sir, the Member has not come

to it yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, I will be coming to it. The

reason  for the historical background is to point  out

that,  in all these periods where daylight saving  had

been  introduced, it had proved to  be  able  to  save

power.  During  the Second World War, daylight  saving

was  again adopted for the purpose of conserving  fuel

and coal, After the war, many countries continued with

daylight  saving  for  the same  purpose,  mainly  the

European countries. China and many other countries  in

the  tropics followed, including Ghana, Sarawak, North

Korea, Malaysia, and also Singapore. We do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>



have half an hour daylight saving currently in force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members are not aware of this, let me explain.

The  manner in which time zones are calculated is that

every  1  5o  Longitude equals one hour. Singapore  is

103o East Longitude.

and  so  we  should be seven hours ahead of  Greenwich

Mean  Time (GMT). If Members check up, they will  find

that  we  are instead 7? hours ahead of GMT. Singapore

is,  therefore, currently saving daylight by  half  an

hour.  This was introduced just after the Second World

War.  Again  in  1968  the United  Kingdom  introduced

daylight  saving for the whole year round.  But  after

the  Yomkipur  War,  as a way of saving  fuel  in  the

United  States, in 1974 daylight saving was introduced

all  year round for the whole nation as an experiment.

This stopped in 1975.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I am saying is that daylight saving is nothing

new  to Singapore. We have had daylight saving. We are

still  saving daylight presently. I would like to  ask

if  the  Hon.  Minister for National  Development  and

Communications would investigate and consider  further

daylight  saving if it could usefully  conserve  fuel.

Many members of the public have been complaining about

the  PUB  charges.  Maybe  with  the  introduction  of

daylight  saving,  we could save some  money  for  the

public and also foreign exchange for Singapore in  the

costs of the fuel that we import.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon is not here. Mr

Teong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have only

two simple questions to ask the Minister. The first is

that I have received many complaints from the electors

concerning  the  high increase in PUB charges.  In  my

constituency, a consumer has his PUB bill increased by

nearly  100%  in three years. That is  to  say,  three

years ago his PUB bill was about $100. Nowadays, it is

about $200. I would like the Minister to clarify  this

point.  Is  it possible to increase the rate  100%  in

three  years when his rate of consumption remains  the

same?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question concerns the fixing of water

meters  in  hawker centres. At present, there  is  one

meter for every four hawkers. Some hawkers complain to

me that this is very inconvenient, because some stalls

use  more water and some use less but they have to pay

a  pro  rata rate. Therefore, I would like to ask  the

Minister  to  consider the feasibility of  fixing  one

meter for each hawker stall. The Minister concerned is

the  Minister for National Development and he is  also

the Chairman of the Public Utilities Board. Therefore,

he  should fully understand the problems of both sides

and be able to compromise. I hope he will give serious

consideration to this question.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development and Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development and Communications (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I  shall take the last speaker first. The Member

for  Sembawang has complained again about increase  in

PUB  water  charges. The water rate,  of  course,  has

increased.  I do not know whether or not  he  realises

that  costs  have increased and, as I have  repeatedly

said,  we  are  going into unconventional  sources  of

water  supply. Water is more polluted and,  therefore,

the cost of treatment is high. Moreover, to discourage

wastage of water, water rates are now calculated on  a

block basis. Every family is given a basic block of 25

cubic metres. (I am not too sure of this figure). That

is  the first block to which every family is entitled,

and   it  is  charged  at  a  certain  rate.  If   the

consumption  goes  beyond the first  block,  the  rate

increases  and  if  it  still  goes  beyond  that, it

increases   still  further.  Therefore, though   the

consumption of water, in the case he has referred  to,

remains the same, the consumer has to pay more because

of  increasing charges and perhaps also because of the

block rates. There is no over-charge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the question of the hawkers wanting a meter

each.  I  think  we  have more  than  half  a  million

accounts  at  the  moment.  Hon.  Members  have   been

complaining about mistakes made in reading  meters  by

meter  readers. In the case of hawkers, we  are  going

out of our way to supply one meter for every



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>



four hawkers. I think for their convenience surely the

four  hawkers  can come to some sort of  an  agreement

among  themselves to share PUB charges. Only when  and

if  hawkers  and members of the public  can  read  the

meters  themselves,  and when we have  enough  meters.

will the position be reconsidered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very indebted to the hon. Member for the short

history of daylight saving. His suggestion is that  if

we  further advance the clock in Singapore we may save

on  fuel.  The maximum difference in time in Singapore

throughout  the  year is 45 minutes, We  have  already

advanced  the  clock by half an hour.  If  we  further

advance the clock, I am afraid that instead of  saving

money on fuel we may have to spend more money on  fuel

because  people  will have to wake up earlier  in  the

morning when it is still dark to prepare breakfast for

their  children  going  to school.  I  think  we  have

achieved  the maximum in daylight saving by  advancing

the  clock by half an hour. Daylight saving  has  been

most  useful in countries which have seasonal  changes

and  where  the difference in time between winter  and

summer is quite wide. For his information, let me  say

that  we have already considered the position  and  we

think  that  half an hour is the maximum that  we  can

achieve  without adversely disrupting the economy  and

social habits and customs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad that the Member for Potong Pasir has

given  me the chance to further elaborate on  what  is

meant by WHO drinking water standard. The WHO drinking

water  standards which I have mentioned in this  House

as  well as in my address at the opening of the  Upper

Peirce  Reservoir recently, are parameters recommended

by  the  World Health Organisation in its publication,

"International  Standards  for  Drinking   Water."   I

believe that by his very eloquent description  of  how

drinking  water should look and taste, he can probably

add   greatly   to  the  publication,   However, the

parameters  mentioned by the World Health Organisation

are  purely  technical  and they  relate  to  chemical

substances in drinking water for domestic use. Besides

salinity, colour and organic contents of water, they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>



also mention the limits for other chemical substances,

such  as  calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese

and  sulphate.  I suppose that if these  comprise  the

minimum  content  of water, it would  have  a  certain

taste.  If this is exceeded, of course, the  water  is

unpalatable. There is also a recommended limit for  ph

value of water as well as its hardness. The quality of

treated water from the Kranji and Pandan reservoirs is

well within this limit. If the Member for Potong Pasir

is really interested, I can give him a copy of the WHO

recommended limits of chemical substances in  drinking

water for domestic use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to my very good friend, the Member for

Anson. I should first speak on the subject which I had

occasion to refer to previously. I have here a copy of

a  PUB  bill which I believe everyone must have  seen.

This  is  a  PUB  bill [indicating].  I  believe  most

Members  must  have handled it at one time  or  other,

except  those who are fortunate enough to  have  their

bills paid by someone else. I think Members must  have

had  a  look at the bill closely, otherwise they would

not  have  complained  of an  increase  in  the  water

charges or that there has been a mistake. If they were

to  look carefully at the bill, they will see an  item

"Government  tax  on  $90.12."  I  have  already   had

occasion to explain that this is not a surcharge. This

is a Government tax on PUB bills, including rentals on

gas  or  other  appliances. Much as I  would  like  to

debate on this Government tax with the hon. Member.  I

cannot do so because I believe the prerogative belongs

to my colleague, the Minister for Finance who has said

in  this  House that, in conjunction with the increase

in  oil  prices, there would be a review of this  tax.

Members  should remember that this is not a surcharge.

This  is  a  Government tax: The Member can bring  the

matter up with the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His complaint was that bills have been heavy. Well.

if  he  uses more, he pays more. That is a  fact.  The

hon. Member is right when he says that new electricity

meters  are calibrated 1% higher. The reason is  this.

We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1418</b></font><br><br>



know  that  meters  are clock-work machines  and  with

continuous  use  they deteriorate  and  would  not  be

accurate. And unfortunately for public utility bodies,

as  meters  deteriorate, they tend to  under-register.

Electricity meters tend to under-register by  as  much

as  3%.  Therefore, in the long run  this  is  to  the

advantage  of  the  consumer.  So  for  a  start, the

electricity meter is calibrated 1% higher. This is the

practice  of  most utility bodies. Electricity  meters

are  not changed until ten years later. So it is  with

water  and gas meters. As they deteriorate, we  change

them. Either we recondition the meters, if they can be

reconditioned, or we change them for new  meters.  Gas

and water meters are changed on the average every four

to six years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding gas leakage, normally there is no gas

leakage  if the appliance is closed tightly. If  there

is  leakage, you  can  smell it,  and  when  you  do.

telephone  the  PUB immediately. They  will  come  and

repair the appliance. In this way, you would not waste

money  through gas leakage. Regarding the  restriction

in  the  use of gas, the PUB does not want a monopoly.

In  fact, it welcomes the use of liquid petroleum gas.

However, its  use is restricted in food  centres  for

reason of safety. Hawker centres tend to attract crowd

and accidents can happen with such gas containers, and

if  the  containers  of  liquid petroleum  gas  should

explode, it could cause a lot of damage and injury. It

is for safety reasons that the use of liquid petroleum

gas  is  not  allowed  in hawker centres.  It  is  not

because the PUB wants to monopolise the business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for power failures, I have here art article

entitled "The Great Blackout of 1960". In 1976 at 5.50

p.m. the  lights began to flicker in Salt Lake  City.

Then,  quite  a large part of America was affected.  A

committee  to look into it was formed and  the  report

has  just come to hand. The conclusion of this  report

is  that  "you  can do everything but  you  can  never

eliminate  blackout". We have done everything  we  can

here.  We cannot eliminate blackout. But the blackouts

that we have from time to time are minor ones. A major

one occurred on Deepavali eve.
