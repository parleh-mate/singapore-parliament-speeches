<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to present a  Report  of  the

Commission   of   Inquiry   into   the    Financial

Transactions of the De-registered Singapore General

Employees'  Union,  the Singapore  Business  Houses

Employees'  Union  and the Singapore  Bus  Workers'

Union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.   Members   will  recollect  that   on   11th

December,  1963, I made a statement in  this  House

concerning  the  setting  up  of  a  Commission  of

Inquiry to inquire into the mismanagement of  union

funds  by  the  pro-Communist leaders  of  the

de-registered unions. I mentioned then that while

de-registration proceedings were pending against them,

the  leaders  of  these three  unions  were  making

desperate  plans to withdraw large  sums  of  money

from  the  unions'  bank accounts  to  finance  the

Communist united front campaign against merger  and

Malaysia.  I also recounted to the House how  these

unions  took  advantage of loopholes in  the  trade

union  laws  to  sabotage  measures  taken  by  the

Government  to  protect trade union  funds  in  the

interests  of  the workers. With the assistance  of

their legal adviser, Mr T. T Rajah, they contrived

and succeeded in withdrawing $30,000 from banks  in

the second week of October 1963. When the Registrar

of Trade Unions tried to ascertain whether this sum

of money was properly and legally utilised, the

pro-communist union leaders deliberately obstructed his

inquiry.  Even police investigations were  hampered

because  of  the sudden disappearance of  the  then

General-Secretary   of   the   Singapore    General

Employees' Union. These incidents caused concern to

the public in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



general  and  the workers in particular.  Naturally

they  had  good  reasons to be disturbed.  The

so-called  leaders  of the pro-Communist  unions  have

been  claiming all these years that they  were  the

genuine  champions of the workers and had dedicated

their  lives  to  the  cause  of  the  trade  union

movement.  But  what some of the  workers  did  not

know,  because  they were really misled,  was  that

these bogus leaders were dedicated only to the

anti-national  cause  of their political  masters.  They

were   not  really  interested  in  promoting   the

industrial  interest of the workers but  just  made

use  of  the workers as political pawns to  achieve

their anti-national objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public and the workers have a right to know

the  actual  state  of financial affairs  in  these

unions.  It is the duty of the Government  to  keep

our  citizens informed of the true facts concerning

any matters of public interest. It was against this

background that a one-man Commission of Inquiry was

set  up  under the Inquiry Commission Ordinance  by

His  Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara on  21st

December, 1963. Mr Tan Wee Kian, an officer of the

Legal Service, was appointed the Commissioner.  The

Commissioner  has now completed his work.  In  all,

there  were  38  sittings of  the  Commission.  116

witnesses were examined, and 324 exhibits submitted

to the Commission. The report of the Commission was

submitted by the Commissioner to His Excellency  on

31st  July,  1965. I now present  a  copy  of  this

Report for the information of Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the Commission reveals a shocking

state  of  affairs  in  these  three  de-registered

unions. Their officials have been found wanting and

have not discharged the responsibilities imposed on

them  by  union  rules.  This  group  of  political

activists  in the disguise of trade unionists  were

found to have displayed a flagrant disregard of the

statutory provisions governing the custody of trade

union  funds. The unions' system of accounting  was

such  that it provided ample opportunities for  the

manipulation  of financial transactions.  Even  the

unions' legal adviser, the self-styled spokesman of

the workers, Mr T. T.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



Rajah,   was   found  to  be   a   party   to   the

irregularities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Report, in the transaction for

the purchase of new union premises by the Singapore

Bus  Workers' Union, Mr T. T. Rajah, who acted for

the   vendors   and   the   purchasers,   undertook

conveyance of the property to three union officials

who  were not trustees, although the rules  of  the

unions  specifically provided for  all  properties,

movable  and immovable, to be vested in  the  union

trustees. In addition to the disappearance  of  the

union  officials,  minutes  and  documents  of  the

Singapore  Business  Houses Employees'  Union,  the

whole  Set of account books was also found missing,

and  deliberate attempts were made to frustrate the

Commission's   investigation  and  to   cover   the

malpractices  of certain officials. The  Commission

also  found that huge sums of union funds had  been

dissipated illegally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The findings of the Commission in this respect,

as summarised in its Report, are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That in the case of the Singapore General Employees' Union -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Payments totalling $24,467 were

unauthorised by the rules of the  unions  or

contrary  to  the provisions  of  the  Trade Unions Ordinance;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) $29,847.95 were incurred negligently

by  the  Executive Committee of  the  Union;

and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) $153,564.32 had not been accounted for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That in the case of the Singapore Business Houses Employees' Union -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Payments totalling $13,550 were

unauthorised by the rules of the  unions  or

contrary  to  the provisions  of  the  Trade Unions Ordinance;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Mr Foo Yong Fong, Mr P. Govindaswamy

and Mr Tan Siew Chwee were found guilty  of

gross  negligence in dissipating  a  sum  of $26,901.30 contrary to the union rules; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) $35,654 had not been accounted for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That in the case of the Singapore Bus Workers' Union -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Payments totalling $55,030.80 were

unauthorised by the rules



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



of  the  union or contrary to the provisions

of the Trade Unions Ordinance;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) $2,535.20 was incurred negligently;

and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) $12,523.69 had not been accounted for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the above, you will see that a total amount of

$354,074.26   was  either  unauthorised,   incurred

negligently or had not been accounted for by  these

three unions over a period from 1st April, 1962, to

30th  October,  1963. How much more  was  taken  or

misused  by  them nobody will know. This represents

the  largest  amount of money the  Communist  union

leaders had abstracted from the workers as  far  as

records are concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not the first time that the

pro-Communist  union leaders are found to have  misused

trade union funds. Such things happened eight years

ago.   Just  before  the  de-registration  of   the

Singapore  Factory  and  Shop  Workers'  Union  in

February    1957,   a   sum   of    $100,000    was

unconstitutionally withdrawn from its bank  account

and  the money just vanished into thin air. Members

will  recall  that  on previous  occasions  when  I

mentioned  in this House how the bogus  leaders  of

the pro-Communist unions illegally dissipated funds

of  the workers for purposes inconsistent with  the

objects and rules of the unions to the detriment of

the  unions and danger to the State, Members across

the House, for obvious reasons, jumped up to defend

their  character and integrity and  accused  us  of

smearing them. Members will also recall that in the

past,  when  the Government introduced  legislative

measures to investigate trade union funds, we  were

accused  by  Members across the House  of  adopting

Fascist  and  dictatorial methods to  suppress  the

unions associated with them. When they receive  the

Report  of  the  Commission, they may  read  it  in

silence or play the same old tune. But one thing is

certain,  and  that  is that  no  amount  of  false

accusations  from Members across the Floor  of  the

House  and their friends will be able to alter  the

facts and figures contained in the findings of  the

Commission.

<div align="center"><b>NEW MACPHERSON</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING ESTATE</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr S. V. Lingam asked the Minister of Defence if he will consider the construction of a Community Centre in the new MacPherson Housing Estate, which has a population of about 40,000 people, and when that Centre can be expected to be ready.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  has  no  plans  to

construct  a community centre in the new MacPherson

Housing Estate in the foreseeable future. There are

already  in the Aljunied Constituency one  standard

type  and  one  rural  type community  centres.  In

nearby  Paya Lebar there are one standard type  and

five rural type community centres. If the residents

of  the  MacPherson Housing Estate urgently want  a

community  centre,  they should club  together  and

rent  suitable premises from the Housing Board  for

this  purpose.  Now  that  we  are  an  independent

nation, social initiatives of this kind are  to  be

encouraged. The attitude of expecting Government to

be  the  universal provider is much to be deplored.

It is a legacy of our colonial past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My suggestion to the residents of MacPherson

Housing  Estate is far from fanciful.  In  fact,  a

community  initiative of this kind  took  place  in

Tanah  Merah  Kechil, Changi, where  the  residents

clubbed  together,  built a community  centre,  and

donated   it  to  the  People's  Association.   The

residents  of Changi are a sturdy breed.  When  the

sea  curfew  imposed hardships on their  fishermen,

they  did  not sit on their haunches and  wait  for

dole-outs  by  the Social Welfare Department.  They

organised  a whip-round, bought food and provisions

and  gave  these to the families of the  fishermen.

Their scale of donations is much more generous than

the  Government  ration scale. It is  sturdy

self-reliance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



of this kind that I commend to the residents of

Aljunied, who surely cannot be in any respect less

worthy than those of Changi.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Motion is now open to debate. I

would like to remind Members that the debate should

be confined to the general principles of Government

policy  and administration. Any matters  of  detail

should  be  raised  when the  Estimates  are  being

considered  in detail in the Committee  of  Supply.

Members are to remember that it is only the general

principles  of Government policy and administration

that are subject to debate today.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish

to  congratulate the Finance Minister on presenting

to  this House a practical and useful Budget. There

are   inherent  difficulties  facing  any   Finance

Minister in budgetting for this small island State.

We are a small nation with a population of some two

million and we have no natural resources. We have a

big  neighbour with whom, in so many ways,  we  are

still closely linked. For example, we share



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



a  common currency. Because of this close link, any

Finance  Minister  will  have  to  look  over   his

shoulder to see that any of his proposals will  not

invite  retaliation from across  the  Causeway,  or

that  any  proposal  will not  be  defeated  simply

because  our  neighbour is there. Let  me  give  an

example to illustrate my point. The income  tax  on

companies is 40 per cent in Singapore. It  is  also

40  per cent in the Federation. Should we decide to

raise the tax on companies to, say, 50 per cent, we

have  to make sure that the Federation do likewise.

Otherwise,  companies  will  move  to  Johore   and

conduct  their  business from across the  Causeway.

This  little  example goes to show the difficulties

our  Finance Minister faces in formulating economic

policies for Singapore. It further goes to show how

unnatural  it is that Singapore and the  Federation

should  be  two  economic entities instead  of  one

whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be that as it may, we are now independent and

sovereign.  We have to manage our own affairs.  The

problems after independence are not quite the  same

as  those before independence. We must find ways of

meeting  these  problems. We must  respond  to  the

challenge.  Even before Singapore joined  Malaysia,

Singapore    embarked    on    a    programme    of

industrialisation as the traditional entrepot trade

was  found to be insufficient and unable to  create

enough  job  opportunities  for  our  fast  growing

working   population.  After   Malaysia,   however,

industrialisation    proceeded    on    the     not

unjustifiable basis that there would  be  a  Common

Market.  With  the  separation  of  Singapore  from

Malaysia,  the prospects of a Common Market  become

remote.  Singapore by herself, however,  forms  too

small  a  market  to  support an  industrialisation

programme.  In order to industrialise  effectively,

an  alternative to the Common Market must be found;

in other words, we must find alternative markets to

absorb  the  goods that our factories are  able  to

produce.  Unless  these  markets  are  found,   our

industrialisation programme will come to grief  and

we will face more than an unemployment problem.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is gratifying to note, therefore, that the

Government  is  doing its utmost to  find  overseas

export  markets  for our industrial  goods.  It  is

doing so on the official level by direct approaches

to  foreign  governments. It  is  also  encouraging

private enterprises to look for overseas markets by

providing suitable incentives like double deduction

for  tax  purposes for market development  overseas

and  for increased allowance for advertising. There

is the further provision for an accelerated rate of

depreciation for tax purposes for export-orientated

industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures proposed by the Finance Minister

may be powerful incentives in normal times. We are,

however, living in times that are not quite normal.

Our  industries are not long established.  Most  of

them have just started production. Most of them too

are  pioneer  industries. Pioneer industries  enjoy

special privileges, the most important of which  is

exemption from income tax for five years.  Most  of

the  new  industries, therefore,  would  enjoy  tax

exemption  for an initial period of five years  and

the  double  deduction in respect of  expenses  for

overseas  market  development does not,  therefore,

benefit these pioneer industries. The same argument

applies  to  accelerated depreciation, although  in

this  case  it  is  possible for  manufacturers  to

postpone  depreciation until after the  first  five

years,  i.e.,  after the period in which  they  are

exempted from income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also well known that taxation is not a

disincentive for capitalists. The reason is that as

long  as there is money to be made, capitalists  do

not  mind paying taxes. What they worry most is the

prospect  of  losing money. Exporting  to  overseas

markets  is  a  new  experience  to  many  of   our

industrialists. It is something of an adventure  to

them.  To  sell our goods abroad, we must give  the

foreign  buyers  some sort of  inducement.  We  can

hardly  expect  them  to buy for  cash.  We  would,

therefore, have to sell on credit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a great help, of course, if the

Government   could  finance  this   export   trade,

especially  for the small manufacturers.  But  this

would   throw   an  unbearable  burden   upon   the

exchequer.  Financing the export trade  is  a  more

risky business than financing internal trade.  This

is  especially  so when we have to break  into  new

markets overseas. So even if private industries can

find the money to finance their exports, they would

be  slow  to  do so unless there is  some  sort  of

guarantee that their capital will not be lost.  And

here  is  where the Government can help. I have  in

mind,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, some kind  of  an  export

guarantee  agency. This is some kind  of  insurance

against  default of payment by overseas buyers.  At

present, manufacturers, especially the smaller ones

with a modest capital, are reluctant to export even

if  they  could do so for fear that they  may  lose

their  capital.  With  this fear  removed,  we  can

expect  to  see  a  greater drive  in  industry  to

export.  Many  industrialised nations  to  whom  an

export   market  is  important  have  this   export

guarantee system. Japan and the United Kingdom  are

two  of  the countries that come to mind. I confess

that I have not made a study of any existing system

and cannot, therefore, recommend how this system in

our  country  should be set up. This task  I  shall

leave to the experts in this field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish, however, to anticipate one criticism that

is invariably levelled against any export guarantee

system, i.e., that it invites reckless exporting by

manufacturers resulting in a loss to the  exchequer

though  not  to the manufacturers themselves.  This

may be true in uncontrolled 100 per cent guarantee.

But   this   defect  can  easily  be  overcome   by

guaranteeing  not the full amount of  the  exports,

but,   say,   50   per  cent.   This   will   leave

manufacturers to bear a proportion of the loss  and

will  induce  them  to exercise  caution.  Further,

exports  can  be controlled by commodity  selection

for  export and quality control grading  of  export

markets according to their risk, etc. But these are

details which, as I have said, I shall leave to the

experts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also envisage this agency working hand in glove

with our overseas trade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>



missions  which will advertise our products  abroad

and  provide us with accurate information about the

conditions and needs of our overseas markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, finding overseas markets to

support our industries has become an urgent task in

our  exercise for survival. I believe this proposal

of  mine can help, in however small a way, in  this

urgent task and I humbly beg to put it forward  for

the consideration of hon. Members of this House.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I believe there is not a

single  Singapore citizen, whether from the working

class  or from the capitalist class, who is  uneasy

after  the Finance Minister delivered his financial

speech on the 13th December last. Usually after the

policy  speech by the Minister for Finance,  people

will  be  uneasy because of increased  taxes.  This

time,  not only are they very pleased because there

has  been  no increase in taxes for the forthcoming

year,  but  the  taxes which were  imposed  by  the

Malaysian  Government when Singapore  was  part  of

Malaysia have now been removed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, Mr Speaker, a point which further

pleases  the people of Singapore is that there  are

many  other  guarantees given by the  Minister  for

Finance,  like  the  setting up of  more  factories

which  will  give more employment opportunities  to

the   people,   and   the  resumption   of   trade,

particularly   with  Malaysia.  This   will   bring

prosperity to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one thing about which the people of

Singapore feel uneasy, and that is the attitude  of

the  Minister for Finance in connection with

back-pay.  When  he replied to a question by the  Member

for Telok Blangah on this matter, he reiterated his

positive  stand relating to back-pay. There  is  no

change  on  that. The emphasis by the Minister  for

Finance  can be equated to his giving a  weapon  to

the  employers  to  kill  militant  national  trade

unions  by dilly-dallying over negotiations between

the management and the trade unions. The Government

will  also  employ  this tactic to  avoid  reaching

agreement between



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



workers and management. For instance, when a  union

puts  up wage claims for better working conditions,

the  employer can deliberately dilly-dally over the

matter.  Or  the  management will  first  ascertain

whether there is a claim for back-pay. When it  can

use  this  weapon  provided  by  the  Minister  for

Finance,   then   it   will   deliberately    delay

negotiations.  Ultimately, union  members  who  are

strongly  united  and support the union  will  lose

faith  in  the union, resulting in the union  going

defunct  and  this  is  the opportunity  which  the

management has long been waiting for. But I do  not

know  whether the Minister for Finance  adopts  the

same attitude as the management towards the unions.

When  the  unions  can  no  longer  represent   the

workers, the management will adopt policies at  its

own  whims and fancies and this will result in  the

workers being oppressed by the management.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  soon after our Finance Minister delivered

his  first  Budget speech in the first  independent

Parliament of Singapore, he was received with great

applause  among the people of the various races  in

Singapore. All these people are of the opinion that

this   is   a  great  assurance  for  the  economic

stability  in  Singapore. This is because  in  this

Budget  speech,  we  have been  able  to  show  our

economic  achievements which represent our national

spirit  and  which augurs well for a bright  future

for  our nation. And this again is a New Year  gift

for  our people with the festive season just around

the corner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a representative of the people, Mr Speaker,

I,  on  behalf  of my constituents, would  like  to

thank the Finance Minister for his Budget speech. I

express  my  confidence in  and  support  for  this

Budget  speech in which our stability and  progress

are assured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, looking at the Budget speech as a

whole, we can see various salient features. I think

it is necessary for me to point out these features.

Firstly, in this budget we can see that the sum  of

some  $537 million will be collected from  revenue.

Against  this we will be spending a total  of  $505

million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the balance is that we will have a surplus of

some $30 million. This is the first point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that, because of our economic

resilience  and viability, we have  not  only  been

able   to  recover  our  losses  as  a  result   of

Indonesian  confrontation, but we  have  also  been

able to increase our national income by at least  2

per  cent in the past one year. This is the  second

salient feature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that, as a result of

Singapore's   independence,  certain  retrogressive

taxes  have been repealed. These taxes were imposed

by  the  Malaysian Central Government.  Instead  of

these retrogressive measures, we have replaced them

with some new measures which provide protection for

our  economic prosperity. From all this, we can see

that with efficient and progressive new methods our

economic future is well protected, and this will in

turn  bring about a reorganisation in the whole  of

our social order and improvement therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, this Budget speech goes a step

further  to  show that our non-Communist democratic

socialist Government is a well-organised and highly

efficient  piece of machinery. With its  consistent

policy   and  long-term  objectives,  it  is   able

effectively to lead the people of our island  State

of  224  square miles towards a well-organised  and

better society, in which the standard of living  of

the  people  will  be enhanced  and  improved  with

economic  independence, which will  bring  about  a

more just, equal and prosperous nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are altogether the salient features that

one  will  see in the Budget speech. What  is  more

important  is  that, Mr Speaker, I would  like  to

stress  at this juncture that the contents of  this

Budget  speech  show that those theorists  who  are

politically  shortsighted are wrong in  their  view

that  they can stifle Singapore's independence with

economic  measures. They also show themselves  that

they  are  very stupid in believing that  they  can

stifle our economic growth.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to give some facts and

figures  to  prove my point. This will, of  course,

give you a better picture of the Budget speech. The

average  national income per capita of the  working

class  in Singapore is as high as $1,300, which  is

the  highest  in  the whole of Asia.  Mr  Speaker,

compared  with  Malaysia, which is  only  $800  per

capita income, Sabah - $700 per capita income,  and

Sarawak  -$550 per capita income, we are  also  the

highest  in  this region. The main sources  of  our

national  income come from these different  fields:

Commerce and Trade, 23 per cent; Industry,  18  per

cent;  Government  services,  18  per  cent;  Armed

Forces,  14  per cent; Agriculture,  18  per  cent;

Building Construction, 5 per cent; Tourism,  3  per

cent;  and  Others,  15  per cent.  The  employment

opportunities for our people come mainly  from  our

commerce,  transportation and other services  which

provide employment to 70 per cent of our people. In

the field of industry and building construction, 20

per  cent  are  employed. Agriculture provides  for

some 8 per cent of our employed, and others, 2  per

cent.  From all these figures, we can see that  the

economic policies of our Government are correct and

on  the  right track. This is because, on  the  one

hand,  we  can  maintain  our  traditional  trading

centre and, on the other hand, we can go ahead with

our industrial development programme. These figures

also show that Singapore's commerce occupies a very

important  point in our economic structure.  It  is

erroneous  to  say  that it is  only  in  times  of

prosperity that the Government is able to go  ahead

with  its  economic  programmes.  This  is  a  very

backward  view  which is not  shown  in  our  first

Budget speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to have learned

from  the  Minister for Finance that for the  first

time the Government is intending to consolidate and

improve upon our infrastructure with great sums  of

money, such infrastructure being necessary for  our

further   improvement  in  social   amenities   and

economic growth. All this will, of course, give our

people a better standard of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



living.  I  understand that it is the intention  of

the  Government to spend some $976 million  in  the

next  five  years,  which is 60  per  cent  of  the

estimate  for the purposes of economic development.

Of this figure, a sum of $486 million will be spent

on social development programmes, and these are all

very good for our people, because this sum takes up

about  32  per  cent  of  the  estimate  for   this

particular Five-Year Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, with regard to social development, I

would  like to mention in particular the  programme

in  housing. Our housing achievements have not only

won  praise locally, but they have also boosted our

international  repute. This very well  proves  that

our  country is going on the right track  and  that

our  Government has the determination and verve  to

face  all  types of difficulties and challenges  in

order to find a way out for our people through  all

these economic challenges and difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the reasons for saying so are very

simple  and clear. You will remember that  when  we

first came to power in 1959, many, many people were

without decent housing and even experts were of the

opinion  that our housing problem was difficult  to

solve,  because  at that time there  was  an  acute

shortage   of  houses  in  Singapore  and  whatever

programme for housing development we had, it  would

not  be possible to catch up with the growth of our

population. But the facts before us today show that

all  those fears were actually unfounded  and  that

the  housing programme of the Government  has  been

very successful all along.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you can see that many, many question

marks  have turned into a lot of exclamation  marks

in  praise of our achievements. Now we have come to

a  stage where we are able to build one unit in  45

minutes. All this goes to show the overall  success

of the housing programme of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you can see how successful we are. A

development  officer of E.C.A.F.E. said  that  the

housing  programme  in Singapore  provided  by  the

Government in respect of low-cost



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



housing   has   been  shockingly  and  surprisingly

successful  and  that  this  was  a  very   massive

programme  - in fact, the greatest of its  kind  in

the whole of Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, our success can be seen in the new

housing  estate  now in Bukit  Ho  Swee  which  was

devastated  by  a big fire in 1961 in  which  about

16,000   people   were   rendered   homeless.   The

Government  then  took up the  challenge  to  build

houses for these people. On 1st February, 1960, the

Housing  Board  was set up and  it  took  over  our

housing   development  project  from   the   former

Singapore Improvement Trust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let us take note that the people of

Bukit  Ho Swee have been lucky in that in  a  short

time they are able to enjoy decent housing provided

by  our Government. Against this background, let us

take  a look at the history of the former Singapore

Improvement Trust. In its 32 years of existence, it

was  only able to put up 21,689 units of houses and

shophouses. This shows that the former Lim Yew Hock

and   the   colonial  governments  were  not   only

inefficient  but  also  incompetent.  Against  this

historical background, we will take a look  at  our

achievements.  We  have  been  able   to   put   up

altogether about 52,206 units of houses since 1959.

This  figure  includes flats as well as shophouses.

The  break-up  is  as follows: in 1961,  altogether

7,320  units of low-cost houses were built for  our

people; in 1962, we built 12,230 units; in 1963, we

built  10,085 units; in 1964, we built about 13,280

units. Since the Government came to power, we  have

been  able  to put up a lot of flats and blocks  of

houses  in various areas in Singapore, particularly

in  Queenstown,  Bukit  Ho  Swee,  MacPherson,  St.

Michael's,  Alexandra, Jurong new town,  Kim  Keat,

Geylang  Serai, Toa Payoh, Kallang,  Selegie  Road,

Onan Road, Toa Payoh South, etc. In these areas, we

have  been  able to put up altogether about  44,345

units  of  houses in order to enable our people  to

live   in  housing  estates.  The  Government  also

provides  them with housing subsidies. The  figures

are  as follows: in 1960, the subsidy provided  was

$2.1



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



million;  in  1961, the provision was $2.1  million

also; in 1962, it was $4.2 million; in 1963, it was

S6.5 million; in 1964, it was $9.5 million and  for

1965  it  will  be $9.7 million. All these  figures

show the amount of housing subsidy provided by  the

Government  for  the people. So the Government  has

not  only  solved  the  acute  problem  of  housing

shortage  but  has also provided  the  people  with

social  amenities in the housing estates,  such  as

schools, clinics, playgrounds, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, from all these facts and figures, we

can  see that the Government has done and is  doing

all  it  can to improve the standard of living  and

the environments of our people. But in spite of the

efforts of the Government to do good things for the

people,  the  Barisan Sosialis and the other

anti-national   elements   are   trying   to   be   very

obstructive,   particularly  in   cases   of   land

acquisition.  They try to whip up the  feelings  of

the   people  against  the  Government  and  create

trouble for their own political ends, because  they

do   not   want  us  to  carry  out  our  work   of

construction and nation-building. They know that if

we  are  successful, it will be very difficult  for

them  in their political struggle to achieve  their

own  selfish  ends.  They  are  not  loyal  to  the

country. They are traitors to our people. They  are

loyal  only to the political leaders of  a  country

outside   Singapore.  We  can  see  through   their

treacherous  intrigues and plots. They  claim  that

they  should  inculcate the theories and  political

ideology  of  Mao Tse-tung into the  minds  of  our

young  people. I would like to tell them  that  our

people   are   not   interested  in   any   foreign

indoctrination   of  any  kind,  because   it   has

practically  nothing to do with the improvement  of

the  lot of our people. Our people want to  see  an

actual improvement in their livelihood. Because  of

this, the Barisan Sosialis have not been able  even

to hold on to their own political strongholds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, our main task ahead now is survival.

I  would  like to tell you what the Government  has

done in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



various  fields, such as industry and  agriculture.

From  these  figures we will be  able  to  see  the

development of Singapore's economy and  its  bright

future. First, the development of industry will  no

doubt  provide the focal point for our  efforts  in

the future progress of economic development. At the

same  time, it will be a safeguard for our  society

to  exist  in  a modernised and developed  economy.

Industry  will  play a very important  role  in  an

independent  Singapore. From the  figures  which  I

will  give  below, we can see that we  have  enough

viability and verve to exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1964 the Government provided sums totalling

$120  million  for  industrial development.  It  is

estimated   that  in  Jurong  the   investment   in

industrial  development by 1970  will  reach  about

$200 million, and by 1980 this industrial city will

be  able to accommodate about one-half of the total

population  of Singapore. The Economic  Development

Board  has already approved various loans.  By  the

end  of last year it has reached $43 million.  They

have   directly  invested  in  various   industries

totalling   $15   million.  At  the   moment,   new

industries  number  110. Their  registered  capital

amounts to $649 million, with a paid-up capital  of

$216.86  million.  By the end of last  year,  there

were  58  new factories which came into production.

Four   other  factories  are  in  the   course   of

construction.  These  factories  will  he  able  to

provide about 16,000 jobs for our citizens.  It  is

expected  that the annual production will be  worth

$505.85 million. Last year there were 120 factories

which were non-pioneer industry factories, engaging

in  production. The investment reaches $44 million,

thus providing 4,000 jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's husbandry has also made great

achievements. It has brought about better prospects

in   the   economy   of   Singapore.   Agricultural

activities have been neglected by the urban people.

Every  year the production of animals for  domestic

needs  will be about 20 million heads, 200 million

eggs,  750,000 pigs and 40,000 tons of  vegetables.

The  economic value of all this will amount to $200

million. This agricultural produce will not only be

sufficient for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>



our  own  consumption, but there  will  also  be  a

surplus for export. It has been exported to various

places in Malaysia. Such produce like eggs has also

been   exported   to   Hong   Kong   and   adjacent

territories.  Singapore is the only  city  in  Asia

which is able to export eggs. Statistics show  that

in  1961  the  eggs exported reached $2.3  million.

Last  year  it  has increased to $3.3 million.  The

total   increase  in  exports  amounted  to   $1.06

million.  In  the  same period, Singapore  imported

eggs  valued at $6.8 million. By 1964 there  was  a

sharp  decrease to $3.8 million. The total decrease

was $3 million. That is a favourable figure to show

the success of our farmers. All this success is the

result  of  our hard work and the progress  of  the

farmers. It has shown that the Government's  policy

has  been  successful in raising their standard  of

living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to comment on the boycott by the

Barisan   Sosialis.  I  believe  the   people   are

intelligent and when the right time comes they will

be able to understand the various activities of the

Opposition  Members and will be able  to  give  the

correct  and just judgment on them. Let  us  expose

their  facade of democracy and socialism. In  fact,

these   Opposition  Members  have  fallen  into   a

contradiction of foreign political philosophy. They

have  fallen into the contradiction of  the  Soviet

revisionist policy of peaceful co-existence on  the

one  hand,  and the orthodox Leninist line  on  the

other.   This  has  resulted  in  a  division   and

contradiction  in  their  analysis  of  Singapore's

independence.  In the end, the fact of  Singapore's

independence  cannot  be  ignored  by  the  Barisan

Sosialis  and  the  pseudo  socialists,   or   even

affected by their slogans and smears. History  will

finally  record that such people will fail  in  all

their attempts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to give the people a very

reliable  analysis.  In  order  to  understand  the

activities  of the pro-Communist Barisan  Sosialis,

we  should  go  a  step further and understand  the

background of international relationships  so  that

we can have the right solution.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me say that Singapore is now an

independent   country,   and   it   has   been   so

internationally   recognised.   It   has   now   an

international status. But the fate of  our  country

is in the hands of the people. This is a Government

elected by the people. All people, irrespective  of

race  and  class,  should unite  together  for  one

purpose  - to fight shoulder to shoulder  with  the

Government  to reform our society so  that  we  can

realise   the  higher  objective  of  a   Malaysian

Singapore.  At  the same time, we should  recognise

that  despite the political and economic separation

of  Singapore  from Malaysia, the  demographic  and

geographical  factors are such that the  people  in

the  two  territories  are inseparable.  These  are

facts.  But, however much the other people wish  to

force  us  into our present temporary position,  we

can   strive  so  that  in  the  end,  through  the

determined  effort of our people and in the  spirit

of  Yu Koon who, according to Chinese legend, moved

mountains, we can establish a multi-racial  society - a non-Communist, democratic socialist

society - in this part of South-East Asia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I fully support the motion moved

by the Minister for Finance on 13th December, 1965,

in  connection with the 1966 Budget.  Although  our

country is small, we are able to maintain a balance

in  the  expenditure and revenue in  spite  of  the

additional burdens of defence and foreign  affairs,

and  also without increasing taxation in the coming

year. This fact shows the soundness of our economic

position. Such a financial policy is also a healthy

one.  It  has  been praised and well  supported  by

people  from all sections in Singapore. On the  one

hand,  the  Government is trying  to  industrialise

and,  on  the other hand, it has also not neglected

the present entrepot trade. They are regarding this

with  favour.  Our country is trying  to  establish

trade relations with more countries, such as Russia

and  African countries, and enter other markets  in

the  international field. This financial policy  is

the  most  suitable  one for  our  country  in  the

present context of

South-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>



East Asia. This is the correct policy to adopt. In

the  end,  it  will lead to economic  progress  and

prosperity. It will bring more jobs to  our  people

and  raise their living standard. At the same time,

it   will  help  the  further  development  of  our

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, whether or not the economic base of

a  country is sound depends on population  and  the

increase in national income. The 1965 figures  show

a  total income of $2,100 million. But there was an

increase of $108 million in the subsequent  period.

The average income per capita in 1961 was $200, but

this  year it is about $1,200 per head. This  shows

the  increase in our national income per capita and

the  growth  of our economic development.  Although

Indonesia has stopped its trade with us because  of

confrontation, this has not hampered us in any  way

in our economic progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Economic Development Board has

undertaken  joint  investments with  industrialists

and,  as  a  result,  there  is  good  progress  in

industrial development in Jurong. According to what

the  Minister  for Finance has said, there  are  82

pioneer  factories  engaged  in  production.   They

engage  9,000 workers. More factories  will  be  in

production.  If  all  are in production,  then  the

workers  employed will be 15,000. The Minister  for

Finance  has  also  announced that  the  industrial

output  is estimated at $1,100 million. This  shows

an   increase  over  the  previous  year's  figure.

According  to the Minister, our industries  have  a

sound  foundation, and the aim  of  our  people  to

industrialise has now materialised.  With  the

co-operation  of  the Government, I  believe  that  in

three  or four years' time, our industries will  be

very  prosperous  and will definitely  bear  fruit,

thus earning more foreign exchange for us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the question of

industrialisation,  we  are  faced   with   certain

problems.  One of them concerns the working  class.

From   1954-61,  there  were  general  strikes   in

Singapore  which discouraged prospective local  and

foreign investors from investing here. If they were

to invest large sums of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



money  in  local  industries, they would  naturally

hope to get some profits and dividends. But if  the

workers  go on strike even before the products  are

put  on  the market, then industries will be killed

even   before   any  profits  can  be   made.   The

investments  will thus come to nothing.  Therefore,

our  Government, in order to alleviate the  worries

of prospective investors in this respect, has drawn

up  pioneer industry laws to provide safeguards and

tax  concessions  to investors. On  the  one  hand,

these concessions are for three to five years, and,

on  the  other  hand, there is  provision  for  the

regulation  of workers. So far, there has  been  no

trouble  in this field, and the workers  have  been

able   to   live   and   work  smoothly   in   good

surroundings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, because of the importance of workers

in  industrialisation and the importance  of  trade

unionism  in  this  development programme,  let  me

touch  a  little on this. In trade unionism,  there

are  apparently two factions. We all remember  that

in  1961  there  was the argument for  and  against

merger and Malaysia, which led to an open split  in

the  leadership of the trade union movement.  There

were  the  pro-Communist trade unions  led  by  Lim

Ching  Siong  on  the one side and  the  democratic

socialist  unions  led by Mr Devan  Nair  on  the

other  side.  Because  of conflicting  views,  they

agreed to part, and trade unionism developed  along

two  different lines. This led to the formation  of

the  present trade union, the N.T.U.C.,  consisting

of  100,000 workers and which is non-Communist  and

democratic  in principle. On the other hand,  there

is  the Left-wing pro-Communist trade union led  by

pro-Communists  and  their  stooges,  who  use  the

workers as pawns in their political struggle. Their

actions  and activities, which were detrimental  to

the  interests of the workers, did not satisfy  the

workers  and they resigned from their trade unions.

This  led  to  the collapse of these trade  unions.

They  are now on their way down the drain.  On  the

other  hand,  the healthy non-Communist  democratic

trade unionism under the leadership of the N.T.U.C.

is  a  strong influence in nation building. If  the

N.T.U.C. can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



continue  to  lead  the  trade  union  movement  by

providing  intelligent leadership and treating  the

workers  with intelligence, then I believe that  it

will  grow  stronger day by day, and we can  ensure

that  our  Government's policy  on  labour  is  not

changed.  On 16th October, the Minister  said  that

the   Government's  policy  was  to  encourage  the

development   of  non-Communist  democratic   trade

unionism, so that it may be built into a strong -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is touching

on  the  labour  policy of the Government.  We  are

discussing  the financial policy. If he can  relate

the  labour movement to the financial policy,  then

he  is  in  order. But just to discuss  the  labour

policy of the Government is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I thank you

for your guidance. I was mentioning those things in

passing because they touch on the labour field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now talk about the Government's

expenditure  on education and housing.  About  $100

million  will  be allotted for housing development,

of which $45 million will be for building and other

sums  have  been allotted for other purposes.  This

goes  to show that the Government is not neglecting

this   project  and  other  development   projects,

include  the  reclamation of  land.  This  is  very

important  in land-hungry Singapore. On  the  other

hand,  a  historic plan in urban  renewal  will  be

carried  out  next year and very soon  our  country

will  be  turned into a modernised country in  this

century.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the expenditure for next year will

be   about  one-quarter  of  our  budget.  This  is

important,  because if we want our  country  to  be

strong, then we must popularise education and raise

the   educational  standard  of  the  people.   The

Government   policy  is  to  regard  education   as

important  as the social amenities to  the  people.

Therefore,  the $120 million to be  spent  in  this

respect   is  quite  a  handsome  sum.  Under   the

Government's  financial, commercial and  industrial

policies, we believe that our commerce and industry

will   be   able  to  develop  quickly.  With   the

diligence,   intelligence,  business   acumen   and

efforts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



of  the workers together, I believe we will be able

jointly to build a more just and happy society with

a high living standard.

<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the financial

policy  delivered  by  the Hon. the  Minister  for

Finance on the 13th of December. Although Singapore

is   a   small   nation  and  has   just   achieved

independence and sovereignty about four months ago,

the Minister's financial speech is an encouragement

to  us  that  next year the financial  position  of

Singapore will be sound. This will give inspiration

to all the people of Singapore to face the problems

ahead.  The  people  of Singapore,  comprising  the

various    races,   workers,   businessmen,    have

considered  the  policy speech as a  balanced  one.

This is the result of the efficient efforts of  the

Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy that the Minister has given attention

to  the social amenities and that in the budget for

next  year there will be a 10 per cent increase  in

social   amenities.   I  feel   in   future   years

allocations for social amenities will be  increased

further. In order to create a multi-racial society,

such  amenities  must be provided. These  will  not

only  be meant for one race, but for all races that

live  in  this country, irrespective of  colour  of

skin,  language, or culture. The P.A.P.  Government

is  based on social democracy. Since 1959  when  it

first  assumed  office,  it has  worked  untiringly

towards the creation of a happy, prosperous  and  a

more  just  and equal society. We hope  that  these

efforts will not only be confined to the people  of

Singapore  alone, but will also be  meant  for  our

neighbouring  population of ten  million.  But  our

efforts  have  been  misunderstood  and  this   has

resulted in our being kicked out of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to emphasise that the achievements made by

our people, including the Malays, in Singapore have

been  the  result  of a positive social  democracy.

Nobody  can  deny  this. If we compare  our  living

conditions, particularly the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



Malays',  with our neighbours', we will  find  that

the  Malays  in  Singapore are  in  a  much  better

position   than  our  neighbours.  The  Malays   in

Singapore  enjoy benefits not only in  housing  and

education  but also in other amenities like  supply

of electricity and water, drains and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is clear that under a government

based on social democracy, the people of Singapore,

including the Malays of Islamic faith, can  achieve

their  objects. All the accusations that only under

a  government  of Islamic religion can  the  Malays

prosper  are nonsensical. Socialism is not  against

any  religion. Socialism is not against Islam.  The

teachings of Islam are not opposed to the  practice

of  socialism.  Socialism, in fact, is  Islam.  For

instance, the payment of tithes, which is  done  by

all the people of Islam throughout the world once a

year  -  shows  that Islam has the same  policy  as

socialism,  and  that  is to  create  a  harmonious

society.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

nothing  is  a better and more practical  New  Year

present to the 1.8 million people of Singapore than

the  1966  Budget Estimates presented by  the  Hon. Minister

for Finance. The budget, as a whole,  has won the confidence

and trust of our people, to whom this  House  is  responsible,

in  the  effort  and ability of the present Government to

create a  more prosperous,  more just and more equal society.

The hazards  and difficulties accompanying  the  sudden

political  changes, namely, Singapore's  separation

from  Malaysia and its emergence as an  independent

sovereign  nation,  have  proved  to  be   not   so

formidable  as expected. The panic of  some  people

over  the  future  of Singapore, with  its  limited

space  and  resources, as a country independent  of

others,  has  turned  out to be  only  a  temporary

nightmare.  Everything has turned  out  fine  after

four  crucial months have elapsed, and the majority

of  our  people are now confident not only  in  the

physical  survival of Singapore as  a  nation,  but

also in the emergence of a more prosperous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



multi-racial society. The Budget Estimates of  next

year have strengthened this belief.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to point out

several  things which the Government have  achieved

or  have decided to accomplish in the coming years,

and  which gives me grounds for my optimism in  the

future  of the new State. First of all, it  is  the

Indonesian confrontation that convinces me  of  the

ability  and the capacity of Singapore  to  survive

and  prosper.  The people at large,  except  for  a

small number of anti-national elements, rejoice  at

the  fact  that  despite the ordeal  of  Indonesian

confrontation  for over two long  years,  Singapore

has  been  able,  not  only to  overcome  the  loss

resulting from the severance of trade, but also  to

show  an increase in our national income. In  fact,

we  expected  to lose 8.7 per cent in our  national

income  as  a result of this economic war,  but  we

have  managed to show a net increase of 2 per cent.

This   is   amazing.  And  again,  in   1964   when

confrontation reached its height, the gross capital

formation  represents an increase of  28  per  cent

over  1963. While the average rate of annual income

increase during the pre-confrontation years,  i.e.,

from  1959  to  1963,  is only  22  per  cent.  And

notwithstanding  the confrontation,  the  value  of

external trade also showed an increase of no  small

percentage.  Considering the important part  played

by  entrepot trade in the economy of Singapore  and

the  amount  of trade we had with Indonesia  before

the  formation of Malaysia, this achievement of the

people  of  Singapore  is a near  miracle.  If  the

nation  can and does survive and prosper under  the

gravest  trial it has ever experienced, we have  no

reason  to doubt its ability to continue to survive

and    prosper   hereafter,   whether   there    is

confrontation of one type or another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point which I think is

significant  is that the Government  has  taken  or

decided  to  take protective measures to  safeguard

our   growing  industries.  Considering  the  role,

especially in future, of industries in ensuring our

prosperity and the high standard of living,  it  is

justifiable for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



Government to take whatever steps are necessary for

the  growth of our industries. One of the steps  is

the  imposition of customs duties on some  imported

goods,   especially   those  which   the   domestic

industries   have   been  able   or   prepared   to

manufacture. I understand that this is primarily  a

reply  to  the  unfriendly action of the  Malaysian

Government. Hon. Members of the House must be aware

of  the consistent policy of the Government on  the

other side of the Causeway aiming at smothering our

infant  industries out of sheer feminine  jealousy.

This  same  jealousy  had caused  the  eviction  of

Singapore  from the Federation. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

anybody  with an average I.Q. will know  that  this

cold  war  of  economy between the two  Governments

will  do no good to both parties, although  we  are

convinced that Singapore will suffer less,  if  any

at all, in the long run. It is in this respect that

I,  and  the  people at large, surely, welcome  the

Hon.  Minister  for  Finance's pledge  that  he  is

willing   at  any  moment  to  meet  the  Malaysian

representatives to discuss the issue of economic

co-operation  on  the basis of mutual benefit.  And  I

also hope that the Malaysian Government will review

its  policy and will not reject our friendly  offer

on  no  sounder  ground  than  mere  jealousy.  The

leaders of the Alliance Government should no longer

be  under  the illusion that Singapore will  suffer

more. They should not calculate the extent they can

hurt Singapore, but how much they will benefit from

mutual    co-operation.   I   also   applaud    the

Government's  lifting of certain taxes  which  were

imposed by the former Central Government and  which

had been the target of a nation-wide criticism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the favourable conditions now, there is

sufficient reason to anticipate the success of  our

industrialisation projects, and with this  success,

we would be able to find enough jobs every year for

the  school-leavers who are expected to  enter  the

labour  market.  If we are to succeed  in  bringing

about  a  more just and equal society in  terms  of

employment for all, then we cannot afford  to  fail

in our industrialisation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government does not neglect entrep�t

trade  in its Budget Estimates. This is proof  that

the  Government has recognised and appreciated  the

traditional role and contribution of entrep�t trade

to  the  economy of Singapore. In fact,  before  we

become a truly industrialised State, we must  still

depend mainly on entrep�t trade for our prosperity.

It  is  wise  for the Government to create  a  free

trade  zone  to  promote  and  facilitate  entrep�t

trade.  I  can  see that for many  years  to  come,

entrep�t  trade will be parallel with  industry  as

two essential life vessels of our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has a natural geographical position

which is most favourable for trade, and it is  this

superb  geographical position that makes  Singapore

the  fifth largest port in the world. We must  not,

at any cost, surrender this natural gift, let alone

give it up of our own accord.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the abundant harvest of the Singapore

Goodwill  Mission  led  by the  Hon.  Deputy  Prime

Minister who returned recently from a tour of

Afro-Asian and East European countries, is an example of

what this type of mission can do to help boost  our

trade  with  the world, especially those  countries

where industries are still in their infancy. I hope

the  Government will send more missions, especially

trade  missions, abroad, as frequently as possible,

within the capacity of our limited resources.  This

is  as important as imposing protective tariffs  to

help  the growth of our industries. Meanwhile,  the

Government  should  encourage the  organisation  of

unofficial  commercial  missions  and   give   them

maximum  convenience and assistance.  Semi-official

missions  where Government officials and  merchants

combine will, in my opinion, bring greater results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch on the $1.5 million

involved  in the Government's intention to  change

identity  cards  and  the $55,000  which  will  be

involved  in  the expenditure on work  permits.  I

think   it   is   worth  mentioning   Government's

intention to issue new -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already indicated to

the  House  that  the  debate  should  be  on  the

general policy, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



matters   of  detail  should  be  dealt   with   in

Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for

your  pertinent ruling. I wish to say, in  passing,

that  this  will  not  affect  our  expenditure  in

bringing  about  prosperity  to  our  country.  Mr

Speaker, as you know, the terrific -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Sim, if you can relate that to

the  financial  policy, please do.  But  all  I  am

saying  is  that you must not embark on a  detailed

discussion of those two items.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> These are methods to safeguard

the  interests of our citizens and our  prosperity.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, as you know, the terrific influx

of  unskilled workers from the other  side  of  the

Causeway since Malaysia Day, and particularly since

the  independence of Singapore, and the expectation

of a worse situation in the near future, has forced

the  Government to take these steps. Otherwise, the

unemployment problem will deteriorate; the  present

prosperity   will   be   jeopardised:    and    the

Government's Second Five-Year Plan will  be  killed

in  the  bud.  However, Sir, in dealing  with  this

problem,  which  is  rather  a  delicate  one,  the

Government should take care to see that the feeling

of  the  masses over the other side of the Causeway

will  not  be hurt too much. We should always  show

our  sympathy,  not  only sympathy  but  also  give

spiritual  strength and encouragement to  them.  We

must  see  that  our actions do  not  endanger  the

traditional friendship between the peoples  of  the

two countries, especially their high esteem towards

us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the next thing I wish to

mention  is  the  introduction of  the  Income  Tax

(Amendment)  Bill which repeals the  unsatisfactory

practice  of  the  former Central  Government.  The

people  in general, and the fair sex in particular,

must  rejoice at this offer of the Government.  One

of  the signs by which the extent of development of

a  country  is  judged is the percentage  of  women

employees  in the total working force. It  is  true

that the more women are engaged in nation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



building, the more advanced the country  is.  As  a

matter  of  fact, there are very  few  jobs   which

cannot be handled by women with equal efficiency as

compared  with  men, in fact, Sir, there  are  many

jobs  which are monopolised by them. Therefore,  it

will be a great loss for the nation if the fair sex

confine themselves to their kitchens. Sir,  when  I

say  "fair sex", I mean the fair sexes of all races

-  Chinese, Malays, Indians and so on. And the best

way to encourage them to contribute their share  in

nation-building is to let their incomes be assessed

separately from their husbands. It is also wise for

the Government to re-impose the upper tax of 55 per

cent  on  personal incomes of $100,000 or more,  on

the  principle that the heavier burden of  taxation

should be borne by those best able to hear it. This

is a principle to bring about a more just and equal

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to touch on is education.

The  present  Government's education policy  is  to

promote   the   four  streams  of  languages.   The

estimated  expenditure allotted to  education  next

year  amounts  to  $129 million out  of  the  total

expenditure  estimate  of $506  million.  In  other

words,  it  is  about  one-quarter  of  the   total

expenditure. Besides, there is a sum of $28 million

for  development purposes of the Ministry. The fact

that  education consumes the greatest part  of  our

revenue is our tradition, a tradition treasured  by

a  responsible government. In some countries of the

world  today, the greatest part of the government's

revenue  goes  to  buying and  producing  arms  and

ammunition  and  the maintenance  of  strong  armed

forces.  In this respect, we are considered  lucky,

for we have a government which spends more money on

building  more schools and training more  teachers.

Sir,  in  a  nation  like ours,  where  the  social

structure  is a multi-racial one, education  has  a

more  important part to play. It is in the  schools

where our younger generation learn to live with one

another irrespective of race, colour, language  and

creed.  It  is in the schools where they  learn  to

create  a  multi-racial society.  Considering  this

sacred task of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



nation-building   burdened   by    our    education

programme,  it  is  more  than  justified  for  the

Government to put such a big amount of public funds

at the disposal of the Minister for Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, incidentally, I recall the Government's

intention  to introduce a new measure on the  study

of  a second language. It is decided that the study

of  a  second  language, other than the  medium  of

instruction,  will  be  made  compulsory   in   all

secondary schools, and instruction will begin  with

Secondary  I  in 1966. I can foresee the  day  when

there  is no language barrier between the component

races of our society. Making our younger generation

well  versed in at least two languages is the  most

practical  and surest way to ensure the  successful

creation of a multi-racial society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the last, but not the least

important  point I want to touch on is the  problem

of  defence and security of our country. As all  of

us  know, all the good things now in our possession

and  those  which are expected in future  are  only

real  and  true within the framework of  peace  and

order.  This is why we have been relying on British

forces  for  the safety of our lives and  property.

All  the  world,  except  Indonesia  and  the

pro-communist Barisan Sosialis, has not denied  us  the

right   to   survive  and  the  right  to   protect

ourselves.   But  as  an  independent   non-aligned

nation,  we  cannot justify ourselves  if  we  keep

British  forces  on our territory forever,  not  to

mention that the British Government might take  the

initiative  to withdraw its bases one  day  due  to

financial difficulties or other reasons. Therefore,

we  must look ahead to the day when we have to rely

on ourselves. It is high time for us to prepare and

to  start  doing something. Sir, that  is  why  the

Government  decides to spend about $70  million  on

security    and   defence.   Compared   with    our

contribution   to  the  former  Malaysian   Central

Government  for their expenditure on  our  security

and  defence,  which is 40 per cent  of  our  State

revenue,  we spend much less now. We must establish

and keep small armed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



forces strong enough for defence purpose. We  never

want to, and can never, invade other countries.  We

want  to  be friendly with all countries, East  and

West.  But we do not want to be molested.  Although

we  are a small nation, we will show the world that

we  want  to  be left alone. The Government  should

take  pains to explain to our people our  position.

We  must  not  underestimate the influence  of  the

traditional attitude towards enlistment, especially

among  the  Chinese community.  We  must  also  not

expect ordinary people to understand the details of

the  Government statement published  in  the  local

Press.  More publicity, especially direct  contacts

between  Government  leaders and  the  people,  are

required  to arouse the interest of our  people  in

joining the Volunteer Army Forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a small State like ours, to maintain social

order  and  internal security, is no less important

than  keeping out aggressors. Singapore shares  the

common problem that all cosmopolitan cities in  the

world face. We have to fight social evils and crime

which  find  their  hot-bed  in  heavily  populated

cities.  We  are fortunate enough to  have  a  very

efficient  police  force.  The  number  of   secret

society incidents has rapidly decreased since 1959.

This is a clear reflection on the effectiveness  of

our police force. Sir, our police force has also  a

duty  to check and curb subversive activities of  a

political, racial, or religious nature. In view  of

the  wide range and large amount of work they  have

to  do, the Government is expanding the size of the

police force. The two riots that happened last year

would  not  have  been  handled  by  unpopular  and

violent  armed  forces had we had  our  own  police

force  strong  enough to cope with  the  situation.

Sir,  this is also a painful lesson - that we  must

trust nobody but ourselves in case of emergency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to call upon this

House  to  give  full approval of the  1966  Budget

which  has  been well received by the public  since

its   presentation.  Sir,  the  whole  nation   has

expressed  its confidence in entrusting its  future

to   the   hands  of  the  People's  Action   Party

Government. And I am sure, if nothing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



goes   wrong  with  the  behaviour  of  the  civil

servants  in  serving the people  efficiently  and

cordially, then the bringing about of a more  just

and  equal  multi-racial society will be  realised

sooner than we expected.

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as has already

been pointed out by my colleague, the Minister for

Finance,  in  his  Budget speech,  expenditure  on

social  services  has been on the  increase  every

year.  For  education  and  health  services,  for

example, there has been a ten per cent increase in

expenditure this year over that of last year,  and

the  1966  Budget provides for a similar order  of

increase  next  year. This is, of  course,  as  it

should  be,  for  the continuing  improvement  and

expansion of social services is in accordance with

the  declared  socialist aim of the Government  to

provide  more  of the amenities of  life  for  the

people  as  part  of  the  general  objective   of

bringing about a more just and equal society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of social welfare, where the needs

of  the  handicapped  and underprivileged  of  our

society  are  catered for, as  distinct  from  the

needs  of the people generally, there has  been  a

constant  endeavour  not  only  to  maintain   the

existing   level  and  standard  of  the  services

provided, but also to improve and expand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the coming into operation this year of the

Woodlands Home for old people, which has a maximum

capacity of 500, the Social Welfare Department now

runs  a  total  of 12 welfare institutions,  which

between them provide care and shelter for all  age

groups, from boys and girls of school-going age to

the  aged and infirm. To provide for future needs,

plans  have  been  formulated  for  two  new   Old

People's  Homes on the same lines as the Woodlands

Home,  and a Junior Approved School for boys.  The

Junior  Approved School will provide training  and

rehabilitation facilities on up-to-date lines  for

boys  below  the  age  of 13 (the  present  Gimson

School



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



provides  for  boys  above  13),  and  will   have

accommodation for 80 boys. In addition, there  are

plans  to  build extensions to an existing  Girls'

Home  and  a  Boys' Home in order to increase  the

accommodation    and   improve   the    facilities

available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on the Social Welfare Department, I should

like  to draw attention to the fact that the  1966

provision for the Public Assistance Scheme,  which

provides financial relief for the unemployed among

our   citizens  ($9.6  million)  shows  a  welcome

reduction  as compared with this year's  provision

of $10 million. This is, indeed, a healthy sign, a

clear    indication   that   despite    Indonesian

confrontation  our unemployment problem  has  been

kept under control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members would have read in the Press  about

the public display that was given by the Singapore

Fire Brigade at Empress Place recently. It was the

first  display  of  its kind  in  the  history  of

Singapore,   and  gave  the  people  a  heartening

assurance  of  the efficiency and quality  of  the

Fire  Brigade.  In particular, I  should  like  to

mention  the  two latest items of equipment  which

have been acquired by the Fire Brigade and both of

which  were  demonstrated in the  display:  a  new

"Snorkel"   Fire  Engine,  which  is  the   latest

development  in  fire  fighting  and  particularly

adapted  for fire fighting and rescue  work  among

high  buildings,  and the Foam Cannon,  which  has

been  specially  designed  for  dealing  with  oil

fires. There are also expansion plans for the Fire

Brigade. Work is expected to start next year on  a

new  $2.5  million Fire Station to serve  the  new

satellite town that is coming up in Toa Payoh, and

plans  have  been formulated for yet another  Fire

Station  to  serve the Jurong industrial  complex.

With  the completion of these two projects  during

the  next five years, Singapore will have a  total

of seven fire stations located strategically on  a

regional  basis to provide protection against  the

hazards  of  fire, which must grow  in  a  rapidly

developing society like ours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has not,

however, forgotten that our progressive and

hard-working   population   also   needs   recreational

facilities for their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>



leisure hours. The new Faber Scenic Park, which was

officially opened last year, and the latest Raffles

Park Garden-cum-Car Park, which was recently opened

by  the Prime Minister, have already proved  to  be

Singapore's  favourite resorts during the  evenings

and   on  public  holidays.  It  is  my  Ministry's

intention to continue to increase and improve these

recreational    facilities.    A    programme    of

improvements  has  already  been  put  in  hand  to

enhance and beautify the existing facilities at the

Botanic  Gardens,  including  the  building  of  an

ornamental  bridge across the Lake, and  there  are

plans  to  extend  the Faber  Scenic  Park  to  the

adjacent  land and hill, to clean up  and  beautify

the  very popular beach resort at Nicoll Drive, and

to  provide  more children's playgrounds especially

in   the  densely  populated  areas  of  the   city

environments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister in charge of sport, I should like

to refer to the Government's plan to build an

up-to-date  sports  complex including a  National  Sports

Stadium of Olympic standards at Kallang. This is  a

major  project which, when completed, will  give  a

tremendous  boost  to  the promotion  of  sport  in

Singapore  and  will help to put Singapore  in  the

forefront in the field of international sport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic objectives and policies of the Ministry

of Culture, which have been geared to the long-term

needs,  hopes and aspirations of our  people  in  a

multi-racial society, have not required any radical

reappraisal after separation and independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continual policy of preserving the basic

elements of our four different cultural streams and

accentuating those facets of our heritage that will

ensure national unity, still stands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy can be instrumental not only in

building an abiding multi-racial society with

built-in  constitutional safe-guards for minority groups,

but can also serve as a bridge of amity between our

people   and  the  people  of  Malaysia   who   are

traditionally one people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, as in the past, the total effect of

the  various divisions of the Ministry  of  Culture

will be, on the one hand, to provide the people  of

Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



and  friendly peoples in other parts of  the  world

with essential information on the nation's policies

and  activities,  and on the other,  to  guide  and

sustain  our  people  in their cultural,  artistic,

intellectual and other pursuits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of multi-lingualism and

multi-culturalism, Radio and Television Singapura

will go on   informing,  educating  and  entertaining

our people,  and in conformity with the Government  and

people's  four  equal-language policy,  daily  news

casts   are   being  transmitted  over  radio   and

television.  Such a practice not only benefits  the

most  number  of  people but  also  reinforces  the

superstructure of our multi-racial society.  Hence,

the  practice  also of juxtaposing Malay,  Chinese,

Tamil and English programmes over television.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, over a period of time, we expect powerfully

to  demonstrate  the  virtues  of  multi-racialism,

multi-lingualism and multi-culturalism and, at  the

same  time, the futility of the one-language,

one-race and one-culture doctrine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The completion of the new Television Building and

Studios  in the middle of 1966 will result in  more

viewing  hours for our people. Also the quality  of

programmes   can  be  stepped  up   and   improved.

Television time over both channels will increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while on this subject, I gather

that  some of our viewers are annoyed with the hard

selling of merchandise over television at the  most

exciting  times of the best programmes.  Scientific

research   into  human  nature  has   revealed   to

advertisers  these  periods  as  being   the   most

effective on the sub-conscious minds of even  those

who  are apparently unhappy. The net result is more

money  from this source of revenue and a  lessening

of  the  burden  on the taxpayer for the  essential

broadcasting services and the possibility of buying

better  programmes. This practice is now universal,

and  besides  being  a  dollar earner,  advertising

stimulates economic activity in the State. In  1965

a gross return of $4.3 million is expected from the

Commercial Service, which represents 53 per cent of

the  recurrent  expenditure  for  the  broadcasting

service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>



With more time over television from the latter part

of  next  year,  the income will no doubt  increase

when  consideration  can be given  to  having  less

frequent commercials in any particular programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a State where about half a million children

are  at school, the value of educational television

cannot  be  over-emphasised. This  is  now  in  the

planning  stage  and  in 1966  a  pilot  scheme  is

expected to come into operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but by no means least, in the light of

independence,  external  publicity  has  become   a

"must".  Through  our external short-wave  networks

and through other media of publicity, including our

missions   abroad,  our  situation,  ideology   and

reaction to world affairs can be made known to  our

friends in Afro-Asia and elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acceptance of Malay as our national language

since  1959 was and is based on multi-racial logic,

political  acumen and common sense.  Internally,  a

national  language can serve several  purposes.  It

can effectively weld the various communities into a

compact  national unity. Malays, Chinese,  Indians,

and  others can think of themselves as part of  one

people who speak a common national language.  Other

advantages  also  accrue from  a  common  language.

Through  our  language policy, most of our  younger

generation  will  be in the fortunate  position  of

being bi-lingual or even tri-lingual. Their horizon

being  broadened, they will be able to pick up  the

best from the literary and technical literature  of

these languages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While accepting Malay as the national language,

our  people  are  exhorted to  study  their  mother

tongue  as  well. Language liberalism, as practised

by  us, will make for greater national progress  in

the  long  run.  A national proficient  in  several

languages  will he able to pick the best  from  the

wisdom and knowledge in the literature of the other

languages.  Apart from regular lessons  over  radio

and  television, National Language Months were held

in 1965. The first, in June 1965, generated a great

deal of enthusiasm among all sectors of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



population,  as  evinced  by  the  wide  range   of

activities  that  took place. The  second  National

Language Month, which was recently concluded, again

created a great impact on our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underlying aim is to spread the use of the

national language at all nation-wide levels. It  is

the Government's wish that employers in the private

sector provide facilities and inducements to  their

employees  to  study  the  national  language.  The

Government  will continue the same policy  in  1966

with  promise  of  more varied and more  meaningful

language activities in the coming year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, increasing importance is being

attached to the National Museum now that we  are  a

sovereign and independent nation. As the repository

of  our  cultural heritage, it has been a  constant

centre  of attraction to our own people as well  as

to  visitors.  Its modernisation is  already  under

way.   In   the  endeavour  to  stimulate  cultural

activities, funds are being secured for the  coming

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with civic organisations, the

production  of  artistic work by local  people  has

been  given  a  fillip.  A  great  number  of   art

exhibitions and other cultural activities highlight

the  year 1965. The Government encourages new modes

of expression to impart identity to our new nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Theatre Trust is empowered by

legislation  as  an  agency for promoting  cultural

activities.  It is actively engaged in  planning  a

wider range of activities for the coming year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture has endeavoured to fulfil

the  major  cultural  needs  of  the  people.  More

remains  to  be  done in the coming year,  and  the

indication  is  that  1966  will  see   a   greater

flowering   in   the  artistic,  intellectual   and

cultural activities in our State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A multi-racial society inevitably poses a greater

variety   of  problems  than  a  homogeneous   one.

Solutions to them are many - some are crabbed while

others are downright stupid. Our solution based  on

a  multi-racial rationale cannot be wrong. Our  aim

is to make our approach humane, just, practical and

acceptable. This is necessarily a difficult



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



and long-term task, and constructive criticisms and

suggestions are always welcome.



<br><br>4.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  in  discussing  our  financial

budget  for  next  year,  we  are  discussing   the

gigantic  plan  of  economic  development   of   an

emerging country. Our heart is filled with joy  and

new  hope. We have sufficient determination jointly

to shoulder the heavy task of economic construction

of our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today what gives us regret is that the Barisan

Sosialis  Opposition  are  not  shouldering   their

responsibility,   but  instead  adopt   a   passive

attitude  of  total  disregard  for  the

people - boycotting  the  Parliament.  And  when  our  newly

emerging  country is marching a step forward,  they

are trying to sabotage the progress of our country.

The  objective  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  is   to

destroy.  All  along they have  been  adopting  the

attitude   of   disruption   of   national   unity,

disrupting  the  construction of the  country,  and

destroying   the   national   economy.   They   are

harbouring the thought of turning Singapore

topsy-turvy  so  that  they can realise  their  dream  of

building  an  ideal  country  from  the  debris  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, because of their boycott, we must solemnly

point    out   their   mistakes   and   mischievous

activities.    Undoubtedly   they    should    give

responsible  constructive criticism, but  they  are

not  doing so. Instead they have engaged themselves

in   destroying   and   sabotaging   our   economic

development and national interests. Their action is

most   incomprehensible.  As  an  independent   and

emerging  country, we look forward  to  a  peaceful

struggle in order to achieve victory, but our  hope

for peace is not less than any other country's. For

the  sake  of preserving our national security  and

defence and the rights and interests of the people,

we  have  to  strengthen our  defence.  This  is  a

necessary   safeguard  for  our  independence   and

security. As an independent democratic peace-loving

country,  our  Budget is full of such spirit.  From

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



figures  of  revenue  and expenditure,  both  total

about  $500  million.  Education  will  incur  $129

million  for  next year, which is $16 million  more

than that of the previous year. Of the $275 million

for  the Development Estimates, the Ministry of Law

and  National Development gets 50 per cent  of  the

expenditure. I point out these figures in order  to

stress  a  characteristic of the whole  Budget.  In

other words, the characteristic of the whole Budget

reflects  the Government's hope of progress,  peace

and construction. They are important factors in our

march towards peace, democracy and progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning of 1966, there will be a new

Five-Year Development Plan in order to implement  a

multi-racial  society in which  there  is  economic

development and prosperity. In the first  Five-Year

Development   Plan,  the  Government  has   already

expended $192 million and built 51,000 units of

low-cost  houses,  to  provide accommodation  for

one-quarter  of our population. The Housing Board  will

in  the  next Five-Year Plan build 12,000 units  of

low-cost houses yearly. It is expected that by  the

end  of  the Five-Year Plan, 60,000 units of houses

and  shop-houses  will have been  built,  and  that

there  will  be reclamation of marshes and  beaches

and urban renewal. There will be P.W.D. development

and other construction plans. What I like to stress

is that these gigantic long-term construction plans

have  all  been stipulated in our Budget  in  order

that  we  may carry them out orderly and  that  the

planning can be done in the first year with a  good

start. This is a long-term plan and not on a

year-to-year basis. And we want to start right from  the

correct perspective. Our stand is very clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Estimates touch on reclamation of

the  sea. If there is a saying that God created the

sea  and  the Dutch created the land, then  we  can

change  it  into that God created the sea  but  the

people  of Singapore created the land. This is  the

right time for us to do so. There are many examples

in  our Budget to show that there has not been  any

miscalculation or wasting of money. It is a  Budget

in which every single



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



cent  is scrupulously used for the benefit  of  the

people.  For instance, the American Defence  Budget

for  1966,  according to the United  Press  Agency,

will  increase to U.S.$6l,000 million.  Of  course,

this  is the result of direct American intervention

in   the  Vietnamese  war.  Of  course,  I  am  not

criticising  or comparing the American Budget  with

our   Budget.  I  am  only  mentioning  it  as   an

interesting contrast. From this, you can  see  that

the  total  Budget  for 1966 for Singapore  is,  in

actual  fact,  one  part out of  366  of  America's

Defence  Budget.  Now what is the  percentage?  The

other point is that America is considering spending

$10,000 million every year on South Vietnam, mainly

on  military aid. One-sixtieth part of it  will  be

enough for Singapore's development construction for

one year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say that if the ultra adventurists or

racialist   ultra   elements   want   to    destroy

Singapore's  economic construction  and  system  in

order to turn Singapore into a hot-bed of war,  and

if  they  succeed,  then we will  not  be  able  to

discuss  the Budget. I have said that there  is  no

wasting  of money as shown in the Budget.  Speaking

from  the construction aspect, every cent has  been

well  spent,  except that $500  allowance  for  the

Barisan  Members.  They want to get  the  allowance

without  being  willing to do the  same  amount  of

work,  to shoulder their responsibilities  for  the

people.  If  the  Minister  for  Finance  wants  to

suggest  a cut in their allowance, then, on  behalf

of  the people of Jalan Besar, I fully support  him

should  he  wish  to make some adjustment  in  this

respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, our Finance Minister has ably and in

a straightforward manner presented his Budget to

this House. The Government for this year has

exempted industrialists from paying the necessary

taxes. In considering the welfare of the workers,

the Government should ensure fair wages. If

Government does not do that, productivity will go

down. Increasing productivity is important to us;

then only can prices be kept down and exports

encouraged. The Minister for Finance will have to

pay particular attention to this. Otherwise,

subversive elements will influence workers to go on

to the wrong path. Then there will be trouble in

the State. So we have to pay attention to this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance in his Budget has also ably set out arguments against back-dating. But civil servants and workers in Government have their own unions. If talks with them are prolonged, and when decisions are finally reached but the agreement is not to be back-dated, then what is the

reason for it? Is that the mistake of the unions or

the  Government?  We  must  examine  this  question

thoroughly.   When   the  unions   submit   certain

proposals,  the  officials  concerned  prolong  the

discussion.    Therefore,   the   Government    are

responsible. They should not blame the unions. They

like  to  implement it from the date on  which  the

agreement  is signed. They should look  into  this.

When  talks  are to be held, the Government  should

accelerate them and try to find decisions  quickly.

If  we do it this way, then the unions will not  be

frustrated.  They  will then  be  prepared  to

co-operate  with  the  Government and  do  their  work

properly.  I  would  therefore  like  to  ask   the

Minister  to  pay  attention  to  it.  If  we  make

concessions  to  the unions, they  will  co-operate

with us, will act responsibly and will continue  to

assist  us.  So the Minister should find  ways  and

means of doing this.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

expect our new Finance Minister to present to  this

House a deficit budget instead of a surplus



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



budget,  for a surplus budget indicates a  pedantic

luxury.  However,  the  Finance  Minister's  Budget

speech  does reflect the Government's determination

to put our economy on a sound footing. I am pleased

to  note that the Finance Minister has not  let  us

down.  The  nation  has  full  confidence  in   his

ability, and the allotment to development programme

as  well  as housing and social services  indicates

his  appreciation of the gravity of  the  situation

and  also  the  immediate necessity  to  raise  the

standard  of  living of the people by  adding  more

positive points to the economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my appreciation need not necessarily mean

that  I  fully subscribe to the ideas contained  in

every  aspect of this budget, as well as the policy

behind it. It is extremely difficult and physically

not possible to go through the entire budget with a

tooth-comb  and  offer constructive criticisms  and

suggestions. Nevertheless, I shall make an  attempt

to analyse the budget from the point of view of the

workers  who  have to contribute the  lion's  share

towards  the  successful  implementation   of   the

development programmes of our democratic  socialist

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A look at the budget tends to create a feeling of

appreciation   and  apprehension.   Regarding   our

industrialisation programme, the  Finance  Minister

appeared  to be highly optimistic about our  market

prospects in Western countries, which, according to

the  Minister's calculations, are likely to provide

outlets  for our manufactures. While congratulating

the  Minister on striking a note of optimism, I  am

afraid I cannot share his views with regard to  our

markets. I wonder whether he has been fully briefed

on the difficulties to be encountered while gearing

our  industrialisation projects to  these  overseas

markets. I am not for a moment being pessimistic or

cynical,  but I will be failing in my  duty  if  at

this juncture I do not pin-point for the Government

the drawbacks and the pitfalls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we have to make sure that these

industrialised nations would be prepared to provide

us  with  a share of their local markets.  Further,

even  if for argument's sake we agree that  we  are

assured of a certain percentage of their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



markets,  the  Minister  should  remember  that  it

introduces    a   new   economic   variable,    The

fluctuations in the markets of these countries  are

bound     to    have    repercussions    in     our

industrialisation programme, and hence the ups  and

downs in the foreign markets would create jolts and

jerks  in  our  economy. Since these industrialised

nations  might, or might not, provide  us  with  an

expanded  market  in  the long  run,  it  would  be

advisable   for  our  officials  in  the   Economic

Development  Board to study the  markets  in  these

countries,  the  fluctuations,  the  prospects  for

Singapore to enter these markets, the short-run and

the  long-run  effects, the type of products  which

could successfully compete with others in the  long

run  etc., etc. Diversification in markets as  well

as  products has to be made instead of  having  all

eggs  in one basket. Unless a proper study is made,

all  our  dreams of our economic prosperity  and  a

solution  of our unemployment problem are bound  to

remain in Utopia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An assurance of a certain percentage of the

markets of industrialised countries is unlikely  to

provide    a    long-term    solution    to     our

industrialisation programme. The expansion  of  our

pioneer   industries  essentially  depends   on   a

proportionate  expansion  of  our  markets  abroad.

Hence,  if  these overseas nations  who  might  be

willing  at  this juncture to render us  a  helping

hand by allowing or permitting us to gain access to

their  markets at the initial stage refuse to allow

us  to make further inroads into their market,  the

expansion of industries in Singapore would become a

remote  possibility, resulting in a  stagnation  in

our  economy. Thus our industrialisation  programme

and  a solution to our growing unemployed would not

become  possible in the long run if we  geared  our

economic  policies to temporary solutions,  without

taking into account the possible impact in the long

run.  Further, a change in the political  situation

in  South-East  Asia and in the strategy  of  these

nations in this part of the globe might necessitate

a re-orientation in their economic policies towards

Singapore,  which  in  turn  might  not   be   very

conducive to our industrialisation programme.  Thus

I do not think the Finance Minister's statement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



with  regard to our economic emancipation is likely

to  be  of  much  practical value to  this  nation,

unless  he  is  prepared to think in terms  of  the

shortcomings,  the obstacles, which might  crop  up

now and again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to attract foreign entrepreneurs and

foreign  capital,  and with a view  to  creating  a

climate for foreign capital, the Government has not

only  provided tax free holidays or pioneer  status

to  industries but also promised to write  oil  the

capital  in  a  matter  of few  years  through  the

provision  for heavy depreciation. While  reserving

my  comments with regard to this policy,  I  wonder

whether the Honourable Minister has at any time  or

moment  considered the measures  essential  to  see

that the huge profits are not drained off from  the

economy.  If  the return to capital is diverted  to

foreign countries, there will he no reinvestment on

expansion of industries. For the sake of industrial

expansion, the excess of profits should be siphoned

off  and ploughed back into the economy in the form

of  additional investment. Even though the  Finance

Minister stressed his plans to create a climate for

initial  investment, it looks as though he has  not

given  much credence or thought to the idea of  the

second  round of expansion. It would he interesting

to  know whether the Government has anything up its

sleeve to make sure that after laying golden  eggs,

the  hen  does not carry them back overseas.  Since

the  Government  does not supply us  with  relevant

figures for Singapore, I can safely assume,  as  in

the  case  of Malaysia, that the amount of  profits

that  has  been remitted overseas during  the  past

five  years from Singapore has far exceeded foreign

investments in this country. If that is the case, I

am afraid the industrialisation programme might not

receive  an  enthusiastic and  unqualified  support

from the population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that wage restraint is the

corner-stone  of the Government's industrialisation

programme. The workers will be only too pleased  to

make  any  legitimate sacrifices provided it  would

put  our  economy on a sound footing. Further,  the

working class should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



assured  that they are not exploited  in  order  to

fatten  the  coffers of a handful  of  unscrupulous

entrepreneurs. It appears to me that wage restraint

is  a  meaningless empty slogan which is very often

used  and  abused to make one class in the  economy

alone  shoulder heavy burdens, inconsistent with  a

welfare State. Low wages need not necessarily  mean

low  wage  cost  per unit of production.  In  other

words,  keeping the wages low need not  necessarily

reduce the cost of production or help in any  other

objective of our industrialisation programme.  High

technical    efficiency   coupled   with    skilled

managerial  personnel would more effectively  lower

the  cost  of  production than  cheap  labour.  The

United   States   products,   for   instance,   are

successfully  able  to compete in  the  continental

markets  even  though the wages of an average  U.S.

labourer  is much higher than that of the  labourer

on  the continent. Thus proper training for skilled

labour   and   specialisation  would  more   surely

canalise   our  industrialisation  in   the   right

direction  than  exploitation of  labour.  Further,

below  standard  wages would adversely  affect  the

morale   and   efficiency  of   industrial   labour

especially when there is a set pattern in Singapore

due  to  the  efficient and effective role  of  the

trade union movement. Hence we cannot and we refuse

to  accept  any  suggestion that  cheap  labour  is

essential  to  promote  industrialisation  in   our

country.  Let this Socialist Government think  more

in   terms  of  reducing  wage  cost  per  unit  of

production    through    promotion    of     skill,

specialisation  and other economies  of  production

instead of repeating the slogans that prevailed  in

a Gladstonian economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is heartening to note that the Government

intends  to  spend on education $129.2 million  for

the  year 1966. It is quite true that we should not

consider any investment in human capital a wastage.

Our   higher  institutes  of  learning,  like   the

University  of Singapore, the Singapore Polytechnic

and   Nanyang  University,  have  to  provide   the

necessary  manpower  to make our  industrialisation

programme a success. In this connection, our  Prime

Minister   has  repeatedly  stated  that  Singapore

should produce more men of science and technocrats.

But I am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



afraid  that  when,  on the  one  hand,  the  Prime

Minister  frequently  stresses  the  necessity   to

produce   more  scientists  and  technicians,   his

Government  officials  (I heard  the  Minister  for

Culture  talk  about his expansion  programme  just

now) on the other hand do not know how to make full

use of our Science graduates from the Universities.

Thus  you  have  a  sad and sorry spectacle  of  an

Honours  graduate, who has specialised  in  Nuclear

physics, being attached to the Ministry of Culture.

I  do  not  think the Ministry of Culture  has  any

intention of manufacturing atomic bombs even though

it is a pleasure to see that the message carried by

the  Mirror,  the official organ of  the  Ministry,

continues   to   radiate   its   powerful   message

throughout  Singapore  and Malaysia.  I  understand

that  there are two more Science Honours graduates,

one  specialising  in Chemistry and  the  other  in

nuclear   physics,   attached   to   the   People's

Association!  If I am not mistaken, the  investment

in  a Science graduate is approximately three times

that  of  an  Arts graduate. And if we  cannot  tap

their  talents and are only in a position to assign

them  jobs which any Arts graduate can do,  then  I

think  it would be more economic to close down  the

Science   Departments  and  concentrate   on   Arts

graduates!   Otherwise,   the   Government   should

necessarily make use of these men of science in  an

efficient  and  effective  manner  so  that   their

assistance    will    be    available    for    our

industrialisation programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our education policy should necessarily be

tailored      to     meet     requirements      for

industrialisation.  We should make  sure  that  the

manpower  available is utilised in a  manner  where

they can give their best. There should be more

co-ordination not only in policy matters but  also  in

their  implementation. Otherwise we will  be  faced

with  a situation where doctors and engineers  will

be  attached to the Ministry of Law, scientists  in

the  People's Association and Ministry of  Culture,

lawyers   in   charge   of   boiler   plants,   and

philosophers   at   the  helm   of   the   Economic

Development  Board. It is high time our  Ministers

woke up from their slumbers and do the needful.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A casual glance at the funds allocated to the

Ministries  for 1966 does indeed convince  me  that

the  expenditure  in  the public  sector  is  quite

substantial and that, as far as possible, no  undue

and  unnecessary  commitments should  be  taken  up

during  the course of the coming year. But it  need

not necessarily mean that the Government should not

honour  its pledge to its employees and treat  them

with  contempt the agreement solemnly entered  into

with  its  employees who are members of the  Public

Daily  Rated  Employees' Federation.  I  understand

from the Budget speech and the provisions made  for

different categories under the Ministries  and  the

Honourable Minister's reply to the Member for Telok

Blangah  that  the Government has no  intention  to

honour an agreement which was entered into the year

1961.  Our Minister for Finance has also quoted  F.

C. Benham. But F. C. Benham has nowhere stated that

the  Government as an employer can always toy  with

the  idea  of going back on an agreement  which  it

agreed  to implement. No economist, as a matter  of

fact,  no human being with an iota of common  sense

and  fair play, would support a breach of contract.

Today,  the  Minister has gone  to  the  extent  of

suggesting that at no time would the Government  be

prepared  to revise the emoluments of its employees

in  such  a manner that it would involve additional

commitments  in  the  form of  back  pay.  I  quite

appreciate  the Minister's capacity and  capability

in  side-tracking  the issue  with  regard  to  the

Government's  agreement  with  the  P.D.R.E.U.   He

conveniently forgot to inform the House  that  when

an agreement was signed in 1961 with the P.D.R.E.U.

it  was  `current pay' and not `back pay'. But  the

terms of this agreement were not implemented by the

Government  up to now. Hence today in 1965  it  has

become   `back   pay'.   If  the   Government   had

implemented it after the agreement signed in  1961,

then  there would be no back pay. But the agreement

was  not  implemented by the Government up to  now.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Several Members have mentioned

that  there  has  been  no  implementation  of  the

agreement. I was the Finance Minister at that time,

and  I  say  that  that agreement  has  been  fully

implemented in so far as the revision of  wages  is

concerned.  There  have been  wage  adjustments  in

several  categories of the daily-rated  workers  in

accordance   with   the  recommendations   of   the

Commission  of  Inquiry. But the  union,  for  some

reason quite unknown to me, was of the opinion  and

apparently  is  still of the opinion that  everyone

should   have  an  increase.  There  was  no   such

recommendation by the Commission of  Inquiry.  That

being  the  case, the union has no case  whatsoever

for  asking for increases in pay, and therefore the

question of back-pay does not arise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after the

Agreement of 1961 was signed, there was no revision

of  salary.  Only on the integration  of  the  City

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I knew the hon. Member was

going  to  get into trouble. He is embarking  on  a

the  financial policy of the Government. I  allowed

him   to  touch  on  this,  because  it  had   some

connection  with  the  financial  policy   of   the

Government.  But  if he is going  to  embark  on  a

debate   on   whether   the  agreement   has   been

implemented or not, then he is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> After the Government

acknowledged the 1961 collective agreement and  the

recommendations    of   the   subsequent    Inquiry

Commission, the Minister appeared before the  House

the  other day and declared, in unequivocal  terms,

that the Government has no intention to honour  its

agreement. The Minister has made a very  poor  case

to  justify  a  breach  of contract.  In  order  to

justify  this  undemocratic action, he  has  quoted

Benham which is quite irrelevant in this particular

case.  If  Government as an employer can afford  to

ignore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



the terms of a collective agreement, it will not be

a  surprise to me if the private sector too  follow

the   footsteps   of  the  Government   and   scrap

collective agreements with their respective unions.

Then  the  N.T.U.C. will not be in  a  position  to

champion  the  cause of its workers and  bring  the

employers  to book, especially when the  Government

has  set  an example to the employers. I  wish  the

Minister,  instead of devoting his time to  Benham,

could  afford to spend a few hours in going through

the  terms  and conditions of service enshrined  in

the  collective agreements entered into between the

N.T.U.C. affiliates and the respective  employers.

Perhaps  that  will provide him with the  necessary

candle-power   for   enlightenment    instead    of

irrelevant passages from Benham.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it will be quite appropriate to quote

another passage from Benham which I hope will  open

the  eyes  of our Finance Minister who  appears  to

have  a  great appreciation of Benham.  Mr  F.  C.

Benham in his report on revision of salaries in the

public  service  states: `... the total  remuneration

and  conditions of service of government employment

should  compare favourably with the net  advantages

of   private   employment.  They   should   compare

sufficiently favourably to maintain the standing of

government  as  a good employer...' Sir,  this  is  a

Report  on  the Revision of Salaries by Mr  F.  C.

Benham.  Since Mr Benham is a good friend  of  our

Finance  Minister,  we insist that  the  Government

should serve as a good employer, and that it should

compare favourably with the private sector. I  hope

the  Minister will follow in the footsteps  of  the

private  sector  which,  by  and  large,  does  not

believe  in  "breach  of  contract".  Most  of  the

employers in Singapore at least honour the terms of

a  collective  agreement. Will  the  Minister,  who

conscientiously attempts to identify  himself  with

Benham,   agree  to  honour  the  1961   collective

agreement and the recommendations of the subsequent

Commission  of Inquiry? Or will he at  least  agree

with  Mr  Benham that the Government should  be  a

good employer and hence consider itself obliged  to

honour  the collective agreement? If it  tears  off

collective agreements



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



in  this  fashion, then  the  daily-rated

employees are likely to lose faith in any assurance

given  by  the Government, and this development  is

definitely  not going to promote healthy

employer-employee relations between the Government

and  its employees.  I hope, at this late hour, that

wisdom will   prevail   and   that  necessary   additional

provisions   will  be  made  in   the   Budget   to

accommodate   justice,  so  that  when   Government

representatives  attest  their  signatures  to  any

collective agreement, it does carry weight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I have only to add that the first Budget

of  an  independent Singapore does present  a  rosy

picture.  Nevertheless, it is like a ship which  is

sailing  against  the  current  and  weather,   and

through  seas which are never calm. It must survive

the  changing conditions of each day, yet  navigate

nearer   the  chosen  journey's  end.  The  Finance

Minister has made a good start, and I hope he  will

take us to the `high sea to progress'.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I was enjoying myself  listening  to

the  Back-benchers until the Member for Bras  Basah

stood up and woke me up from my pleasant dream.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Budget time is Opposition time,

and  normally a responsible Opposition should  take

the  opportunity to examine critically  the  fiscal

policies  of  the Government for the corning  year,

and where they defer, to make their opinions known,

and,  if possible, help to formulate policies which

will  lead  us to prosperity. But today and  during

the last few days, we see empty benches in front of

us.  And here I entirely agree with the Member  for

Delta  that  the people of Singapore will  not  and

should not forget the dereliction of duty shown  by

a most irresponsible lot of Members of the opposite

Bench.  Many reasons have been given as to why  the

Opposition have chickened from the open debate. One

reason  is probably that during the last few years,

they  have  lost out in the open debate. They  have

clearly  shown their colours; they have shown  that

they  never  had  the interests of  the  people  of

Singapore at heart and that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



they  are not loyal to this country. Their  absence

here  during the first Parliament of an independent

Singapore  in  which important policies  are  being

debated is an added testimony to the fact that they

have  never  had  the interest  of  the  people  of

Singapore at heart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some other reasons too, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  but I would only expand on one which  reminds

me  the story of a fox which has lost its tail. The

story  goes  that the fox was trapped and  after  a

great  deal of struggle, he managed to escape,  but

left  his  tail behind, as a result of which  other

foxes  made  fun of him. One day he  had  a  bright

idea.  He  called all the foxes together  and  told

them that a tail was not a nice thing to have, that

it  was  a  dangerous thing to have,  that  it  was

difficult  to keep it clean and that therefore  all

of  them  should have their tails off. A number  of

them were persuaded, but up rose a bright young fox

who  said,  "Will you, Sir, turn round and  let  us

see?" That was the end of the scheme. And so it  is

with  the  Barisan. Their leader, having  lost  his

seat  in the Assembly, is now persuading the  other

Members  that the Assembly is not a useful  adjunct

to  the democratic way of government. Whether there

will  be a body as intelligent as the bright  young

fox  among  the Barisan, only time will tell,  and,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  fortunately  I  am  saved  the

embarrassment of a monologue on the Budget  by  our

Back-benchers  who have bravely  stepped  into  the

breach. Mr Speaker, Sir, I am wondering whether it

would  be possible for you to divide the emoluments

that  are  due  to the Members opposite,  who  have

disgracefully absented themselves here,  among  the

Government  Back-benchers for  carrying  out  their

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is time for me now

to   summarise  some  of  the  opinions  and  views

expressed  by  the Back-benchers on the  Government

side.  I am glad that they have shown a great  deal

of interest and have taken time to look through the

Budget.  The  absence of the Barisan Sosialis  here

does  not make any difference at all to the  Budget

debate   because,  from  past  experience,  nothing

constructive  has ever come from their  side:  they

are not constructive people,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



they  are  destructive, and the opinions that  they

have offered here are most sterile.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I will take up the suggestion of the

Member for Punggol with regard to export credit.  I

do not know whether Members are aware that at least

during   tile   last  few  months,   the   Economic

Development Board have been assisting exporters  in

financing  the purchase of raw materials for  goods

ordered  and to he exported abroad. The  suggestion

made  is  a  good one, and we are now studying  the

various  schemes in different countries to  see  in

what  way they can he adopted here. I am also glad,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  that in putting  forward  this

suggestion, the Member for Punggol is also aware of

the  abuses that may arise. Also there are  certain

factors  existing among our neighbouring  countries

which  make it quite difficult for us to  implement

some  export  credit  or  insurance  scheme.  I  am

referring  to  the instability of the  currency  in

some of our neighbouring countries, but whatever it

is,   I   have  already  asked  for  an  exhaustive

examination  into all the problems  which  must  be

resolved   before   our   export   trade   can   be

substantially increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what is uppermost in the minds of the trade

union Members on our Back Benches is the problem of

back-pay.  I  would like to remind Members  that  I

have  already gone into the reasons why it  is  not

possible  for Government to encourage back-pay.  My

friend the Member for Bras Basah has accused me  of

being  irrelevant  for quoting  Benham.  But  I  am

wondering  whether  he will  agree  if  I,  as  the

Minister  for Finance, back-date revenue  increases

and  ask  him  for back-payment on his income  tax,

because, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already  made  it

clear  that  no government can carry out  its  work

properly if, at any time, it can be presented  with

a bill for back-pay. It is not the intention of the

Government  to  penalise the workers  if  delay  in

coming to an agreement is the responsibility of the

Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention was made that delay in coming to an

agreement on any wage claim is always the fault  of

the  Government. It is not always so, because trade

unions are known also to adopt delaying tactics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform the House that as recently

as  about  a  fortnight ago, the Arbitration  Court

handed down an award to the postal workers, and  it

was back-dated to about nine or ten months from the

day of the award. Therefore, as I have said, we  do

not want to encourage the payment of back-pay, but,

at  the  same  time,  if  we  find  that  there  is

justification for it, the Government will always be

reasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the Member for Bras Basah who has

accused   the  Government  of  not  honouring   its

agreement with the daily-rated workers.  I  do  not

know whether it is due to a lapse of memory on  his

part,  or  because  it  is just  to  embarrass  the

Government that he has made his accusation, because

I  have here before me an extract of the record  of

the minutes of the meeting held on 27th July, 1965,

with  the  Prime Minister, at which representatives

of the Public Daily-Rated Unions Federation and the

N.T.U.C. were present. I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Claims for fresh revision of wages should be

regarded  as outside the scope of the Agreement  of

1961  and  the Union would be at liberty to  submit

fresh  claims on revision of wages for  negotiation

after   settlement   of  the  other   two   issues:

disciplinary  and  grievance  procedures  and   job

evaluation  exercise  of  ten  outstanding   grades

involving about 300 odd employees. In the event  of

failure  to  reach  agreement in  the  negotiation,

consideration would be given for the claims  to  be

referred to arbitration.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Mr Speaker, shows that all outstanding

issues  have  been  resolved,  and  there   is   an

agreement  that  any fresh claims would  be  looked

into  after  disciplinary and grievance  procedures

and job evaluation exercise have taken place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, while the Member for Bras Basah

agrees   with  the  Government's  industrialisation

programme,  I  think he does not look  with  favour

upon   what   he  calls  "huge  profits   made   by

entrepreneurs".  I am sure he is  jumping  the  gun

here,  because we are just starting and  I  am  not

aware of any pioneer industries that have made huge

profits.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member went on to the second stage of

expansion. We always take one step at a  time,  and

this  is where I think the trade unionists  have  a

great  responsibility, and that is,  "Do  not  look

optimistic about the profits that are to be made by

manufacturers." The Member for Bras Basah has  said

that  I  am  being  optimistic in  my  estimate  of

markets  abroad. I say that he is being  optimistic

in   his   estimate  of  profits  to  be  made   by

manufacturers, because, as far as I know,  none  of

the pioneer industries have paid dividends yet.  As

regards  his fear that if and when these  companies

do  pay  dividends  the profits  will  be  remitted

overseas,  I  think  my  predecessor  has   already

informed  this House last year that more than  half

of the investments in the pioneer industries are by

local   people;  so  there  is  no  likelihood   of

remittances being sent abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said just now, the trade

unionists  have a great responsibility to  shoulder

in  that  if  we  are  to secure overseas  markets,

whether  we are guaranteed a certain percentage  or

not, the quality and price of our products must  be

competitive.  And  this is where  our  productivity

comes  in.  I would suggest to the trade  unionists

among our Members here that this is not the time to

look backwards but to look forwards and ensure that

there  is discipline on the Floor, discipline among

the  rank and file, and that the efficiency of  our

workers is such that our entrepreneurs will be able

to  compete, and compete successfully,  in  markets

overseas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Assembly approves the financial policy

of the Government for the year 1966.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a common saying among the Chinese masses

which goes as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[The Minister read the quotation in Mandarin which

he then translated into English as follows]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Good men do not become soldiers; good iron does

not go into making nails.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This popular Chinese saying originated among the

Chinese folk. The reason for it is not far to seek.

China's long history is interspersed with years  of

violence.   Then,  as  the  fortunes  of   imperial

dynasties  declined, ambitious men rose to  contend

for mastery over the empire. And it was the fate of

the  ordinary  people to provide or  to  be

press-ganged  into military service for one or the  other

of  the  contending parties. It is not  surprising,

therefore,  that military service  is  not  popular

when  a  soldier risks his life not for his country

or  for  his people, but for the advantage  of  one

contending  group  or  another.  Whoever  wins,  he

loses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position we are facing in Singapore today is

completely   different  from   that   of   dynastic

struggles  of  former imperial China.  Accordingly,

the  Chinese saying I have quoted becomes dangerous

folly. Our army is to be engaged in the defence  of

our country and people against external aggression.

Today  we  are unable to do this task by ourselves.

It  is  no use pretending that without the  British

military  forces  in Singapore  today,  the  island

cannot  be easily overrun within a matter of  hours

by  any  neighbouring country within  a  radius  of

1,000  miles, if any of these countries care to  do

so.  Everybody  -  and  this includes  the  Barisan

Sosialis  -  can  see  that at  least  one  of  our

neighbouring  countries does care  to  do  so.  The

Barisan Sosialis hope that when this happens,  they

would  be  "top dogs", or rather I should say  "top

running  dogs". So they hoped before 30th September

this year!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British military protection today has made quite

a  number of our citizens complacent about the need

to  conduct  our  own  defence preparations.  These

people   assume  that  this  protection   will   be

permanent.  I regard it as the height of  folly  to

plan our future on this assumption. And if there is

any basis on which we, as an independent country,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 543</b></font><br><br>



can plan our future, it will be on the opposite assumption,

that is, the removal of the British military preserve at some

time in the future.  Nobody - neither we nor the British - can

say when this will be. It may be 5, 10 or 15 years - maybe longer,

maybe shorter. Whatever the time maybe, it will be useless then

to think of building up our defence forces. The time to do so

is now, and the Bill before the House provides for the establishment

and maintenance of the Singapore Army.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the main provisions of the Bill. Part II provides

for the establishment of the Army and its Reserve.  Part III provides

for the establishment of an Army Board, the Chairman and Members of which

will be appointed by the Minister. The Board will be responsible for the

overall administration and discipline of the Army.  It is empowered, subject

to appeal to the President, to vary the conditions of service to permit a

soldier to extend the term of his commitment or be placed in the Reserve.

It may also, with the approval of the President, vary the basis of persons

to be enlisted in the Army.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Bill deals with discipline and provides for punishable offences

and due execution of the sentences imposed.  Provision is also included for the

convening of courts-martial and the appointment of a Judge Advocate - General.

Part IV is applicable not only to the Army but also to the other Services, such

as the Navy and the Air Force, if and when they are formed. Now the offences of

mutiny and sedition in the Armed Forces are punishable with the maximum sentence of

death. Those falsifying statements and documents shall receive a sentence of two years'

imprisonment.  In order that the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts will not be

interfered with, provision is included that a person who is subject to military law

shall not ordinarily be tried by court-martial for offences such as treason and murder,

unless the offender was at that time on active military service. Although a court-martial

may try person subject to military law for any offence, provision is contained in clause

63,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 544</b></font><br><br>



subclause (2) that the President shall have power to mitigate or remit any sentence passed

by a court-martial.  Clause 64 provides for the appointment by the President of a person

in the legal or judicial service with not less than five years' service, or a person

qualified under the Advocates and Solicitors' Ordinance with not less than five years'

experience, as a Judge Advocate-General. The duties of a Judge Advocate-General shall include

the appointment of a Judge Advocate at court-martial, and the tendering of advice to the Army Board

on the validity of the findings and sentences of courts martial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is included in Part V of the Bill for the commissioning and promotion of offices by the

President, who is also empowered to cancel commissions. Provision is also included in this Part

for the President to grant honourary commissions to suitable persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The qualifications of persons for enlistment and conditions of discharge and transfer to the

reserves are included in Part VI of the Bill. In brief, a person for enlistment must, among other things,

satisfy the qualification of Singapore citizenship. The enlistment or commissioning of others on the

recommendation of the Army Board is also provided for in clause 97. A soldier may be discharged on sentence

by court-martial or by order from the President.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VII includes general provisions like summoning of witnesses for courts-martial and the rules of evidence.

The conduct of proceedings at courts-martial and the admission or rejection of evidence shall be subject to laws made

by Parliament. Rules of evidence as adopted at proceedings at courts-martial are the same as those followed in

civil courts in Singapore. Other provisions included in Part VII are of a routine nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I speak in support of the Singapore Army Bill introduced by the Hon.Minister

of Defence. I am not going to touch on the Bill in detail, but I shall touch on matters of general policy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 545</b></font><br><br>



I must stress that the building up of a Singapore Army is an absolute necessity. We need to build an army to protect and

defend our national integrity and sovereignty because we must always beware of the territorial ambitions of a hungry neighbour

whose country is many times bigger than Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is because we are a small country that we must be prepared at all times to meet any emergency. There is an order in an

army parade - that is, the order "On guard" is occasionally used to test the alertness of the soldiers when a parade is held.  So this

House will fully agree with me that we must be on guard at all times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Singapore is a small multi-racial nation, I therefore think our army that is to be built should also be multi-racial in character.

As I have just mentioned, Singapore is a small island nation. But the very fact that Singapore is a very prosperous nation in which her people

are enjoying the highest standard of living in South-East Asia is amongst her bigger and stronger neighbours. This may, therefore, tempt her

bigger and hungry neighbours to try to swallow us up, not only to rob us of our hard-earned wealth, but also of our homes and also with a view

to enslaving us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure you yourself would not like to be shackled nor put in chains. Further, I think all able young men who have the interests of our

country at heart should choose army life as a career. They can be assured of an interesting and adventurous life in the army. In doing this, we will

show to our neighbours that even though we are  a small nation, yet we are not an easy prey for them. We have the determination to ensure our survival

as an independent and sovereign nation. We mean to keep what we have built and achieved in the past six years, and also to chart a course in which an equal

and more just, muiti-racial, multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-cultural nation will emerge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, to those anti-national elements who think they can create trouble in our midst, I have this to say. I think the army is not going to lie or keep

still



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 546</b></font><br><br>



while the interests and security of our country are threatened. The army, I am  positive, will deal a strong blow at such elements. So, all in all, I strongly

urge this House to give its fullest support to the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I rise to support this Bill because our nation needs a national defence based not only on

equipment but also on people with the spirit of dedication, and a desire to have peace in the Republic of Singapore.  Our Republic must be defended at all costs

and by all means against our external and internal enemies. They intend to create trouble or invade our country. The responsiblity of the people of the Republic

of Singapore is to defend their integrity to the last drop of their blood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, not only do the Barisan Sosialis have no interest at all to defend the Republic of Singapore, but they intend to surrender our sovereignty to their

foreign masters, like the Communist Party of Indonesia, with the fate of its leader, Aidit, still unknown. The Barisan Sosialis have acted in an irresponsible manner

towards the country. I think there is a small responsiblity on the part of the Barisan Sosialis to carry, and yet they have failed to discharge it. When I say

"small responsiblity", I mean voicing their arguments in parliamentary debate. What is more, Mr Speaker, we cannot depend on them to defend our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our country has no army, inevitably all our property, including that of Dato David Marshall, will be confiscated and plundered. If our enemies, like the army

of the P.K.I., were to conquer the Republic of Singapore, there would be no more law or the right of property. Land and propery will be confiscated by our enemy without

compensation at all. Dato David Marshall has expressed his anxiety for the right to own property which must be written into the constitution. Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill

will safeguard not only land belonging to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



Dato  David Marshall but also the property  of  all

the people of the Republic of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we cannot always depend on our

neighbour's  soldiers to defend  us,  although  our

neighbour has given an assurance that it will  help

us.  We  must  have  second  thoughts.  Because  of

political  developments, we fear that  our  country

may  be invaded by enemies. Our neighbour says that

they  will  send their troops to defend  us.  Their

troops are stationed in Perlis, Penang, Sarawak and

Sabah.  If  we  have  to wait 24  hours  for  their

arrival, our country will be saved. But if we  have

to   wait  for  one  week,  our  country  wilI   be

destroyed,  for when the reinforcements  arrive.  I

think they will be of no use to us. Therefore,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, the army of the Republic of Singapore

must  be  strengthened so that we  can  defend  our

independent and sovereign State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this matter of defence is the

bounden  duty of all of us who owe our  loyalty  to

the  country.  We  have  to  defend  not  only  our

property but also to preserve international law and

order.  On that note, I end my speech. Mr Speaker,

Sir.



<br><br>6.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Singapore  Army

Bill. With Singapore's independence, it becomes the

responsibility of our citizens to defend the State.

The  British were responsible for our defence,  and

we  had no need for an army of our own. But  it  is

not  desirable  for us to depend on foreign  forces

all  the  time. When we were part of Malaysia,  the

Central  Government  bore  the  responsibility   of

defence. But after we were ejected, our defence has

become our own problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last world war, we had known what

would happen to a country which depended on foreign

forces  for  its  defence. In  December  1941,  the

Japanese  bombed  Singapore.  Although  there  were

100,000 British troops here, the Japanese were able

to capture this country in two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



months.  And  now,  two  neighbouring

countries  - Malaysia  and  Indonesia - are not  maintaining  the

best of relations with us. Therefore, we should  be

alert to defend ourselves in all circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Deputy Prime Minister spoke, he referred

to  the Three Kingdoms of China. We should not face

such  a  situation. There were two racial riots  in

Singapore, and it is our responsibility to maintain

peace  so  that there is no such repetition.  There

are  subversive forces which would  like  to  bring

about confusion. They have not been eliminated.  If

we  have  sufficient security, we will be  able  to

manage any situation. The defence of the nation and

the maintenance of peace need our own army. That is

why  I  praise  the  Minister who  has  tabled  the

Singapore  Army  Bill. There are  forces  like  the

Barisan  Sosialis who propagate that the people  of

Singapore should not join their own army.  When  we

were  part  of  Malaysia, when  people  were  being

enrolled  in  the  security  forces,  the   Barisan

Sosialis came out in opposition. At that time,  the

reason  they gave was that such an army  was  being

raised to fight Indonesia. Then they were in favour

of Indonesia. At the same time, the Indonesian Army

sent  its  agents  into Malaysia and  Singapore  to

carry  out  subversion and sabotage. When Indonesia

sought  volunteers  for  West  Irian,  the  Barisan

Sosialis  sent their friends secretly to  Indonesia

for  training. After 30th September, there were big

clashes in Indonesia between the Communists and the

Army, and the Barisan Members are now in a state of

hopeless confusion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are issuing statements asking the Indonesian

Army  not  to strike or work against the Indonesian

Chinese  and the Peking regime. But the  Indonesian

Army  is crushing the Chinese in Indonesia.  If  we

are  going  to  prevent  the Indonesian  Army  from

crushing  us  in Singapore, we should establish  an

army  and we should support it. I therefore support

this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.
