<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, it is Government's policy to nominate

introducing  a  Bill  to  make  amendments  to  the

Dangerous  Drugs  Ordinance at this  sitting.  This

Bill  includes  an  amendment to the  existing  law

which makes a prison sentence mandatory in the case

of  first  offenders who are considered  unsuitable

for  treatment at an opium treatment centre. It  is

not, however,  intended  to  provide  that   all

offenders shall be sent to such centres.

me to anticipate any statement that I might make in

moving the Budget.

that   many  employers  in  commercial  firms  have

increased   the   personal  emoluments   of   their

employees due to certain unfavourable fluctuations,

<div align="center"><b>(Relief Measures)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Lim Koon Teck</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Works what steps have been taken

to relieve the congestion of the traffic at-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the junction of Paya Lebar and Yio Chu Kang Roads; and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the 6th milestone Yio Chu Kang Road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I think perhaps I ought first to make

clear,  Mr  Speaker,  that there  is  no  junction

between Yio Chu Kang Road and Paya Lebar Road. They

both join Upper Serangoon Road at points about  300

yards apart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of proposals in connection

with  traffic congestion. The problem in this  area

has  been  considered by the Highways Co-ordination

Committee which has large-scale proposals extending

from  here  to the Merdeka Bridge. The whole  thing

links  up.  In  this  particular  area  the  works

include  a  widening of the Yio Chu Kang Road  from

the  junction  of  Upper  Serangoon  Road,  to  the

Serangoon  Garden  Estate, and a  by-pass  to  give

direct  connection to Upper Serangoon Road  at  its

junction with Paya Lebar Road. The widening of  the

Yio Chu Kang Road on each side at the 6th milestone

will commence when the land acquisition proceedings

and  removal of' squatters have been completed; and

the local authorities are being requested to' carry

out  the  by-pass scheme which should also  include

the  roundabout  at the Paya Lebar/Serangoon  Roads

junction.  Further relief in this  immediate'  area

will  require  widening the  Upper  Serangoon  Road

between  the  Yio  Chu Kang and Paya  Lebar  Roads'

junctions, but as this would involve demolition of'

shophouses, it is not an immediate possibility.

<div align="center"><b>1956-1957 SCHOOL DEVELOPMENT PLANS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Minister for

Education whether he will give details of the 1956-1957  development  plan  for  English  schools  and

Vernacular schools; and whether he has any plan for

building  a  Malay secondary school in the  Siglap-Bedok area.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in general

the  primary  school  programme  provides  for  the

building of 18 schools a year. The present standard

type  schools have 15 class-rooms. The new  schools

will have 18 class-rooms.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



In  addition, a number of smaller schools  will  be

built  in the rural areas. Some of the new  schools

will  be  vernacular  schools  if  the  demand   is

sufficient and if competent teachers are available.

Where the demand does not justify the use of a full

school,  the Government proposes, as an experiment,

to  introduce  Chinese or Malay  stream  into  some

schools where the medium of instruction is English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the two secondary technical

schools  which have been completed this year,  work

has  just started on two academic secondary schools

of  which one is to be a Malay school. This will be

at  Dunman  Road in Katong and not in  the  Siglap-Bedok  area. Provision is being sought in the  1957 Estimates  for  the building of six more  secondary

schools of which the present intention is that  two

should  be  Chinese  schools and  one  a  technical school.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> To (a) the answer is there is

no  new  Chinese  Education Policy apart  from  the

policy  laid  down in the White Paper.  The  policy

applies  to all schools, and aided Chinese  schools

will  have  exactly the same degree of autonomy  as

aided English schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) I would refer the hon. Member to the relevant

sections  of  the All-Party Committee  Report,

especially sections K, L, and M, and to paragraphs     17, 19, 20, 21 and 22 of the White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The answer is yes.

<div align="center"><b>HOSPITAL AT KALLANG AIRPORT SITE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Lim Koon Teck</b> asked the Minister for Health-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) whether plans for the proposed Hospital at the Kallang Airport site have been

completed; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) whether Government has decided to establish a

temporary cottage hospital there

pending completion of the District Hospital.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. J. Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) plans for the Kallang Hospital are

practically completed but the finalisation  of  the

detailed plans, which are under study by the P.W.D.

architects  in  consultation with the  Ministry  of

Health, is dependent upon the site. The site at the

old    Kallang   Airport   ground   presents    two

difficulties.  First, it has been ascertained  that

the hospital will be in the "flight funnel" for the

take-off  and  landing of all civil  aircraft.  The

question  whether the noise created by the aircraft

will  be  detrimental to the health of the patients

has  been  put before the Medical Advisory Council.

The next difficulty is the extra expense in piling,

for it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



has  been  found that the foundations of  a  multi-storeyed  building will be comparatively  costlier.

An    alternative   site   at   Bedok   is    under

consideration. The delay in the final  decision  on

the site is in no way hampering the planning of the

building.  It is expected that it will be  possible

to  start construction of this hospital sometime in

1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Government has decided to allot the old

Terminal  Building  to the Singapore  Youth  Sports

Centre. A detailed study of the requirements  of  a

cottage  hospital  reveals that  expenditure  on  a

temporary  project  cannot  be  justified  by  the

resulting  benefit to the public. It is  considered

better  to  press  forward with  the  plans  for  a

permanent  district hospital. Government,  however,

has been given the Malayan Airways canteen which is

planned to be converted into an out-patient  clinic

and  dispensary. This will be able to cater for 600

patients  a  day  and  work on that  will  commence

almost immediately.

on which the Assembly is sitting during the present

session  due  order and decorum are maintained  and

preserved  in  and  around  the  precincts  of  the

Assembly House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is clearly desirable that

the   deliberations  of  the  Assembly  should   be

conducted in an atmosphere



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



of calm, uninfluenced by public demonstrations, and

that  therefore such demonstrations should  not  be

permitted  in  the vicinity of the  Assembly  House

while the Assembly is sitting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United Kingdom all meetings and assemblies

of  more than 50 persons have been forbidden within

a  distance of one mile from Westminster Hall while

either House of Parliament is sitting. In addition,

the  House  of  Commons at the  beginning  of  each

session  of  Parliament  makes  a  Sessional  Order

addressed  to the Commissioner of Police requesting

him to ensure freedom of access to the House and to

prevent disorder. The Commissioner then issues  the

necessary   directions  regarding  assemblies   and

processions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore the Deputy Commissioner of Police

has  powers  under the Minor Offences Ordinance  to

make, with the Governor's previous approval, orders

forbidding  processions and assemblies. In  October

last  year, Sir, on your representation, the Deputy

Commissioner  made an order forbidding  processions

and assemblies while the Assembly is sitting within

an  area bounded by Stamford Canal, the sea  front,

the  left  bank of the Singapore River,  and  North

Bridge Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is felt, Sir, that it would be wise to follow

United Kingdom practice in this matter and for  the

House to pass a resolution at the beginning of each

session  to request the Commissioner of Police  to

make such orders and take such other action as  may

be  necessary  to  ensure that there  shall  be  no

disorder  in the vicinity of the Assembly House  on

any  day on which the Assembly is sitting.  Sir,  I

beg to move.

move the motion standing in my name,

namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly expresses its thanks to His

Excellency  the Governor for his Address  delivered

on Wednesday, 29th August, 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the one week's

adjournment has given the Opposition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



ample time to study the Governor's Address and this

traditional  motion is to give them an  opportunity

to   debate  and  criticise  the  policy   of   the

Government.  There  has been talk  that  some  hon.

Members  are waiting for this day to come  so  that

they can unleash the fury of their attack. This  is

indeed,   Sir,  a  very  healthy  sign,   for   our

parliamentary form of government demands  a  virile

and constructive Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first business sitting of the

Assembly since I took office as Chief Minister last

June,   and  I  am  therefore  taking  this   first

opportunity of making a lengthy statement on why  I

accepted office and what are the Government's plans

for Merdeka.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accepted office, Sir, because I believed that I

had  the  confidence  of the  public,  and  I  have

received  no  indication that this  confidence  has

waned.  I believed that there was a job to be  done

in  the interests of the people and that it was  my

duty,  as  a Malayan, not to shirk it. I  sincerely

believed  that  it was the desire of  the  people's

representatives  in this Assembly to  have  another

crack at the Colonial Office. I sincerely believed,

and  still sincerely believe, Sir, that when I lead

the   next  delegation  to  London  to  resume  the

constitutional talks, I would have the full support

and  co-operation of all Parties in this  Assembly.

These were my beliefs which led me to accept office

as  Chief  Minister, an office to which,  in  God's

truth,  I did not aspire. These beliefs have  given

me  sustenance in the carrying out  of  a  job,  in

fact,  two  jobs  which are  onerous  and,  at  the

present  time, full of difficulties. If my  beliefs

are unfounded, then I shall have no strength and no

confidence left in me to continue working  for  the

task that is immediately ahead of us - the attainment

of   complete  internal  self-government - and  I  am

therefore,  Sir, asking this House  to  confirm  or

shatter those parts of my beliefs as have a  direct

bearing on them. This motion, Sir, is therefore  to

be treated as a vote of confidence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I formed my Government with the same

colleagues   who  held  office  in   the   previous

Government, without any change in their  portfolio,

although this meant that I have to tackle two jobs - that  of Chief Minister and of Minister for  Labour

and  Welfare. I did this, Sir, in order to have the

advantage  of  continuity of  personnel  to  ensure

continuity  of  policy.  I  did  not  seek  further

coalition to strengthen the Government and  sustain

us in office. The Labour Front Coalition Government

do  not  propose to hold office up to 1959, the  natural  life  of  this Assembly  under  the  present

constitution.  The  Government  propose  to  reopen

talks  with the Colonial Office by April next  year

for complete internal self-government. If the talks

are  successful, a new constitution will come  into

being;  and if we fail, the purpose of my accepting

office will have come to an end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been silent, and deliberately so, on our

plans for Merdeka because I feel a new strategy  is

called  for  as a result of experience gained  over

the  failure of the last talks. This time  we  must

plan, and plan well, so that we can negotiate  from

a  position  of  strength. In this  planning  there

will,  of course, be consultations with Members  of

the  Opposition  with a view to united  effort  and

united  action. Let us not play party  politics  in

this  great  task. Let us, however, show  that,  as

true  Malayans,  we are united  in  the  fight  for

Merdeka, because in unity we beget strength and  in

unity  we  brook  no failure. This is  another  big

reason,  Sir, which impels me to ask this House  to

treat my motion as a vote of confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I visited London last July to attend the

Labour Administration Conference in Oxford, I  took

the   opportunity  offered  me  to  have   informal

discussions with the Secretary of State, and  I  am

strongly convinced that if the Government have  the

fullest support and co-operation of the Opposition,

there  can  be no failure when the next  delegation

goes to London.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have set, Sir, April 1957 as the latest date

for  the  reopening of the talks with the  Colonial

Office,  but this date can be advanced  by  two  or

three months if our plans are ready by then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am most conscious of the fact that the

Government   and   the   Opposition   are   equally

represented in this House. We are back again to the

16-a-side. During the previous session of this House

one  hon.  Member was wont to point out at  various

times  that  the  Government Benches  had  only  12

elected Members against 13 in the Opposition. I was

quite  aware of the reasons which prompted  him  to

launch this criticism. Today this side of the House

has only 11 elected Members, whereas the opposition

ranks  have  increased by one. Be that as  it  may,

Sir, I am not in the least dismayed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are at present working under the Rendel

Constitution,  a  constitution which  we  have  all

expressed a desire to throw out, and I have already

described  how  best we can achieve  this.  I  have

already  stated, Sir, that I did not  seek  further

coalition to sustain us in office, because the work

that  we  set  out to do during our short  term  of

office  has, I believe, the support of all  Members

of  this  House. I know the feeling  of  this  hon.

Member  towards me and this is not a  challenge  to

him at all. It is just a statement of facts and  it

is  because  I  am most conscious of  these  facts,

apart  from  the  two other reasons  which  I  have

already mentioned, that I find it imperative that I

should ask this House to treat my motion as a  vote

of confidence. My colleagues and I are prepared and

at all times willing to roll up our sleeves and put

our  heart and soul into the service of the  people

of  this fair land of ours, if we can feel that the

goal of Merdeka has the support and co-operation of

Opposition  Members, because,  as  I  have  already

explained, Sir, it is only with this support and co-operation that Merdeka can be attained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I invite the attention of hon. Members to

paragraph 62 of the Governor's Address which  deals

with  the  relationship  with  the  Federation   of

Malaya.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



Since  I  became Chief Minister, I have  maintained

close  and  friendly contacts with  the  Federation

Chief  Minister  in order to bring about  a  better

understanding  and  appreciation  of   our   common

problems,  aims and aspirations. I am happy  to  be

able  to  say that our relationship has  been  most

friendly  and fruitful and both of us are  striving

to keep it so. What I have been trying to build up,

Sir,  has received a setback by the attack  of  the

P.A.P. on the Federation Government. The  People's

Action Party, like the Labour Front, stands  for  a

united  Malaya, but their method of bringing  about

this unity is one which we all deplore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I will speak briefly, indeed very

briefly, on the plans that the Government  have  to

bring about a better and a happier Singapore. These

have  been  described  in  greater  detail  in  the

Governor's  Address. I know some hon.  Members  are

very  anxious  to  hurl  their  criticisms  and   I

therefore  do not propose to prolong the  agony  of

their anxiety. The Government welcome criticisms as

long as they are constructive, because we thrive on

criticism. I have not elaborated, Sir, on our plans

at  this stage because we want to hear the views of

Opposition Members before we get down to  the  task

of  putting  the Government's policy  into  action.

Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  I  rise  to  second  the   motion,

reserving my right to speak at a later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

it  is  most  welcome to note that  the  Government

recognises that for national prosperity there  must

be cooperation between employers and employees. The

constant  preaching  of  this  philosophy  by   the

Liberal-Socialists during the  past  year  has  not

been  in vain, and we hope that the Government will

pursue this policy steadfastly. In contrast to  the

pride  expressed  by the ex-Chief  Minister  of  the

endless number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



strikes  last  year, the Government  realises  that

such acts are wasteful and damaging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in His Excellency's Address the

Government  stands  for  the  early  attainment  of

complete  internal  self-government.  Although  the

expression is exactly the same as that used in  the

Address  last  year, we hope that with  more  sober

leadership  this  will be attained  at  an  earlier

date.  The Chief Minister today has asked  for  the

support  of all other Parties in this Assembly  for

this   mission.  Merdeka  is  also  our  goal   and

certainly  he  will  receive our  support  in  this

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in spite of all this, the Government cannot

escape  criticism on all its omissions, failure  to

carry  out  its  promises  as  well  as  its   many

shortsighted policies. In the field of commerce and

industry, Government hopes to promote the expansion

of  industries. It also hopes that  the  people  of

Singapore  will invest in new projects.  The  other

hopes   are   that,  as  a  consequence   of   such

expressions,   foreign  capital  will   flood   the

Singapore  market  to increase its  prosperity  and

employment opportunities. There are also  hopes  to

assist    small-scale    manufacturers,    farmers,

livestock  rearers and fishermen. It  seems  to  me

that  the  Government lives on hopes, but  I  would

like  to warn our Ministers that mere existence  on

hopes  will  never bring about the  realisation  of

their  dreams.  Action is needed and  we  need  the

right type of action as well as approach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The friendly contacts and discussions with our

neighbours  brought back absolutely  nothing  worth

while   to   Singapore.  Apart  from  the  pleasant

reception  accorded  to our  trade  delegates,  the

mission   claimed   that  it  had   persuaded   the

Indonesian Government to sell us a few tons of low-grade  rubber. But from the accounts given  by  our

rubber  dealers  as  well as the  newspapers,  such

contracts  for sale were completed even before  the

mission left the shores of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-standing difficulties of our fishermen

and   fish   merchants,  fishing  or   working   in

Indonesian or near Indonesian waters, are still not

solved. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



currency  difficulties in connection  with  trading

with  Indonesia  experienced by our  importers  and

exporters  are  still formidable  barriers  to  our

entrepot trade, and therefore to our earnings. Even

in  the  frequent  discussions  with  our  brothers

across  the Straits, the Government have  not  been

able  to  negotiate anything substantial that  will

benefit Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministers talk about assisting industries,

but  let  me  ask them where our manufacturers  can

sell their finished products. Singapore has to face

competition  from Hongkong and Japan, and  yet  the

only   and   nearest   market - the   Federation   of

Malaya - has  not been able to assist such industries

or  encourage  them. The Government  of  Singapore,

despite all its claims, is unable to secure for our

local  manufacturers  preferential  treatment  even

with  the  Federation of Malaya. Goods manufactured

in  Singapore  are subject to tax, whereas  if  the

factories  are situated in Johore or  Penang  there

will  not  be  the  necessity  to  pay  duty.   The

Government  should  take heed  of  this  seriously,

otherwise  any expansion or increase in  industries

will  not  take  place  in  Singapore  but  in  the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to exports of local manufactures to

Indonesia,  I  need not dwell too long  on  it.  In

fact,  most  of  us  know that  the  import  duties

imposed  on  such goods range from 50  to  200  per

cent, and that has pushed our exports to a position

of insignificance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now come to the manufactures for local

consumption.   Even   these   are   facing    great

difficulties   because  of  keen  competition   and

sometimes  dumping from our near  neighbours.  Many

are  struggling on grimly for their existence,  but

many  others are faced with the imminent danger  of

closing down their factories. Let me just quote one

example - the  bee-hoon  manufacturers.  In  previous

years  they  not only produced sufficient  for  the

consumption of Singapore but they were also able to

export  their surplus to the Federation  of  Malaya

and the nearby islands. Today



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



they  are  faced with such fierce competition  that

they  will  soon go out of business.  The  Bee-hoon

Association  have voiced their opinions  and  their

problems  in  the  Press. They have  brought  their

problems  to  the  attention of  the  Minister  for

Commerce  and  Industry, and  I  believe  that  the

Minister for Communications and Works is also  well

informed  of  this  subject.  But  what   has   the

Government  done for them? Up to date I believe  it

is  still absolutely nothing. We are interested  to

know  what Government is going to do to assist this

category of small-scale manufacturers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of agriculture, apart from the island-wide show that produced nothing but expenditure,

what  encouragement  is Government  giving  to  our

farmers? Fertilisers are not sold to the farmers at

cost.  They have to fend for themselves and to  buy

their  own  fertilisers. Even such  accessories  as

insecticides are not readily available to  them.  I

know  of  a  brand of insecticide sold by  Imperial

Chemical Industries Limited, but I believe -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> No advertisements, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> but I believe that brand has

been given to someone pretty near the Government as

a sort of monopoly, and it is a real difficulty for

farmers to get such an insecticide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem facing the farmers is the

insecurity  of tenure of land. We have very  little

land  for farming. As was stated by the Speaker  of

the Federal Legislative Council, when we talk about

farmland  we  refer to such places  as  Changi  and

Ponggol  and  not to large stretches of  land  like

Johore.   [Interruption.]  The   Speaker   of   the

Federation  during  the Commonwealth  Parliamentary

Association meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He was not the Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> This small acreage of

farmland is slowly but surely being pushed  out  to

make  way for new housing estates. The life of  the

farmer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



today  is not a pleasant one. In fact, he is driven

from   pillar   to  post.  I  wonder  whether   the

Government would be prepared to grant the  farmers,

who  occupy  Crown  land  on  temporary  occupation

licences, permanent titles to dispel their sense of

insecurity. As I have said before in this Assembly,

and  I repeat it again, the only possible expansion

for  Singapore is towards the sea. Fisheries is the

only  feasible  primary  industry.  The  Government

hopes to encourage it. It invited applications  for

licences  for  deep-sea  fishing.  Eight  companies

applied  for  that,  but only  three  were  granted

licences.  No doubt many of them did not  know  the

conditions  required for securing  a  licence,  but

they expressed their willingness to comply with all

such  requirements and yet the licences issued were

limited only to three. Let me ask the Minister  for

Commerce and Industry whether another monopoly,  or

near monopoly, is to be created? Let me further ask

him whether more people engaged in deep-sea fishing

will  benefit Singapore? Each licensee is  required

to train a number of local fishermen. If the number

of companies granted licences were increased, would

not the number of fishermen undergoing training  be

increased? I would request the Minister to  make  a

statement of policy on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of training local fishermen under

the above scheme, it will also be interesting if we

can be informed of the number under training. I  am

certain  this number will just be a token one  and,

this  being the case, what is the Government doing?

Is  it going to take an active part? Is it going to

establish  fishery  schools to start  training  our

local  lads or is it only taking a passive attitude

and  asking  fishermen to train their  own  men?  I

suggest that Government should give this idea of  a

fishery school some thought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still on the lines of encouraging the fishing

industry,  let me ask the Minister in  charge  what

facilities  Government is providing for  the  cheap

landing  and sale of fish. Now that Nicoll's  Drive

has  cut off Clyde Terrace Market from the sea,  it

is no longer possible to land fish



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



there.  Instead, fishermen will have to land  their

fish at Tanjong Rhu and thereafter transport it  by

lorry  to  Clyde Terrace Market. It may  be  argued

that  there  is still the Ellenborough Market,  but

this  market was already too small when two markets

were  available  for the landing of fish.  Further,

with  deep-sea fishing and more off-shore  fishing,

larger  boats  will have to be used  and  certainly

with  the  many  low bridges over  Singapore  River

entry  to  Ellenborough Market will not be possible

for  these bigger boats. What has happened  to  the

much  discussed wholesale market? Has it gone  into

cold storage? I recommend that it should be brought

out  again and the scheme implemented at once. This

will  then give a little more encouragement to  the

fishing  industry as well as lowering the  cost  of

fish to the people of Singapore by saving transport

and handling charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the case of prawn ponds. In one

instance, an operator did encroach a little on  the

forest reserve at Jurong. He was immediately  asked

by   Government   to  remove  his   bunds   without

considering  the  great  financial  loss  he  would

suffer. I would like to point out that whereas  one

Government  department encourages fishing,  another

department is not doing much to encourage it.  Land

for productive industries is scarce and it would be

a  help  if some areas of forest reserve  could  be

utilised   for  prawn  ponds  or  other  productive

projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, the prospect of business in the

near  future is dull. The Government may claim that

the  financial position of Singapore is  sound  and

that the people are confident of its future, but it

is   a   well-known  fact  that  capital  has  been

transferred  from  Singapore.  National  income  is

steadily  diminishing  and  with  the  stoppage  of

industrial  and  trade expansion,  unemployment  is

sure to mount. We have some interesting figures  of

unemployment from the Registrar of the Unemployment

Bureau,  but  I am inclined to treat  such  figures

given  as  bogus.  For every man registered  as  an

unemployed,  there are at least  three  others  not

registered. The ever-increasing number  of  hawkers

points to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



this sorry state of affairs. In the East here  the

people  do  not,  as  a  rule,  welcome  Government

charity. They will only accept such dole as a  last

resort, and so when they are out of a job they  try

to  eke out a living by hawking. If more industries

are  established, I am sure the number  of  hawkers

will decrease. Whilst on the problem of hawkers,  I

have heard that the Government intended to set up a

Hawkers  Advisory  Board, but to-date  nothing  has

been   done.   Will  Government  do  something   to

alleviate the difficulties of the hawkers? They are

arrested  for  obstruction  and  suffer  heavy  and

frequent fines. I put it to you, Sir, that  if  you

eliminate hawkers by arresting them, you will  have

yet  another  problem  on your  hands.  These  poor

people  will have no means of supporting themselves

and  it is more than likely that they will turn  to

crime  in  order to secure the money  necessary  to

keep themselves alive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now turn our attention to what the

Government  terms  as  a  peculiarly  urgent  youth

problem. This problem, in fact, arises out  of  the

Government's   policy   of  only   giving   primary

education to the masses of our young people. A  boy

who  passes Primary VI should be of an average  age

of  13  years. What can a boy of 13 or  14  do?  No

employer  will give him a job because  of  his  low

education  as well as his youth. He is forced  into

wasting his time and obviously sooner or later  his

excess  energy will lead him to gang up with  other

youths to create mischief. This urgent problem  can

be  met if the Government is prepared to extend the

education  of the masses to a minimum  standard  of

Form  III. Only then will such students be able  to

attain  a  standard of education and be of  an  age

that   will   be  more  acceptable  to   employers.

Government may claim that this will mean a  greater

expenditure of the taxpayers' money, but this money

is more suitably employed than when it is spent for

building  more  criminal courts, for enlarging  the

police force, and perhaps



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



for building more prisons to house young criminals.

The  youth of Singapore has received a raw deal  in

this  matter and I hope that Government  will  look

into  this  problem very seriously and do something

to correct that shortsighted policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government also admits that it will not be able

to  supply an adequate number of qualified Malayans

to  replace  all  expatriates,  especially  in  the

professional and technical posts. With  the  policy

of  not  building  a  greater number  of  secondary

schools,  the  supply  of such  men  can  never  be

satisfactory. I believe that for every ten  primary

schools   built,  there  must  be  at  least   four

secondary  schools. The students who pass  well  at

the  primary  level  should not  be  debarred  from

entering  a  secondary school because  of  lack  of

places.  He should be allowed to continue on  in  a

secondary  school  to  a  standard  equivalent   to

Standard  VII. Now if these secondary  schools  are

not built, then the number of students that can  be

turned out at the School Certificate level will  be

few  and selection for the university will then  be

even fewer. In this manner it will not be easy  for

us to have local lads to fill all the technical and

professional posts required. Even the University of

Malaya  is  not  doing its share in  assisting  the

people of Singapore. In more advanced countries  we

find  that  universities  usually  conduct  evening

courses  for those who are not fortunate enough  to

be  able to attend a full course. The University of

Malaya  is  not doing this. We hope that Government

will assist the University further in order that it

can  afford  such facilities to our workers.  After

all,  the  University of Malaya  accepts  only  the

cream  of Malayan students, yet many other students

have  gone  abroad for their studies and many  have

come back with first-class qualifications. This  is

an  indication that we have not fully utilised  the

talents  we  have  in  this country.  The  rate  of

progress in any country is closely tied up with the

educational policy, so that whilst it is  essential

to   concentrate  on  the  problem  of  eradicating

illiteracy in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



this   country   and   also   producing   the   top

professional men, the need for training  people  to

fill  such  jobs  as  mechanics,  foremen,  masons,

salesmen  or even junior executives should  not  be

overlooked.  In fact, the greatest volume  of  work

and  the  most  important work  is  done  by  these

classes  of people. Two secondary technical schools

for  the whole of Singapore are not sufficient, and

I  hope  that Government will build more to provide

facilities   for  the  middle  classes.   This   is

important because unless this is done we will have,

on  the  one  hand, people with high qualifications

and,  on  the other hand, the half-educated people.

The  Government should do its duty to  the  country

and try and raise the standard of education of this

country to further heights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assurance by the Government to assist the

Nanyang  University is most welcome, but  we  shall

have to withhold comment until such time as we know

what  concrete steps Government is taking to assist

that institution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Address by His Excellency the Governor,

the  Government  recognises the  need for  better

communications in the rural areas.  I  shall  quote

one  example of such a need and the manner in which

the  Government tackled the problem. I had occasion

to  bring  to  the  notice of  the  Government  the

bottleneck that existed and is still existing along

the  half-mile  stretch between the 5� milestone

and  the  6 milestone Yio Chu Kang Road early  last

year. The road is so narrow that it is a danger  to

pedestrians  and  cyclists when two  vehicles  pass

each  other.  A  number  of serious  accidents  had

happened  there.  One year has already  passed  and

nothing  concrete has been done. The voice  of  the

people  living  there, expressed in the  Press  and

through  their  Assemblymen in this  Assembly,  has

fallen  on  deaf ears. I hope that Government  will

stir  itself into action and widen the road  at  an

early  date.  Instances such as this  reflect  that

Government is ignoring the needs of the people  and

it reflects badly on the policy of Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a glowing note in the Address

regarding  the  Singapore Telephone  Board,  but  I

would like to voice the opinion of the people  that

the  progress  of that Board can be  compared  with

that of a snail. If the Minister for Communications

and  Works  cares  to  look  into  the  number   of

applications  for  new  telephones,  he   will   be

astounded   by  the  number.  Even  the  mechanical

working  of  the telephone is none  too  good.  The

public of Singapore will agree with me that  it  is

not an infrequent experience that when one dials  a

number,  instead  of getting that number,  you  are

connected  to the wrong line. It is indeed  not  an

exaggeration  to  say  that  using  the   telephone

nowadays is a training in patience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Postal Department is having a Five-year

Postal Services Development Plan, but I would  like

to  warn  the  Government that the number  of  dead

letters  will  not  decrease if  the  numbering  of

houses  in  the rural areas remains in  that  crazy

state.   I  would  like  the  Minister  for   Local

Government,  Lands and Housing to  look  into  that

matter  and bring some order into the numbering  of

houses  in the rural areas. Let me quote  you  some

examples.   You  have  small  numbers   off   Upper

Serangoon  Road,  somewhere near the  end  of  that

stretch,  and  then after that, the  numbers  start

varying  from  larger ones to  smaller  ones.  That

crazy  state  of  affairs should be rectified,  and

rectified  at  once. In fact, I did  send  a  large

number   of   letters  to  people  living   in   my

constituency -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> During the elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Not during the elections.

Many  of these letters addressed to people  in  the

kampongs came back to me, not because there was not

a  house  but because of the crazy way of numbering

the houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the medical services, it is

heartening to note that Government is starting work

on  a  new  district hospital and  a  hospital  for

chronic  cases. The Assembly will remember that  on

many occasions last year I voiced the need for such

measures. In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



fact,  I  had  put  the  questions  direct  to  the

Minister  for  Health. I am glad that the  Minister

has  taken  note of this, but I am not too  certain

that  the line taken by the Government is the  best

one. The General Hospital today is doing the job of

a  specialist hospital, a district hospital as well

as  a hospital for chronic cases. I would like  the

Minister  for Health to know that in a set-up  such

as  this,  there  is bound to be a  great  deal  of

wastage   of   manpower.  As   I   understand   the

arrangements  in  hospitals, a  certain  number  of

patients are attended to by a doctor and a  certain

number  of  nurses.  Whereas the  acutely  ill  may

require  the  maximum  of  medical  attention,  the

convalescent cases and the chronic cases need  less

expert  attention.  There is therefore  a  wastage.

From  the accounts released to the Press,  the  new

district hospital is going to be a replica  of  the

General  Hospital. Only in this  case  it  will  be

smaller  in size. Looking at it from the  point  of

view of shortage of staff and shortage of funds,  I

think this is all wrong. I believe it would be wise

for Government not to build such hospitals catering

for   all  types  of  cases.  In  fact,  the   best

arrangement would be to build a central  specialist

hospital that requires specialists who can  act  as

consultants  to other hospitals and then  to  build

cheap  district hospitals situated in all parts  of

Singapore to cater for the acutely ill. Of  course,

we  should  also  have chronic hospitals.  If  such

arrangements  are made, the only type  of  hospital

that  will require specialist attention and special

equipment  will be the central specialist hospital.

District hospitals can be built very cheaply on the

lines of the old Tan Tock Seng Hospital. They  will

need  ordinary operating rooms. I believe that  the

old Tan Tock Seng Hospital, which was built at less

cost  than  the present type of hospitals installed

with  air-conditioning  and  luxurious  rooms,  has

managed to cater for the needs of the people. If we

are  going  to  have the idea of building  a  grand

district hospital, then we will not be able to have

more hospitals. A hospital's essential function  is

to treat patients and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



to render assistance to the people who are sick. If

the  money  can be spread to cover more  hospitals,

then  medical care can be given to many more people

than  the  number  that  is being  catered  for  by

Government. I am sure that in Singapore today there

is a large number of people who are sick and who go

round  to the hospitals but are turned away because

there  is  a  lack of bed space. Government  should

look into this carefully and decide whether medical

attention   for  a  large  number  of   people   is

preferable  or  whether  it  is  better  to   build

luxurious hospitals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come back now to the problem of youths and it

is one that is uppermost in the minds of the people

of  Singapore. As I have said earlier, this problem

has been created by the Government policy of under-educating  our  boys  and girls  and  leaving  them

without  further  guidance or  the  opportunity  of

employment at a tender age. Although Government has

declared  that  it will do everything  possible  to

encourage  healthy  youth activities  and  training

facilities,  as the President of the Federation  of

Boys'  Clubs.  I  am forced to the conclusion  that

although Government has promised a full loaf to the

youth  movement, in actual fact, it is  withholding

three-quarters  of  that  loaf.   The   people   of

Singapore  should  know that boys'  club  movements

cater primarily for the under-privileged youths and

their   activities,   unlike   many   other   youth

movements,  are  carried  on  daily,  Sundays   and

holidays  not,  excepted.  With  the  little   help

received from the Department of Social Welfare, the

boys' clubs have to rely a good deal on the efforts

of  voluntary  workers and public  assistance.  The

movement  tries  to provide healthy activities  for

the   under-privileged  youth,   and   to   produce

satisfactory  results, effort  must  be  sustained.

Unlike other  movements, boys' clubs  are  very

short of trained instructors. Some of these leaders

may  assist the clubs for some time, but invariably

their interest will slacken and they will drop out.

In  order to provide for continuous leadership, the

Federation of Boys' Clubs have put up a  scheme  to

train leaders and to post them to assist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



the various clubs. I must remind this Assembly that

I  raised  the question of boys' clubs  during  the

Budget  debate  last year and was promised  by  the

Minister  for  Labour and Welfare  that  assistance

would  be forthcoming if concrete schemes were  put

up. Now that the scheme has been put into operation

and the Government is not assisting it as promised,

it  will be a pity if the voluntary workers are not

encouraged  to carry on assisting our  youths  more

vigorously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members  will remember that the  problem  of

illiteracy   was   first   tackled   by   voluntary

organisations, and although there was  no  lack  of

trained  personnel, this scheme  did  not  flourish

until   full   assistance  was   granted   by   the

Government.  If  the  Government  feels  that  this

movement  can carry on with ten per cent Government

aid  only,  then  let  the Assistant  Minister  for

Labour  and  Welfare, who is also the President  of

one  of  the  boys' clubs, tell us  the  degree  of

success  his  club has achieved.  Believe  me,  the

voluntary workers that we have are mostly  salaried

people. In addition to giving their services,  they

have  to pay for transport, drinks, food and  other

incidentals.  Enthusiasm in such  cases  cannot  be

sustained.  The Government should wake up  on  this

matter  and  if it still maintains the attitude  of

wanting  to train our youths to be good and  useful

citizens, it should do something more concrete.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I must urge the Government not to

live  on  hopes,  but  to  carry  on  its  promised

programme diligently. Otherwise it will not be able

to retain the confidence of the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   with  reference  to  paragraph  4   of   His

Excellency the Governor's Address, where  he  dealt

with  the expansion of existing industries  on  the

island, I would like to say a few words. It  is  to

be  appreciated that the Government  had  the  most

important  matter in mind. It is essential  to  the

interests of the whole population that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



every   conceivable  effort  is  made  to   develop

industry and add to the general prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Assembly is aware of Government's intention

to  increase  taxation. I warn Government  that  it

must  be careful to avoid any action which  in  any

way would scare capital investment away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Government does not seem to realise

there  is  increasing  unemployment  in  Singapore.

Therefore  why  do  not  we  allow  these  overseas

investors   to  come  immediately  to   start   new

industries, thereby lessening unemployment in  this

beautiful island of ours?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, out of this dull and prosaic morning there was

one  sparkle for which I am grateful to the  Member

for  Serangoon. It is that the Hon.the  Assistant

Minister for Labour and Welfare is President  of  a

boys' club.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the Governor's Address, I was

unimpressed  at  the disjointed  catalogue  of  the

miscellaneous   administrative  projects   of   the

various Ministries all stuck together by a  lot  of

political platitudes. The one thing for which  this

Government  has taken office, namely the  reopening

of  the Merdeka talks, was left hanging in the air.

This  morning  we  have heard  the  Chief  Minister

declare  his  stand. He would  have  made  my  task

easier  if  he  had  declared  his  stand  in   the

Governor's  Address. We all know  that  this  is  a

caretaker Government. We all know that we are  just

marking  time.  But  unless the  Government  itself

bears that in mind, it will soon forget the purpose

for  which  it has assumed office, and the  purpose

for which Opposition leaders and Opposition Parties

have declared their support for this Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A remarkable feature of the speech of the leader

of the Liberal-Socialists is the fact that he, like

the Address of the Governor, was only interested in

internal  self-government just by the way.  He  was

more  interested in the crazy numbering of  houses,

boys'  clubs, the running of hospitals on which,  I

am sure,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



there  are  people  more competent  to  advise  the

Minister,   and  a  whole  host  of   other   petty

administrative  matters. We  are  not  saying  that

these  matters  of day-to-day administration  of  a

government are not important or that they should be

neglected.  But  to ignore the political  realities

which surround this whole Assembly, this Government

and the whole country is political childishness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case I am accused of being preoccupied with

the  political issue of the next Merdeka  talks  to

the  exclusion  of the day-to-day running  of  this

administration, I took great care to  read  through

the whole of this policy speech. As a statement  of

the  policy of the Labour Front Government for  the

second  session  of this Assembly,  the  Governor's

Address  was poor and feeble. There was no coherent

theme,   no   broad  exposition  of  the  country's

economic  or  political situation. No master  plan,

but  just  a collection of the various departmental

activities  puffed up with pious ministerial  hopes

and  good  intentions. Instead of  specific  plans,

figures,  targets, there was only fluff  and  empty

exhortation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if the content was poor, the presentation was

atrocious.   We  can  excuse  the  hollow   opening

paragraph about the Government's desire to link  up

its  future  with the achievements - or  perhaps  the

lack of them-of the last 17 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 2 we are told that "the Government

stands   for  the  early  attainment  of   complete

internal self-government", with a platitude that it

"recognises that successful self-government must be

based   on   national   prosperity   and   national

solidarity".  But  after that  promising  stand  we

expected  to hear the Government tell us  how  they

proposed  to  achieve this; what were their  plans;

what  steps  were  being taken to  implement  these

plans.  Even this morning we have not been told  of

them.  We  only  have an assurance from  the  Chief

Minister    that    that   is    his    predominant

preoccupation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly in paragraph 3 we are plunged from

entrepot trade to capital expansion for industries,

agriculture  and  fisheries, farming  land,  crops,

down to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



deep-sea fishing in paragraph 9-a higgledy-piggledy

collection  from  the  Minister  for  Commerce  and

Industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in paragraph 10 comes the Labour Front Party

theoretician who tried to tie them all up  together

with a bit of Labour Front Socialist erudition. Let

us read it:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the objective of the Government not only

to  increase the total wealth of Singapore but also

to  ensure  that wealth is diffused throughout  the

population  and  that the gap between  the  largest

incomes  and  the  smallest  is  steadily  reduced.

Whilst this is partly a matter of the cash earnings

of  the  worker,  diffusion of wealth  also  occurs

through improvement of the social services provided

out   of   national  revenue.  In  this  connection

Government  policy  is  one  of  improving   social

services  of  all kinds especially in those  areas,

whether  urban or rural, whose needs have not  been

fully met in the past."



<br><br>Blabber, blabber, blabber! No facts, no figures.  A

lot of pious protestations. Let us examine what the

Minister  for Commerce and Industry has said.  Take

his programme for industrialisation. He covers that

in  paragraphs  4  and 5. He said  something  about

promoting  "the expansion of existing industries...

and  the establishment of new industries. For  this

purpose    there    must   be   adequate    capital

investment.... the  rate of capital  formation  within

Singapore can be increased...."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he says in paragraph 5:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...International Bank Mission the Government is

preparing  legislation  to  set  up  an  Industrial

Promotion   Board   to   assist   the   small-scale

manufacturer   and   is  examining   the   possible

establishment of an Industrial Research Institute."



<br><br>We  hear  of  nothing but possible  committees  and

public  authorities which have all not  come-  into

fruition.  Sir,  I  thought  this  was  all   about

industrialisation,  but  47  paragraphs  later,  in

paragraph 52 there is more, probably not  from  the

Ministry  of  Commerce and Industry. This  time  it

says - again    from   the   Labour    Front    Party

theoretician:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aspirations for political freedom must be

accompanied   by  genuine  national   efforts   for

economic  independence.  Whilst  Singapore,  as  an

international  centre of trade, must always  retain

close  links with its trading neighbours, and  must

give scope for foreign capital, it is of the utmost

importance  that  the citizens of Singapore  should

provide as much as they possibly can of the capital

needed  for  national development. For  the  future

every good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



citizen should recognise the need, for his own  and

for  the  nation's prosperity, to be economical  in

his  spending and thrifty in his habits so that  he

can  save in order to invest within Singapore.  The

Government   is   examining  the   feasibility   of

initiating a national savings movement. In this way

every  citizen could, in greater or lesser  degree,

contribute to the national prosperity."



<br><br>Then it goes on, and this is one of their key plans

for increasing industrialisation!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whilst the Government recognises that Singapore

lives by the free movement of trade, steps must and

will be taken, as indicated briefly earlier in this

Address,  to  encourage  and  build  up  our  local

production for home consumption and for export. All

citizens  can, and should, play their part  in  the

development  of  secondary  industry  by  consuming

goods produced on this island."



<br><br>I shudder to think what would happen to the economy

of  this  country if the author of this piece  were

made the captain of the economic ship of Singapore.

But   obviously  that  could  not  have  been   the

intention of the Hon. the Chief Minister because he

goes  on in paragraph 59 to talk about the Economic

Adviser to the Chief Minister. He says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whilst the business of Government proceeds from

day to day and from year to year, it ought also  to

be  planned  with proper thought for the  long-term

future and for this purpose planning must be  based

on  sound economic surveys and economic advice. The

Government  will seek to expand and strengthen  the

office  of  the Economic Adviser in order  that  no

factor should be overlooked which can contribute to

the future welfare of Singapore."



<br><br>Perhaps  if this strong, wise and capable  Economic

Adviser  had  been  found before this  Address  was

written, it might have had more substance in it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same thing with all the other schemes.

Paragraph  7 talks of "the need to improve  farming

lands... security  of  tenure  ... freedom   from

exploitation." Words, words, words. How?  When?  No

answer.  Just pious protestations. One has  got  to

turn  to  paragraph 30 to find a partial answer  in

the   contribution  from  the  Minister  for  Local

Government,  Lands  and Housing.  Incidentally,  he

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Land Clearance and Resettlement Plan,

accepted by the previous Government, makes fair and

adequate  provision for compensating and  rehousing

in  such  cases,  whether in appropriate  permanent

housing, or in semi-urban planned attap areas  with

municipal services, or in farming settlements."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>



Just  incidental.  Security of land tenure... freedom

from exploitation - fine words, fine

sentiments,  but no answer as to how it  should  be

done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraphs 11 to 15 we are taken rapidly

through  health and medical facilities,  education,

community   centres,  postal  services,   telephone

facilities, public assistance, the citizens  advice

bureau, to local government elections. Why they all

come together in this section I do not know, except

that  they may constitute a good election bait  for

the  Labour Front's next local government  election

platform. But again, no facts, no figures, but more

good intentions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraphs 16, 17 and 18 we are told of

technical schools, a part of education, I  presume,

but  somehow education is dealt with in some  other

later section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We commend the Government for making arrangements

for  marine training for the local merchant marine.

We know that the Government recognises the need for

technical schools. It lists one Polytechnic that we

have  been talking about - that mirage which all good

colonial  administrators point to and have  pointed

to, for the last five years. And before this mirage

becomes  a  reality we are being presented  with  a

Supplementary  Budget to boost  it  up  by  several

million  more  dollars.  More  of  that  from   the

financial aspect later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever wrote paragraph 18 could not have read

paragraph 62. In paragraph 18 - the explanation given

why certain technical skills cannot be provided for

in  Singapore  is that Singapore  is  too  small  a

territory. It is not economic. Singapore is  viewed

alone,  separate  and distinct. Paragraph  62  envisages  all  these links with the Federation,  links

strengthened  to make both territories indivisible.

Whoever  wrote paragraph 18 obviously did not  have

the Federation in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it difficult not to be disjointed in my

criticism of this Address because the Address jumps

from  item  to  item with no connecting  theme.  In

paragraph  19  we  are suddenly plunged  into  road

transport and traffic. We are told that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



"the Government is continuing to give careful study

to   the   problems  of  road  communications   and

transport.  The  establishment  of  a  unified  bus

system...".The people of Singapore have paid  a  very

large sum of money to bring out a transport expert.

There  has been a Transport Commission and a report

has  been  tabled which recommended a  unified  bus

service   under  a  public  authority.   But   like

everything  else about this Government,  they  call

for  the  experts, they call for the  reports,  and

finally  there  is no implementation.  Now  we  are

told,  so  I  read  in  the  newspapers,  that  our

Minister for Communications and Transport is  going

to  London to see the crowded streets of London  in

order  to  be  able  better  to  equip  himself  to

discharge   his   duties.  Every  Member   of   the

Government  Front Bench has had a free  trip.  They

have  been  either  to  the Merdeka  talks,  or  to

Hongkong over Christmas to inspect Chinese  schools

and  teachers.  So  why not let  the  Minister  for

Communications and Transport go to London  to  look

at  the  buses in London? We only hope  that  after

this  sojourn to the land of his ancestors, or more

accurately  the  land  of  the  conquerors  of  his

ancestors,  he will come back with a more  vigorous

and  a  more  positive attitude  to  the  transport

problem. But it is unfortunate he did not take this

opportunity   to  clarify  the  position   of   his

Government with regard to road transport. It is  an

open secret that all the bus owners are saying that

this  Government has decided that public  ownership

is  not possible and therefore it is going to  plan

out  some scheme between the Government and private

ownership - perhaps the Government 55  per  cent  and

private capital 45 per cent. There is a great  deal

of talk and a lot of heart-burn amongst the Chinese

bus  owners that this 45 per cent may not be  local

capital  either, because it is alleged  that  local

capital has not got sufficient managerial skill and

experience.  Here  is  a good opportunity  in  this

policy statement debate to clarify the Government's

stand.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



We   are   not   satisfied  with  this  wishy-washy

equivocation - that "the establishment of  a  unified

bus  system  will play an important  part  and  the

Government  will  publish a  White  Paper  on  this

subject shortly." The report of the commission  has

been  tabled  for several months.  Let  us  have  a

stand.  We  all  know that the Member  for  Kampong

Kapor  is very anxious about the Singapore Traction

Company, so let the S.T.C. know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curious thing about the next few

paragraphs - 20, 21, 22 and 23 - all from the  Ministry

of  Communications and Works is the facile  way  in

which everything is explained away. If a problem is

intractable, then there is the comforting  thought:

"After all, it is just as bad anywhere else in  the

world."  For  instance, "If traffic  congestion  is

becoming more acute," so it is, "as in other cities

in  the world." And in the best colonial traditions

they  give  a lot of comforting figures  about  how

"Singapore's Airport is flourishing" with more  and

more  passengers. The fact that we  have  more  and

more  telephone  calls between  Singapore  and  the

Federation, says the Ministry of Communications and

Works, illustrates "the very close ties between the

two  territories". Two million trunk calls. We were

not  told what the previous figures were and  I  do

not know how these two million trunk calls had been

registered.  Every telephone call to  Johore  Bahru

now  has  to go through as a trunk call.  So  these

comforting figures mean less than they appear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, when we come to intractable

problems like flood control, the attitude indicated

is even more engaging. Paragraph 22 says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The frequent and increasing floods which have

caused  serious damage and suffering  in  the  past

constitute a major problem for which the Government

now  has the technical solution, but which can only

be dealt with as funds can be made available."



<br><br>Whatever  that  can  mean. Not a  word  about  this

controversy between the Government Engineer and the

City  Council Engineer; between the man  who  said,

"You can stick up three gates in front of the mouth

of three rivers and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>



hold back the sea and you have all the drains empty

ready to take the flood waters."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the other engineer who said, "If you try to

do  that,  perhaps all the three gates, or  one  of

them,  will  be swept away." What is the Government

saying? They say they have got a technical solution

which,  fortunately  for  the  Government  and  the

engineer concerned, may never be put into operation

for  quite  a  long  time, by which  time  the  man

responsible for the scheme may have safely  retired

to  some  pleasant country cottage in the south  of

England.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Government does say that "the anti-flood

scheme  at Bedok is now almost completed". What  it

does  not  say is that when it is completed,  there

will be no floods in Bedok! It was very wise of the

Minister for Communications and Works not to commit

himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether Radio Malaya, which comes

in  the  next paragraph, 24, was tacked on because,

although  part  of  the  portfolio  of  the   Chief

Secretary, it is really communications.  Can  there

be  any  doubt at all that Radio Malaya  should  be

divorced  from the Government and run as  a  public

corporation?  Is there any real doubt  that  if  we

wanted   to  introduce  television,  and   if   the

committee  sitting on it should want  to  recommend

it, it should be done by a public corporation? I am

not an uncritical admirer of the British. For their

own country, they institute public corporations  to

run  their  radio, but they allow it to  become  an

adjunct   of  a  government  department  in   their

colonies.  That is why we have to put up  with  the

curious  sort  of  news  presentation  from   Radio

Malaya. Recently Mr Casey, the Australian External

Affairs   Minister,  and  Mr  Abdul   Ghani,   the

Indonesian  Foreign Minister, were passing  through

Singapore.  I was listening to the 7 o'clock  news.

Right in the middle of the news they broke the news

to  interview Mr Casey. I do not know whether  the

Chief  Secretary  gave his leave  and  licence  for

this,  but  to  hear  an expatriate  break  a  news

bulletin and suddenly turn round



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



and   say,  "Mr  Casey,  we  in  Malaya  are  very

concerned  about the problem of the Suez Canal  and

our  future  trade and so on, via the  Suez  Canal.

What  do you think, Mr Casey?" And then Mr Casey,

over  Radio  Malaya's News, said, "We in  Australia

share  the  views and sentiments of the  people  of

Malaya and indeed of the whole of South-East  Asia.

The  Suez  Canal  must  be internationalised ...".Of

course, to be fair, Radio Malaya's news reader went

on  to  say  that  Mr  Abdul  Ghani,  the  Foreign

Minister of Indonesia, was also passing through and

Mr  Abdul Ghani said that all the Indonesians were

solidly behind the Egyptians. But this is the  kind

of  monstrous  bias  which a Government  department

running  a  radio station gives. Expatriates  under

the  charge  of an expatriate Minister,  using,  at

public  expense, this radio network to  give  radio

time  in  Malaya to the Australian External Affairs

Minister.  We  raised  this  matter  of  a   public

corporation for Radio Malaya at the very opening of

this  Assembly last year. After 17 months of office

to be told that the Government is still thinking of

it,   one   wonders  what  could  have   been   the

achievement in the last 17 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To quote another instance on this Radio Malaya

issue.  Recently four unions of the  Harbour  Board

were calling a meeting to counter the moves made by

certain unions to form one union on the waterfront.

Because  these four unions happened to  be  against

this  one  union, they got radio time. It  was  all

over   Radio  Malaya  on  the  21st  and  22nd   of

August - that  these  four  unions  were  calling   a

meeting  for  the  22nd.  The  news  was  over  all

networks  of Radio Malaya. We are trying to  run  a

democratic  State and if we expect others  to  play

the  game  with us, we have to play the  game  with

them.  If we attempt to use the whole machinery  of

state,  while we are in office, to bias things  our

way,  then  we cannot complain when somebody  else,

after assuming office, does exactly the same to us.

I have quoted these two instances to show the great

dangers  of having this great propaganda instrument

in  the  hands of a Government department  under  a

colonial official.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraphs 25, 26 and 27: We have S.A.T.A.,

medical   training,  nurses'  training,  specialist

examinations,  district  hospitals.  They  are  the

contributions  of the Ministry of  Health,  of  the

healthy  looking Minister for Health.  Of  all  our

Ministers he is the man who carries the burdens  of

office  most lightly, probably because  he  is  the

wisest   and  leaves  the  burden  mostly  to   his

permanent officials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a little statement on clinics in

paragraph  11 - it must have been from  the  Minister

for  Health,  but  I do not know  why  it  came  in

paragraph 11:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Extended medical facilities will be continued

through a system of clinics throughout the Island."



<br><br>All we have heard so far is that one clinic will be

put  up  where the Malayan Airways canteen used  to

be.  Now  they  give  us a little  bit  more  about

S.A.T.A., the Colombo Plan, aid from Australia, the

fight against tuberculosis, specialist training  by

arrangement   with   Australia,   and   the   Royal

Australian  College  of Surgeons.  Everybody  knows

that  the  British are on their way out.  They  are

8,000  miles away and they are intractably involved

with Cypriots and Egyptians and they have less  and

less  to  spare  to deal with us. But  now  we  are

getting more and more linked up with Australia.  We

are  getting  Australian troops to replace  British

troops.  We  are going to be trained by  Australian

surgeons instead of British surgeons. Sir,  I  have

got  nothing  against the Australians  except  that

they have not had a civilisation in Australia for a

long  time,  and  I would rather have  an  F.R.C.S.

(England) than an F.R.C.S. (Australia)!  So,  I  am

sure,  would  all  the  doctors.  And  talking   of

subversion, here is subversion: Colombo Plan aid. I

give  you a free milk shaker, then I sell you milk.

Then  I send my fellows along to test you for Royal

Australian College of Surgeons memberships. Then  I

help  you  in  the  fight against tuberculosis.  We

welcome all these things, but I think one must draw

attention  to  the fact that in this  part  of  the

world  the Australians are gently moving  in  while

the British are gently oozing out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Ah!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Ah! So we must watch out for

this infiltration. Let us have no subversion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in paragraph 27 - and this wasted five minutes

of the P.A.P. Committee's time:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Plans are being prepared for a 200-bed Chronic

hospital."



<br><br>Is  it  worth while building a hospital  if  it  is

going  to be "chronic"? I do not know whether  this

is  a  technical  phrase. Perhaps medical  men  can

enlighten us on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three paragraphs are the smallest

contribution  of all the Ministries - quite  wisely,

because  the  less there is, the less there  is  to

criticise.  Not  one word about  this  shortage  of

doctors.  Everybody knows that Singapore  is  in  a

chronic  condition of shortage of doctors; that  we

are  importing  our doctors from  India  and  other

parts  of  the  world. Not one word has  been  said

about how medical training facilities are going  to

be  expanded;  how  we  are going  to  improve  and

increase the training of more doctors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in paragraphs 28, 29, 30, 31 and 32 - they are

the   contributions  of  my  friend  the  Hon. the

Minister  for Lands and Housing. Sir, I hope  I  am

still his friend, for there has been a lot of  hard

words  said about my Party in the last week by  his

friends,  but,  I  am happy to  note,  not  by  the

Minister  himself. I hope his Master Plan  will  be

not  only  technically sound, but also  wisely  and

justly  implemented. As a technical job,  very  few

people will find anything to complain of because  a

tremendous amount of planning has gone into it. But

to  put  that  blue-print into  action,  to  uproot

thousands  of  families is bound to cause  a  great

deal   of   distress  and  suffering,  unless   the

implementation  is  done  with  a  great  deal   of

"heart".  This  is  not to  say  that  we  have  no

criticisms at all of the Master Plan. I am  not  an

expert  on town planning, but it does seem  strange

when  the  building of a cinema was disapproved  by

the City Council, and suddenly approved because the

Master Plan had marked the site out as a cinema!  I

do  not know what this is all about. I do not  know

if there is any connection between this and the two

new Members on the S.I.T.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



who  are members of the Labour Front. It does  seem

odd  that  the Master Plan has gone to such  minute

detail  as to mark out this little bit of  land  in

Katong for a cinema.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope also that the Land Titles Ordinance and

the  Land  Acquisition and Land  Purchases  Control

Bills mentioned in paragraph 29 will be looked upon

in  the  years to come as sound Socialist  inclined

legislation; that his Housing Authority,  which  he

envisages, in paragraph 30, will give rise to  tens

of   thousands  more  of  homes  before  the   next

election,  so that they can bear witness  in  steel

and  concrete  and tiles to the great  contribution

made  by  the  Member  for Ulu  Bedok  towards  the

happiness and welfare of thousands of families  now

living in slums.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am not particularly impressed by paragraph 32. Houses for sale-this scatter-brained scheme of

a   million  dollars  to  finance  several  million

dollars worth of business by building societies. 68

houses  put  up  for sale, probably  with  the  $1

million  lent  by  Government to the  S.I.T.,  drew

1,300  applications. Therefore it proved that  here

is the way to solve the ills of Singapore by making

all of them petty bourgeois, making all of them own

houses. A wonderful and admirable scheme if it were

possible. But can you solve the housing shortage on

this  basis?  Are  you  not  just  aggravating  the

position by putting in a great deal of material and

skill  into middle-class homes - they must be middle-class homes - before people will buy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Lower income group.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Lower income group?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You have to pay for it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> A million dollars. We had a

debate on it. This one million dollars is going  to

work  this  way: The Government lends  one  million

dollars  to  the  S.I.T. The S.I.T. takes  it  and

builds  the  houses and says, "Here  you  are,  for

sale."  The  moment you buy, you go to the  housing

society.  You pay interest to the housing  society,

and the housing society pays off the Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



Then  the  Government  says, "Take  this  same  one

million  dollars and start another housing estate."

Anyway, I hope my friend the Hon. the Minister  for

Local  Government,  Lands  and  Housing  does   not

believe that this is the way to a greater and  more

prosperous  Malaya, it certainly is not  the  magic

formula for the next election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know he has received a copy of the P.A.P.

policy statement. I refer him to pages 8 and  9  on

security  of tenure, compensation and resettlement,

and eviction from private holdings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are glad to note that the Government did

mention  that  the Land Clearance and  Resettlement

Plan  had been accepted by the previous Government.

We hope they will implement this Plan and, further,

that  the rates and scales of compensation will  be

kept  up-to-date. Everybody knows that  whenever  a

squatter is evicted, he suffers a capital loss  and

loss  of  income for at least a year until he  gets

going  in  some other locality. But  at  least  the

Government  has the intention to pay  compensation.

But  what  of evictions from private holdings?  The

Minister for Lands and Housing knows that there has

been  a great deal of trouble over this. How  often

have  I  seen  him, together with  the  Member  for

Sembawang, to discuss the problems of squatters, of

Naval Base workers living on land belonging to  the

Bukit Sembawang Estate Ltd. of which the Member for

Paya Lebar is a director? Under the present Control

of  Rent Ordinance passed by the Progressive Party,

any  land-owner can get a squatter  out  simply  by

giving  him  a notice to quit and then employing  a

lawyer to issue a summons if he refuses to quit and

to  prove  in court that the premises on  his  land

consist  of temporary dwellings like an attap-house

or  a wooden and zinc house, and he is entitled  to

recover his possession. The unfortunate squatter is

then  pushed  out  with  no compensation.  Sir,  in

effect,  there  are two standards of treatment  for

squatters.  One,  the Government  which  recognises

that  it has certain responsibilities to the people

of  Singapore,  and when it evicts squatters,  pays

them compensation. Two, the Government holding the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



ring  for  a  free-for-all,  winner-take-all  fight

between the private land-owners and the unfortunate

squatters  who live on private land.  The  Minister

for  Local  Government, Lands and  Housing  is  not

unaware  of the situation. The only reason  why  we

had  not pressed it earlier was because he informed

us  that he had a committee sitting to enquire into

this matter and to make such amendments to the  law

as  were necessary. Seventeen months of office, and

we  have  not  had one word about  the  results  or

recommendations of this committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me read a short paragraph from the P.A.P.

policy statement about which a lot has been said by

the  Chief  Minister without his  having  read  it,

apart from what the local Press chose to publish of

it. It says here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Occupants of Crown land are now given some

compensation when they are evicted from  Government

land. Similar provisions ought to be made for those

who occupy land belonging to private individuals or

companies.  The Rent Control Ordinance  (passed  by

the Progressive Party in collaboration with British

Colonial  Officials)should  be  amended   to   make

provision    for   the   payment   of    reasonable

compensation  to  those occupants who  are  evicted

from  their homes by private landlords.  Scales  of

compensation  based on principles  adopted  by  the

Government  and  the  Singapore  Improvement  Trust

should be worked out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disputes over the application of such scales of

compensation could be referred to a body similar to

the  Rent  Board  who  could determine  the  proper

compensation payable."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless this is done, all that we can do for these

unfortunate  people,  who  happen  to  occupy  land

belonging  to some private company like  the  Bukit

Sembawang  Estate,  is to apply  a  little  bit  of

political pressure; like threatening to expose  the

Bukit Sembawang Estate unless some compensation  is

paid.  Because we threatened to do that, some  kind

of  compensation was offered. But  that  is  not  a

satisfactory position and the Government should not

waste time in correcting it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come now to paragraphs 33 to 38 of the

Governor's  Address.  They  concern  the  Financial

Secretariat:    finance,   development,    building

economy, taxation, fiscal policy. It is in the best

of colonial traditions. No facts, no figures,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



nothing   definite  on  which  you  can   pin   the

Government  down.  Just  expressions  intended   to

instil confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Singapore's financial position continues to be

sound ...nothing  shall be done to shake  confidence...

The Government will continue to ensure economy  in

development  spending ... large economies have  already

been  achieved... prudence forbids  draining  these

(reserves) too low .. .Considerable taxation potential

remains  to be tapped... to lay the burden  on  the

shoulders  of  those members of the community  best

able to carry it."



<br><br>But  how?  It  does not say. All it  says  is  that

Singapore's  fiscal  policy is  tied  up  with  the

Federation. So presumably we cannot put  up  income

tax  until  the  Federation  Government  runs  into

difficulties,  as  it is already doing.  But  apart

from that, nothing but a whole series of confidence

inspiring notes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education. I am glad to note that the Ministry of

Education  opened up its topic with the  increasing

population of Singapore youth. Unless it does  more

than  take  note  of the increasing  population  of

Singapore and spends a great deal of money, time in

organising   the  training  of  these   youth   and

providing   career  opportunities,  the  Government

cannot  expect co-operation and public spiritedness

from  this  population. Let it never  be  forgotten

that they are born here and they have the right  to

vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know about the boys' clubs and I have

listened with patience to what has been said by the

Member  for Serangoon. It does seem to me  that  is

not  just  a question of catching them and  putting

them  into boys' clubs so that their excess energy,

as  the Member for Serangoon puts it, will go  into

useful and peaceful activities. He thinks the  best

thing that can happen to Singapore youth is to  put

them  into boys' clubs under good leaders like  the

President  of the Federation of Boys'  Clubs.  Then

they  will all grow up worried about crazy  numbers

of  houses,  and streets that are too  narrow,  and

markets that have got no more access to the sea. It

may be a good thing, to keep them interested in the

little things in life so that they forget the wider

problems of society. But that is not the purpose of

youth education. These are the people who will form

the nation of tomorrow.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



Unless we give them not only education and training

but career opportunities, then we are in for a load

of trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Minister for Education knows full

well that what is said in paragraphs 40, 41 and  42

is  just scratching the surface. There is some talk

about  being "ready to help the Nanyang  University

authorities  to  attain  standards  which  will  be

internationally recognised, so that  the  graduates

will  be  able to find worthwhile employment",  but

there is not one word about the controversy sparked

off  by  his saying that Nanyang University degrees

may  not  be recognised by the Government. What  is

the  position?  Is it going to be  recognised?  Are

steps being taken to see that the standard is  such

that the Government can recognise its degrees? What

is  the  position of its students? They are  virile

and  vigorous people. If you say to them  that  the

door  of employment is closed to them because  they

did   not  go  into  the  Government-sponsored  and

Government-run  University of  Malaya,  you  cannot

expect them to look upon this Government with  much

enthusiasm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only touch of imagination is in paragraph 42.

No  one  has  yet  raised the cry over  handicapped

children  and the mentally deficient,  and  to  the

Labour  Front  Government must go  the  credit  for

having  taken  the  field first  in  looking  after

mentally  deficient children.  I  have  a  sneaking

suspicion  that it may be the past  career  of  the

Organising Secretary of the Labour Front,  one  Mr

de  Cruz, who  is  a  fully qualified  teacher  of

mentally   deficient  children,  and  perhaps   his

experience  since then with Labour  Front  workers,

that has inspired this imaginative social work. But

we  give  them full credit for this. We  hope  that

this  school for the blind, for the deaf and  dumb,

will  perform  the very important task  of  looking

after the less fortunate in society. The only thing

that is missing is a Dr Barnado's home, and I hope

in  the  next  Governor's Address that  some  other

source  of  inspiration in the  Labour  Front  will

raise the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can now go on to paragraph 42 to talk about minimum living standards and -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed on Question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just before

the  adjournment, I had finished  paragraph  42  on

mentally  deficient children. I was  commenting  on

the   fact  that  paragraphs  43  to  45  were  the

contribution of the Ministry of Labour and  Welfare

but not wishing to make my comments on this Address

more disjointed than it need be, it might be better

if  we  go on to a later part of this Address where

the  Minister for Education states his  policy  for

the  coming year. In paragraphs 54, 55, 56 and  57,

the  Ministry of Education continues its  statement

on  education  policy. Mr Speaker, Sir,  there  is

very  little  in  this  enunciation  of  Government

policy  other  than the reiteration  of  the  White

Paper  and the fact that according to the  Minister

for Education the White Paper differs only slightly

from  the All-Party Report. It is necessary for  my

Party  to  restate our stand. There have been  some

not  disinterested  comments in the  English  Press

about  an  alleged  change of my Party's  stand  on

education policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an absence of imagination in this part

of  the  Report. We have the statement that English

is  necessary  for trade demands  and  so  on,  but

nowhere  does  it  reflect the changing  trends  in

Asia.  Nowhere is there any acknowledgment  of  the

fact  that in the years to come, the Malay language

will  be the language of the country and that  this

change in trends in Malaya and in the rest of  Asia

should be reflected in the education policy. In our

statement on education and culture, we said:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The education policy of the Government of

Singapore does not reflect the position of Malay as

the common national language of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Party believes that not only must Malay

education  in  this  country  be  developed  beyond

primary  school level as soon as possible but  that

it  should also enjoy undisputed priority over  any

other language as the compulsory second language to

be  taught in all schools, be they English, Chinese

or  Indian  schools. We support the  cause  of  the

Malay  Education  Council for more Malay  secondary

schools and with the Council's demand that  in  the

Malay  secondary  school,  Malay  and  not  English

should  be  the  medium of  instruction  and  that

English   should  only  be  treated  as  a   second

language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Party believes that a free and democratic

Malaya  will  give full and disinterested  aid  and

encouragement to the full growth and development of

Malay,  Chinese, English and Indian schools  whilst

developing Malay as the common national language of

the various communities."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know the excuses

that  have  been  advanced  by  the  Minister   for

Education that there are not enough Malay  language

teachers  and  that therefore it is  impossible  to

implement  the All-Party Report on Education,  that

there should be a free choice of a second language,

and  a  free  choice of a third language.  In  that

particular   All-Party  Report,   we   accommodated

ourselves to reach unanimity of views. We wanted to

go much further together with the representative of

the United Malay National Organisation to state  in

clear  and categorical terms that Malay should  and

must be the predominant language in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no use trying to escape historic trends in

Asia. Nowhere in Asia was the English language more

carefully nurtured and infused into an Asian people

than  in Ceylon. Those of us who stopped in  Ceylon

recently  on  our  way to London  for  the  Merdeka

Conference had the opportunity of seeing a  set  of

completely  English-speaking  and  English-educated

people  ruling the country. Yet they have found  it

necessary to yield to an historic tide of  history.

There, a people completely led and administered  by

English-educated Singhalese and Tamils have decided

by  free  franchise that English is  not  their  national language and that in another



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



twelve  years  they  hope to  make  Singhalese  the

national  language. This trend is  irreversible  in

Asia. We the English-educated in this country are a

passing  generation.  The  generation  that  is  to

follow us will be shaped by the education policy of

the   present  Government  both  here  and  in  the

Federation  of Malaya. It is for the Government  to

lead  or  control these trends. It is a matter  for

which they must answer in the next elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said that we are against Government

controls in vernacular schools in this country. Let

me   read  the  Party  statement  on  education  in

vernacular schools:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The P.A.P. believes that there must be only one

educational  authority  in  the  country  and  that

authority is the government of that country through

its popularly elected representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that steps can and should be taken now

towards integrating the Chinese, Malay, Indian  and

English   schools   under  a   single   educational

authority  and  within the framework  of  a  single

educational    policy   orientated   towards    the

achievement of a free and democratic Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the conditions attached to grants-in-aid,

the  present  laws relating to the registration  of

schools  and teachers, are liable to abuse  in  the

hands  of  either  the Registrar or  the  Permanent

Secretary in the Education Ministry. They can  also

make  for  abitrary meddling and interference  with

the  formulation  of curricula  and  timetables  in

vernacular schools which accept Government aid."



<br><br>We stated in the All-Party Report on Education that

this  suspicion was deep-rooted, that it was  there

and  that  it,  was  the result  of  years  of  bad

handling by previous governments. It is useless the

Minister  for Education saying, "This is all  over.

In   fact,   we  are  now  an  elected   Government

responsible to the people and you should trust us."

We   are  not  saying  that  there  should  be   no

conditions in grants-in-aid. What we do say is that

some  of  these conditions have aroused antagonism,

and  particularly  a fear that  acceptance  of  aid

would   mean   interference  with  timetables   and

language teaching. There is nothing in this  policy

statement which gives us an indication of  what  is

to  be  in the new grant code. All we have is  this

pious  principle  with which no one  can  disagree:

firstly, that they must turn out children



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



whose  loyalty  will be to this  country;  secondly

that  the grants should be wisely used and properly

accounted  for.  We  have  no  quarrel  with  those

principles.  But what are the terms and  conditions

which the Minister for Education has worked out  to

ensure  that these two conditions are obeyed?  That

is an entirely different matter. I hope that in the

course  of  this debate, the Minister for Education

will state his policy with regard to grants-in-aid.

It  would be optimistic in the extreme to hope that

whatever  it is, there will not be some  opposition

to it, particularly in view of the statement of the

Minister for Education that the policy is now, full

aid  with conditions, or no aid at all. But  before

we criticize this policy let us know what are those

conditions  which he and his Ministry have  decided

to impose as conditions to grant-in-aid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I go back now to paragraphs 43, 44, 45 and 46 on

labour  and  social welfare. These four  paragraphs

are distinguished by a lot of pious pontifications.

All these soothing words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Government intends to formulate and present to

the  Assembly schemes for ensuring that  the  first

steps  towards social security and relief  for  the

hardships of the unemployed are taken."



<br><br>But  is there any doubt at all, whatever the Report

of  the Minimum Living Standards Committee may  be,

that the present rate of unemployment relief is too

low and that the Government could safely step these

unemployment  assistance rates much higher  without

any  danger  of being accused of being overgenerous

with public funds? On this question of unemployment

itself, the policy states - I think this is where the

Hon. the Chief Minister found enthusiastic support

from the leader of the Liberal-Socialist Party:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the field of economic production the

Government  considers  that employers  and  workers

must  recognise the need for cooperation  in  their

joint    task   of   service   to   the    national

prosperity....".



<br><br>An so on and so on, blah, blah, blah -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It must be realised that plans for relief of

unemployment  and for creation of  new  industries

can be frustrated by  unnecessary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



stoppages, which reduce production or even halt  it

forever, thus throwing workers into the miseries of

unemployment."



<br><br>It  is fair to say that paragraph 46 does nor go as

far  as what the Liberal-Socialist Party have  been

saying  of  late; namely, that because  of  strikes

there  has  been  unemployment.  We  dispute   that

thesis.  We do not believe that because  there  are

strikes, therefore unemployment is caused. There is

not  the  slightest shred of evidence to show  that

unemployment and growing unemployment is  connected

with strikes. No factory that has suffered a strike

has shut down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Mis-Sino?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No factory has decreased its

production  when  a strike is settled  and  workers

resume  employment.  May I  read  my  Party  policy

statement on the menace of growing unemployment:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We believe that unemployment is neither

inevitable nor necessary. Only by freeing ourselves

from  the  grip  of  a colonial  economy  with  its

complete  dependence on the fluctuations  of  world

markets, will it be possible for us to organise our

labour and resources, to increase our wealth and to

tackle the problems of unemployment effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political and economic causes of

unemployment, the elementary facts, that under  the

colonial system the people of this country have  no

control  or  direction of their economic destinies,

are  deliberately overlooked by those who  seek  to

hide the real causes of our economic difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we realise the problem of unemployment

cannot be completely solved until we get rid of the

present  colonial economic system  which  restricts

our  trade  and our industries in the interests  of

the colonial power, we believe that some action can

and  should  be  taken  to lessen  the  effects  of

unemployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, before any government can work on this

problem,  it  must  have accurate  information  and

statistics  on  the extent of unemployment  in  the

colony  and  we  therefore urge the  Government  to

carry  out  a  proper  survey  of  the  extent   of

unemployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we believe that if society is unable to

provide  employment for those willing and  able  to

work, it must give and provide them with a means to

exist at a decent human level. We therefore urge an

increase  in the present relief given to unemployed

persons through Public Assistance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



A  proper  system of registration of the unemployed

must  be  introduced not only for  the  problem  of

unemployment relief but also as an efficient labour

exchange.  At  present, employer and unemployed  do

not  regard  the Labour Exchange as a  satisfactory

channel to secure labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we must press for the introduction, as

soon  as  possible,  of  an unemployment  insurance

scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Important as these things are, they do not offer

a  positive solution to the problem of unemployment

but  are merely ways of alleviating the effects  of

unemployment."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in our day-to-day trials and

tribulations - particularly if we happen  to  be  the

Chief  Minister and at the same time  Minister  for

Labour,  instead of attending to the higher  duties

of state, one is interminably involved in trying to

settle disputes between recalcitrant employers  and

unions. One forgets the wider historical aspects of

the  economy  of this country. Does  any  one  here

dispute   that  we  have  been  a  base   for   raw

materials - cheap labour, cheap raw materials,  cheap

rubber, cheap tin - and that is why we have not  been

industrialised, that is why it is in the  interests

of  big companies to invest in plantations and  not

in factories? Every tyre, tube, or rubber sole that

we need to use, we import from Britain and abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as we are tied up with this capitalist

economy  and  as  long as this  capitalist  economy

undergoes  periodic trade depressions, whatever  we

can  do  here  cannot buffer ourselves against  the

effect  of  these  world  economic  cycles.  It  is

obvious  that before the problem can be tackled  we

must  first have control of our economic destinies.

We  must  be  masters in our own  homes.  In  every

country  in  South-East Asia that has emerged  from

colonialism - India,   Burma,  Pakistan,   Indonesia,

Ceylon -  the problem of rapid industrialisation  is

the  first one they have to face because they  have

previously    been    colonial   territories    for

investments for raw materials. To equip  themselves

for  modern  economic production,  to  provide  the

employment  and  the standards of living  that  the

people desire, rapid industrialisation is the  only

answer.  We face that same problem. But  we  cannot

hope to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



solve  that  problem  just  by  being  polite   and

friendly  to foreign capital. Foreign capital  will

not  come to Asia because they feel that Asia  does

not   provide   the   incentives  to   capital - high

dividends. There is still Africa where there  is  a

certainty  of  going on for some twenty  or  thirty

years  before the Africans in that continent  catch

up  with European imperialists. In Malaya today  it

is  not because we have militant trade unions  that

Australian  investors do not  want  to  build  more

factories. It is because they understand that there

is  a  revolution in Asia. That implies two things.

One, they work under certain limitations as to  the

extent  of profits they can rake out of the country

quickly.  Two, however much they may make  for  the

present, they will soon face a time when a  country

having  assumed control of its own economic destiny

wishes  to assert itself. It has happened all  over

SouthEast  Asia.  It  is happening  even  in  India

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time when we were in London, we were

regaled on several occasions by British people  who

had  large  interests in this  country.  The  first

thing they wanted to know about the P.A.P. was  not

whether  we  were  Communists or non-Communists  or

anti-Communists: "Tell me what are you going to  do

to  our  capital, to our factories?" So  I  blandly

looked at them, having had a magnificent repast and

said, "We shall do exactly what India has done.  We

do  not want to expropriate you. We do not want  to

act  illegally,  or act against the  principles  of

good  conduct which all nations in this world  wish

to  observe. We shall allow you to carry on so long

as  it  is  in our interest." They said, "Yes,  but

that is exactly the trouble you see, Lee. In India,

they are demanding more and more directorships  and

they  are  taking over our companies." That  is  an

inevitable  process  but  it  is  a  process  which

European   capitalists  find   difficult   to   get

reconciled to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways to carry out an

industrialisation programme in Asia. One, you  work

it  partly  by private enterprise with a calculated

national



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



policy,  laying  down  terms  and  conditions  that

foreign  enterprise should employ or train  locally

at  least 50 per cent of their managerial staff and

50  per cent of their technical staff. Ceylon tried

this policy with their European business houses. Or

like   India  where  Indian  capitalists  go   into

partnership with foreign capital. That is one  way.

The  second way is where, like in North Vietnam  or

China the State takes over the whole machinery. All

this  problem of capital accumulation and where  to

get money for investment is then solved because the

State  assumes  all the powers  that  it  wants  to

control the economic life of the country. Having  a

completely different economic system the  State  is

able to industrialise rapidly. We have not come  to

that  point where we have to decide how to  do  it.

Whether we follow the Indian way or the Chinese way

is  not  as  yet  in dispute. Until  we  are  free,

whether we are going to have a capitalist Malaya or

a  socialist Malaya is a purely academic question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fallacy to suggest that because there

have  been  strikes, because unions  are  militant,

therefore  we  have this lack of industrialisation.

Foreign capital does not want to come in for  other

political   reasons.  We  have  this   problem   of

unemployment and we have to find some solution.  We

cannot find a complete solution until we are  free.

But until we are free, let us try and alleviate  it

before it becomes too acute and produces unpleasant

political consequences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> How?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I have already said, one,

accurate statistics, two, to provide higher  public

assistance  and  relief and, three,  investigate  a

scheme for possible unemployment insurance.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> How will that cure unemployment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> We have not said that that will

cure  unemployment. In fact, we say that  important

as  these  things are, they do not offer a positive

solution  to  the problem of unemployment  but  are

merely ways of alleviating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



the  effects of unemployment. How can one  talk  of

curing   unemployment  when  one's  whole  economic

destiny is tied up with shareholders in London? Are

we in control of the direction of our trade? Are we

in  control  of  the  direction of  our  productive

activities?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After unemployment, the Government discusses

certain  expansion  of  social  services.  This  is

another   of   its  pious,  political   platitudes.

Paragraph 45 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government is profoundly convinced that the

expansion of national prosperity, with accompanying

expansion  of  social services and of  development,

can  only  be  achieved on the  basis  of  national

solidarity and national effort."



<br><br>What  does  it  mean? What is new? A lot  of  pious

platitudes! Here are some specific problems which I

think the Government can do something about:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1. The revision of the Trade Disputes Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The repeal of the English Act on which our Trade

Disputes  Ordinance is based as one  of  the  first

legislative   acts  of  the  new   British   Labour

Government in 1945 was a victorious culmination  of

nearly  two  decades of agitation by British  trade

union  movement. The Singapore copy  of  this  Act,

however, has not yet been repealed."



<br><br>We  seek to bring the local Trade Disputes Act into

line  with the Act which is now in force in England

and  thus help to safeguard the just and reasonable

rights of striking workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2. The Workmen's Compensation Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Ordinance was left alone when the old Labour

Ordinance was revised and replaced last year. Under

the    present   Ordinance,   workers    who    are

incapacitated  over  any  period  as  a  result  of

industrial injuries do not receive their  wages  in

full   for  their  period  of  absence.  Rates   of

compensation for permanent and partial  disablement

arising   out  of  industrial  injuries  are   also

inadequate.  The Party shall strive to  revise  the

provisions of the Workmen's Compensation  Ordinance

to make it more just."



<br><br>That is within the province of this Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"3. The Revision of the Labour Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the provisions of the Labour Ordinance

particularly those relating to payment  for  annual

leave  and  overtime payments have  given  rise  to

disputes and must be clarified."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



The Minister for Labour will remember that when  we

decided  to  provide annual leave  for  seven  days

instead  of one week, his intention then  was  that

annual  leave should be paid at the rate  of  seven

times the daily rate. Unfortunately, many employers

have  taken "seven days' annual leave" to mean  one

week's  annual  leave, which means the  daily  rate

times five and a half. He knows of one dispute with

a  transport  company which I had to refer  to  his

department.  Fortunately, this  particular  company

decided to accept the interpretation placed on this

section  by  the  Labour Ministry. There  are  many

other  companies  not  quite so  helpful  in  their

attitude. Rather than have this matter litigated in

the  courts one day, the section concerning  annual

leave  could be clarified so that there is no doubt

that  what is intended by the Legislature is  seven

times the daily rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the purpose of the reduction of the

working week from 48 hours to 44 hours was to  give

greater leisure to workers. It is not intended that

employers  could reduce the total weekly emoluments

of  workers. Some employers however have abused the

spirit of the Labour Ordinance and have reduced the

total  weekly  emoluments of their  employees.  The

true  purpose  and spirit of the reduction  of  the

working week must be respected by the employers. We

had  a long debate on this matter when the Bill was

in  Select Committee. We decided then to leave this

question  of  the wage adjustment when the  working

week  was  reduced from 48 hours to 44 hours  to  a

free   play   between  union  and  management.   We

envisaged  then  that there would  be  difficulties

with  some employers who may want to pay, 44  times

the  hourly  rate  instead of 48 times  the  hourly

rate.  We  envisaged also that there  may  be  many

unions who want to get 48 times the hourly rate for

working  44  hours.  But the  Minister  for  Labour

advanced this argument that certain industries  may

be  borderline, that, economically, from the  terms

of   efficiency,  they  are  on  the  margin.  That

therefore  there  should  be  room  for  adjustment

between union and employer. In the last few



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>



months,  this has given rise to a great  number  of

disputes. This was the issue which started the Fred

Waterhouse  Union dispute with the Fred  Waterhouse

Company.  One  sunny day a few  months  after  this

Ordinance was put into force, the employer  reduced

wages.  The reduced hourly rate times 44 plus  time

and  a half for overtime to meet the provisions  of

this  Ordinance would in fact give  the  workers  a

little more. When the workers discovered that  this

was  not  stipulated for in the Ordinance, a  great

deal of friction arose between the employer and the

union  which led to the company sacking  the  union

President, which led to the union going  on  strike

to support their President and which finally led to

a  great number of hours wasted by the Minister for

Labour. All this needs to be reviewed. It might  be

wiser  on  the part of the Government  to  have  it

clearly laid down that where the hourly rate cannot

be  agreed  between management and labour,  then  a

formula  must be applied. It should not  be  beyond

the  capacity  of his Government officials  in  the

Labour Ministry to work out a formula to provide  a

ready-made  solution  where  worker  and   employer

cannot  agree on the adjustment. If we do not  have

this ready-made solution ready for them in case  of

disagreement, we will have many more  strikes  over

this  issue of the reduction of the 48- to the  44-hour working week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The right of trade unions to collect political

funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This right has already been accorded to workers

in the Federation. The Hon. the Minister for Labour

will  remember  that in the first  debate  of  this

Assembly - those were buoyant days - he  said  that  he

would  in  the  near future accord  this  right  to

workers  in this territory. Since then, of  course,

much water has flowed under the bridge. More unions

have  popped  up, more members have  defeated  from

some  unions and joined other unions, and  so  this

question  of political funds for a union  has  been

conveniently  forgotten. We say that  whatever  the

inclinations of unions, they should have the  right

to have a political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



fund  for  political action and  we  look  to  this

Government  to  implement this  in  this  caretaker

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The subject of the workers in the Armed

Services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an ad-hoc arrangement whereby every

time  legislation was passed which affected workers

generally, the Armed Services were consulted.  They

then decide either to abide or not to abide by  the

new legislation. This is an unsatisfactory state of

affairs  and  the position must be regularised.  We

cannot have large sectors of our working population

outside   the  legislative  jurisdiction   of   the

Government  of Singapore. This position  should  be

settled  with  the British Government  particularly

before  the  Defence Treaty between the  Federation

and  the British Government is signed. We must have

this question of our right to fix minimum standards

of  employment for all our workers respected by the

British Armed Services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From labour relations, the Address with

appropriateness goes on to Malayanisation. This  is

the height of understatement. Paragraph 47 says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Detailed study of the report of the

Malayanisation Commission is now, far advanced  and

will  soon  be completed. The Government will  then

(on  some date in the indefinite future) publish  a

programme  for the phased replacement of expatriate

officers by Malayans."



<br><br>Here  was a hotly debated and controversial Report.

For  months the discussion of the Commission  raged

in  the  Press.  For months we had the  expatriates

cowering in the corners of their offices and  under

their  desks, as one by one their dirty  linen  was

brought  up  for the public view. The  ex-Hon. the

Chief Minister said in one of those moments when he

was  provoked,  that he had absolute confidence  in

the  Chairman  of the Malayanisation Commission.  I

had  indicated  to him then that the  Chairman  had

very  strong views on these matters, but  he  said,

"We  have  the  most  absolute  confidence  in  the

Chairman.  Let  us  wait for the Report."  Well  we

have. We have had the Report for five months. Those

of  us who went to London know the real reason  why

the  thing  was  not tabled and discussed.  It  was

because  Members on the Government side  wanted  to

use that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



as   a   lever.  In  the  middle  of  the   Merdeka

conference,  the  then  Chief  Minister  said,  "We

accept  the report for the first year since we  are

only  going  to be a Government for one  year  till

April 1957, when there will be fresh elections." So

he  hedged  on  this question of the Malayanisation

programme.  That  was a fairly logical  stand.  But

what  is  all  this  blabber here  about  fair  and

reasonable   compensation,   needs   for    keeping

efficiency, adequate supply of qualified  Malayans?

What we want to know right here and now is what  is

the   Government's  stand  on  the   Malayanisation

Report?  Does it accept the majority recommendation

or  does  it not? If it does not, why not?  Let  us

have  a  debate on it. We all know - it is  an  open

secret - that  some fantastic claims for compensation

are  being  staked by expatriates as the price  for

abolition. That is one of those things referred  to

euphemistically in the Address as:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Negotiations with the Staff Associations are in

progress."



<br><br>Let me say on behalf of my Party, and I think other

people in this House not belonging to my Party will

agree  with this, that the funds of the public  and

of   the   Government  are  not  largesse   to   be

distributed to a few European officials. Before any

agreement is reached with them, there should  be  a

full  and  frank debate. Let us have all the  dirty

linen washed in public, if necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, with even more appropriateness, after

discussing   this   question   of   Malayanisation,

paragraph  50  goes on to talk about gangsters  and

gansterism. Yes, we all endorse the desire of  this

Government    to   stamp   out   armed    thuggery,

intimidation,  extortion and all unlawful  pursuits

organised  by  unlawful  gangs.  But,  here  again,

although  boys' clubs can help, one can never  hope

to  tackle  this  problem unless  one  tackles  the

question    of    education    and     employment

opportunities.  As  long as  you  have  people  who

cannot  get  education and who cannot  get  gainful

employment, then you have to face this  problem  of

hoodlumism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From gangsters we go on to Singapore Battalion in

paragraph  51.  There is an air of unreality  about

this paragraph which says:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As Singapore moves towards complete self-government and national status, the need to

maintain its own armed forces becomes more  urgent.

Recruitment for the new Regular Battalion will open

shortly  and it is hoped that all sections  of  the

community will support the new Battalion ...".



<br><br>If   it  had  said,  "As  Singapore  moves  towards

complete  self-government, the need to maintain  an

army to help the police to defend our rights . . ."

that makes sense. We are going to have a battalion.

Whom  are  we  to fight against? Who  is  going  to

challenge  us?  Do we expect to fight  the  Siamese

armed forces? Or the armed forces of the Federation

of Malaya?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my knowledge, this idea of a battalion grew up

in  the  most curious fashion. We were then arguing

with  the  Secretary of State for the Colonies.  We

told  the then Chief Minister, "Why do you want  to

say  that  you  want to give all  these  things  to

Britain: `You will look after my defence; you  will

look  after my foreign affairs?' " But he said, "Ah,

I  am  not  Oliver Twist. I will give it all  away,

whatever  I want to give away." Well, having  given

it  all away, Mr Lennox-Boyd then turned round and

said,  "Well, you want my troops to defend you.  If

you  want my troops to defend you, then I must have

the  final  say in the Defence Council", which  was

logically  an  impregnable  position.  Not  to   be

defeated  by  logic, the then Chief  Minister  that

night summoned the Merdeka delegation and said, "We

will  have  a Singapore Battalion. Then we  do  not

have  to have British troops." We said to him, "You

are  not  seriously  suggesting  that  a  Singapore

Battalion  will man the Naval Base,  Blakang  Mati,

all  the airfields, and so on?" He said, "No, never

mind,  we will sign a treaty with Nepal for  Gurkha

troops.  Then  we  will not need  to  have  British

troops."  We were all too aghast for words.  So  we

told him that it had better not be put forward as a

serious  proposition. But, it was put forward.  The

result  is that now we have the Singapore Battalion

in the Governor's Address.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want a battalion just to be a reserve for

the  Singapore Police Force, then let it  be  clear

that  this  is a small battalion meant for  certain

specific



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



domestic purposes and not meant for war. This grand

sweeping statement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As Singapore moves towards complete self-government and national status, the need to maintain its own armed forces....",



<br><br>invokes a  vision

of resplendent men with steel helmets marching past

the  Chief  Minister at the Esplanade.  If  we  are

going  to  have  one battalion in case  the  Police

Force  finds it a bit difficult, and two riot  vans

not enough, let us put this thing into perspective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that we should get this whole Address

into perspective. What are we talking about?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You tell us.

destined for mankind in the next one week  will  be

the big blow-up in Suez and a great deal of trouble

that will follow after the big blow-up in Suez. Let

us  get  down to realities, to the basic  political

position  in Malaya and in Singapore. I  have  said

this  before, on many an occasion, but perhaps then

I  was  not believed. The battle for Malaya is  the

battle  in  the Federation. Singapore is  a  little

laboratory  where  the  British,  Nationalists  and

Communists  try  out  their  tactics  so  that   if

anything  goes  wrong, there is an explosion  on  a

laboratory  scale. The fight is in the  Federation.

My  Party has been criticised this morning  by  the

Chief  Minister  of  Singapore  for,  so  he  says,

attacking the Federation Government. Sir, my  Party

did  not set out to do so. No one who reads,  as  I

hope  the Minister for Local Government, Lands  and

Housing  has read, the statement, can say  that  we

have   set  out  to  queer  the  position  of   the

Federation  Government  or the  Alliance.  We  have

sought to present our analysis of the position



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



in  Malaya  and Singapore as it is today.  A  great

number  of things have happened since the elections

in  Singapore last April and in the Federation last

August  and  it is necessary to take stock  of  the

situation. We have propounded our analysis in  very

careful  terms.  Of course, some people  have  just

read Press extracts with exaggerated headlines  and

have  come  to the conclusion that the  P.A.P. has

lashed out at the Alliance and we were told to mind

our  own  business in Singapore. Sir, when Alliance

Ministers come down to Singapore and lash the  P.A.P.

in  Singapore, we have never had the  impudence  or

impertinence  to  tell Alliance Ministers  to  mind

their  own  business.  This is  our  business,  the

business of Singapore and the Federation.  You  can

in  legal  fiction divorce the two territories.  In

political  fact you cannot cut the two  territories

apart.  There  will be more trouble  with  the  two

territories  apart than if they were combined  into

one.   Politicians  often  wish  to  avoid   saying

anything which is inexpedient and which will invoke

popular  emotional protest. But  unless  we  resist

this  tendency, we find ourselves watered  down  to

weak and feeble statements. In this analysis - and  I

propose to read passages of the analysis to put the

picture  into  perspective - we have stated  what  we

think  is the position today. Nobody has taken  the

trouble  to read it and having read it, to disprove

this  thesis. We started with the present situation

and said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is nearly two years since our Party was

formed in November 1954. We stated in our Manifesto

then  the  long-term objectives of the  Party, the

fight  to end colonial domination, and the creation

of  an  independent, democratic Malaya, of a united

Federation  and  Singapore,  in  which  the   great

differences  of wealth and opportunity between  our

peoples  would be reduced and gradually  eliminated

by constitutional means, and a happy and prosperous

society established - [lnterruption.]



<br><br>I wish I could make this analysis more entertaining

but I regret that the situation as we see it is far

from entertaining.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At that time, the political situation in Malaya

was quite simple and clear to the people of Malaya.

The British were in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



blatant  and  open control of the country.  In  the

Federation, they had a wholly nominated Legislative

Council with a few weak local men as "Members"  of

the   Government.   In   Singapore   they   had   a

transparently farcical Legislative Council of  less

than  one  half  "elected" Councillors.  Government

policy and its execution were all in British hands.

The   people  were  discontented.  They  could  see

clearly that economic and social difficulties  were

caused  by foreign domination and exploitation.  So

the  cry  of  "Merdeka" rallied all,  both  in  the

Federation and Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will dispute that that was, in fact, the

truth.  Then we go on to say that colonial  control

is  now concealed and great umbrage has been  taken

by some people to this. But nobody denies that even

the  Federation  has not as yet got  Merdeka.  They

have  a promise of it in August 1957. And we go  on

to analyse the position at present:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Malayan situation confused. An independent,

democratic  Malaya  comprising a united  Federation

and  Singapore, appears further away today than  it

did before the elections. Many things have happened

since  April  1955: labour discontent and  strikes.

student  discontent and unrest in Chinese  schools,

the  inconclusive  Baling  talks,  the  promise  of

freedom  for  the Federation alone by August  1957,

the    failure    of   Singapore's   constitutional

conference and a lack of united action by Singapore

political Parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before it was the British who wanted to keep

Singapore  and the Federation politically separate.

Today  there  are among the Alliance leaders  those

who  do  not want Singapore to join the Federation.

Other   leaders  have  even  said   to   the   Reid

Constitutional  Commission that they  do  not  want

Merdeka unless they first get jus soli rights."



<br><br>We  have been reading all this in the Press.  These

are  statements of facts. All kinds of people  have

gone  before  the Reid Commission.  The  Singhalese

from  Malacca  said  that  they  wanted  to  remain

British subjects and be citizens of the Federation.

Leaders of Chinese guilds have gone before the Reid

Commission and said, "Unless we get jus soli, we do

not  want  Merdeka." Last year, there was  talk  of

amnesty  for  the Communists and peace  in  Malaya.

Now,  there is talk of surrender of Communists  and

the  need  for expanding the Malayan army  to  take

over   from   the  British  the  war  against   the

Communists.  It  is no wonder that  the  people  of

Malaya find the situation confusing. And so we went

on  to  explain  why  we say  that  the  trends  in

Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



and  in  the Federation are dangerous. We have  not

said  that  it  is the intention of  any  political

Party or any government to cause this racial strife

but   the  policies  that  are  at  present   being

implemented give reason for the greatest  disquiet.

Can  any  one deny that unrest amongst the  workers

and  squatters is not being traced to its  economic

and  social roots in the Federation and instead all

blame for strikes and discontent is placed upon the shoulders of Communist agitators and troublemakers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Instead of solving the economic problems which

cause  the  discontent,  a solution  is  sought  in

military  weapons, in the building  up  of  a  $500

million  army and in intensifying the  war  against

the  Communists. It is becoming increasingly  clear

that   the  army  and  the  gendarmerie   will   be

predominantly if not wholly Malay. And  that  these

Malay  forces  will be used to police predominantly

Chinese squatters and workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dangers of racial friction and conflict

between  the  Malays and the Chinese  are, already

present  and  if  the  Alliance  Government  drifts

further  along  the  road of repression  of  social

unrest  by  armed forces, it will mean, in  effect,

more  Malay police, special constables and soldiers

against Chinese squatters and workers."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not the first to say this, in fact,

several  Alliance leaders have raised  the  warning

against  racial  war  in the Federation.  We  fully

admit  that  it is their intention to prevent  any

such  thing from happening. In a democratic  State,

we  reserve  the right to give our views  of  where

their  policy is leading them - a policy not designed

to  bring  about  this racial friction  and  racial

strife but which unless checked will tend to' bring

it about. The first hallmark of a democratic State,

if  we are to run a democratic State in Malaya,  is

tolerance   of   criticism  from  other   political

Parties. If we are wrong in our thesis, let  it  be

disproved.  We took this stand and we are ready  to

be  criticised and to be proved wrong.  It  is  not

helpful  to say that we are just seeking  to  cause

trouble, that we should not interfere and that,  in

fact, we are a lot of mischief makers. When we  say

what  other people have said before and we say  it

in moderate language, we have been denounced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future of Singapore lies with the Federation.

It is no use trying to pretend that we could, if it

came to it, get on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>



without the Federation. It is no use the Federation

trying  to  pretend  that it can ignore  Singapore.

Singapore is the spark plug for all kinds of things

that  are happening in the Federation. As  long  as

Singapore  is distinct and separate, the Federation

Government is faced with a situation in which, one,

it  has  no  direct  control of  the  situation  in

Singapore,  and,  two, it has no means  to  prevent

ideas  from crossing over the Causeway  on  to  the

Federation.  It  is no use telling workers  in  the

Federation  that they are unreasonable  and  stupid

when,   in  fact,  they  see  that  militant  trade

unionism  has brought about general wage  increases

in Singapore. The only solution is to run these two

territories  as one unit so that one will  moderate

the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another important issue like education I watch

with  fear the differences in emphasis in Singapore

and   the  Federation:  a  Singapore  predominantly

Chinese  with  well organised Chinese students  and

giving  the bias on Chinese education; a Federation

that  gets  frightened that such a  policy  may  be

transported  across the Causeway and going  to  the

other extreme of pressing its over-Malay emphasised

policy.  The  separation of these  two  territories

with  all the resultant biases as a result  of  the

racial  composition  in the two territories  cannot

but  make  for difficulties both here  and  in  the

Federation. Sooner or later I hope reason,  careful

thinking  and  facing  of facts  will  bring  these

territories together. If it is emotion,  if  it  is

appeals  to  the instinctive loyalties of  man,  to

religions  and race, then I do not see how  we  can

hope  to  moderate  the  over-Chinese  emphasis  in

Singapore  and  the  over-Malay  emphasis  in   the

Federation.  The only chance of doing that  is  for

both   territories  to  face  the  facts   of   the

situation,  that they are parts of one  country  in

the  South-East Asian scene, that somehow or  other

they must find a modus vivendi to live and let live

as one happy community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the time being, we are preoccupied with the

next Merdeka talks. That is as far as we can go. We

know  that  beyond  that our  future  lies  with  a

Greater  Malaya.  To think otherwise  would  be  to

think  in  terms  of  Port Swettenham  becoming  an

international



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>



port,   of   Kuala  Lumpur  airport   becoming   an

international airport and the consequent  diversion

of  trade, of having all the business houses  moved

up to Kuala Lumpur and of Singapore perishing as  a

second  Malta  in  the  Far  East,  its  livelihood

dependent on military bases on the island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately we are a long way yet from that

irretrievable position. For the time being, we have

a certain definite task ahead and that is to reopen

the  Merdeka  talks.  I am glad  to  see  that  the

present  Government has the good sense to  pick  up

where  the P.A.P. left off - complete internal  self-government.

When we said that the last time, the ex-Chief Minister

became very angry. I knew reporters

who were roundly rebuked for daring to suggest that

it  was anything other than independence which  was

going  to be achieved. For to suggest that we  were

only  fighting for internal self-government was  to

detract  from  the ex-Chief Minister's achievement.

Sir,  we tried to face the facts then as we saw  it

and  tried to moderate the situation. That  was  as

far as we could go.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, we are interested in seeing two

steps ahead; one, the next Merdeka conference; two,

the  step beyond that. What is there in the present

situation   that  will  make  the  next  conference

succeed  where  the last one has failed?  The  same

Party  is  in power, the same Parties  are  in  the

Opposition  and the same people are waiting  to  be

Chief   Ministers.   The  position   is   basically

unchanged - of  course, we all know that  the  Member

for  Changi  (Mr Lim Cher Kheng) has since  broken

off with old friends and colleagues on that side.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Guess why?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> We all know that the Member for

Kampong Kapor (Mr Seah Peng Chuan) has had unhappy

differences with Members on that side of the  House

no  doubt  for good political reasons and questions

of  principle,  and we all miss  the  former  Chief

Minister about whose sojourn in Peking we are daily

reminded by the Chinese Press. Apart from all that,

is  there  anything different that will  make  this

team  that will go succeed where the last  one  had

failed?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let us find out why the last one

failed.   Has   there  been  any  change   in   the

international situation that is in our favour?  Are

we  going  to  go  there  and  meet  a  Lennox-Boyd

demoralised, ready to compromise, willing to yield?

What  has happened in the international field? Lots

of bombs and grenades have exploded in Cyprus since

we  left  London. Colonel Nasser has been called  a

dictator and British troops are moving into  Cyprus

in  great strength. Before the end of this week, we

shall  know whether we are going to be in a  bigger

and  more  dangerous Korea, with the Arab world  on

the  one  side,  pipelines being cut,  British  and

French   troops  coming  in  to  make   sure   that

international rights are respected and the Canal is

kept  open.  The Secretary-General  of  the  Soviet

Republic  has already said that Russian  volunteers

are  going  and that if he had a son he would  send

his son and lots of other people who have sons will

send  their  sons. Then the Far  East  will  go  by

default.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that apart, assuming that nothing blows up to

smithereens, we are going back to London. I keep on

saying "we", but I do not really know who "we" are.

Whoever  goes  back  to  London  has  got  to  have

something extra which was missing the last time  or

they  cannot  deliver the goods. They  will  either

have to compromise in which case they will be faced

with  a  great deal of trouble here, or  they  will

fail.  The  last time right in the  middle  of  the

conference,  the Chairman or the President  of  the

Liberal-Socialist Party announced to the world that

he  was  ready to form a government if these  talks

failed.  One can imagine the effect it had  on  the

delicate constitution of our then Chief Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British knew that we had reached all-Party

agreement on certain heads. But they knew and  knew

publicly  as  a  result of the  activities  of  the

people  whom  we  left behind in  Singapore - not  my

friend the Member for Tiong Bahru (Mr William Tan)

who  was in London and cannot be held to blame  for

it.  They said that they were ready to carry on the

government. The British Government knew that if the

talks  failed,  there  would be  no  constitutional

crisis.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



They  knew  that all that would happen would  be  a

slight reshuffle in the team. Since that is  not  a

situation  that  one  should  be  unduly  concerned

about,  they  allowed a reshuffle in the  team.  We

congratulate  the  present Chief  Minister  on  his

skill  and  dexterity in making  the  reshuffle  as

inconspicuous as possible. But if he is faced  with

the  same position again, he must face failure. The

next  time  he  must assure himself of  a  position

where sabotage is not present.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Especially from you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> All political groups - when I say

all political groups, I do not mean Independents or

those  who have forfeited the right of representing

the   masses.   The  Chinese  expression   for   an

Independent  Member is much more  accurate  and  is

more  pungent than the English one. We call Members

in  this  House  who  do not belong  to  any  Party

"Independent"   meaning  that  they   depend   upon

themselves. The Chinese with a wry sense of  humour

call  them  "wu  tang wu pai" which  means  without

Party, without stand -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Nonsense! You go and learn

some more Chinese!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Anyway it sounds very curious.

This  type  is increasing but we are not  concerned

with  them in the next Merdeka talks. We  know  who

will not be going.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible if the Chief Minister is

determined  to  assure himself of his  position  of

strength to organise all the anti-colonial  Parties

together  in  one  group: one, to call  a  national

convention; two, to plan the tactics for  the  next

talks;  and  three,  this  is  the  most  important

one - this is the sting which will make it succeed - to

plan  concerted and united all-Party constitutional

action  if the next talks fail. If the British  are

again  confident in the coming talks that if  there

is  a  failure, there will be another reshuffle  of

this  Assembly,  that Members will move  over  from

this  side to the other side and Members  from  the

other  side  will move to this side and  some  will

stay  behind, then success is uncertain. There  may

be  no progress. But if they are confronted with  a

solid



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



phalanx  of  anti-colonial groups who have  decided

upon  what they will do at the talks, and what they

will  do  after  the talks if they fail,  then  the

chances of success will be much greater. The  Chief

Minister can then go back to London either alone as

he  did recently, or with others, whichever way  he

will, but in a stronger position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are told that this is a motion of confidence.

We  said  when the Government took office  that  we

supported the Government as a caretaker Government.

What  the Chief Minister has said this morning  has

to a certain extent made up for what was lacking in

this  Governor's  Address.  In  this  Address,  the

question of self-government was treated as  lightly

as   the  leader  of  the  Liberal-Socialist  Party

treated  it. He was interested in houses,  bee-hoon

sellers, fish sellers - I am not saying that they are

not  important - I.C.I. fertilisers,  prospects  for

business,   youth  clubs,  youth  problems,   night

courses, and the narrow Yio Chu Kang Road which  he

unfortunately has to travel up and down every  day.

The   Labour  Front  forgot  self-government  after

mentioning  it in the third paragraph.  Then  comes

the Party theoretician who puts in at the end three

resounding  paragraphs  which  wind  up   with   an

incantation to God to ensure success.  Let  us  not

leave  these things in the lap of the gods. Let  us

make  sure  as  far  as  we  can  of  positions  of

strength, positions from which we can talk, bargain

and act effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the understanding that the Government calls a

national  convention to plan the  tactics  for  the

talks  and to plan united action if the talks fail,

my  Party  will  give  this Government  a  vote  of

confidence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  have been treated today to an exhibition of the

most  destructive criticism ever launched  in  this

House. This Address of His Excellency contains what

must  be  at  least 75 per cent  of  the  aims  and

aspirations  of the People's Action Party.  Anybody

who  has  his country's interests at heart and  who

has  socialistic tendencies cannot but  accept  all

that is hoped for and all that is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



aimed  in  this  Address and  we  are  prepared  to

support  all  that is contained in His Excellency's

Address.  But  our  friend the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar  (Mr  Lee Kuan Yew) can see  nothing  in  it

except  pious  words, blah, blah, blah and  ridicule

for  anybody else except his own opinions  and  his

own  ideas.  The exhibition he gave me today  makes

his stand very clear. When he went through item  by

item  of the Address, he appeared to me like a bull

in  a  china  shop  looking  at  every  teacup  and

smashing it if it was not red enough to his liking.

That  I  am afraid is the attitude. From his ideas,

it is clear that what he wants is not evolution but

destruction   of   every  other   institution   and

constitution so that he can rebuild as an  autocrat

and does what he likes with the country. Naturally,

in  such  a  country, there will be no unemployment

simply because every one will have to work and if a

person  does  not  work, he is made  to  work.  The

penalty,  of  course,  for not  working  is  either

starvation  or  the slave camp. Do you  think  that

there will be strikes in such a country with such a

system? Not on your life!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> You have been reading too many U.S.I.S. pamphlets.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> The only strikes that will be

allowed  will  be  fostered in the countries  where

there  is  democracy, where people are  allowed  to

speak,  allowed to bargain and allowed to riot  and

those who instigate these can sit quietly smug  and

smiling.  It  seems to me that he  has  a  peculiar

mentality.  Maybe it is one of the results  of  the

occupation  by  the  Japanese  when  every  act  of

someone  else is viewed with suspicion and ulterior

motive. There seems to be a kink somewhere in  that

he  cannot  appreciate  a person's  act  without  a

bitter  and  sinister motive behind it.  Even  such

aids  as  the  Colombo  Plan,  the  milk  machinery

offered  by  the Australian Government  are  viewed

with grave suspicion and the doctors who are coming

here to teach us are not acceptable to him. He says

that  such  acts  are  an  infiltration.  Yes,   an

infiltration if you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



like, an infiltration to make it more difficult for

any  other  power who wants to move into  Singapore

when we get independence. That is the view of how I

look upon it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow or the other, he has always chosen me to

be the butt of his sarcastic remarks. I do not know

why his remarks are filled with such acidity. Maybe

it is because the grapes are sour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on this Bukit Sembawang compensation, I do

not think he could have chosen a worse instance  to

blame  private  owners  for  not  compensating  the

tenants  on their land. In this particular case,  I

know that the people who were on the land were paid

a  better compensation than those who were on Crown

land. Each of them - there were six of them who  were

removed  in  the  first phase of  building - received

approximately  10,000  sq. ft. of  land  and  the

compensation was $1,500, even for the smallest hut,

for  which Government only paid a dollar  a  square

foot.  When  you talk of compensation,  it  is  not

legal compensation that the people are entitled to.

It  is  because times have changed and people  feel

that those who are in very poor circumstances ought

to  be  given something to enable them to get along

when  they have to shift from the places which they

have occupied for a long time. As a man who went on

land and sat there, his right up to the present and

until it is changed by the Member for Tanjong Pagar

is only a month's notice but Government

and  many  people have found it  right  that  he

should be given something to go on and I can assure

him  that  this  Company  has  done  all  that  the

Government  has  done, if not more.  Yes,  we  have

resisted some claims because the Member for Ponggol-Tampenis (Mr Goh Chew Chua) comes along and  tells

the  squatter, "You join our Party and then we will

see  that  you get compensation according  to  your

heart's  wishes. If you put your changkol into  the

soil,  that  land is yours." The Member  for  Bukit

Timah  (Mr  Lim Ching Siong) goes stumping  around

the  country telling all his people, "We will  give

you compensation. You strike and ask for more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



pay.  You  will  get it and if not, there  will  be

trouble."  Right! The Member for Tanjong  Pagar  in

this  House says, "You follow me and you  will  get

what  you  want.  When I get into  the  Government,

everybody  will get compensation according  to  his

heart's  content - full employment." But he does  not

tell  him, of course, that if he asks too much,  he

will find himself in a slave camp.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> He is reading U.S.I.S.

pamphlets.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> I have finished with my friend

or  my enemy and I come to the more serious part of

today's debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I for one have been greatly moved by our Chief

Minister's speech. I believe his sincerity, in  his

wish  to try and pick up the threads of Government,

to  put  together the shattered teapot  and  to  do

something for the good of Singapore. For  that,  we

and  our Party will support him and I can say  that

he  has  convinced the Member who came  with  every

intention  of  challenging  him  today.  His  is  a

difficult  job, and no one envies him and  we  will

wish him all the luck and success that you may get.

We stand with you on the question -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the hon. Member standing with the

Chair or with the Chief Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> I am sorry. We stand with the

Chief  Minister  on  his  ideas  of  getting  self-government.  I believe he said on the  occasion  of

the opening of the Merdeka Bridge that you have  to

work  for Merdeka and you cannot rush and  ask  for

self-government. lf he is going  to  work  towards

Merdeka  in  the  same way the Merdeka  Bridge  was

built,  I  am  fully  with him.  Now  that  I  have

criticised destructive criticism, I hope  to  offer

some  constructive ones. Today is the day when  the

steward,  that is the Government in power,  renders

to  its  master,  the public, his  account  of  the

year's  stewardship. His work is not judged by  the

hopes  and aspirations which he thinks that he  can

achieve during the next year or next few years  but

can  only be assessed by what he has done. I do not

think  the Chief Minister can claim to be proud  of

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



achievements of the previous Government during  the

past  year.  Much  of the time  was  spent  in  the

struggle  for more power and settlement of  strikes

instead  of  constructive work. There  has  been  a

general slowing down in the public service and this

is  reflected  in the housing programme  when  just

over  1,000 houses will be completed this  year  as

compared  with 3,000 last year. This  is  indeed  a

severe  setback.  The excuse of  vacant  sites  not

being available cannot account for the decrease  of

over  50  per  cent as the difficulty  of  clearing

sites was allowed for when the target of only 2,500

units  was  decided on. If this  can  happen  to  a

programme planned years ahead, what will happen  to

objectives  which are still in the planning  stage?

Housing is one of the items of topmost priority and

we  cannot and must not let the public down on this

score. We hope the target of 6,000 units per  annum

will be achieved in the near future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very glad indeed that Government has a

firm  intention of establishing new industries  and

for  that  purpose  not only  will  the  people  of

Singapore   be  encouraged  to  invest   in   local

enterprises but foreign capital will be  attracted.

However  it  is by deeds alone and not  words  that

confidence  in investments will be restored.  There

is  no  use  closing  our eyes  to  the  fact  that

confidence in Singapore was severely shaken by  the

riots,  strikes  and intemperate language  used  in

this  House, even this afternoon. We shall have  to

restore  confidence  again before  we  can  attract

capital  and  this can only be done by  hard  work,

sound leadership and a firm Government. During  the

past few months, there have been welcome signs of a

change for the better and it is most encouraging to

find trade union leaders warning the members not to

be  misled by unscrupulous men who are prepared  to

call  workers to strike to further their  own  ends

without  regard to the fact that the  industry  may

not  be  able  to meet their demands  resulting  in

permanent  loss of employment due to the  factories

having  to  cease operation. Of course, the  Member

for Tanjong Pagar denies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



that  there are such factories. There are  a  great

number.  He  denies  them  because  his  Party   is

responsible  for their ceasing operation.  We  must

realise  that  the most serious problem  facing  us

today  is unemployment which is steadily increasing

during  the  year. The factories  which  came  into

operation this year could not absorb those who lost

their  employment due to factories having to  close

down or curtail production. Added to this, are  the

10,000  odd people each year who will leave  school

to look for employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion to establish an Industrial

Promotion   Board   to  assist  the   small   scale

manufacturer is an excellent one but  I  am  afraid

that   many   small  scale  manufacturers   require

immediate  help  and  they  cannot  wait  for   the

establishment of the Board. I have been one of  the

strongest supporters of free trade but I cannot see

how  we  can  continue to find employment  for  our

workers without some measure of protection for  our

industries against dumping of subsidised  goods  by

foreign countries. A fair test as to whether  goods

are  subsidised  or  not is the difference  in  the

price  obtaining in the country of origin  and  the

export  price. Every nation at some stage or  other

has  had  to protect her industries against  unfair

competition to prevent mass unemployment and  I  am

afraid  that we have come to that stage.  Wages  in

Singapore have gone up to such an extent that  many

manufacturers and shopkeepers find it impossible to

compete   against  goods  manufactured  in  foreign

countries  and they are being forced  at  first  to

curtail production and then to cease operation.  In

particular,  I refer to the bee-hoon or  vermicelli

industry.  A  year  ago, there  were  25  factories

employing  600 odd men. Today, there  are  only  20

factories employing under 400 men. This is  due  to

such fierce competition from Thailand that over  60

per cent of bee-hoon sold in Singapore is imported.

At  this  rate,  in  a  few more  months,  all  the

Singapore  factories will have  to  close  down.  I

realise  the difficulties of imposing a tariff  due

to  our entrepot trade but I suggest that we cannot

let  another  400  men be thrown into  the  already

swollen  ranks  of our unemployed. I  suggest  that

there should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



be  a restriction on import so that dealers of bee-hoon  instead  of  being allowed to  import  10,000

piculs,  which is the average consumption per  year

including the exports from Singapore, be allowed to

import  5,000 piculs, that is half the amount,  and

be made to buy the other half locally. This is only

a suggestion which I think can save the industry. I

shall welcome any other suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sad state of affairs prevails in the shoe

industry. Nearly all the shoes we see in the  shops

today  are  imported  and our  shoemakers  are  now

unemployed.  What  is the use  then  of  Government

preparing  legislation  to  set  up  an  Industrial

Promotion Board to assist small scale manufacturers

when  many are already facing bankruptcy?  We  must

take immediate steps to help them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We notice with satisfaction Government's

intention to provide more medical services,  social

services  and  amenities in  the  urban  and  rural

areas.  Such  schemes will have to be paid  for  by

increased  revenue and we are told that the  burden

will fall on members of the community best able  to

carry it. No one can or will grudge the improvement

of  the  standard of our workers but we  must  take

care  that  the burden of taxation will not  be  so

heavy  that  it kills all incentive  to  start  new

enterprises.  It is much easier to  keep  investors

away  than to attract them and unless they  can  be

assured  of  a reasonable return, they will  invest

elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I deplore the rise in the cost of administration

which  has made it necessary for Government to  ask

this  House  to approve supplementary  votes  every

quarter. If we are to spend more in social services

of  which we are all agreed, we must see that every

dollar we spend is spent wisely.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

once  again,  the  Government  has  reaffirmed  its

social



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the few points which I would like to deal

with  today,  Sir, is the problem  confronting  the

rural people. As has been stated by the Member  for

Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) many of the  rural

people  are now suffering hardship due to  eviction

from  their  places. I have at  the  moment  in  my

Division,  Sir, nearly 300 squatters who are  faced

with  eviction  notices. The present  Rent  Control

Ordinance  affords  little  protection  for   these

people.  I  do suggest that an examination  of  the

existing  Rent Control Ordinance be  made  and,  if

possible -

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr R. Jumabhoy</b> asked the Chief Secretary what

steps, if any, are being taken to protect innocent

people  with  tattoo marks on  their  bodies  from

being arrested.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode:</b> Persons are not interrogated

by  the  Police  merely because they  bear  tattoo

marks.  They are only detained for questioning  if

they  are suspected to be acting or to have  acted

as  members  of unlawful societies, and  any  such

person with a tattoo mark which is the insignia of

an unlawful society is presumed, according to law,

to  be a member of that unlawful society until the

contrary  is  proved. Comprehensive measures  have

been   taken   to   ensure   that   persons    who

inadvertently bear these particular  tattoo  marks

are  not  questioned again. The name and  identity

card number of the person concerned are circulated

to  all  Police Divisions and Branches to  prevent

that  person  being  again  questioned.  The  same

procedure  is adopted in the cases of persons  who

were  formerly members of secret societies against

whom there is no evidence of recent secret society

activity. Since 16th July, 1956, when "Operation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>



Dagger"   was   launched,   276   persons    have

voluntarily subjected themselves to screening  and

their  names  have been accordingly circulated  to

all Police Divisions and Branches. The success  of

these  measures is shown by the fact that  between

16th  July, 1956, and 28th August, 1956, only  two

suspects are known to have been detained twice for

questioning, and neither of these was among  these 276 persons.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Chief Secretary

whether  he  will  give  a  detailed  statement  on

"Operation Dagger".



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode:</b> During the first six months

of 1956 there was an alarming increase in crimes of

violence  perpetrated by secret society  gangsters.

This  increase was reflected in the number of armed

robberies which rose from 56 during the first  half

year  of 1955 to 111 during the first half of 1956.

Gang  fights  and  organised  assaults  had  become

frequent  occurrences and during May and June  1956

there  were 15 incidents in which secret  societies

were  involved  and no fewer than  70  gang  fights

which were broken up or prevented by Police action.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 16th July, 1956, the Commissioner of Police

launched  a  vigorous campaign known as  "Operation

Dagger"  designed to disorganise the societies  and

to   disperse  the  members.  The  object  of  this

campaign  was  to  make  it  difficult  for  secret

society  members to move around the city in  groups

and  terrorise their victims by weight of  numbers.

Over  a  long  period the Police have  built  up  a

comprehensive record of secret societies which  are

known   to  number  over  300,  and  have  prepared

dossiers  of  a  hard  core of  over  4,000  active

supporters of these societies. Information had also

been collected and collated which showed the places

where gangs congregated and the areas in which each

society exercised its influence and control. Police

Units  have  been  taken off  other  duties  and  a

concerted drive has been made in these areas  where

secret societies have been most active.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 16th July to 28th August, 1956, the Police

have  questioned and screened 922 suspects, of whom

736  were found to be already on record as  members

of  secret  societies. During this same  period  76

persons  have  been  charged in  Court  with  being

members   of  unlawful  societies,  44  have   been

convicted,  32  cases are pending, and  there  have

been no acquittals. In addition, many known members

of  secret  societies have been charged with  other

offences such as armed robbery, extortion, criminal

intimidation,  possession  of  dangerous   weapons,

assault and rioting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of these operations on serious crime

and gang activity is shown by the facts that during

the  six  weeks  prior to "Operation Dagger"  there

were  31  cases of armed robbery and  13  cases  of

secret  society  gang  fights  and  incidents,  and

during the six weeks after "Operation Dagger" there

were  14  cases of armed robbery and not  a  single

secret society gang fight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of "Operation Dagger" has been mainly

due  to  the disorganisation of the gangs, and  the

dispersal  of members, many of whom have gone  into

hiding,   and  the  consequent  greater   ease   in

obtaining information from members of the public.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Chief Secretary

whether  he will give a detailed statement  on  the

findings  by  the Police of the Vice  and  Gambling

activities, and what steps have so far  been  taken

to suppress these activities.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode:</b> Action by the Police in

respect   of  vice  and  gambling  covers  measures

concerned  with prostitution, indecent publications

and performances, and gambling and lotteries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards prostitution, the Police are not able

to  take  action against prostitutes as  such,  but

they  seek  to check the evil by prosecution  under

the  Aliens Registration Ordinance of hotel-keepers

who  fail  to register particulars of the occupants

of  hotel rooms. There are 226 hotels in Singapore,

exclusive of boarding houses, and up to the end  of

July  1956  the Police, in liaison with the  Social

Welfare  Department,  made 396  routine  checks  of

hotels. As the result of these checks 46 cases were

taken  to Court and fines amounting to $9,790  were

imposed by the Courts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main part of the new Hotels Ordinance was

brought  into  force on 10th August and  the  penal

provisions   will  be  brought  into   force   when

sufficient time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



has  been  given  to processes of registration  and

licensing    of    hotel   and    boarding    house

establishments  and their keepers.  Enforcement  of

these  provisions should prevent hotels from  being

used by known prostitutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards indecent publications and

performances,  action  is taken  whenever  suitable

evidence is forthcoming against vendors of  obscene

photographs  and against editors and publishers  of

mosquito newspapers publishing obscene articles. In

the first seven months of the year, 21 persons have

been  arrested,  one  person  summoned,  and  fines

totaling $3,991 have been imposed by the Courts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications for theatrical performances are

carefully  scrutinised and licences are refused  or

cancelled   in   cases   where   performances   are

considered improper or immoral.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A campaign steadily increasing in intensity

during the first seven months of the year has  been

carried out against gambling and lotteries, and 503

raids have been made resulting in 794 arrests,  and

fines  amounting  to $70,632 have been  imposed  on

persons  brought into Court. These raids have  been

on  clubs  and  on  common  gaming  houses  and  in

connection with "chap-ji-kee" lotteries.
