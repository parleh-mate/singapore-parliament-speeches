<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ho Kah Leong.).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the kampung areas there still exist common

problems  which  have to take a considerably  long

time to solve and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



with   much  effort.  Therefore,  in  the  present

circumstances, I find it necessary to speak up  in

this  House  with  all earnestness  to  appeal  on

behalf  of  the  rural  people,  hoping  that  the

authorities  can sympathise with the  difficulties

and  sufferings  of these people and  to  exercise

some flexibility in order to allow them to enjoy a

more  reasonable and better livelihood and a  more

hygienic way of living. In this way, I hope it can

reduce  the loss to the country. By loss,  I  mean

the  problem  of the drinking water  of  the  poor

rural people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that in this world if there is no

water, it is tantamount to having no blood in  our

human  body.  We  know  that  water  is  precious,

especially in Singapore as it has to depend  on  a

neighbouring   country  for  its   water   supply.

Therefore, water is all the more precious  to  us.

In  recent  months, we use to hear or see  on  the

television,  over  the radio and  Rediffusion,  in

public  places and in the newspapers,  the  appeal

and  advice not to waste water. In fact,  even  if

water  is  inexhaustible, because it is a  primary

need  for life, we have to treasure it. We  should

not waste it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rural areas, there are still some people

staying  in  attap  and wooden houses.  Originally

they  had to depend on public standpipes for their

drinking   water.  However,  since   many   public

standpipes have been shut or removed, their  water

supply  was  also  cut off. But for  the  sake  of

making  a  living and because of health, they  are

willing  to  save  up  to  pay  for  the  cost  of

installation   of  water  pipes.  However,   their

applications were turned down because they have no

house  numbers. Thus they could not get any  water

supply.   As  a  result,  these  people  have   no

alternative  but to try to get their water  supply

from   their   nearest  friends   or   some   good

samaritans. Even the Minister can appreciate  that

they  cannot live without water. So this puts them

in  a  predicament. They can only get very  little

water for their daily needs. They pass their  days

in this way, as though they are living in hell!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rural areas water is very important

because  many of them rear domestic livestock  and

poultry.  Poultry  animals  are  not  like   human

beings.  They will defecate anywhere  and  at  any

time  they like. They cannot be taught  to  go  to

proper places to do so. In these circumstances how

are   we   going  to  prevent  pollution  of   the

environment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now our Government has set up a department for

the control of environmental pollution. Since some

of our people live in such unhygienic environment,

how  are  we  going  to  bring  up  a  new  rugged

generation? If this situation were to persist  for

some time, I am sure this will become a burden  to

the society, and it will also constitute a loss to

the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that Members will also agree with me

that  in  the  rural areas, even today  there  are

still  many unauthorised attap houses. This  is  a

fact.  This  is  not something that  only  happens

today. You can trace this fact up to the time when

Rallies  founded Singapore and set up the colonial

Government.  However, since rural  people  are  in

existence, if we do not supply water to  them,  we

can  all  feel that these unfortunate  people  who

stay in houses without numbers will not be able to

live  in a hygienic environment. Of course,  I  do

not  mean to say that the Government has not  done

anything.  Ever since the present Government  came

to  office,  it has done many things. However,  we

should   also   remember  that  in   the   present

circumstances  we  can  still  try  to  solve  the

problem,  if  not, the fundamental  cause  of  the

ills. The Government can exercise some flexibility

and  relax its rules and so allow those people who

stay  in  unnumbered houses to install water-pipes

in order to solve their problem of drinking water.

In  this  way,  the Government is keeping  to  its

policy  of  giving the people a better environment

to  live in. This will also promote public  health

and prevent pollution from worsening. Furthermore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



if  the  Government insists on its hard  and  fast

rule  that  houses without numbers should  not  be

allowed  to  install piped water, then our  recent

efforts  in  the various campaigns in  respect  of

anti-mosquito,  anti-pollution,   etc, will   be

wasted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  as a Member of Parliament  from  a

rural constituency, I fully endorse and sympathise

with  the Member for Paya Lebar in respect of  the

hardships   suffered  by  the  rural   people   of

Singapore.  It  is, therefore, my  hope  that  the

Minister  will  give sympathetic consideration  to

his appeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I would like to take the opportunity to

raise  a  few points with the Minister. The  first

question  is  that of the disposal  of  industrial

waste.  We  know  that industrial  development  in

Singapore is in full swing and is going at a  very

high  rate.  As a result there has  also  been  an

increase of industrial waste in Singapore.  In  my

view, the present method of disposal of industrial

waste is inadequate. Whether it is in respect of a

single-storey factory or flatted factories, we can

see  that around such factories there is always  a

collection of industrial waste, heaps and heaps of

rubbish attracting a lot of flies and other pests.

They  are  also  a  fire  hazard.  In  fact,  some

factories  have  suffered losses as  a  result  of

fire. I wonder whether the Minister concerned  has

any  new  method  of disposal of the  accumulating

industrial waste in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question I wish to raise is in

connection  with  air pollution  in  Jurong  Town.

Jurong Town has developed into an industrial  area

with  many factories in production. There are some

40,000  people living in the residential  part  of

the industrial town.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a recent survey, there is indication

to  show  that the air in Jurong Town is the  most

polluted. As



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



a  result,  there  have been many complaints  from

residents  who  are concerned over the  increasing

pollution  of  the  air  in their  environment.  I

would, therefore, ask the Minister whether  he  is

aware  of the increase of air pollution in  Jurong

Town. I have received complaints from residents in

Jurong  Town that every morning when they wake  up

they  can  see and feel a layer of black  dust  on

their  furniture, or on any flat  surface  in  the

house.  I  would like to ask the Minister  whether

the  black dust is injurious to health and whether

steps  are taken to ensure that the production  of

such black dust is minimised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I would like to raise the question

regarding the hygienic conditions of Jurong  Town.

Jurong   Town  is  a  model  industrial  town   in

Singapore. Tourists very often pay visits to  this

industrial town. Because of these foreign  visits,

whether  the state of the environment is  hygienic

or  not will leave a good or bad impression on the

foreign visitors. Sir, does the Minister know what

is  the  actual  position regarding  the  hygienic

environment  of Jurong Town? I have seen  that  in

some    places   the   situation   is   far   from

satisfactory.  Some drains are choked  up  in  one

place, and in other places, rubbish is strewn  all

over.  These  are the places occupied  by  foreign

workers. Perhaps these imported labourers  do  not

know the legal aspects of our social requirements.

There  may be cases of those who choose to  ignore

our  requirements. But the fact remains that there

are  people  in  Jurong Town who do  not  keep  to

public  health  standards. I  wonder  whether  the

Minister concerned can do something about this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am most happy to learn

that  the Member for Paya Lebar is now well  aware

that  water is precious. He has further emphasised

how  precious  water  is to  us  in  Singapore  by

enumerating  the difficulties which  some  of  his

constituents  have  faced  because  they  suddenly

found  themselves without water. I  think,  having

understood how



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



precious water is, he will probably understand the

reason  why we are removing standpipes  because  a

lot  of  wastage has been caused by  these  stand-pipes. Sir, the removal of standpipes in the  Paya

Lebar constituency is not done arbitrarily.  I  am

sure   all  Members  are  aware  that  the   Water

Department of the Public Utilities Board have,  in

all  instances  of  the  removal  of  stand-pipes,

worked  closely  with Members of  Parliament.  The

procedure  adopted before removing a standpipe  is

this:  the Water Department will consult the Urban

and  Rural Services Committee which, in turn, will

consult  the  Citizens' Consultative Committee  of

the  area. The Member of Parliament is the adviser

to  the CCC of his constituency. It is only  after

these   two  Committees  are  satisfied  that   an

alternative supply of water is available, or  that

there is an alternative supply of water, then  and

only then will the standpipe be cut off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Member for Paya Lebar, I am

sure  this procedure was followed. As far as I  am

aware,  I have ascertained from the URSC  and  the

CCC  that  there  has been no complaint  from  him

whatsoever. Therefore, I believe there must  be  a

satisfactory alternative supply of water.  Anyway,

I  am  glad to note that the problem which he  has

brought  up  has made him realise  that  water  is

precious, and it is part of his duty to  see  that

he saves water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Jurong, let me say that

it  is  neither  the policy nor the  duty  of  the

Ministry  of  the Environment to remove  trade  or

industrial  refuse. Removal of trade or industrial

refuse  is part of the manufacturing process.  The

Government will try its best to remove refuse from

trade  premises and from houses daily. It is  only

when  there is an increase in absenteeism  of  the

workers,  usually during festivals  and  holidays,

when  a greater amount of refuse is discarded that

there is a pile-up of refuse. This is perhaps also

because  of the higher standard of living.  It  is

usual  to  find  that  there  is  an  increase  in

absenteeism



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>



during  public  holidays.  And  to  highlight  the

problem,  the  newspapers publish a picture  of  a

refuse heap just before it is removed. I think  we

are probably one of the few countries in the world

where refuse is being removed daily, and it is not

our  duty  to  remove industrial refuse  or  trade

waste.   If  the  Member  for  Jurong  said   that

manufacturers are willing to pay for its  removal,

I  am  sure  there  are many contractors  who  are

willing to remove their refuse for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the fire hazard arising from industrial

waste, it is largely because the factories have  a

very  irresponsible attitude: they pile  up  their

refuse  and  leave it there for quite  some  time.

That is where the hazard lies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reassure the Member for Jurong

and  the  House  again that the air in  Singapore,

including   Jurong,  is  quite   pure.   We   take

measurements regularly and when factories  violate

anti-pollution  requirements,  action   is   taken

against  them.  A  number of offenders  have  been

warned.  In fact, two of them have been prosecuted

under  the  Clean Air Act, because their  chimneys

have been emitting an excessive amount of smoke. A

few  others were also prosecuted for open  burning

of  trade waste, thus causing a nuisance. An  acid

works  has  also  been fined for  emitting  acidic

fumes which exceed the minimum allowed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is advisable for hon. Members to note

that  open burning of trade and industrial  refuse

is  now  prohibited under the Clean Air Act.  This

Act was gazetted on the 26th of January this year.

I  would like to assure the Member for Jurong that

the  Anti-Pollution Unit will continue to  closely

watch  emission  from the various  factories,  and

there will be no let up in their surveillance.  We

will not hesitate to bring the offending factories

to  court,  as most of them have been  given  more

than adequate time to comply with the requirements

of the Clean Air Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards pollution in the urban area from motor

vehicles, this is being closely watched. The Anti-Pollution



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>



Unit  is  working  closely with  the  Registry  of

Vehicles  on the measures to be taken  to  control

pollution from this source.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad also that the Member for Jurong has

invited  my inspectors to go to Jurong and  ticket

those  people  who have been throwing  refuse  all

over  the  place. I only hope that when  summonses

arc issued to these offenders, he will not come up

to me and ask for the summonses to be waived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

since  we  are ahead of guillotine time, I  wonder

whether you will permit mc to say a few words.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, I do not wish to participate

in this debate, but I just want to make a point of

clarification.  I  think the  Minister  had  side-tracked  his answer to the question of the  Member

for  Paya  Lebar. What the Member for  Paya  Lebar

asked  was  that  since  the  standpipe  has  been

removed,  the villagers were not able to  get  any

water.  So they asked the PUB to supply them  with

water. But the PUB said. "You do not have a number

to  your house, and therefore we cannot supply you

with  water." So under the circumstances  how  are

these  villagers  going to  get  their  supply  of

water?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to thank the Member for Bras Basah  for

his  support  and  assistance  in  clarifying   my

question  to the Minister. The question  I  raised

was  not  answered  at all. The Minister  has  not

answered  my point. My question is: is it possible

for water supply to he given to unnumbered houses?

In  other  words,  is the PUB prepared  to  supply

water  to  unnumbered houses? I am not complaining

against  the removal of stand pipes.  I  am  fully

behind  the  Minister in removing the  standpipes,

because  of  the  wastage  caused.  But  once  the

standpipes have been cut off, the PUB must give an

alternative water supply to the villagers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I wish to clarify is this. He

has said that the CCC and the Member of Parliament

for  the area have not complained to the Urban and

Rural  Services  Committee.  In  fact,  the   URSC

informed  us that these stand-pipes would  be  cut

off,  and  I was advised to tell the villagers  to

apply  for  an alternative water supply.  I  asked

them  to do so, but their applications were turned

down.  There was a stand-pipe at Lorong  Tai  Seng

market  meant for the hawkers to keep their places

clean.  We  brought  this up  with  the  URSC  and

requested  for  a  standpipe to  be  installed  at

Lorong  Tai  Seng, near the market. It was  turned

down.  We did take action on this. My question  is

not  so much about standpipes. My question is:  is

the  Minister  prepared to grant water  supply  to

those  people living in unnumbered houses? Yes  or

no? That is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me ask him a

question:  will he pay for the water  consumed  by

these  people?  Since they have no house  numbers,

where  can I send the bill to? That is the  reason

why   the   Water  Department  does  not   approve

applications from residents of unnumbered  houses,

because  we cannot send the bill to these  people.

That is the simple reason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards consultation with the URSC, I think we

have  had none of these problems from any  of  the

other  Members, and we do not disconnect the water

supply  unless the URSC and the CCC are  satisfied

that  there  is  an alternative  water  supply.  I

presume  when the CCC says so, it has the  benefit

of   the   advice  of  the  Member  of  Parliament

concerned,  and unless they say that there  is  an

alternative  supply,  or  there  is  available  an

alternative  supply, we do not cut off  the  water

supply. We know how difficult it is for people  to

be  without  water. Therefore, if the  Member  for

Paya Lebar has really looked into the problem,  he

would have raised the matter with the CCC and  the

URSC.  We  do  not  cut off water  supply  without

making sure there is an alternative supply.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

before  I withdraw my amendment, I would  like  to

tell   the  Minister  that  in  1972  I  made   an

application  for  a standpipe  to  be  erected  at

Lorong Tai Seng market, but this was turned  down.

The crux of the matter is still this. The Minister

says  that it is difficult to send the water bills

to  the  unnumbered houses. It is  a  very  simple

matter.  Even  though  there  are  no  houses   in

Singapore  we  may  have to build  thousands  upon

thousands of houses for the people. Assuming  that

there  are no numbers, we can still send the bills

to the houses. It is as simple as that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not number

the houses for people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the question

is  not whether you are responsible for giving the

house  numbers. You can give a special number  for

the  supply  of water and electricity.  Then  with

that  special number, you will be able to get  the

bills paid.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, this is the first time I

have  heard of a "water number". What is  a  water

number?  Who gives the water number? And with  the

water  number,  can  you find the  addresses?  The

answer is that, if you do not have numbers to  our

houses, you do not get water.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Ministry of the Environment is a new Ministry.

The  consumers' numbers are available. We can  ask

the URSC.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the answer is

a  very  simple one. If these attap house dwellers

at  the moment have no house numbers with which to

apply  to  the  PUB for water supplies,  then  the

simple  thing  for them to do is to  come  to  the

Ministry of National Development,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>

solve  the problem. If the Member has any  special

difficulties,  he  can write to  my  Ministry  for

attention.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to

thank  the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

concern  is  that when these people  who  live  in

unnumbered  houses write to the  department,  then

they   would   be   considered  as   dwellers   of

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1071.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the implementation of legislation for

the  control of pollution in Singapore, there  has

been  a remarkable improvement in the environment.

However, I wish to point out the dirty and  smelly

condition   of  the  rubbish  collection   centres

located   in   different  parts  of  the   island.

Obviously  certain  centres  do  not  have  enough

containers   for   the  collection   of   rubbish.

Consequently,  there  is  a  fantastic  amount  of

rubbish spilling on to the road resulting in dirty

and smelly roads. One clear example is the rubbish

collection  centre next to Kandang Kerbau  market.

Not only does the rubbish spill on to the road but

also  into the canal next to it. All efforts  will

be  wasted if the hawkers are careless or if there

are  insufficient bins at the collection  centres.

It  is very unhygienic for health and could result

in  the  breeding of flies. I hope the  department

concerned  would  look into it and  see  that  the

rubbish  is cleared at least twice a day, even  on

holidays  and  Sundays, especially in  the  hawker

areas and housing estates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, we try our best to clear all

the  refuse. But, as I said, during holidays there

is  usually an increase in absenteeism and also an

increase  in  rubbish because of the rise  in  the

standard of living. The Member for Anson suggested

that we remove the rubbish at least twice a day. 1

have  known  of  instances  where  we  remove  the

rubbish  five  times a day and the  rubbish  still

keep piling up. We are trying to solve the problem

by  mechanisation, and if the Member will help  us

recruit  workers,  probably the problem  could  be

more easily solved.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Minister for the

Environment has asked me to recruit workers.  What

does   he  mean  by  that?  He  is  a  responsible

Minister.  He  should recruit the workers.  If  he

cannot  get  the workers in Singapore,  he  should

import   them  from  other  countries   under   an

agreement.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Do you want to take a vote on that,

Mr P. Govindaswamy?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> No, Sir,I beg leave to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1182.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should feel proud that foreigners

visiting  our  country praise  Singapore  for  its

cleanliness. The cleanliness of our city  is  well

looked after. But, to my surprise, the rural areas

are  neglected. During my periodical  tour  of  my

constituency,  the  residents  approached  me  and

complained  that refuse in the kampungs  were  not

removed,  sonic-times for weeks. Sir, I think  the

other  Members  of  the rural constituencies  also

face the same problem. I appeal to the Minister to

immediately  look  into  this  matter  with  great

urgency and to pay more attention to the health of

the rural people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to bring to the attention

of  the  Minister  the  problem  of  inconsiderate

drivers  of  Public  Health vehicles  which  carry

refuse for dumping at Koh Sek Lim Road. They drive

at  a  pretty  fast speed along the narrow  roads,

thereby  spilling the refuse on to the roads  and,

at  the same time, this is quite dangerous to  the

children in the villages. I hope that the Minister

will   take   immediate  action  to   remedy   the

situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I presume the

Member  for  Changi  must be talking  about  rural

areas   which  are  inaccessible  either  to   the

vehicles of the Ministry or to hand-carts, because

normally  where  premises are  accessible  to  the

Ministry's  vehicles,  the  refuse  is   collected

direct. Where premises are not accessible  to  the

vehicles  of the Ministry, the refuse is collected

by  hand-carts. It is only in places where  it  is

inaccessible  either to lorries or  to  hand-carts

that we ask the residents to bring their refuse to

the  collection  centre. I have already  mentioned

just  now that there is a shortage of workers  and

to  remove refuse by hand is labour-intensive. The

problem  here is to find enough men  to  do  that.

However, as I said, we are mechanising, and I hope

that  with more mechanisation we can make-do  with

less manual labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the complaint about inconsiderate

driving  by  drivers  of the  Ministry's  vehicles

along  Koh Sek Lim Road, it is difficult  to  take

action.  We have asked our inspectors and  drivers

to  be considerate and to be careful in what  they

do.  But  if  the Member for Changi  can  give  me

specific   instances  of  inconsiderate   driving,

resulting  in  refuse spilling  on  to  the  road,

action will be taken.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, I will certainly give the

Minister  specific  instances.  In  view  of   the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, may I range over

my next amendment* on subhead 1441? (* The amendment reads as follows: (5)That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be reduced by 510 in respect of subhead 1441.)

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I have been noticing

that many drains have been found to be choked  and

the  flow of water is being obstructed, especially

with the underground and the monsoon drains. It is

therefore necessary to clear these drains as often

as  possible. Some of them are found to be awfully

smelly  and  filthy, for example, the drain  along

North  Bridge  Road  opposite the  former  Raffles

Institution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to know the progress of

the construction work at Rochore Canal, which will

provide a better drainage system. It looks  as  if

the  work has stopped. If so, why is the work left

uncompleted?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to voice out that there

are many places, especially at construction sites,

where stagnant pools of water are found, and these

become  grounds  for mosquito breeding.  This  may

affect  the health of our citizens, even  for  the

people living in the Housing Board flats. I wonder

what  is  the Department doing to get rid of  this

menace.  Although malaria is not a common  disease

in Singapore, it should nevertheless be completely

eradicated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in spite of the

"Anti-Litter Campaign", people still keep throwing

refuse  into the drains. As a result,  the  drains

are  choked, mosquitoes breed in them, giving rise

to  smells and all that. We are well aware of  the

problem,  especially with mosquitoes.  The  health

inspectors do go round to persuade contractors  to

take    preventive   measures   against   mosquito

breeding. We try to clean the drains as  often  as

possible. But here



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



we  must  seek the co-operation of the  public  in

trying  not to throw refuse or sullage water  into

the  drains so as to block the free flow of water.

We  are  carrying out regular oiling in all  these

places.  The  inspectors  do  go  round   to   the

contractors  and  warn  them  of  the  dangers  of

mosquito breeding. If they do not conform  and  do

not  take  preventive measures, they are  summoned

and fined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assure the Member for Anson, I would like to

clarify that mosquitoes commonly found breeding in

construction  sites  are of the  Aedes  and  Culex

species, and they are not vectors of malaria.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction work at Rochore Canal Road has

stopped   because  the  original  contractor   has

failed.  We have suspended him and we have  got  a

new  contractor. The work will resume as  soon  as

the new contractor can get to the work site.

hawking before 1968 should be reviewed, especially

in  the  case of Changi constituency. Hon. Members

of  this House will agree with me that Changi  was

hard  hit  economically by the British withdrawal.

Many of the former RAF employees, whether directly

or  indirectly  employed, were out of  employment.

Some  of  them were unable to get other  jobs  and

they  turned to hawking for their livelihood. This

took  place  two  or  three years  ago.  With  the

present policy of licensing hawkers, these  people

are  therefore  not qualified to  get  a  hawker's

licence.  I  would strongly urge the  Minister  to

reconsider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



the  present hawker's licensing policy  to  enable

many  of the present hawkers, who were doing  such

business for their livelihood for the last two  or

three years to get a licence.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

received   many  complaints  about   some   hawker

inspectors  not carrying out their  duties  justly

and  reasonably.  The complaints  were  that  they

issued summonses to some hawkers biasly. There was

an  instance when many hawkers were found to cause

obstruction to a passage way and yet only one  was

served   with  a  summons.  And  when  the  hawker

inspector  was  questioned  for  his  actions,  he

answered.  "That is not your duty." It shows  that

there is prejudice and injustice going on in  this

regard.  The  department  concerned  should   take

action to stop this state of affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder whether during festival days, rules

relating to obstruction of roads or public  places

could  be relaxed so that the poor hawkers can  do

their  business more freely in view  of  the  fact

that  business is brisk on such days. I  hope  the

department   concerned  would   be   lenient   and

sympathetic   towards  the  hawkers  during   such

periods.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, much as I

sympathise with the Member for Changi with  regard

to   the   plight   of   his   constituents,   the

department's  policy  of  not  giving  new  hawker

licences is a good one. Otherwise, the policy that

we  are carrying out now of resiting all bona fide

hawkers  would  go  awry. We are  already  finding

great  difficulty in resiting bona  fide  hawkers,

i.e, hawkers who were registered prior  to  1968.

If,  at  the  same  time, we are to  increase  the

number  of  new  hawkers,  then  it  would  be  an

impossible job to resite all of them. I doubt very

much whether new hawkers can be registered. It  is

not  our  policy  to  encourage  hawking  as  such

because  it  has brought about a lot of pollution.

As  it  is, we are already finding our hands  full

with controlling whatever pollution there is.

<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have looked into this problem and, as I have

said, the Ministry itself is short of workers.  In

this respect we have gone down to his area and  we

have   so  far  employed  50  of  those  who  were

retrenched  by  the British forces.  There  is  no

reason why some of these retrenched workers cannot

be  retrained because quite a large number of  new

industries  are being set up in Changi.  If  there

are  real cases of hardship, perhaps they  can  be

brought to my notice. We could employ these people

in  the  Ministry of the Environment  to  help  us

clear the rubbish and keep the place clean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson said that he has received

many  complaints  about discrimination  by  hawker

inspectors. The Ministry takes a very serious view

of   any   discriminatory  practices   by   hawker

inspectors. Largely, I think the complaint is  not

so  much  that  they  are  discriminating;  it  is

perhaps  because  they have done  their  job  very

well.   However,  if  there  are  real  cases   of

discrimination, they can be brought to  my  notice

with specific details and action will be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very much worried by his request for

relaxation  of  the rules during festive  seasons.

Once  you  relax, you allow people to do  as  they

like  - illegal hawkers will come in; hawkers will

obstruct traffic during festive seasons- and  this

will  become a habit and compound the problem.  As

it  is,  we are having great difficulty in keeping

these  people within the law, it is easy to  relax

rules,  but  very  hard  to  bring  them  back  to

observing  them again. Therefore, we  cannot  make

exceptions even on festival days.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> By "relax", I mean just

close an eye! That is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, if I should close an eye

and ask my inspector to close an eye, Members will

discriminating, "How is it that on

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Government has done all it can to look

after  the  welfare of our hawkers.  Hawkers  were

formerly  under  the control of  the  Ministry  of

Health,  but now that they come under the  control

of  the  Ministry  of  the Environment,  many  new

measures  have been introduced, for  example,  the

resiting  of  hawkers, and issuing of licences  to

hawkers to enable them to carry out their business

in  hawkers centres. These hawkers now ply only on

one side of the road, whereas previously they used

to  ply  on  both sides. This has helped  to  ease

traffic  congestion. We have  also  built  hawkers

centres, for example, near Newton Circus, 6th  m.s.

Bukit Timah. All these are very good measures  for

the benefit of the hawkers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current Estimates, there is a provision of

$5  million  for  development and  improvement  to

markets  and hawkers' sites. I would like  to  ask

the   Minister   two  questions  concerning   this

provision. Firstly, where will the new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



hawkers'  sites  be?  I  know  there  is  one   in

Sembawang;  so  I  am not going  to  ask  one  for

Sembawang,  but  for  other areas.  Yesterday  the

Minister  said  that other areas  will  be  looked

after  too.  So where will the new hawkers'  sites

be?  Secondly, what are the old markets  that  are

going to be developed and improved?



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampung Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, during the cholera epidemic 2 1/2 years ago, the area that was

affected by cholera was Kampung Kembangan and  its

neighbourhood.  According to a  statement  of  the

Ministry of Health at that time, the condition  of

the stalls was poor. The hawkers had to stop their

business  on  the  instructions  of  the  Ministry

concerned.  The  livelihood of these  hawkers  was

badly   affected.   Although   they   were   given

assistance  by  the Social Welfare Department,  it

was  only  given  as a token of  sympathy  by  the

Government. It was far from sufficient to meet the

needs  of their families. I urge the Minister  for

the Environment to take steps to provide a hawkers

centre in the Kampung Kembangan area so that  such

an epidemic would not happen again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> First, to answer the Member for

Sembawang. We are building three hawkers  centres:

at  Empress  Place, Telok Ayer  Market  and  North

Bridge  Road.  They are expected to  be  completed

this year. These are the old projects. Tenders for

hawkers centres at Jalan Besar and Beach Road  are

now  being  called. In addition, there  are  eight

more  projects in various parts of Singapore. They

will  be  implemented  this  year.  The  above  13

hawkers centres, plus one centre already built  at

Yung  Sheng  Road, Jurong, will accommodate  about

1,600  hawkers in all, and the estimated  cost  is

about $7.4 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Kampung Kembangan, may I

say that the building of a hawkers centre will not

stop any epidemic of enteric diseases. I think  it

is   more   the  practice  of  personal   hygiene.

Regardless of whether they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



accommodated  in a centre or hawking.  If  hawkers

were  to  practise personal hygiene, they are  not

likely  to  spread diseases, and  therefore  their

livelihood and the health of their customers  will

not  be endangered. It is unlikely that they  will

be  ordered  to  stop selling unless  there  is  a

danger  of their spreading diseases. For instance,

at  the last and biggest cholera epidemic outbreak

we  ever had, there was a total of 114 cases, with

three   deaths.  Twelve  carriers  were  detected.

Fortunately, we were able to control the outbreak.

Most of the victims ate from hawker stalls. Out of

641   food  samples  taken  from  hawkers  in  the

affected area, 357 samples, or more than  half  of

the  hawkers  were found to sell food contaminated

with  faecal coliform organisms. These  are  germs

found  in faeces of human beings. In other  words,

you  find  traces  of faeces in  the  food.  These

findings indicate that the food handlers  had  not

practised personal hygiene. Therefore, even if  we

move them into hawkers centres so long as they are

not  careful in their personal hygiene, there will

be an epidemic and they will have to stop selling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is going to be a major development in the

Kampung  Kembangan area. In common  with  all  the

other  areas  where development will  take  place,

there  will  be  plans  for  markets  and  hawkers

centres  in  Kampung Kembangan. So if  the  Member

will  bide  his  time,  he  will  have  all  these

developments in his constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   the   Minister  has  answered  my  question

satisfactorily, and I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 20.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, mechanisation of the Public Cleansing

Services  is given a provision half as  much  more

than  last  year's Estimates. I do not  know  what

type  of  equipment  will be necessary  for  these

services.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what I would like to bring to the notice of

the  Minister  is that the refuse, that  is  being

dumped  in  bins  for  daily  collection  by  this

Service, is not collected daily because the refuse

vehicles cannot enter into these areas. Hand-carts

cannot  go through these lorongs and lanes because

they  are  damaged, as for example, the roads  and

lanes   in  Kampung  Kembangan.  These  hand-carts

collect refuse from only five or six houses  where

the  refuse  is being thrown. These  workers  find

difficulty  in  pushing their  hand-carts  because

they  are so full of rubbish. Moreover, the  roads

are  not properly surfaced. Such places which  are

inaccessible to lorries and hand-carts  should  be

improved.  House  owners pay  for  such  cleansing

services  every  month,  whether  the  refuse   is

collected  or not. Therefore, 1 feel  that  people

who  send  their refuse to rubbish dumps elsewhere

should be exempted from paying for this service.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very

difficult to exempt payment of refuse fees to only

a section of the population. The only thing we can

do,  Sir, is to see that we have enough people  to

collect the refuse. There is a shortage of labour.

However, we are trying out a new way of collecting

waste by encouraging people whose premises are not

accessible either to hand-carts or trucks, to  put

their  refuse in paper bags, and dump the bags  at

the  refuse centre. They will probably  find  this

method of refuse disposal much easier. But it will

be  difficult to exempt a certain portion  of  the

population  from paying refuse fees.  Probably  in

the  course  of development within  the  next  few

months  or years, the area mentioned by  the  hon.

Member  may have a few roads or tracks  opened  so

that  the hand-carts can go in. We will look  into

this  matter, but it is impossible to exempt  them

from payment of fees.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, in view of

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 21.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think acquisition of land for refuse

disposal  should not be the only means  of  refuse

disposal. At the same time whilst I appreciate the

difficulty  involved and the time needed  for  the

refuse  incinerator  and compaction  plant  to  be

built,  the  conventional means of merely  dumping

trade  and household refuse at the refuse disposal

sites is both unhealthy and "anti-environment".  I

am  sure  the Members will agree with me on  this,

because   this  will  cause  air  pollution,   not

forgetting  the stench emanating from the  rubbish

heaps.   For   example,  I  have   received   many

complaints  from  my  constituents  regarding  the

stench  and  breeding  of flies  in  the  Tampines

refuse dumping ground. I wonder if steps are being

taken to eradicate this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of interest, Sir, the Housing and

Development  Board  is  at  the  present   moment,

building  flats at the Tampines Estate, just  next

to  the Tampines dumping ground. When these  flats

are  ready, and with the present Tampines  dumping

ground  still  in existence, and with  still  more

refuse being dumped there, I do not know just what

will  be the reaction of future residents of  this

Estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this vote, more land is being acquired

for this purpose. In this respect, I would like to

know  from  the  Minister  when  will  the  refuse

incinerator  and compaction plant  be  built,  and

where will they be sited? I hope it will not be in

Punggol again!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, refuse sites are

usually  located in tidal swamp lands. For obvious

reasons,  I  think  it  is  advisable  for  me  to

indicate the actual locations, as the Ministry  is

in  the  process of acquiring these lands. We  are

well  aware  that with the increase in  population

and  with our limited land space, we have to think

of  new  ways of disposing refuse. So the uses  of

incinerator and compaction plant are possible



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>



ways.  But  this is something which  you  are  not

likely  to go ahead with lightly because the  cost

of  the compaction plant and incinerator is in the

region  of $100 million! There is also the problem

of pollution: how big is the incinerator and where

is  it  going to be sited? What sort of compaction

plant will you have, and where will you locate it?

If  you  locate the plant at Tampines, the  Member

for  Punggol  will  again  complain  because,   in

addition to the smell, he will get the noise.  And

if  the incinerator is also there, he will get air

pollution  too. Therefore, this matter needs  very

careful  study  by  specialists.  Anyway,  we  arc

embarking on this study, and it will be some  time

before we come out with the appropriate method  or

methods  suitable for our use. I hope that answers

the question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has

not  answered  one  part  of  my  question,  i.e.,

whether  his Ministry will take steps to  minimise

the  pollution emanating from the Tampines dumping

ground.   I  have  said  that,  apart   from   air

pollution,  there is the question of  breeding  of

mosquitoes  and flies, which is so  acute  that  I

have  to  come to this House every year  to  raise

this  problem.  The hon. Minister for  Health  and

Hone Affairs can bear me out on this. I would like

the  Minister  for the Environment to  assure  the

House  that  he  will take steps to  minimise  air

pollution and fly-breeding in the Tampines dumping

ground. I know very well that we have to use  that

area  as  a dumping ground because it is a  swampy

area   and   affected   by   tidal   waves.    But

nevertheless, Sir, steps must still  be  taken  to

minimise  this inconvenience caused to the  people

living there as it is a danger to health.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, it is a very good sign that

people are complaining about smell. It means  they

are  becoming  aware  of  the  need  for  a  clean

environment, and are more voluble now.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if you live somewhere near a dumping

ground, the smell is just unavoidable. We can keep

it  to  the minimum. I believe the department  has

been  quite efficient, and they have been  keeping

the smell down to the lowest minimum possible.  If

you live next to a septic tank, then of course you

cannot  avoid smelling what is in it. But  we  are

doing everything possible technically, to keep the

pollution down to the barest minimum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the Member, we do spray

the dumping ground regularly with anti-malarial or

anti-mosquito oil, and insecticides. We do not let

the  refuse  rot to high heaven. We  try  to  keep

pollution down to the minimum. It is just too  bad

if  you  live  in  that area where  the  smell  is

unavoidable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> In fact, I was in that area

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this year's provision for the Siglap Canal

Improvement  project is six times more  than  last

year's. Although the provision has increased  from

year  to  year, the development of  the  canal  at

progressed  much.  Digging of sand  is  not  being

sand. During the rainy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>



season, sand is usually washed into the drains. As

time  goes  by, the condition of the drains  grows

from  bad to worse, and water cannot flow properly

because  of  the lack of attention given  to  this

canal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to request the Minister

concerned  to look into this problem so that  this

canal  could be properly maintained and  that  the

area is not polluted by this canal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, contrary to what the Member

for  Kampung Kembangan may think, the Siglap canal

is being maintained regularly. I agree there is  a

lot  of  sand.  This  is largely  because  of  the

development and earth-works going on in  the  area

there.  When there is heavy rain, sand gets washed

into the canal, and this problem is accentuated by

the  sand-bar  at  the  south-end  of  the  canal.

However, steps arc being taken to widen the  canal

and  to  bring  the peak fall beyond the  sand-bar

into  a  deeper part of the sea, so that the  sand

that goes through will not pile up on the sand-bar

and  thus  block the canal. The work is  in  hand.

That  is  the reason why $600,000 is required  for

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 42.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision allocated for Minor Drainage

Improvement is $450,000, as compared with $300,000

last  year.  With the extra provision of  $150,000

this  year, I hope the drains in most of the roads

in Kampung Kembangan can be repaired. For example,

the  drains  on  both sides of  Changi  Road  have

broken down and the same condition can be said for

the  drains along the roads made under section  19

of  the  Local  Government  Integration  Act.  The

drains are not properly made. As a result, water



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



cannot  flow properly, so much so that the  owners

of  land in the area had to pay for the repair  of

roads and drains in front of their houses. This is

because  the  drains are not properly  constructed

resulting in poor water drainage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has said just now

that  water  is  precious and that we  should  not

waste  water. But I know that a lot of drains  are

being  flushed  with potable water from  hydrants.

Why  cannot these drains be flushed with  effluent

water  transported by lorries? Is this not one  of

the  ways  to  waste water which  is,  of  course,

precious?



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Member  for Kampung Kembangan will recall  that  a

large number of drainage improvement projects have

been  completed in his constituency. For  example,

there  are  two main drainage outlets,  one  along

Jalan  Kembangan and the other along Jalan Wijaya,

not  to  mention  a number of subsidiary  drainage

projects which have been completed. As 1 have said

just  now in reply to certain questions raised  by

him under another subhead, there is going to be  a

major  development in his area, and  there  is  no

point  in spending money on improving drains  when

they will only be temporary. However, where it  is

found  that a minor improvement could improve  the

drainage, and where it is feasible to do so, money

will be spent on it. But where a major development

will  affect the drainage, then we will just do  a

little bit of repair work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to using potable water to flush the

drains, I would like to say that this practice has

been  stopped for almost a year. We have not  used

potable  water to flush drains, unless for  health

reasons we have to use potable water, for example,

in the markets and crowded hawker centres. Much as

we  like to use effluent water to flush drains, it

is  not safe to do so because it might contaminate

the food. At the moment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>



effluent  water  is not as clean or  as  pure  and

sterile as potable water. We are, however, working

on  a  system  of tertiary treatment  of  effluent

water. By further treatment, we hope to be able to

bring  it up to the standard of potable water.  By

then  we  could  probably use effluent  water  for

flushing. But at the moment to use effluent  water

for  flushing drains would endanger the health  of

our  citizens. In the process of flushing,  sprays

of  effluent water may drop on to the food or  may

spill on to passers-by. Therefore, though water is

precious,  the  health  of our  citizens  is  more

precious.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, the drains I referred to are the drains which

had  been  made in the developed areas, at  Lorong

Maideen,  Lorong  Melayu, etc. These  drains  were

made  under  section  19 of the  Local  Government

Integration  Act  with funds  collected  from  the

owners.  However,  these  drains,  for  which  the

owners have paid, have not been properly made and,

as  a  result, water does not flow properly.  Will

the  Minister  concerned consider improving  these

drains  without any extra cost, because  this  has

been fixed by the PWD?

it will be rectified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this subhead concerns the Serangoon Sewerage

Scheme. I have just one simple question to ask  of

the Minister: will this Serangoon Sewerage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>



Scheme   be   extended  to  the  Upper   Serangoon

constituency,    and   ultimately    to    Punggol

constituency? If so, when?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Punggol is going to be very disappointed.  At  the

moment  it is not likely that the sewerage  scheme

will  be  extended to the Punggol area. Under  our

sewerage  scheme, we are undertaking to sewer  the

whole of Singapore in as short a time as possible.

For  this, we require a lot of money. It is  quite

costly  to sewer, and we must get loans  from  the

International   Bank   for   Reconstruction    and

Development (IBRD). As Members know, when the IBRD

lends   money  for  any  project,   it   must   be

economically  feasible.  Comparatively   speaking,

Punggol has a lower density of population than the

other areas of Singapore. Therefore, to sewer  the

area  there is not economically feasible. I  think

Punggol  has  a very low priority in our  sewerage

scheme. But if something should happen, such as  a

major   development  in  Punggol,   perhaps   this

question can be reviewed. Moreover, Punggol is  in

a  very  low-lying area, and it will cost quite  a

lot of money to sewer such areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the last note

of  the  Minister concerned, I mentioned just  now

that  the Housing and Development Board is at  the

present moment building more than a thousand flats

in  that part of Punggol, along Tampines Road. And

next   to  this  Housing  and  Development   Board

project, there is a major scheme going on  because

an  area  of  not less than 60 acres have  already

been  acquired. I believe one-third of it is under

construction at the moment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> If that is so, there is hope for

him, but I cannot tell him definitely whether this

is in the Punggol area. I have not been there. But

where  the  Housing and Development  Board  has  a

housing project, there is sewerage.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, in that case, I must say

that  the Minister has been misinformed. That part

of  Tampines  Road definitely comes under  Punggol

area,  because I happen to live there,  and  I  am

also required under Acquisition order to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister may say that Punggol rates very low

in priority for a sewerage scheme. All I am asking

is: when will this sewerage scheme be extended  to

the  Upper Serangoon constituency, in which  there

is  a  great  deal of development  going  on,  and

whether  it  will  ultimately  extend  to  Punggol

constituency?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not good at

working out time-tables. But if he says that there

is  going to be development there, so be it. There

will be sewers. I hope that will satisfy him.  And

if  he  says  that  that part of  Tampines  is  in

Punggol, well, he lives there and he knows better.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> On that note, Sir, may I thank

the  Minister  for his patience. I  beg  leave  to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (01) of subhead 58.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, only a few residents of wooden

houses in Kampung Pachitan have been notified that

the  sewerage  scheme, now being  carried  out  in

Lengkong  Tiga, would be extended to their  homes.

These  are houses sited close to the main  sewers.

However,  many  other  residents  in  the  Kampung

Pachitan area have not been given such notices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know from the Minister whether

these  few  residents, who have been so  notified,

could be exempted from payment of sewer connection

fees.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true that

only  a  few of the residents in front of Lengkong

Tiga have been asked to install modern sanitation,

while quite a large number of the others have  not

been  asked to do so. This is because the sewerage

system only goes as far as the front of these  few

houses.  However, whether you install  it  now  or

later, it is ultimately a question of time. But as

far  as the installation is concerned, I will  not

press  the point. I would only say that if I  were

the owner or if I were the tenant, since there  is

the  opportunity for me to get a connection to the

sewage system, I may as well take advantage of it.

It will probably be cheaper to do it now than five

years later.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

if they were to install modern sanitation, it will

cost  them thousands of dollars. And later if  the

landowners  decide  to take back  the  land,  they

would suffer a loss.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead l001*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ho Kah Leong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, culture and art have a very important

influence on the life of a people. A country  must

have  flourishing cultural and artistic activities

to  enrich the spiritual life of the people. It is

only  then  that  the  people will  be  encouraged

spiritually  to take part in other endeavours  for

the interest of the country and the society.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the field of culture and artistic

activities,  there have been a number  of  foreign

cultural delegations performing in Singapore, such

as  the Russian and the North Korean dance troupes

and so on. They have achieved a very high standard

of  the  performing art. They provided our  people

with  an  eyeful of what cultural life is like  in

other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture has done its part in the

promotion and the development of culture and  art.

It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Ministry  of

Culture to develop the fine traditions of culture,

art,  music,  painting and other  literary  works.

Encouragement must be given in all these fields to

ensure   that  activities  of  this  nature   will

flourish  in  Singapore. At  the  same  time,  the

Ministry  of Culture should formulate  a  definite

policy  on culture for the development of  culture

in Singapore. For example, a publication bureau or

a   publishing  house  should  be  established  to

encourage   local  writers  to  have  their   work

published.  This is one of the concrete  forms  of

encouragement  for  local  writers  who   can   be

encouraged to write works of local content.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many causes for the low level of

publications  in Singapore. It includes,  firstly,

the  fact  that  publishers  are  not  willing  to

publish local works. Secondly, the writers are not

able  to write on a full-time basis even with  the

necessary encouragement. So if assistance  can  be

given in this field, I am sure the situation  will

improve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the field of music, the Ministry of

Culture  should also do more promotional work.  In

this  respect,  the  National  Theatre  under  the

Ministry  of  Culture should  set  up  a  National

Symphony  Orchestra. At the  moment,  there  is  a

Chinese  orchestra in the National  Theatre.  With

the  setting up of a National Symphony  Orchestra,

we  can  have  better performance at our  national

functions  or festival occasions. On  this  point,

when the Minister of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



Defence  opened  the  Seiwen  Japanese  Garden  at

Jurong, he made an appeal for the setting up of  a

National Symphony Orchestra. He said that this was

an  important and urgent matter, and I endorse his

view.  A  National Symphony Orchestra will  be  of

great  importance for Singapore in the inculcation

of  music consciousness among the people  and  the

attraction of tourists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture has done a great deal in

the  promotion of cultural activities such as  the

organisation  of Music for Everyone, concerts  and

other activities. But the performances are limited

and  the effect has not been so wide. I hope  that

the Ministry of Culture will give encouragement to

local   music   groups  or  give  them   financial

assistance for the purchase of musical instruments

and  for expenses incurred in rehearsals.  At  the

same  time,  the  Ministry  of  Culture  can  also

encourage  cultural  activities  in  the   various

schools by making arrangements for school children

to  perform at the National Theatre or  for  Radio

and  TV. In this way, the younger generation  will

be  given  the necessary encouragement to  form  a

successor to our cultural effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, radio and television command a large

audience.  And  the radio and TV  programmes  will

therefore  certainly have a great  impact  on  the

audience. If the programmes on TV and radio are of

an  educative nature, the people will get not only

entertainment hut also education at the same time,

if  the  programmes put up by Radio and Television

Singapore  are  nothing more than  decadent  music

about love and so on, and a lot of fuss which they

call  "comic sketches", then such programmes  will

be of no value to the audience. Instead, they will

have  a  bad  effect  on  the  young  audience  or

viewers. I am not denying the fact that there  are

good programmes broadcast by RTS. I am just making

a   fair  comment.  There  are,  of  course,  good

programmes such as Youth Festival, and the various

programmes  on  forums, reports and  reviews,  and

"What's  Happening in Singapore", and  a  host  of

others. But very few such programmes are broadcast

or televised.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



I  think  programmes  of  this  nature  should  be

increased  both  in scope and in  volume  so  that

those  farcical  programmes can be  reduced  to  a

minimum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometime ago in order to promote cultural

exchanges, the Ministry of Culture sent a cultural

delegation   to  Adelaide,  and  this   was   well

acclaimed  overseas. It is a  good  plan  to  send

cultural   troupes   overseas.   It   will    give

encouragement to our local artistes and will  also

promote  cultural understanding between countries.

I  would  like  to  ask the Minister  for  Culture

whether  there  are  any plans  to  send  cultural

delegations overseas this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture has conducted healthy and

sound  cultural  activities such  as  concerts  at

grass-root  level  in the rural  areas.  But  this

programme  was  stopped. I do not  know  for  what

reason. This kind of programme should be continued

and  promoted  and the contents of these  concerts

should  be enriched to bring culture to the people

and  to ensure that the broad masses of the people

can  also  enjoy cultural programmes. I  hope  the

Ministry  will  revive  the programme  of  holding

concerts in the rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

last  year when we debated this item, I  raised  a

matter  with  the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister  for  Culture,  in  the  absence  of  the

Minister who was then away. During that debate,  I

made  the proposal for an open air art gallery  at

the  Queen  Elizabeth Walk for  local  artists  to

display   their  work  and  to  provide   portrait

painting    for   tourists.   This   could    give

encouragement to local artists and could turn  the

place into a tourist attraction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also made the proposal that some form of

sculpture  work  should be on display  at  traffic

islands. We could invite local sculptors to put up

their  work  on  some  outstanding  or  convenient

places,  like traffic islands. At that  time,  the

Parliamentary Secretary promised to look into  the

matter and give me an answer. And I am raising the

matter  again  because I am still waiting  for  an

answer.

* Amendment (9), standing in the names of Messrs Teong  Eng Siong, P. Govindaswamy and Ng Kah Ting, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1751.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Sembawang    has   mentioned   about    television

programmes  and I would like to link  it  up  with

cinema  shows.  In recent years,  too  many  films

portraying  violence, vengeance, gangsterism,  and

drug-taking, which are dominant issues of the day,

have  been  shown in our cinemas. These  films,  I

would  like to believe, have caused and will cause

considerable harm to our society, a major  section

of  which consists of people below the age of  21.

Moreover,  in  the  last  few  years,   the   film

distributors  have been importing  and  exhibiting

such films which have drawn full houses. Alas, sad

to  say, there has been a marked increase  in  the

number  of  cases  of juvenile delinquency,  armed

robbery  and  drug-taking.  This  issue  has  been

discussed  very widely. There has been  a  lot  of

allegations as to who is responsible.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that before there is any damage beyond

repair, so to speak, can the Minister indicate  to

this  House as to whether his Ministry  will  take

steps to ensure that the public exhibition of such

films will be cut down. But I must point out  that

mere censoring of certain parts of such films will

not  serve  any purpose at all as the  main  theme

will   remain,   thereby  allowing   the   obvious

impressions to take effect. One has only  to  look

up  the  newspapers any day to  notice  that  such

films are being shown in many of the cinemas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to suggest to the Minister

for  Culture  to  introduce the classification  of

films, and that film



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>



distributors  be  asked  to  exhibit  films  of  a

classical   content,   as   for   example,   those

portraying  historical  events,  and   not   films

depicting violence and vengeance.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Sir, I thank you for

the  opportunity you give me to say a  few  things

about the Government's cultural policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Culture may be related to the group aspirations

of  a  people and the embodiment of their  values,

their  hopes and their strivings; in other  words,

their   way  of  life.  Where  our  own   cultural

development  is concerned, thought  and  extensive

thought   should  be  given  to  some   integrated

progress of our way of life. In other words,  some

sort of a general policy must be thought out about

our  total development. Emphasis has been laid  on

our   material   development  -  on   hard   work,

determination to succeed, achievement-orientation;

and  all this is certainly a manifestation of  our

collective aspirations. But there is also  another

side to our life - the spiritual, the ethical  and

the  specifically cultural. What quality is there,

with  regard  to this aspect of development?  What

sort  of  encouragement are we giving to  cultural

development? What realistic sums of money  are  we

voting  for this? What administrative devices  are

we   working   out  to  encourage  this   cultural

development?  The  Member for Sembawang  has  made

some  practical suggestions. I am merely  speaking

in   terms  of  general  responses,  because  this

question   of  support  for  culture   should   be

essentially Government's responsibility. We cannot

leave the question of cultural development to some

voluntary  organisations to which  we  vote  token

sums.  Government has to bear the  main  brunt  of

working out a policy and supporting such a policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard frequently of an emphasis on

quality   of  life.  In  what  does  this  quality

consist?  Does  it  mean a better  car,  a  bigger

swimming pool,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>



or   more   fashionable  clothes?  I  think   much

encouragement should be given to a debate on  this

topic.  Development  does  not  consist  only   of

material  development. It  is  when  we  recognise

common spiritual and cultural forms, and when such

forms  become familiar to all, then only will  our

society  become  cohesive. It is because  of  this

social  cohesion that we may succeed in  resisting

the   debilitating  effects  resulting  from   our

exposure to industrialisation and modernisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are under some sort of onslaught of the

trivial from the West. We are undergoing a sort of

material  siege, a striving after material  things

as  we can see representing a marked phenomenon in

our   environment.  This  striving  is   divisive,

because  each  thinks of himself,  each  tries  to

elbow  the  other  out of the  way.  Any  cultural

policy  should  aim  at the participation  of  the

greatest number of people, deriving enjoyment  out

of cultural expression, even if it is sport, which

is  one aspect of culture. Culture is not elitist.

If enjoyment of what is quality in our environment

is  confined  only  to  a  few,  this  is  elitist

culture.  For  this reason, I shall mention  later

when we talk on Broadcasting, how important it  is

for  the  mass  media to help in  stimulating  and

disseminating mass appreciation of culture.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the debate on Culture is  bound  to

get   very   abstract  -  words  like   spiritual,

integrated    progress,   achievement-orientation,

achievement  manifestation, quality of  life  will

crop  up  and  people can take sides in  different

ways.  In  order  not to get into difficulties,  I

propose to get down to something realistic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture will continue to promote

good  and  healthy  culture  for  all  races,   as

suggested  by  Members. I  myself  feel  that  the

cultural activity of a people in a country  cannot

alone be protected, promoted or initiated by  just

one single Ministry. It requires the effort of the

whole nation. People from every walk of life  will

have to contribute



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>



towards  building  a cultural  heritage  for'  the

people.  Because our nation is a new  one,  it  is

very  necessary for us to drive this  point  home:

that  not just one Ministry, or any one particular

official,  should be held responsible, and  if  we

fail  to  provide a good and progressive  culture,

then the whole society will have to be blamed  for

its shortsightedness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reply now to the points raised by Members. The

first  point  is  that raised by  the  Member  for

Sembawang   about   setting  up   a   publications

department to help local writers, and to give them

encouragement.  I would say that this  is  a  very

good suggestion, and we will, of course, look into

the  matter. I myself feel that we need  a  market

for these writers. It is no use producing books if

you  can  only  sell  a few thousand  copies.  The

writer would not be able to make a living just  by

writing  books. Therefore, we really have to  look

for  a market for these writers if they are to  be

protected.  For a population of two million  which

is  made up of different language streams, I think

it  may be difficult for local writers to go ahead

if they are to make a living purely by writing. In

any  case  we will give them all the help  that  a

writer requires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the symphony orchestra, it is a good

suggestion  but it may not be realistic  to  start

one   straightaway  because,  according   to   our

estimation,  if  we  were to have  a  full-fledged

symphony orchestra we would have to import  a  lot

of  good musicians in order to get it started, and

we  would  have to pay them very well in order  to

get  the  good  ones  to come.  According  to  our

estimation,  it may cost us in the  region  of  $2

million   a  year  to  maintain  such  a  symphony

orchestra.  We  are  going to do  something  about

this, but it will not be on a grand scale as  yet.

We  are  going to have a Chamber Ensemble, i.e, a

small   group  of  musicians,  to  get   something

started. We hope that this will provide some  kind

of good music in the course of the next few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the main point here is to create an

audience. It is no use having a symphony orchestra

or a Chamber



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



Ensemble  if  you  do not have  an  audience.  The

audience will have to be trained from a very young

age,  and  that is why the Ministry of Culture  is

conducting    Sunday    concerts,    and    giving

concessional  rates to students to encourage  them

to come to these concerts. We hope that by getting

them  accustomed to good music, we may be able  to

build up a good following.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also complains that not

enough  of this sort of concerts arc conducted.  I

think that is true. If we were to have our way, we

will  have  it  once every week.  At  the  present

moment,  we  are having it once a  month.  We  are

trying  to increase the frequency of these  Sunday

concerts, within our budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the suggestion that we should give away

free musical instruments to musical organisations,

I  think it would be the surest way to spoil them.

I  would  be happy to see them stand on their  own

feet, and survive on their own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also some criticism regarding TV and

radio  programmes. As has been raised in the past,

there  are a lot of sword fighting and love  story

programmes.  The Member must not mix  up  cultural

items  with  entertaining  items.  There  must  be

something interesting in our programmes. We cannot

have cultural items all the time over TV or radio.

It  is not possible, because if you do that,  then

nobody would want to tune in to your radio  or  TV

programmes. We have got to maintain some  kind  of

balance.  The  programmes  should  not   only   be

entertaining, but also educative and  informative.

It   is  the  function  of  Radio  and  Television

Singapore to provide such programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for sending cultural troupe delegations

overseas,   I   personally  think  that   cultural

activities should begin at home. We have got  very

little  resources  at home,  and  it  may  be  too

ambitious  if  our  cultural troupes  were  to  go

overseas



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



and  perform  on a grand scale. But right  now  we

have plans to send a troupe to the USSR if we  are

able  to  find the money. I agree with the  Member

that   sending  cultural  troupes  overseas  would

promote  the good image of Singapore. However,  we

have to do this within our resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not stopped the cultural shows in the

rural areas. True, the Ministry of Culture has not

conducted these shows for the past few years.  But

it  does not mean that cultural shows will not  be

staged in the rural areas. This function has  been

taken  over  by  the  People's  Association,   and

occasionally  they do send their cultural  troupes

to perform at various places in Singapore. That is

all  I  have  to  say in reply to the  Member  for

Sembawang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has suggested that we

should  have  an  open-air place  for  artists  to

exhibit  their works. This was, tried  out  a  few

years  ago  and  it was not successful.  The  main

reason  is  that  the  weather  in  Singapore   is

unpredictable. Sometimes it may he hot one moment,

and  then  suddenly there is heavy rain.  If  this

occurs, the paintings will be spoiled. The artists

themselves experienced difficulty in finding  such

a  place to exhibit their paintings because of the

unpredictability of our weather. Another reason is

that  this sort of exhibition does not really help

the  artists  very much. Established artists  will

not  send their paintings for display in  an  open

air  exhibition.  They  do not  even  have  enough

paintings  for  display  in  galleries  or   hotel

lobbies,  let  alone have some to spare  for  this

open air exhibition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the young up-and-coming artists, I do not

think  they lack any opportunity or facilities  to

display  their works. The Ministry of Culture  has

been   holding   Art   for  Everyone   series   of

exhibitions in community centres at the  frequency

of  once a month. Any good artist can always apply

to  the  Ministry of Culture for his works  to  be

included  in one of these exhibitions. Apart  from

that,  the  Ministry  of  Culture  also  regularly

organises art exhibitions on a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>



national  scale  in  the Victoria  Memorial  Hall.

Therefore, this suggestion of an open air  gallery

may not be a feasible one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards sculptures on traffic islands, I do

not  know  what is the opinion of the  other  hon.

Members. I myself feel it may contribute  to  more

traffic accidents. Our traffic islands are not big

and  for a sculpture to be visible, it has got  to

be   sufficiently  big.  And  if  they  are   huge

sculptures   or   monuments,  they   may   attract

unnecessary  attention or obstruct the  visibility

of  motorists,  and thus cause traffic  accidents.

The  answer  perhaps is to have them displayed  in

front   of   buildings,  plazas,  squares,   hotel

lobbies,  or other places. But it is not practical

to have one in every traffic island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has asked that films

should be classified. I have given my reply to the

Member for Katong in this House, the last time  we

were  talking about film classification.  At  that

time,  we found we could not get any advantage  in

film  classification. This  is  because  we  would

"kill off" good films, as people will then go  for

"X"  films.  Then there will not be any  patronage

for  the  other films which are not given  an  "X"

classification. This may do more harm than good to

the film industry in the long run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have had some discussions with the film

distributors,  and they are quite happy  with  the

present  system  of censorship.  Of  course,  they

would  want  to  have  more  sex  films  or   more

gangsterism  in their films. But we  cannot  allow

them to do what they want. I share the concern  of

the  Member  for  Punggol that  films  may  induce

gangsterism, terrorism, and so on. That is why  we

have got to strike some sort of balance. There  is

also the difficulty of laying down exact rules  as

to  what  to show and what not to show in a  film.

The  censor may say that there should not  be  any

sword-fighting scenes in a film. The producer will

respond   by  producing  films  portraying   fist-fighting.  And when you say that there should  not

be any more fist-fighting films, they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>



will  come  out  with  something  else.  The  film

distributors'  main concern is to sell  the  film.

Therefore,  they  will go for anything  that  will

create sensation. This is the primary problem.  It

is  like playing cat and mouse. That is the job of

the  film censor. Singapore alone may not be  able

to  stop  this kind of exploitation,  because  the

market  here is too small and it is not worthwhile

for  any film producer to produce a film just  for

our market. They are producing films for the whole

of  Southeast Asia, or the world market. So unless

the  various  governments in Southeast  Asia  make

concerted efforts against such films, we will  not

be able to do anything. Fortunately for us, we are

getting   some   results  in  this  respect.   For

instance,  when  we first said that  we  were  not

going  to  have  any more violent  scenes  in  our

films, the film producers just ignored us and kept

on  producing such films. But when Taiwan and Hong

Kong  also  took  the same steps,  they  began  to

realise  that  they have got to conform  with  the

censorship    requirements   of   the    countries

concerned.  So  this is really a  matter  for  the

various countries concerned. For our part, we  are

trying our best to keep this under control.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I make a

point  of clarification? The Minister for  Culture

has  just  mentioned that films are being produced

for  the  countries in Southeast  Asia,  and  that

unless  the  governments  in  Southeast  Asia  are

concerned with the extent of violence portrayed in

such  films,  and  get  together  to  work  out  a

solution,   there  is  nothing   much   that   our

Government can do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest, Sir, that since ASEAN has been

dealing  with  all  sorts  of  projects,  such  as

tourism, would it not be good for its members  and

for  us if ASEAN could set up a steering committee

on  film  censorship with a view to  cutting  down

violence?  In  this way, producing countries  will

realise there is no market for such films and they

will thereby reduce acts of violence and terrorism

in their films?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, the suggestion, of

course,  is  a very good one. It is worth  trying,

but  I doubt very much if we can get all the ASEAN

countries  to  bring their minds to bear  on  this

matter. They have got much bigger and more serious

problems to deal with at the present moment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> No, Sir. Whilst ASEAN may have

other  more urgent and important problems to  deal

with,  I think this is just as important a problem

for ASEAN. Whilst the Minister is very pessimistic

over  this issue, I would like to suggest that  he

brings  it up, and if ASEAN members are agreeable,

something  may  come  Out  of  it.  We  should  be

optimistic, and should not be pessimistic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I did not say I am

pessimistic.  I  am  never pessimistic.  I  am  as

optimistic  as he is. But the thing is whether  we

can  get  all  the ASEAN countries to bring  their

minds  together to bear on this problem.  We  will

try,  of  course. We never say die. But  the  main

thing   is  that  different  countries  have   got

different   policies  in  the   matter   of   film

censorship.  Not only have we got to persuade  the

policymakers that they have to follow  our  steps,

but  also  have to persuade the film  industry  in

their  respective countries to  do  the  same.  Of

course, this work is not simple. I agree with  the

Member  for Punggol that we should try to  do  it,

but there is no promise of any success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that the Government is looking after

the  health of our people. It has therefore banned

all  forms  of  cigarette  advertisement.  It  has

organised an anti-smoking campaign over the TV and

radio.  Logically, as a result of  this  campaign,

people should have stopped smoking. However, I see

at  page  6  of  the Memorandum on  the  Main  and

Development Estimates that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Despite the campaign to discourage cigarette

smoking, there   are   indications   that    the

consumption  of local and imported cigarettes  may

increase marginally.'



<br><br>So  I  have  my  doubts whether  our  anti-smoking

campaign  has been intensive enough. I  wonder  if

the   Ministry  of  Culture  will  intensify   the

campaign  by displaying anti-smoking slogans  over

pedestrian bridges.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is an

Anti-Smoking  Advertisement Unit in  my  Ministry.

However, the function of this Unit is to  keep  an

eye  on  the  mass  media  so  that  no  cigarette

advertisements are being publicised.  Actually  it

has  very  little  to  do  with  the  anti-smoking

campaign.   But  nevertheless,  the   Broadcasting

Department  has  carried out  a  campaign  against

smoking,   just  as  it  has  carried  out   other

campaigns like the anti-pollution campaign,  "Save

Water" campaign, and so on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not be blamed for the failure to

convert smokers into non-smokers. The campaign  is

actually  directed  at  the  whole  population.  I

personally  feel  that  no  matter  what  sort  of

campaign  is conducted, and on how grand  a  scale

the  campaign is no smoker can be converted. If  a

person  is  a  smoker, I think he  will  remain  a

smoker. I can say that there are a few Members  in

this  House who are smokers and no matter how  you

prevail  upon them not to smoke, they  will  never

give  up smoking. I think Members will agree  with

me  that at the very least the campaign over radio

and  TV  will  achieve some effect on our  younger

generation because, being potential smokers,  they

can  be  drawn  into  the  smoking  habit  by  the

advertisements put up by cigarette companies,  and

in  this  respect  the anti-smoking  campaign  can

prevent that. I can quote several instances  where

some fathers said that they had been told by their

children  not  to  smoke lest  they  die  if  they

continued  smoking.  This is  the  effect  of  the

campaign:  we have put our message across  to  the

younger generation. If this kind of campaign  goes

on,  we  would  be  able  to  create  a  kind   of

resistance  against  cigarette  smoking   in   the

subconscious mind of the younger generation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for anti-smoking banners on overhead bridges

and so on, I think we may be overdoing it if we do

this  because, as I have said, it is not  possible

to  convert the smokers into non-smokers. They are

already a "gone" case.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

does  the  Minister mean to say that  the  present

anti-smoking  campaign is adequately  carried  out

and,  therefore, he does not intend to do anything

else?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, may I speak in Mandarin?

Perhaps I can explain more clearly in Mandarin.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,I am not

saying that what we have done is sufficient.  What

I  am  saying is that for those confirmed smokers,

whatever  campaign is carried out, they cannot  be

persuaded  to change their habits, or to  give  up

smoking.  What  is important is that  the  younger

generation  should  not  be  influenced  by  these

advertisements to take up smoking. I think that  a

campaign  of  this sort is really to  prevent  the

younger  generation  from  forming  the  habit  of

smoking.  It  should  not  be  something  to  stop

confirmed  smokers from the habit. The  programmes

on   our  television  and  over  radio  are  quite

sufficient.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may  I  make a suggestion in connection  with  the

point  raised by the Member for Jurong? The Member

wanted  an  intensification  of  the  anti-smoking

campaign.  Bearing  all  the  facts  in  mind,  no

sensible person would doubt that cigarette smoking

is  bad.  But we are not discussing the merits  or

demerits of smoking in this Chamber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have accepted the fact that the anti-smoking

campaign  must go on. The question is how  can  we

further  produce  concrete  results.  I  was  just

thinking  that  instead  of  putting  up  slogans,

signboards  or  banners across  overhead  bridges,

perhaps  we can follow the examples set by certain

western  countries, on every cigarette packet  you

put a label in clear language, saying "Smoking  is

bad  for your health. You are smoking at your  own

risk."  Or  there can be some other slogans  which

the Minister for Culture might think of.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

dispute  the fact that we should have  this  anti-smoking  campaign. What I am saying is  that  this

campaign  should not be carried to the  extent  of

having  banners on overhead bridges and so on.  As

for  putting labels on cigarette packets, that  is

another  matter.  I  think the smokers  themselves

know what they are in for. And if, in spite of all

these anti-smoking campaigns, they still carry  on

smoking, then it is their own lookout.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, recently it

was  announced that newspapers might  have  to  go

public, after legislation to that effect has  been

enacted. That is well and good. However,  can  the

Minister  tell  us how will it he possible  for  a

newspaper  with  a  small  circulation,  or  whose

readership does not exceed a few thousand,  to  go

public? I am afraid that such a newspaper  with  a

poor  circulation may have to mid up if it has  to

go public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Culture should screen its

films  more  often  in the various  parts  of  the

island. We have several campaigns going on in  the

island, and yet some people in the rural areas are

completely  neglected as far  as  publicising  the

campaigns is concerned. Many of the rural folks do

not  possess a radio or television. May I  suggest

that the Ministry of Culture vans frequently visit

the  rural areas to publicise the campaigns. There

should be film shows telling them what is going on

in  Singapore.  We should also make it  compulsory

for  all  theatres to show the Ministry of Culture

films  before the main show begins.  Many  of  our

citizens  are surprisingly not aware  of  what  is

happening in our island. The television is a  good

medium of information. But the cinema as an avenue

of publicity is being completely neglected.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the theatres I find that the national anthem

is not being played at the end of the last show. I

do  not  know  why this practice is  stopped.  The

national anthem should be played at the end of the

last  show,  because the people of Singapore  must

respect their national anthem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other matter I wish to raise is this.

Under  the  urban renewal project, I  believe  the

Ministry  of  Social Affairs will  be  resited  at

Pearl's  Hill.  May  I know whether  the  Victoria

Memorial  Hall  will  also  be  affected  by   the

resiting?



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wonder whether the State crest could

be  erected  at  the clock tower of  the  Victoria

Memorial  Hall, which appears to be  bare  at  the

moment.  I know that I had brought up this subject

last year to which the Parliamentary Secretary  to

the  Minister for Culture suggested referring  the

matter  to the proper authority. I believe because

of that reason nothing has been done so far. Can I

suggest to the Minister to liaise with the  proper

authority  and reconsider the matter'? Since  this

building  is in the heart of the city and  also  a

tourist  attraction, something  must  be  done  to

better its appearance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Anson  has raised matters under  the  various

subheads.  He has mentioned the Victoria  Memorial

Hall, the clock tower and many other matters.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, only two matters were

brought  up:  publicity and the Victoria  Memorial

Hall.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, in the Government

statement   on  the  detention  of  the   Managing

Director of Nanyang Siang Pau, it was stated  that

the  Government  was  considering  legislation  to

require  all  major  Singapore  newspapers  to  go

public, so that no single person or family  should

be in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>



control  of  a  newspaper. The Government  is  now

considering an amendment to the Printing Press Act

to  provide for all major Singapore newspapers  to

go  public. Therefore, the proposed amendment will

apply  not  only to Nanyang Siang Pau but  to  all

major  Singapore  newspapers. Here  the  operative

word is "major". That means, it must be a very big

newspaper.  If  a newspaper has a  circulation  of

only  a  few thousand, then there is no  point  in

asking that newspaper to go public, because it  is

not  possible to get people to buy its shares. For

newspapers with a small circulation, I think, this

amendment may not apply to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards screening films in various parts of

the  island, the Ministry of Culture  did  have  a

film unit in the past, which screened films in the

rural areas. But with the advent of television, we

found  that  the unit has become obsolete  because

people  can see more up-to-date films  on  TV.  It

would  also be a waste of public money to continue

with  these  film shows, since the people  in  the

rural areas can watch films on their TV sets.  For

those who do not have TV sets or radios, they  can

always go to the rural community centres to  watch

TV  shows. We feel that we may be duplicating  the

work  of television if the film unit was asked  to

go round to show films in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if the national anthem is still

played  in  the theatres. I have not been  to  the

cinema for a long time, and I do not know what  is

happening there. If they do not play the  national

anthem,  I  think it is to avoid the embarrassment

of  disrespect to the national anthem  when  after

the  show the cinemagoers scramble for the  doors.

That may be one reason why the cinemas do not play

the national anthem at the end of the show.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also suggested that the

clock  tower of the Victoria Memorial Hall  should

have  a  crest on it. I think he is quite  serious

about  it because this is the second time  he  has

raised it; the first time was last year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



This  is  a matter of opinion. I myself feel  that

the  clock tower is already a very famous landmark

of  Singapore and we need not have anything on it.

As  it is, I like the beauty or the simplicity  of

the  clock tower. If we put a crest on it  we  may

spoil  its  beauty and we may have to  spend  some

money  maintaining it by giving it a coat of paint

regularly. In any case, there is already  a  crest

at the front entrance to the Victoria Theatre, and

there is also another one at the front entrance to

the  Victoria  Memorial Hall. Therefore,  we  have

enough crests in the building, and I do not  think

it is necessary to have one big crest on the clock

tower.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the urban renewal project, I have no

knowledge that the Victoria Memorial Hall would be

pulled down or would be resited. I think it is now

the subject of discussion by the National Monument

Board.   Once  it  is  designated  as  a  national

monument,  it will not be touched. At the  present

moment, I have no further information about this.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

objecting to what the Minister has said about  the

clock tower. He can see for himself whether it  is

attractive  or not. Previously, the British  crown

was  at the top of the clock tower. Now, there  is

nothing  there. Therefore, we should put  a  crest

which  will  be a tourist attraction. This  is  my

proposal, and I hope the Minister can see some way

to do it before next year's Budget sitting.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, in order to save the

Member  the  trouble of bringing it up again  next

year, I think he should stop here because I do not

think there is any necessity to put up a crest  on

the  clock tower. The appearance is good as it is,

and we should not spend any more money on it.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, in view of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1301*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here I would like to refer to the question

of the educational potential of broadcasting. I do

not  feel  that  this  potential  is  being  fully

exploited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, management of the mass media is an extremely

grave   responsibility.  Yet  despite   what   the

Minister has already remarked on, I feel that  the

policy  is not too clear. What is it that we  want

to  put  on TV and over radio? Is it only what  we

feel  is  popular? Is there any attempt to educate

in  order to raise the standard of taste among our

people, the standard of cultural appreciation?  Or

do   we   simply  respond  to  the  lowest  common

denominator of demand? There does not seem  to  be

any  attempt  at  a feed-back, no audience  rating

that  I  know  of,  no significant  research  into

audience responses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think more could be done to make people more

conscious  of  one  another's  forms  of  cultural

expression.  This  is simply  an  example  of  the

possible  educational uses to which we  could  put

our  normal television channels. For example, when

we  put  up  a programme consisting of  a  Chinese

cultural item, why not explain what we present? If

there  is  a  Chinese  orchestra  rendering   some

selection, why not explain the particular features

of the instruments of the orchestra, and how these

instruments  are combined to give effect?  Perhaps

some  further explanation of the finer aspects  of

Chinese  music could be conveyed to a  non-Chinese

audience. Again, if there is the presentation of a

Chinese  opera, what sort of story does it attempt

to  tell? What is the significance of the costumes

and  of make-up? What we nowadays see is merely  a

straightforward presentation, with no  attempt  at

explanation. We can do the same with the  cultural

forms  from  some other streams.  Take  an  Indian

dance,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



for  example. We can show the meaning of gestures,

of movements of arms, legs, head and eyes. In this

way,  we can give a cultural experience to  people

who  watch television or correspondingly to  those

who  listen to the radio. Otherwise, we  have  the

Chinese enjoying Chinese culture, Indians enjoying

Indian culture, and there does not seem to be  any

kind  of cross-fertilisation or cross-explanation,

and  no  attempt to bridge the cultural gap  which

continues to exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other educational purposes, why can we not

have  interesting courses for the worker  and  his

family?  Courses which may be related to  culture,

but   which   may   be  related   to   the   other

preoccupations as well. There are many cases which

have  shown  that  people  in  Singapore  do   not

adequately  know their own cultural background.  A

course  on historical monuments, landmarks, sites,

the interesting stories behind these objects, even

religious  edifices and other features, all  these

would  go to make an interesting programme, giving

people  a sense of belonging to their environment,

a   Singapore   identity,  a   sense   of   common

relationship, one with another, because of  common

recognition  of common features. It  would  appear

that  tourists  seem to know more about  Singapore

than Singaporeans themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to another matter -, the question of

the  quality  of  technique possessed  by  our  TV

personnel.  Just  watch,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,   for

example, how a TV interview is conducted. The  way

questions  are  asked could only be  described  as

gauche,  to  say the least. At one  time,  if  not

recently,  there  was  a lot of  camera  gimmickry

going on even in serious programmes, like zooming,

panning,  super-imposition.  Even  when  it  is  a

ballet,  an  Indian dance or an orchestra,  it  is

quite a giddying experience to watch the tricks of

the  cameramen. Sir, all this indicates that there

is   a   necessity  for  an  improvement  of   our

telecasting expertise. I hope that steps  will  be

taken in this direction.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  know why Tamil radio programmes close down  at 9.00  p.m.,

whereas the other language programmes

continue  till midnight. I am raising this  matter

in  the  House because I have received  complaints

from  the public to this effect. Therefore, I have

to  bring  this  matter  up  here.  Can  the  same

privilege  be  extended  to  the  Tamil  programme

listeners?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also noticed that Tamil news-readers have

all  along been pronouncing the word "million"  in

English. Is there no such a word in Tamil?  Or  is

it  because  the reader does not know  the  actual

word  in Tamil? In Tamil, "million" is called  oru

latcham.  "Ten  million" is oru  kodi.  It  is  so

simple. I have to bring this matter up although it

may  be  trivial, because there has been criticism

by some Tamil speaking groups on the word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the last two Budget sittings, I had

brought up the question of Tamil films being shown

on   TV  rather  too  late  in  the  evening.  The

Parliamentary Secretary last year had promised  to

consider  the matter, yet so far nothing has  been

done.  Can  the  Minister concerned  do  something

positive  to screen the films at an earlier  hour?

At  present, the film is scheduled at 9.25 p.m. or 9.30  p.m.

For God's sake, stick to the scheduled

time! Do not extend it to 9.40 p.m., or 10.00 p.m.

At  9.20 p.m. or 9.25 p.m. is fair enough, because

sometime  they have to change the time.  When  you

see  in  the newspaper that the scheduled time  is 9.40  p.m.,

they will only telecast it  at  10.10 p.m.

Therefore, I think they should strictly keep

to the scheduled time, at 9.25 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Sir, in respect of Tamil programmes, I

observe  that very often most of them are repeated

and  only  a  few  artistes appear  in  all  these

programmes.  Can the Tamil section  programmes  be

improved  with  more new items and  more  artistes

participating?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to know the progress our

country is making in respect of colour TV.  May  I

know  when  will this be introduced? Everybody  is

expecting  to buy a colour TV. If the Ministry  is

not  introducing colour TV, then  they  would  not

want  to  buy, and moreover we would not get  more

revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What my colleague, the Member for Katong, has

said  about  the  Indian  cultural  show  is  very

important.  When they move their hands,  there  is

some  meaning. When they move their eyes or heads,

there  is also some meaning. These movements  must

be   explained  so  that  the  other   races   can

understand and may learn how to bring this culture

together with other cultures to mould our national

culture.  I  hope the Minister will  instruct  the

Broadcasting    Department    to    explain    the

significance of these movements for every show, so

that it will be easy for the people to learn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I again seek

your   permission  to  speak  on  this  amendment,

because  just  now my colleague,  the  Member  for

Anson, raised the question of colour TV? If  I  am

permitted  to  speak  now, I will  not  be  moving

amendment (12)*.

<hr size="2" noshade>

* Amendment (12), standing in the names of Messrs Teong Eng Siong and Ng Kah Ting, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 12.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right, Mr Ng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Thank you, Sir. Just now the

Member  for  Anson asked the Minister for  Culture

when will colour TV be introduced. I would like to

say,  Sir,  that it is all very well to  introduce

colour  TV  but the cost is in the  region  of  $3

million.   In  actual  fact,  according   to   the

Memorandum  on the Main and Development Estimates,

it will require $2.9 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In introducing colour TV, I wonder whether the

Minister for Culture takes into consideration  the

question of cost of colour TV sets to the  viewer.

In  this respect, I wonder how many people will be

able  to afford the luxury of a colour TV set.  To

my mind, only a few



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



will  benefit, i.e, those who are well to do. When

Government  introduces colour TV,  I  take  it  as

another form of social service for the benefit and

enjoyment of the general public. Therefore, if the

introduction of such a service is beyond the means

of  the  majority of the people, due to  the  high

cost  of  the  set,  I  would  say  that  such  an

introduction would be unwise. However, as a  first

step  upon the introduction of colour TV,  perhaps

the  Minister will consider installing  colour  TV

sets  at community centres for the general public.

Will  he  also consider ways and means of reducing

the  high  cost of such sets, so that more  people

can enjoy this new amenity?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am saying this because I do not wish the

Government  to give the impression to the  general

public  that when such a service is introduced  it

is  only  for  the benefit of the privileged  few.

Also,  I  hope  the manufacturers  will  not  take

advantage   of  this  new  amenity   by   charging

exorbitant  prices  for  these  sets.  I  am  sure

Members  will  agree  with me  that  public  money

apportioned for such a purpose must be justifiably

and  worthily  spent. That is to  say,  everybody,

whether  he  is with or without any means,  should

benefit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  this  provision of $2.9 million is  for  the

development  of  colour TV. I recall  that  during

last  year's debate on the Budget, I talked  about

this matter too. The Minister told me then that he

had  plans to implement colour TV. 1 am very  glad

that in this year's Estimates, he has very quickly

and  rapidly provided for the expenditure of  this

item. This goes to show that the Minister is doing

his job efficiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that colour TV has already been

introduced in other South-east Asian countries. As

a  financial centre of South-east Asia  and  as  a

country   with  a  high  level  of   culture   and

education,  Singapore should not lag behind  other

countries. We should catch up with other countries

and  provide this service for the benefit  of  our

people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to raise now is in two parts.

Firstly,  under  this provision of  $2.9  million,

what  sort of plans are in hand? Can the  Minister

give   us  some  details  of  the  various  plans?

Secondly,  the  Minister told us  last  year  that

colour  TV  would  take three  to  five  years  to

implement.  I think that is rather slow.  I  would

like  to  ask  the Minister when can  we  actually

implement colour TV programme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I agree with some of the

remarks made by the Member for Katong that we need

what   he  called  "cross-fertilisation"  in  this

cultural field. But the problem is that we need to

have    the   personnel   to   do   this   "cross-fertilisation". It is no use asking a mono-lingual

person  to  do it because he would not  understand

what  it  is  all  about - the  movements  of  the

fingers,  eyes  and so on. It is a rare  breed  of

species, like myself or some other people, who can

enjoy  a  Cantonese opera as well  as  an  Italian

opera,  and who can also enjoy a Western  symphony

orchestra  music  as well as a  Chinese  orchestra

music.  At the present moment very few people  can

do  this. I think we should be given time to  work

this  out. Of course, our aim is that whatever  we

produce  for screening on TV should be  understood

and  enjoyed  by the majority of the people.  Here

again, the language barrier is also a problem.  It

is  no use explaining to them the significance  of

certain movements in the Cantonese opera,  if  the

people  cannot understand Cantonese at all and  it

is  too  late to teach them Cantonese. So I  think

there  is some obstacle to this. However, we  will

try  our  level best to bring about this  kind  of

"cross-fertilisation".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courses to be conducted on the historical

landmarks and monuments of Singapore is, I  think,

a   very  good  suggestion,  although  the   other

departments should also be responsible.  What  the

TV  can  do  is  to  produce films  depicting  the

various  landmarks of Singapore, before  they  are

gone.  We  are definitely going into this,  and  I

think it is a very good suggestion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the techniques of the producers and the

personnel involved in making a film, I admit  that

we  have some shortcomings because technicians are

difficult  to get nowadays. And if they  are  well

trained, it is also difficult to retain them.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interviewers are young. Therefore, they have

got  to  be  trained. Some of them are just  fresh

from  school. It will take some time for  them  to

become more sophisticated in their interviews. But

I  will  take  note of this and will  urge  for  a

better performance the next time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong says that camera gimmickry

can   make  a  person  giddy.  This  is  something

producers  like to try out because  there  are  so

many  gimmicks that they can do to  make  a  scene

more interesting. Instead of just showing the face

of  a singer, they can make it more interesting by

superimposing  something  to  give  it  a   better

effect. I must, of course, say that I am not fully

in  agreement with this. But we have to  let  them

try  out their own techniques because it is in the

nature   of   technicians   to   improve   through

experiment.  We  will therefore have  to  tolerate

this for some time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson is, as usual, complaining

about Tamil films. I am not quite sure what he  is

trying to aim at. At one point he was saying  that

we  do  not  provide midnight shows for the  Tamil

viewers,  and in the same breath he said that  the

Tamil  programmes are too early for them.  Perhaps

this  is  because some Tamil films are intolerably

long.  So  they are scheduled at the  end  of  the

daily  programme  series, so that  the  films  can

carry on into the night.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

is on the wrong track. There is a weekly film show

in  Tamil, on Thursdays and Fridays. Usually  they

telecast  the film at 9.25 p.m. on Thursdays,  and

at  9.30  on  Fridays. Sometimes these times  have

been changed from 9.25 and 9.30 p.m. to 10.00  and 10.30 p.m.

respectively. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



will  therefore mean that people will have to stay

up  late to watch these films as they go on up  to

midnight. So I want the times for the Tamil  films

to  be  fixed at 9.25 and 9.30 p.m. for  Thursdays

and  Fridays respectively. I do not want the times

to be earlier or later than 9.25 p.m. or 9.30 p.m.

This  is because on Fridays some Tamil people want

to visit the temple and when they go home they can

watch  the  Tamil shows on TV. If it  is  telecast

earlier,  they  may not go to the temple  as  they

will want to watch the shows. Therefore, we should

stick to 9.25 p.m. and 9.30 p.m. Does the Minister

understand now?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I wish to make is about radio

programmes.   Radio  Singapore  stop  broadcasting

Tamil  programmes  at  9.00  p.m.  For  the  other

language mediums, they broadcast the programmes up

to  midnight.  Why  is  this so?  Radio  Singapore

should  also end the broadcast of Tamil programmes

at  midnight.  Then the Tamil community  will  not

talk  of discrimination in a multi-racial society.

That is the reason why I am asking the Minister to

extend the times.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a

very tall order - to have the Tamil films telecast

on  Thursdays  and Fridays at 9.25 and  9.30  p.m.

respectively,  and not earlier or  later!  But  we

must bear in mind that we have to be flexible when

arranging  programmes  just  in  case  some  other

popular  and exciting programmes like boxing,  for

instance,  come on. Then we have to  put  them  on

first,  and leave the lengthy Tamil films  to  the

end  so that people who enjoy these films can stay

up to enjoy them without interruption. Conversely,

people  who  do  not enjoy these films,  can  then

switch  on  to  another channel. We will  have  to

leave the Tamil programmes as they are, because of

the   need   for   flexibility  in  arranging   TV

programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radio programmes in Tamil always stop at 9.00

p.m. to  give way to the other Chinese  dialects.

This  is  done  because we have to meet  with  the

demand of the majority of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



listeners. This has been so for several years  and

we do not intend to change this time-table.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, it is not a question of

the  majority or the minority. We are now  talking

in   the  context  of  our  multi-racial  society.

Therefore,    why    should    there    be    this

discrimination? Singaporeans do not think in terms

of  whether  they are in the majority or  minority

nowadays.  They belong to a multi-racial  society.

So  why should radio broadcasts in the other three

languages go on to midnight, and stop broadcasting

Tamil programmes at 9.00 p.m.?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, this practice has been

going  on for several years and we are quite happy

about  it.  This  is the first time  it  has  been

raised.   However,   we   have   to   take    into

consideration  the  proportion  of  the   problem.

Nevertheless,  we  do  not intend  to  change  the

present practice.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I have not brought this

matter  up  in  the  past few years  because  only

recently   did   I  receive  such   a   complaint.

Therefore,  I  now bring it up for the  Minister's

consideration.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jek, what about colour TV?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir. The

Members for Punggol and Sembawang have asked about

colour  TV. We have done everything we can to  lay

down  the  foundation for colour TV. If everything

goes  on well, we will probably have colour TV,  a

pilot  programme, in the later part of  1974.  The

important  thing for us to do now is  to  persuade

the dealers to send their technicians for training

in  the  field of colour TV. RTS has already  done

the  necessary training for its staff. It has sent

three engineers abroad for training, and they have

all  come  back.  We  are  now  seeking  funds  to

purchase certain equipment. The dealers will  also

have to step up the training of their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



technicians,  because it is imperative  that  they

provide  good service as the colour sets are  much

more  complicated  than the black-and-white  sets.

The  colour sets can go out of order very  easily.

Hence, this need for better servicing. We are also

in  the  process of calling a meeting with dealers

to urge them to go ahead and train their staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the total cost of setting up colour TV is

$20.4 million. The amount shown in the Development

Estimates  is  $2.9 million. This  is  the  amount

required  for the financial year 1973-74.  But  if

you  look  at  the provision carefully,  you  will

notice  that  there  is  an asterisk  against  the

amount.  This  means that it  is  subject  to  the

sanction  of  the Development Planning  Committee.

The  Committee  is  now asking  us  what  sort  of

equipment we are purchasing, and other matters. As

soon as we have satisfied their curiosity, we hope

to get the money to carry on with our plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the cost of a colour TV set is quite

expensive, and the Member for Punggol has  rightly

shown  his concern for the high cost. He has asked

whether anything could be done to reduce the cost.

I  remember  when  we first introduced  black-and-white  TV in 1963, everyone was saying that  a  TV

set would cost them $400 or $500 and they were not

sure whether people could afford that sum. We  can

now see that practically every family has one set.

I  am  quite sure our standard of living will have

gone up by the time colour TV is introduced and by

then  many people will be able to afford a  colour

set. One way to reduce the cost of a colour set is

for  a dealer to take back the black-and-white set

and  offsetting the trade-in value for the  colour

set.  When I was in Taiwan last year, I found that

Taiwan  has a large rural population. This  is  an

advantage for conversion into colour because  when

they  introduced colour TV, what happened was that

the  dealers took back the black-and-white TV sets

from  the city and sold them to the people  living

in  the  rural areas, resulting in the city people

all having colour sets and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



rural  people  having  the  black-and-white  sets.

Moreover, the black-and-white sets will slowly  be

phased  out  as  the standard of living  of  their

rural people goes up. But here in Singapore we  do

not  have  a big rural population. So the  dealers

may have to think of some other way to dispose  of

the  black-and-white sets. Perhaps they  can  sell

them  to  places like Sarawak, Sabah or Indonesia,

and  then give good discounts for the colour sets.

That  may  be  one way to reduce the cost  of  the

colour sets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way for the people to enjoy colour TV is

to have one in each community centre. I can safely

say  that the People's Association will definitely

take  steps  to  install  a  colour  set  in  each

community  centre,  if  and  when  colour  TV   is

introduced. But it is still too early to say that.

So  I will leave it to the People's Association to

decide when the time comes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

make   a  point  of  clarification.  The  Minister

mentions  that the People's Association will  take

into consideration the request I made just now.  I

would  now  like to add to what he has said  about

the  People's Association. I believe the  Minister

for Culture is the Deputy Chairman of the Board of

Management of the People's Association. Therefore,

when  he says that such request will be taken into

consideration, I hope that it will be realised.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, before I withdraw, I would

like to make reference to the Minister's statement

money  on  acquiring programmes,  such  as  buying

these  canned  programmes that are ready-made,  it

might  be  better if we spend more money  training

our

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for Culture

whether there are any plans to set up a library in

Jurong Town. As we all know, Jurong Town is  under

rapid  development. There are about 40,000  people

living  there now. In years to come  it  may  well

become  a satellite town of 100,000 people.  There

are  branch libraries in the other satellite towns

built  by the Housing and Development Board,  such

as  Toa Payoh and Queenstown. Therefore, may I ask

the Minister for Culture whether he intends to set

up a branch library in Jurong Town? Perhaps he can

make use of one of the HDB premises as a library.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is

yes,  but it will have to be in the financial year

1976-77.  In the consideration for the setting  up

of  branch  libraries  of  the  National  Library,

priority is given to areas with at least a 100,000-population. The first full-time branch library was

set  up  in Queens-town in 1970. The second branch

library at Toa Payoh is now under construction



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



and  will  be  completed in the 1973-74  financial

year.  Provision has also been made  for  a  third

branch  library  to  be built  in  Katong  in  the

1974-75  financial year. The fourth branch library

is  being planned at Telok Blangah and Bukit Merah

housing  estates  in the financial  year  1975-76.

Jurong  Town  is expected to have a population  of

70,000  by  the end of 1973, reaching a population

of 100,000 by the end of 1975. Therefore, a branch

library  is being planned for Jurong Town  in  the

financial year 1976-77. The present population  is

now served by means of a regular bulk loan of 500

books  per  loan  to  the Jurong  Town  Residents'

Association. Altogether, 1,690 books were borrowed

in 1972 in this manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Film shows are one of the most popular forms of

entertainment and recreation for the  masses.  The

film  industry has made a great profit, which  may

amount  to  millions of dollars. Since our  people

have  spent  so  much money on  film  shows,  they

deserve  to get back something for what they  have

paid,  that  is to say, the films the  people  see

should  be  healthy  and  meaningful.  However,  I

regret to say that the films shown in recent years

have  been  bloody. They are violent,  nonsensical

and meaningless to the audience. Some of the films

depict sex, and the pornographic art. These  films

have deleterious



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>



effects on the minds of the people. They also have

an  adverse  effect on the morals of  the  people.

Many  parents  now realise that they should  guide

their  children  along the right path.  They  feel

that  it  is  difficult to  get  films  which  are

healthy for their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent days we have read in the newspapers

about juvenile delinquency. There was a case  when

two teenage boys robbed a couple at a bus station.

One even kissed the girl and tried to assault her.

This incident did not occur without any reason.  I

think  it  is the result of bad social  influence.

The  other  reason may be due to  the  deleterious

effects of films depicting sex and violence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the harm that is being done by these

films,  the  Board  of  Film Censors  should  take

positive  action to ban these films. The  Ministry

of  Culture should encourage the showing  of  more

healthy  and  educative films so that the  general

mass  of the people can enjoy healthy films  which

will  be  of  benefit to them. In  this  way,  our

society will be more peaceful and secure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I inform

the  Member that we are doing our very best to try

to  put a stop to films which glorify violence.  I

do  not  think we can put all blame on films.  For

instance,  juvenile  delinquency  can  be  brought

about by many factors other than films. All I  can

say is that the film distributors aim at making  a

profit.  If  they can make money out of  producing

good  and healthy films, I am quite sure they will

do  that.  But they find that they can  make  more

money out of films which depict violence and  sex.

Therefore, everyone goes for this type  of  films.

Our  problem  is that we are not in a position  to

say  what sort of films should be allowed to  come

in. We can only censor the films, impose cuts,  or

ban  the films altogether. As to the kind of films

to  be  brought into this country,  it  is  all  a

matter  of supply and demand. If more people  want

good films, I am quite sure there will be a lot of

good films coming in.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am  glad  to hear from the  Minister  for

Culture  that the Board of Film Censors  would  be

taking  positive  measures to  deal  with  various

types of films depicting violence and sex. I  hope

the  officials  involved in  this  work  will  pay

attention  to  what the Minister  has  said.  When

censoring  films  they should  bear  in  mind  the

Minister's statement of policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture has also said just now

that the film industry is only aiming at making  a

profit. The Ministry concerned should persuade the

film  industry not to regard profit-making as  the

only motive but also to pay some attention to  the

benefits which it can contribute to our people and

thus  help  maintain stability and  peace  in  our

society. The people in the film industry can  make

a valuable contribution to our society, since they

are  also  human and they also have a  conscience.

Therefore,  I  think they will take  heed  of  our

aspirations.

(* The same amendment also stood in the names  of Mr  Ho  Kah  Leong and Tuan Haji Mohd.  Ariff  Bin Suradi.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, commenting on the effect of

industrialisation and citizens' fashions and  ways

of  life  during  the last week's  debate  on  the

Budget  statement, the Minister  for  Finance  had

agreed  that there is a lot to be said for turning

away   from  materialism  towards  more   cultural

projects  and  worthwhile activities.  I  have  no

doubt  that  the Minister for Culture  will  agree

with  me  that  community centre  development  and

activities are worthwhile projects. Activities  in

this direction provide alternative outlets for our

energetic  youths. In our endeavour  to  encourage

our youths to participate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



in cultural and other healthy activities, in order

to  keep them away from less desirable indulgence,

especially   drug-taking  and  other  pill-abuses,

there  is  no  question that we need  to  urgently

upgrade  the  facilities of most of our  community

centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of the 180-odd community centres in our

Republic are sub-standard. Besides, a good  number

of  our  constituencies are  without  a  community

centre.  In  this connection, I am of the  opinion

that the total sum of $1.03 million allocated  for

the  People's  Association for the development  of

community  centres,  i.e, the  purchase  of  land,

equipment and furniture, and for other activities,

is  grossly  inadequate. If  we  divide  this  sum

equally  among the 187 community centres, it  will

come  to  something like $6,000 a  year  for  each

community centre, or $500 a month, which  in  many

cases  is barely enough to pay for the PUB  bills,

let alone upgrading the facilities, like providing

colour  television in the next financial year.  I,

therefore, wonder if the Minister for Culture will

kindly  inform the House as to how he  intends  to

utilise the limited funds made available, and what

programme   of  activities  is  he  contemplating.

Finally,  I  would like to know whether  he  would

consider  taking  steps as  soon  as  possible  to

secure  additional votes for the coming  financial

year  to  upgrade the facilities in the  community

centres.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

merely  want  to  find out from the  Minister  for

Culture in what way the Ministry is going to  help

the  community  centre now being built  in  Jurong

Town. $400,000 is the target cost of building this

community centre, and it will take a long time and

a  lot  of effort to get this large sum of  money.

When  asking for contributions, I have often  been

asked   in  what  way  is  the  Government  giving

financial assistance for the building of community

centres.  Is it a dollar-for-dollar grant  in  the

case of this Jurong Town community centre?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in planning

the expansion of the community centres, especially

in the provision of funds for the construction and

improvement  of community centres, we have  always

relied on local participation. The amount that  is

being  voted  for  is for the construction  of  11

community  centres in various parts of  Singapore.

We  are  giving priority to constituencies without

community   centres.  In  the  case   of   Tanglin

constituency,  it has no community centre  and  we

are  therefore  going  to  build  a  standard-type

community  centre there. In fact,  last  year,  we

allotted a sum of money for the construction of  a

community centre in Tanglin constituency, but they

did  not use it. So this is a revote. We are going

to  build  a centre in Jurong Town, one in  Potong

Pasir,  one in Henderson constituency, and one  in

Toa Payoh constituency. Toa Payoh constituency has

been  divided into two, and the one which is still

called  Toa  Payoh constituency has  no  community

centre.  So we have to provide a sum of money  for

this.  We  arc also providing some money  for  the

reconstruction of the existing community centre in

Anson constituency. Another community centre is to

be  built  in Moulmein constituency,  and  one  in

Kampung Chai Chee. The community centre in Kampung

Chai Chee is inadequate because it is sited on the

ground floor of a block of Housing Board flats. We

find that the space is too limited for the various

activities  of the community centre and  provision

has been earmarked for its development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the construction of rural-type

community  centres,  we have to  build  three,  at

Bukit  Gombak, Paya Lebar and Punggol.  These  are

the  projects we have in mind. We have  set  up  a

Development    Committee    in    the    People's.

Association, and the Member for Kim Keat is also a

member  of  this committee. The function  of  this

Development Committee is to look into the  various

aspects of activities of community centres and  to

put  up  recommendations for  the  improvement  of

facilities  in  these centres. With  this  sum  of

money, I think we can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



go  a long way towards improving the facilities of

the  centres, provided we have the support of  the

local   people  in  providing  money   for   these

improvements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always said that the activities of

community  centres must have the  support  of  the

local population. There is no point in spending  a

lot of money when the facilities are not used. The

purpose  of getting the people's participation  is

to ensure the full use of the facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has asked for the full

amount   of  money  to  be  spent  on  the  Jurong

community centre. I am afraid we cannot  give  him

the  full amount. It is the policy of the People's

Association to give grants, dollar-for-dollar, for

the  construction of community centres. But  there

must  be  a  limit. We cannot just  go  on  giving

dollar-for-dollar subsidy without  a  limit.  They

may  ask  for  a  $400,000 or  $500,000  community

centre.  And  I do not think they can  expect  the

People's Association to meet with the demand. So a

ceiling  has got to be fixed, and that ceiling  is

about $80,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  thank the Minister for his explanation. Before

I  withdraw my amendment, I would like to  comment

on  the principle involved, i.e, that there should

be  a  ceiling  for the grant. I think  we  should

conceive  that  the facilities  in  the  community

centres or the provision of community centres is a

form of public institution, like the provision  of

schools  for  the  children, provision  of  public

recreational  facilities, as  part  of  the  State

responsibility.  In  that  sense,  I   feel   that

although I agree with the Minister that we  should

encourage    or   would   like   to   see    local

participation,  the main responsibility  of  these

provisions  should be that of the  State.  If  the

State can provide additional funds, then it should

do   so   to  lighten  the  burden  of  the  local

residents, like residents in my constituency,  for

example,  where  almost 100 per cent  are  Housing

Board  residents, 30 per cent of whom are one-room

flat  dwellers. And for them to raise $150,000  or

even $100,000 is rather impossible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(14) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 63.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the proposal to replace old

buildings  and holiday camps at Changi  and  Tanah

Merah  with chalets and picnic pavilions with  the

provision  of  $200,000. This proves that  holiday

chalets  are  becoming more and more popular,  and

hence there are insufficient chalets to cope  with

the  increasing demand for such facilities. On the

question of booking holiday camps and chalets,  it

takes a long time for the People's Association  to

approve  the  application. Moreover,  applications

have to be submitted very early.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know from the Minister for

Culture whether the People's Association is in the

process of acquiring more land, especially in  the

coastal parts of our Republic, for the purpose  of

building more holiday chalets or picnic pavilions.

Sir,  I have pointed out to the House earlier that

in  an urbanised society like ours, there must  be

room  for recreational facilities for those living

in  Housing  Board flats. I would  certainly  hope

that this is not the end of the holiday complex. I

would  like  to  see more holiday complexes  being

built for the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Punggol  complained that the holiday  chalets

are  not sufficient. Yes, they are not sufficient.

But   in  what  periods  of  time  are  they   not

sufficient? In Pasir Ris we have 30 holiday flats.

But  they  are all empty during school terms,  and

full  during  the  school holidays.  I  think  the

problem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



here  is not that we do not have enough. It  is  a

question  of how to allocate or how to  make  full

use  of  these  chalets. During the school  terms,

there are many holiday flats, bungalows and so  on

looking  for  occupants. During  school  holidays,

however,  we  have applicants looking for  holiday

chalets.  Perhaps one solution will  be  that  our

people  should  take their holidays  in  different

periods  and not take their holidays  all  at  the

same time. If they do that, then I do not think we

need  to have so many chalets. Otherwise no matter

how we allocate them, we will still not be able to

meet  the  demand for holiday chalets. If everyone

goes  on  holiday  at the same time,  then  it  is

really not possible to approve every application.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The booking of a holiday camp takes a very long

time.  I  presume that it will take some  time  to

book a holiday camp because of the popularity  and

also  because of the number of people who want  to

get into these camps. The problem here may not  be

just  acquiring land to open up new camps, because

in  land-hungry Singapore it is not feasible to do

that. One solution may be to partition the present

holiday  camps in such a way that more groups  can

use the camp at any one time. For instance, we can

have  the Tanah Merah Camp renovated to allow  not

just  one group to use it at any one time  but  to

partition  it  in such a way that  several  groups

from  different organisations can occupy this camp

at  the  same time. I think that may be a solution

to  this  shortage of camps. I agree that we  need

more  camping sites for our young people in  order

to encourage them to get used to outdoor life. But

the  problem is how to get more camps. How are  we

going  to  get  land in order to convert  it  into

camps? As I have said, I think the solution may be

to subdivide the camps now available.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> As regards land availability, I

think there is no problem. Even though there is  a

term known as "land-hungry Singapore" as mentioned

by  the  Minister just now, I think the Government

can easily acquire land if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



it  wants to. We have seen this going on  all  the

time.  So there is no problem about that.  What  I

wanted   was  that  certain  coastal  parts   with

beautiful  beaches  be acquired  so  that  holiday

complexes can be built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also mentioned that holiday camps or

complexes  are  only fully occupied during  school

holidays.  I concede that that is true. But  that,

of  course,  proves  one point,  that  during  the

school   holidays  everybody  goes   on   holiday,

especially   parents  who  want  to  bring   their

children to the seaside, or some place like  that.

It  also  proves another point, that not everybody

can  take his holiday and use it by going  to  the

seaside  where the People's Association  have  got

these holiday camps, because the children have  to

go  10  schools. So that is ruled out. But in  all

probability it may be that the organisations might

want to make use of these holiday camps or chalets

during   certain  weekends.  Similarly,  in   that

respect,  where there is a great demand for  these

holiday   camps  at  certain  times   or   certain

particular periods of the year, there would hardly

be  sufficient  holiday camps or complexes  to  go

round.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister said that partitioning may be one

way  to solve the problem. I would say that it may

ease  the  problem a little but not totally  solve

it.  I cannot agree with him in his assertion that

it  is  difficult to look for land because,  as  I

have  mentioned just now, if Government  wants  to

acquire a piece of land for public development  it

can do so at will. There is no question to that. I

do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



not  think  it  is  going to be very  costly  when

Government  acquires a piece of  land  for  public

development because it is in the interest  of  the

public. In that respect, if I get the assurance of

the  Minister for Culture that he will  look  into

all   these   aspects,  then   I   will   consider

withdrawing my amendment.
