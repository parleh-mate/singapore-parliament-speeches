<div align="center"><b>(Colombo Plan Aid)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr M. P. D. Nair</b> asked the Chief Minister if

he  will  make a statement explaining the  economic

and  agricultural development of Singapore proposed

by Government; and the scope and extent of external

aid  which  it has been promised or is expected  to

receive  financially  and  materially  through  the

Colombo Plan in pursuit of such developments.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  broad field of economic and agricultural

development  of  Singapore  is  at  present   under

consideration  by  my  Economic  Adviser  and   the

various  Ministries in the light of the  report  of

the  International  Bank.  After  the  Council   of

Ministers has considered the recommendations of the

Economic Adviser and the Ministries involved,  Sir,

announcements of policy will be made. That  is  the

first part of the question, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second part dealing with the

Colombo  Plan,  Sir, the Member  for  Seletar  (Mr

Nair)  will be aware of the generous offer  by  the

Australian Government of a milk reconstituted plant

valued at (Straits) $700,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, of course, the question of training

facilities,  Sir.  Over the period  1951  to  1955,

there have been 79 students from Singapore who have

been awarded



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>



scholarships under the Colombo Plan on a variety of

subjects,  and the question of further scholarships

and  training will be pursued. In addition, we have

the  right to apply for experts, and this  we  have

been doing and will continue to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the rest, Sir, I would refer the hon. Member

to  a reply which I made in this Assembly in answer

to a question from the Member for Tanglin (Mr John

Ede) on matters of trade and industry - a reply which

was reported in the Official Report, Vol. 1, No.  6

of  29th  June, 1955; and a further  reply  to  the

Member  for  Seletar, Sir, on Rural Veterinary  and

Animal  Husbandry Services, which was  reported  in

the  Official Report, Vol. 1, No. 9 of  26th  July,

1955.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Will the Chief Minister inform

us  from  where his Government propose to  purchase

the    powdered   milk   to   operate   this   milk

reconstituting plant?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I thank the hon. Member, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  for giving me this  opportunity  to

indicate to the Assembly that at the time the plant

was   offered  to  the  Singapore  Government,  the

Australian  Minister  for  External  Affairs,   Mr

Casey, indicated that there were no ties at all  to

the  offer,  and that although Australia  did  sell

powdered  milk,  there  was  no  question  of   the

Government being tied to the purchase of Australian

milk.  We were entirely free to obtain our supplies

where we thought it was most advantageous.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Will the Chief Minister inform

us if there was an offer made of free powdered milk

for a few years to operate the plant?

<div align="center"><b>(Travel Association)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Chief Secretary whether

the   Government  has  any  plans   formulated   to

encourage  the  tourist industry in Singapore;  and

whether   it  is  intended  to  set  up  a   Travel

Association  or  similar  organisation   for   this

purpose.



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> Yes, Sir. This Government regards

Singapore,  with its unique geographical  position,

its diverse



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>



cultures  and its amenities, as a natural and  most

desirable centre for tourists. In consultation with

the   commercial  interests  concerned,  whose  co-operation  is essential to success, it is  intended

to  examine the most effective form that a  central

travel  organisation or bureau  could  take.  Among

positive   action  already  taken,  Singapore   has

already  joined the International Union  of  Travel

Organisations,  a subsidiary of the United  Nations

Organisation,   and   the   Pacific   Area   Travel

Association. The Public Relations Office  has  over

the   past  years  produced  poster  and  publicity

material  and has worked in close association  with

travel  agencies concerned with tourist  publicity.

The  shooting of a tourist colour film begins  this

month.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, is the Chief Secretary aware that

the   Public  Relations  Office  is  not   properly

equipped to deal adequately with the whole scope of

the tourist trade?



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> There was no suggestion in my reply

that  the Public Relations Office, in itself, would

be  an adequate central tourist bureau. There  will

have to be something much wider in scope than that.

<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr M. P. D. Nair</b> asked the Financial

Secretary  if  he  will state the amount  of  money

spent  out of the public funds to provide transport

facilities to school children and others due to the

strikes  in the Singapore Traction Company for  the

following periods: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) from the day the strike began to the 12th October, 1955; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) from 13th October to 6th November, 1955.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> The cost of providing these

facilities has been as follows: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) from the 27th of September to the 12th of October, 1955, inclusive - $23,890;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) from the 13th of October to the 6th of November inclusive - $30,667.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of these Government vehicles which

were  used in the scheme, the figures I have  given

include  the cost of petrol and overtime  allowance

for  their drivers, but take no account of drivers'

wages, maintenance or depreciation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Will the hon. the Financial Secretary

explain  why  this expenditure was not  brought  to

this House for approval under a resolution approved

by  the  Assembly on the 25th of May, to the effect

that  any  new  service costing more  than  $10,000

should be approved by the Assembly?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The provision of these services, Sir,

was  a  matter in the public interest, and we  were

justified  in  approving payment of these  services

from  advances below the line. We will come to  the

Assembly  at  the first convenient  opportunity  to

take a vote for that amount.

<div align="center"><b>(Bukit Timah Road)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Works whether he  will  consider

lifting the 30 m.p.h. speed restriction on the dual

carriage-way  sections  of  Bukit  Timah  Road   and

imposing it on other sections.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The power to impose speed limits

rests with the Commissioner of Police and with  the

City Council or Rural Board as the case may be.  It

is peripheral to my Ministry and not central.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the Commissioner of Police

considers  that  the present speed  limits  on  the

Bukit Timah Road, and indeed in other parts of  the

rural  areas should be re-examined to see  how  far

they  should  be  extended or removed,  and  before

arriving at any conclusions, the police have it  in

mind  to  consult responsible bodies  such  as  the

Automobile Association, the Singapore Safety  First

Council, and the rural district committees.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Is the Minister aware that the speed

restriction along these dual carriage-ways  is  not

being  respected, and will he not agree that it  is

now  safe  and sensible to travel at more  than  30

miles an hour?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. The second part is a

the  same!  I  am  aware  that  it  is  not  always respected.

whether the Government school building programme of

23 primary schools and one secondary school due for

completion in 1955 is up to schedule.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> The school building programme

referred  to  was  a forecast by the  Public  Works

Department in April of the number of schools to  be

completed this year. This was one secondary  school

and 23 primary schools. The secondary school and 11

primary  schools  have  been  completed.  One  more

primary  school  will  be ready  in  December.  The

remaining  primary  schools  are  expected  to   be

February;  two  in March; and four  in  April.  But

(i)  whether the work of construction  of  all  six

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> The six secondary schools

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



Cedar Avenue and Bukit Timah have been approved and

tenders are to be called for. For Kim Seng Road and

Dunearn   Road,   layout   plans   are   with   the

Commissioner  of  Lands, but negotiations  for  the

purchase of the sites have not been completed.  For

Raffles  Institution  and  Raffles  Girls'  School,

plans have been held up because of a change in  the

policy of resiting Raffles Institution.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, will the Minister give an assurance

that all these secondary schools not so far started

early as possible in 1956.

are  applying  for entry into Government  secondary

schools  in  January 1956; (ii) how  many  students

can, in fact, be selected for entry to such schools

because of limited accommodation; (iii) whether  he

is  satisfied with the present method of selection;

and (iv) what plans the Government have in mind  to

give further education to those students unable  to

obtain entry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> The answer to the first part

of  the  question is 3,998; and to the second,  not

less   than  2,000.  To  the  third  part  of   the

question - yes,   the   method   of   selection   was

determined  by  a Board of Examiners consisting  of

representatives of the Department, the  University,

the  Training  College and heads of  secondary  and

primary  schools. They have been at great pains  to

make  the  examination  as fair  as  possible.  The

system, of course, will be continually reviewed  in

the light of experience.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the fourth part of the question - for boys,

there  is a Junior Technical School. For both  boys

and  girls, evening classes will be started at  the

new Junior Technical Schools as far as possible  to

meet  the  demand. There are, as the  House  knows,

some  children  now  in  primary  schools  who  are

debarred  from taking the secondary school entrance

examination because they are over-aged.  There  are

many  good reasons why they should not be  admitted

to  Form  Two, but if they are of more than average

intelligence  for  their age, it is  possible  that

they  can  cover  the secondary school  courses  in

three  years. Heads of schools are therefore  being

asked  to  recommend suitable candidates  who  will

then be required to take a special examination  for

admission to Form Three.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) what are the terms and conditions of

occupation.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   there  are  altogether  six  parts  to  this

question,  and I shall reply to them  according  to

the form they are tabulated on the question paper.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) There are at the moment altogether nine areas

available for resettlement, and of these, five  are

occupied.  The other four areas are being  prepared

for  allocation and should be ready for  occupation

next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In Ama Keng we have 738 acres; Jurong, 14th

milestone,   138   acres;  Chua  Chu   Kang,   14th

milestone,  140  acres; Jurong, 12½ milestone,  260

acres;  Chua  Chu  Kang, 13½ milestone,  44  acres;

Sungei Tengah, 373 acres; Tampenis, 10th milestone,

126 acres; Boon Lay Road, 14th milestone, 25 acres;

Bedok, 325 acres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The class of people who have taken advantage

of   the  allotments  in  resettlement  areas   are

farmers,  either full- or part-time, rural dwellers,

and people engaged in cottage industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) There are actually two kinds of allotments.

One, house lots. For these, settlers are being given

between  6,000  and 10,000 square feet  allotments;

and  the  second  one is farm lots.  These  usually

range between one and three acres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Rentals. Rentals vary with the areas. For

house lots in Jurong and in Boon Lay Road, they are

being  charged  between $30 and $34 per  annum.  In

Tampenis  rentals are $54 per 10,000  square  feet,

and in Bedok $24 to $28 per lot. For farm lots, the

rentals  are as follows: In Ama Keng it is  between

$10  and $26 per annum; in Jurong and Boon Lay Road

$16; in Tampenis $27, and in Bedok between $36  and

$48.   The  rentals  are  based  on  the  cost   of

acquisitions and development of the land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Occupation is on a Temporary Occupation

Licence  for  the first two years of occupation  at

half  the rental. After two years, if the land  has

been developed, a 30-year lease will be issued.  No

assignment  or subletting of the land may  be  made

without written permission from the Commissioner of

Lands.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> I would like to ask the

Minister  what  class of squatters are  allowed  to

occupy  the land, that is, squatters to be  evicted

from  Crown  land, or squatters to be evicted  from

privately-owned land?

<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  within  the meaning of the interpretation  of

the  term, there is no such thing as a squatter  in

Singapore,  but people who are allowed to  use  the

resettlement areas in Singapore are actually people

who have been compelled to evacuate from Government

property.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> I just heard, Sir, the

Minister  say  that each family  or  unit  is  only

allowed  a  maximum of three acres or something  to

that  effect. Has the Minister considered that some

families  may comprise a man and his wife,  two  or

three   stalwart  sons  and  two  or  three  tomboy

daughters? In that case, I think three acres  would

not be sufficient for them.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  question of allotting farmland  actually

depends upon the acreage, which the farmer  had  at

his old place of residence.

The  Draft Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure for

1956, which form an attachment to the Appropriation

Bill,  have  now been in the hands of hon.  Members

since Monday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time a Sessional Paper (Command No.

28  of  1955)  was circulated. This paper  gives  a

brief description of the Draft Estimates of Revenue

and  Expenditure and it is hoped that it may  serve

as  a  guide to hon. Members in their consideration

of the Draft Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I deal with the Draft Estimates in detail,

hon.  Members  will  perhaps  wish  me  to  comment

briefly  on  the  workings for 1954,  the  possible

outturn  for  1955  and on the  financial  position

generally. These matters are covered in some detail

in the Sessional Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accounts for 1954 show a deficit of $41.6

millions. Revenue realised $207 millions instead of

the  estimate of $214 millions, due mainly  to  the

fact  that the collections of income tax fell $13.5

millions   below  the  estimate  of  $70  millions.

Expenditure amounted to $248 millions as against an

estimate  of  $240.5 millions.  This  included  two

large  items  of  special expenditure  which  were

unforeseen  when the estimates were  prepared.  The

first  was  for  $36.4 millions in respect  of  the

settlement  of the Straits Settlements Assets  and

Liabilities. The second was for $14.5  millions  in

respect of a payment on account of the purchase  of

the Oriental Telephone and Electric Company. If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



these  large items are left out of account,  normal

expenditure  amounts to $197.9  millions  of  which

$14.5  millions represents expenditure under Public

Works  Non-Recurrent and a notional surplus  of  $9

millions can be shown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to 1955, it appears likely that there

will  again be a surplus but this time of  only  $2

millions.  Revenue is likely to fall short  of  the

estimate of $208 millions by $7 millions. It is now

clear  that collections from income tax  were  over

estimated at $70 millions. It is unlikely that more

than  $56  millions will be collected. 1954  was  a

much   less   prosperous  year,  particularly   for

companies, than was thought when the Estimates were

drafted. This shortfall will be offset to a certain

extent  by  increased collection on Customs  Duties

and  other items of revenue, but the net collection

of revenue is unlikely to exceed $201 millions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also appears likely that expenditure will also

fall  considerably short of the  estimate.  On  the

basis  of actual expenditure to the end of  August,

it  appears that total expenditure will  amount  to

about  $199  millions, including a contribution  of

$20  millions to development expenditure. The  main

savings on estimated expenditure have been effected

under  Head:  Defence  Services.  There  has   been

unavoidable  delay in the construction  of  seaward

defence  vessels and inshore minesweepers  for  the

Royal  Malayan  Navy, in addition to other  defence

expenditure  and  works, and savings  of  over  $18

millions   are  expected  under  this  Head.   This

expenditure will, of course, be carried forward  to

future  years. Savings of about $2.5  millions  are

expected under Head: Education as well as Head:  Medical and Health, and

over  $1  million in the case of Public  Works  and

Postal  Services, due mainly to inability  to  fill

appointment and to savings on Special Expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small surplus of $2 millions expected in 1955

compares  with surpluses of $42 millions  in  1952,

$52  millions in 1953 and, as already explained,  a

surplus on normal working of $9 millions in 1954.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also appears probable that development

expenditure   will  fall  short  of  the   original

estimate of $60.5 millions by some $16 millions and

that  a  balance of about $30 millions, instead  of

$16.4  millions,  will remain  in  the  Development

Reserve  Fund  for  use in 1956.  Under-expenditure

has,  in  the  main,  been due to  difficulties  in

obtaining and clearing sites and to delays  in  the

delivery  of  essential material.  In  addition,  a

total  of  $10 millions will have been advanced  to

the  Singapore Improvement Trust by the end of 1955

for  the  construction of low  cost  housing.  Here

again, the efforts of the Trust have been seriously

frustrated  by difficulties in clearing  sites  for

building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement of the Estimated Assets and

Liabilities on 1st January, 1956, is given on pages 6

and  7  of  the  volume  of draft  estimates.  This

statement  is  discussed  in  some  detail  in  the

Sessional Paper. Perhaps the main point to note  is

that  the Special Reserve Fund which, with interest

added,  stood  at  $106.6  millions  in  the   last

Statement,  has now been revalued at $96  millions,

due  to the general fall in value of the gilt-edged

securities in which it is invested. The Development

Reserve  Fund,  to  which interest  has  also  been

added, has been reduced from $51.9 millions to  $30

millions   by   drawings   for   development    and

revaluation, although in this case, since the  Fund

is  invested in short-term securities, the fall  in

value has been less marked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the position of the Colony's finances

as  they  will  stand at the end of  1955  must  be

regarded  as sound. The public debt is  very  small

and  adequate  provision continues to  be  made  to

service  it. There is a solid Special Reserve  Fund

which  serves  as the sheet anchor of the  Colony's

finances  and  which  can only  be  drawn  upon  by

resolution  of  the Assembly. There  is  a  General

Revenue Balance of $130 millions. Attention  should

however  be drawn to two points. The first is  that

approximately $109 millions of the General  Revenue

Balance is bound up in long-term loans, the bulk of

which  are  repayable on an annuity  basis  over  a

period of 60 years. Therefore, of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>



General  Revenue  Balance, only  a  small  part  is

liquid and available for use in the near future. In

fact,  a  truer  picture of the financial  position

might  be  shown  if these loans  were  charged  to

expenditure and the repayments credited to  revenue

year   by   year.   This  matter   is   now   under

consideration.  The  second  is  that,  while   the

position at present is sound, we are about to enter

into  a  period when mounting recurrent expenditure

and  the  needs  of  development,  particularly  in

respect  of  housing and the social services,  will

make great demands on our resources. It is when  we

look  at  the  Estimates for 1956 and the  probable

position  in later years that we see the  financial

position of the Colony in its true perspective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Draft Estimates of Revenue are described in

some  detail in the Sessional Paper. The  estimates

total $208.4 millions and represent as accurate  an

estimate  as it is possible to give of the  revenue

which is likely to accrue in 1956, on the basis  of

existing  taxation.  Generally,  they  follow  very

closely on the pattern of previous years. The  fact

that 1955 has generally been a more prosperous year

than  1954 for commercial interests has been  taken

into  account in estimating income tax  collections

at $65 millions, compared with actual collection of

$56  millions in 1954 and estimated collections  of

$57  millions  in  1955. In estimating  collections

from Customs Duties, account has been taken on  the

one  hand  of  the  fact  that  the  effects  of  a

Federation  boom  are usually delayed  in  reaching

Singapore,  and,  on the other,  that  the  present

price  of  rubber  may not be maintained  in  1956.

Customs Duties of all kinds total over $73 millions

and  represent approximately one-third of the total

revenue.  Other items of revenue vary  little  from

the estimates of previous years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before commenting on the Draft Estimates of

Expenditure,  I  should like to draw  attention  to

certain changes in the format of the Estimates. New

Heads  of  expenditure have been  created  for  the

various  Ministries.  The  various  departments  in

Ministerial   portfolios  have  been   grouped   in

alphabetical order after the Ministry  Head.  Head: Mis-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>



cellaneous Services, which totalled $30 millions in

1955,   has   been  abolished,  and   the   services

previously  grouped  under  this  Head  have  been

transferred to other appropriate Heads.  This  fact

should  be  borne in mind when what  appear  to  be

extraordinary  increases in expenditure  are  noted

under  other  Heads.  The  divisions  of  the   old

Department  of  Commerce  and  Industry  have  been

reconstituted as independent departments under  the

Ministry of Commerce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimates of expenditure total $231 millions,

including   a  contribution  of  $20  millions   to

development. The first draft estimates submitted by

departments,   excluding   any   contribution    to

development,  totalled  $232  millions.  They  were

subsequently  pruned  to $211 millions.  In  making

these  reductions, the following objects were  kept

clearly   in  mind:  the  need  to  limit  ordinary

departmental recurrent expenditure to  the  minimum

required  for the efficient discharge of Government

business:  the need to make adequate provision  for

the  expansion of the social services: and the need

to  augment  the funds likely to be  available  for

development  by  a  substantial  contribution  from

revenue.  Action towards these ends  was  taken  as

follows: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of ordinary departments all

applications for new appointments were re-examined.

Only  those  were passed for entry which  could  be

shown  to  be  necessary for  the  expansion  of  a

service  for the public, e.g. postmen; or  for  the

manning of a service which had been provided  in  a

previous year, e.g. crew for a new launch; or which

could  be  shown  directly to save  expenditure  or

increase revenue, e.g. collection of income tax; or

which  were otherwise imperative for the  efficient

discharge  of the government business. With  regard

to  recurrent expenditure, in so far  as  this  was

possible, provision was limited to, if not  reduced

below, the 1955 Estimates. As will be seen from  an

examination of the volume of the estimates, special

expenditure has been cut to the bone.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the social service departments

the needs arising from the rapid expansion of these

services  were appreciated. The ordinary  estimates

for  the  Medical Department are,  in  total,  $1.4

millions   in  excess  of  the  1955  figure.   The

estimates for the Department of Education,  if  one

takes account of increased provision for grants  in

aid   and   the  contribution  to  the   University

transferred from Head: Miscellaneous Services,  are

also very close to the 1955 figure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the net result was that the

estimates  of  expenditure  were  reduced  to  $211

millions and it was possible to make provision  for

a  contribution  of  $20 millions  for  development

which   was   required  if  essential   development

projects were to be financed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have dealt with the ordinary estimates of

expenditure in the Sessional Paper under  the  main

divisions  of  Personal Emoluments,  Other  Charges

Annually Recurrent and Special Expenditure, and  it

might be appropriate if I now deal with them on a departmental basis, drawing attention to points  of interest on that basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A table showing the pattern of estimated

expenditure  is  given on page 7 of  the  Sessional

Paper.  Further details of departmental expenditure

on  a  percentage basis are given in Appendix A  of

the  volume  of the Estimates. The main  points  of

interest  arising from that table  are  the  steady

growth  of  expenditure on the social services  and

the marked rise in respect of education in 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the various Heads of Expenditure, the

new Ministries require approximately $1 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 2: Pensions, increased provision is

required for pensions generally and for commutation

of  pensions.  These increases alone make  up  over

$700,000 of the total increase of $1 million  under

this Head.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision made under Head 3: Charitable

Allowances, follows the usual lines. The  provision

for  Family Planning has been increased by  $25,000

and  I am asked to state that this item will be the

subject  of a free vote in the Committee of Supply.

$300,000 has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>



been   provided  as  a  contribution  towards the

capital  cost  of  a  new  hospital  building   for

S.A.T.A.  Under  the Social Welfare  sub-head,  the

contributions    to    S.A.T.A. and    voluntary

institutions for children have been increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Head 6: Legislature, I understand

that  certain additions to this Head will be  moved

in  Committee,  arising  from  increases  of  staff

approved by the Standing Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 10: Audit, provision has been made for

certain  new appointments but the cost of these  is

largely covered by increased audit fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimated Expenditure under Head 12: Chief

Secretary has increased from $2 millions in 1955 to

$5.7  millions  in 1956. The increases,  which  are

almost  entirely  due to services transferred  from

old  Head: Miscellaneous Services, are explained  on

pages 4. 5 and 6 of the Sessional Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 14: Chemistry, provision has been made

for   the  first  time  for  the  Inspectorate   of

Dangerous Materials, an essential service in a city

like Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision under Head 16: Defence Services,

has  been very substantially reduced by eliminating

from the estimates all provision, which is unlikely

to be spent in 1956. The planned development of the

Defence   Services  has,  of  course,   not   been

interfered with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 18: Botanic Gardens, provision has

been made for the first time for a Nature Reserves

sub-department  which  will  give  effect  to   the

provisions of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police Personal Emoluments have increased by

$900,000.  69  new  appointments  appear   in   the

estimates  of  which  20 were approved  last  year.

Other  Charges  Annually Recurrent expenditure  has

been  kept  within  the  1955  figure,  despite   a

substantial  increase in the cost of City  Services

and  provision  for contributions  to  the  Central

Provident   Fund.  Special  Expenditure   is   only

slightly in excess of the Estimate for 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is made under Head 27: Treasury, for

the contribution of $20 millions to development. It

may be argued that such contributions should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>



not  be made from revenue, that capital expenditure

should  be  met from loans, and that the burden  of

repayment should be shared by all who will  benefit

from  it.  The answer to this argument is that  the

money  is required not only for capital development

in  the  ordinary sense of the term  but  also  for

special  development expenditure, as will  be  seen

from  the  estimate; that when it  is  for  capital

development  in the ordinary sense, it is  required

to  build  schools and hospitals  for  the  present

generation;  that future generations will  probably

have  to bear an even greater burden, and that  our

development requirements are such that we will have

difficulty in meeting them, not because our  credit

is  in doubt but because the capacity of the  loan

market  is limited. Contributions from revenue  are

therefore required as long as we can afford to make

them.   Provision  is  also  made  for  the   first

repayment  instalment of the  War  Damage  Interest

Free Loan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 31: Income Tax, provision is made for

additional  staff  in connection with  the  planned

expansion  of  the  department, and  under  Special

Expenditure   for   increased   staff    for    the

investigation of tax evasion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 45: Land and District Offices,

provision is made for the new Land Titles Registry.

A  sum  of $796,900 is revoted for the acquisition,

drainage   and   development  of  land   for   food

production. Of particular note is the fact that  no

contribution is made to the Rural Board in  respect

of  Other Charges Annually Recurrent expenditure in

1956,  the  Board having increased its  revenue  by

$900,000. This is a most gratifying move  on  which

the  Board  is  to be heartily congratulated.  Last

year's contribution in this respect was $405,000. A

contribution  of  $632,000 is  made  under  Special

Expenditure, compared with $1.3 millions  in  1955.

Of this sum, $254,000 is revoted. In addition, $4.4

millions is provided for development compared  with

$3  millions  in 1955, of which $857,000  has  been

revoted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 48: Education, Personal Emoluments

have   increased  from  $18.7  millions  to   $20.2

millions. 964 new appointments have been added,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>

mainly  for  probationary teachers.  This  gives  a

clear  idea  of  the  rate  of  expansion  of   the

department.  There has been a substantial  increase

in   the   provision   required   for   appointment

allowances.   The  most  spectacular  increase   in

estimated expenditure in the whole estimates occurs

under  Other  Charges Annually  Recurrent  in  this

Head.  The contribution to the Education Board  has

been  increased by $9.4 millions. This is  entirely

due  to an increase in the provision for grants  in

aid  to schools, which has been increased by almost

$10  millions. As hon. Members are aware, a  scheme

for the re-organisation of vernacular education  is

under  consideration and awaits the recommendations

of the All-Party Committee. It is impossible at the

present  juncture to say exactly what the recurrent

cost  of implementation of this scheme will be.  It

is,  however, likely to be of the order of the cost

of  full aid on the present basis to all vernacular

schools  and  provision  on  this  basis  has  been

entered in the estimates. It is desirable that this

should  be done so that the public can see clearly

what the cost of vernacular education is likely  to

be. Put bluntly, it will add about $10 millions  to

existing  costs and from now on, the  estimates  of

expenditure  will be increased by that  amount.  In

addition,  a  provision  of  $366,000  is  made  in

respect of the Provident Fund and $250,000 has been

provided  for the cost of staff for the Polytechnic

in  1956. Under Special Expenditure, a contribution

of   $425,000  is  made  to  the  Education  Board,

compared  with  $1.9 millions  in  1955,  and  $1.4

millions  is provided in the Development Estimates.

Provision  of $2.3 millions is made as  Singapore's

contribution to the cost of the University in 1956.

This was previously shown under Head: Miscellaneous

Services.  The  estimate  of  expenditure  for  the

department  in  1955  was $33.7  millions.  If  the

increased   grant  in  aid  to  schools   and   the

contribution  to the University are  excluded,  the

total estimate in 1956 is $34.5 millions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 52: Medical and Health, provision is

made  for  560 new appointments. These  are  spread

throughout  the many departments and  divisions  of

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



Medical  Department and reference must be  made  to

the  Estimates to find out where and what they are.

In all, personal emoluments total $18.5 millions as

compared  with  $16.8 millions in  1955.  Recurrent

expenditure totals $8.1 millions compared with $8.2

millions in 1955. The contribution to the Hospitals

Board  and  Tan  Tock Seng are reduced  below  1955

levels. Again the special expenditure contribution

to  the Board is reduced from $1.5 millions in 1955

to  $979,000  in 1956. In all, Medical  and  Health

expenditure  totals  $28.8 millions  compared  with

$27.4 millions in 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 56: Social Welfare, provision for

Public  Assistance  has  been  increased  from   $4

millions to $5 millions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been some re-organisation under Head

58:  Civil Aviation. The Regional Headquarters  has

been  disbanded and the Department is now organised

on  a  Singapore  basis. The Regional  Air  Traffic

Control  organisation however continues.  Increased

provision in staff and recurrent charges  has  been

made  for  the Singapore Airport, which is  now  in

operation. The ambition of the Director-General  is

to  run  the Terminal Building on commercial  lines

and make it pay its own way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total provision under Head 62: Public Works

Recurrent  has been reduced from $6.9  millions  in

1955 to $6.5 millions in 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a deficit of $22.7 millions in the

ordinary  Estimates of Revenue and  Expenditure,  a

matter on which I will touch later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Estimates are contained in a

separate  volume  which has been circulated  along

with the volume of ordinary estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original estimates of development expenditure

submitted  by  departments totalled $75  millions,

including  $38 millions for capital works  and  $37

millions for other development expenditure. It  was

quite  clear that funds would not be available  for

development expenditure on this scale, even  if  it

could be undertaken. In the end, the estimates were

cut   to  the  more  reasonable  figure  of   $53.6

millions, which now appears in the Draft Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering the financial aspects of the

Development Estimates, it was clear that  the  only

funds  likely to be available were the  balance  in

the   Development   Fund  and  as   substantial   a

contribution  as  could be made from  revenue.  Any

funds  which we could borrow in 1956 - and we  will

have to borrow in that year - would be required  for

other   commitments  such  as  housing,   telephone

development  and similar matters which might  total

as much as $35 millions. It was therefore necessary

to  frame  a development budget within a  total  of

about  $50  millions to which would  be  added  any

Colonial  Development  and Welfare  Funds  accruing

during the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the Development Estimates provided

$24  millions  for Special Development  expenditure

including  purchase of land, cost of  resettlement,

contributions  to Boards and similar projects,  and

$29.6  millions for capital works, of  which  $13.3

millions  represent  revotes.  Emphasis  has   been

placed  on social service development, and it  will

be seen that 34 per cent of the money available for

capital works has been devoted to Education and  24

per cent to Medical and Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although every possible effort has been made to

provide  for  projects in order of  importance  and

priority, it is inevitable that some very important

projects  have  only been given  a  token  vote  or

omitted  altogether. It is possible  that,  by  the

middle  of  the  year,  savings  will  have  become

available  because of the inability of  the  Public

Works  Department to make the progress  which  was

expected on certain major items. Should this  prove

to  be  the case, and the savings are not  required

for  other purposes, the authority of the  Assembly

will  be  sought to switch any available  funds  to

priority  projects for which it has  not  yet  been

possible  to  make provision. In this  way,  it  is

hoped  to make the maximum use of the funds  likely

to be available in 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stated earlier, there are other commitments

of  a capital nature in addition to those appearing

in   the  development  estimates.  Funds  for   the

construction of low rental housing will have to  be

supplied to the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>



Improvement Trust. It is hoped that the Trust  will

be  able to build new units to a value of at  least

$18 millions in 1956, although much will depend  on

whether  some solution can be found for the problem

of  clearing  suitable sites. A  sum  of  about  $7

millions  will be required for essential  telephone

development. $4 millions will be required as a loan

to   the  City  Council  for  the  construction  of

approach  roads  to the new Kallang  Bridge.  Other

commitments  such  as  flood  alleviation,  housing

loans,  etc.,  may amount to about $5  millions.  In

all,  these  commitments are likely to total  about

$35  millions.  Part of this sum can  be  met  from

liquid balances but the great bulk of it will  have

to  be borrowed in 1956. This may not be altogether

easy.  There  will  be other  borrowers  on  a  not

unlimited market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position therefore is that we are faced with

a deficit of $22.7 millions in 1956. With regard to

this estimated deficit, attention will no doubt  be

invited  to  the experience of previous years  when

even  larger estimated deficits have been converted

into surpluses, admittedly growing smaller year  by

year,  but surpluses just the same. To this  I  can

only  reply that this will not happen in  1956.  In

the  first  place,  the  factors,  which  converted

deficits  into  surpluses in the  past  no  longer

operate  to  the  same extent.  Public  Works  Non-Recurrent  estimated expenditure no longer  appears

in  the  ordinary estimates. Instead, its place  is

taken  by  a contribution to development, which  is

certain  to  be spent. Equipment for which  special

expenditure is required is now in free  supply  and

deliveries are no longer delayed as they have  been

in the past. There is no longer the same likelihood

of  under-expenditure  and  consequent  revotes  as

there  has  been in the past. In the second  place,

the  estimates of recurrent and special expenditure

have,  in fact, been literally cut to the  bone.  I

can  see  no possibility of any savings on ordinary

departmental  recurrent expenditure. Again,  having

regard to the way in which special expenditure  has

been pruned, it is difficult to see much likelihood

of  savings there. On the other hand, I cannot  say

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>



there  will be no savings. Some savings on personal

emoluments are inevitable. They may be substantial.

In this respect, performance invariably falls short

of  expectation. There may also be some savings  on

grants  in  aid. The sum entered provisionally  for

the  scheme  for the re-organisation of  vernacular

schools  may in the event be found to be more  than

is   required  in  1956.  Against  these   savings,

however,  there are bound to be unforeseen  revotes

and  expenditure on applications for  supplementary

provision.  I would not like to hazard a  guess - for

it  would be no more than a guess - as to the  actual

deficit  which  will be shown at  the  end  of  the

year's   workings.   Too  many  imponderables   are

involved.  All  I can say, with any certainty,  is

that  the  experience of past  years  will  not  be

repeated  and that the actual deficit is likely  to

be substantial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be convenient to take this opportunity

to  endeavour  to estimate the probable  course  of

revenue and expenditure over the next five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already endeavoured to show how revenue,

on  the  basis of existing taxation, is tending  to

level off at about the $205 millions mark, and how,

if  there  were any slight recession of  trade,  it

might well fall lower.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An attempt has also been made to show, in the

table,  which  appears on pages 10 and  11  of  the

Sessional  Paper,  how expenditure  on  the  social

services has increased over the past five years. It

will  be  seen  that actual recurrent  expenditure,

excluding  special expenditure,  on  Education  has

mounted  since  1951 as follows:  - $10.7  millions,

$14.1 millions, $15.4 millions, $23.3 millions  and

$31  millions. The figures for Medical  and  Health

are equally significant and are as follows: - $11.5

millions,  $14.2  millions, $15.2  millions,  $18.8

millions   and  $22  millions.  If  the  curve   of

expenditure  created by these figures is  projected

into  the  future,  and  if  $9  millions  for  the

additional cost of vernacular education is added to

the figure for education, the staggering figure  of

$106  millions  is  reached in 1959  for  recurrent

expenditure  on  education and medical  and  health

alone. This would be an increase



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>



of 100 per cent on actual expenditure over a period

of five years. Fortunately, however, it is unlikely

that  recurrent expenditure on these services  will

increase at these extraordinary rates. I think that

it  is  now  appreciated that the  economy  of  the

territory cannot stand expansion on what  has  been

called a "champagne" basis. Standards can and  must

be  reduced without affecting efficiency. As  staff

is  trained and becomes more experienced, it can do

more.    As    the   organisation   shakes    down,

extravagances  in staff and equipment,  which  have

previously  passed  unnoticed  can  be  seen   and

removed. Again, it is perhaps true to say that,  in

certain respects, the back of the present programme

of  expansion is some way to being broken and  that

increases in expenditure in the future will not  be

quite  so  steep as they have been  in  the  recent

past. It is clear, however, that, no matter what steps  we  take to reduce expenditure, to  increase

efficiency and to make our resources stretch as far

as possible - and these steps must be taken - recurrent

expenditure  on social services is going  to  mount

steadily in the future. When one takes into account

the  inevitable expansion of the Government machine

in   sympathy   with  an  expanding  economy,   the

increased charges on account of public debt as more

and  more is borrowed for development purposes, and

the  planned expansion of defence service, it  will

be appreciated that the estimate, which was made in

the  Sessional Paper to the effect that expenditure

on  all the services of Government might well be in

excess of $240 millions by the end of 1959, may not

be  very wide of the mark. In other words,  on  the

present basis of revenue receipts, we might by that

time  be  facing  an  actual deficit  of  over  $40

millions. Quite clearly, all practicable steps will

have  to be taken to increase revenue so that  this

deficit can be met.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position with regard to development

expenditure also gives equal cause for concern.  In

so  far as one can make an estimate on the basis of

the  legitimate  needs of the various  departments,

the capacity of Government to execute work, and the

capacity  of  the  Singapore Improvement  Trust  to

clear sites and build



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>



houses,  it  appears  likely that  Government  will

require an average of about $50-$60 millions a year

for  development of one kind and another  over  the

next few years. As recurrent expenditure mounts, so

ability  to  make any contribution from revenue  to

development will decrease and, before very long, we

shall  reach  the stage when we shall  be  entirely

reliant  on  borrowings  or reserves.  This  raises

serious problems. We must take care not to let  our

reserves  run down too far. In fact, they  are  not

very large in relation to the potential demands  on

them.  The  local loan market is not  unlimited  in

capacity.  There  will be other  borrowers  in  the

market  besides Government. Access to other markets

may  be  difficult  to  obtain.  We  may  find   it

difficult   to  obtain  all  we  require.   Clearly

therefore we must make sure that our plans  include

only  those  projects which are of vital importance

to  the  well-being and development  of  Singapore,

that nothing is included which does not measure  up

exactly  to  these standards, and  that  the  money

which  we  do  obtain  is made  to  go  as  far  as

possible. This may require a re-examination of  our

development  plans in the light  of  the  resources

likely  to  be  available. Steps have already  been

taken to examine the standards of construction  and

equipment   used  in  connection  with   Government

building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarise, the position is that, on the

present basis of revenue, we are faced in 1956 with

an   actual   deficit  which  is  likely   to   be

substantial  and  that,  despite  all  practicable

steps which can be taken to keep expenditure  to  a

minimum, this deficit could easily be of the  order

of $40 millions by 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was against this background that the review of

the  revenue potential envisaged in His  Excellency

the   Governor's  Address  to  the   Assembly   was

undertaken, and the Government's original proposals

for increased taxation in 1956 drawn up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review was undertaken before the arrival of

the  Economic  Adviser whose expert  knowledge  and

wide experience would have been invaluable. On  the

other hand, having regard to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>



time available, it was comprehensive and covered  a

wide  field. Consideration was given to the general

principles   of   taxation   in   Singapore,    the

possibility   of  increasing  existing   rates   of

taxation   was  examined,  and  the  more   obvious

proposals for new taxation were explored.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the review indicated that: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly: having regard to the free port status of

Singapore and to its almost complete dependence  on

trade,  the whole system of taxation should  be  as

direct  and  as simple as possible. Any  system  of

taxation  which interfered with the free  flow  of

trade, should be avoided as far possible. Secondly: having  regard to the close economic  ties  between

the  Federation  and Singapore,  it  was  generally

desirable  and in some cases essential,  where  the

fiscal  policies of the two territories  coincided,

to   have  the  same  rates  of  tax.  Thirdly:  by

comparison    with   adjoining   and   neighbouring

territories,  Singapore  appeared  to  be   lightly

taxed. There appeared to be considerable scope  for

increased  taxation within the existing  framework.

Fourthly: in so far as it was possible to  estimate

future  needs  over,  say, a five-year  period,  it

appeared  possible  that  these  needs  might,  and

indeed  could  perhaps best, be  met  by  judicious

increases  within  the  existing,  established,  and

familiar framework of taxation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the probable deficit in 1956, it

was  considered  that  this  might  be  met  by  an

increase in the rate of tax in the higher ranges of

assessable  income,  by  increasing  the  rates  of

estate  duty, and by imposing an additional fee  on

the first registration of motorcars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to income tax, it was considered that

it  would  be just to tackle higher incomes  before

considering proposals to alter personal allowances,

lower  the minimum level of taxable income or alter

the  rates  of  tax on the lower and  middle income

groups.  It  is  clear that there  is  considerable

scope  for  increased taxation in the upper  income

groups.  In this connection, I feel sure that  hon.

Members will have seen the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>



statistics  of  income tax rates  in  all  Colonial

territories  which  were  given  in  reply   to   a

Parliamentary Question earlier this year. They were

published  in  Hansard and also in the  August  6th

edition   of  the  publication  "Taxation".   These

statistics indicated very clearly that Singapore is

most fortunately placed in the matter of income tax

in  general but more particularly in respect of the

rates  of tax in the higher income brackets.  These

statistics can be made available if hon. Members so

desire.  As  regards  the  increases,  which   were

proposed  for  the  higher income  groups,  it  was

suggested that the rate of tax on incomes  of  over

$25,000  should be increased progressively until  a

ceiling  of  60 per cent was reached on incomes  of

$100,000  and over. As hon. Members are aware,  the

present  ceiling  is  30 per  cent  on  incomes  of

$50,000.  It  was estimated that this  increase  in

rate  of  tax would produce $9 millions in  a  full

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Estate Duty, it had been felt for

some  time  that the rates of tax, particularly  in

the  case  of large estates, were too low.  It  was

therefore proposed that the rates of tax should  be

substantially increased along the whole range.  The

existing scale reaches a maximum of 40 per cent  on

estates of $5 millions. The proposed scale gave  an

effective rate of tax of rather more than 50 per cent on estates of this amount. At the other end of

the  scale, however, estates of under $10,000  were

to  be exempted from duty. It was considered, in so

far as it was possible to make an estimate that the

new  scale might yield an additional $1.5  millions

in a full year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposals for an additional motor car

registration fee, in their original form, aimed  at

imposing  a graduated rate on c.i.f. values,  which

it  was estimated might yield $1 million in a  full

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These proposals were in accordance with the

general principles of taxation policy which I have

already outlined. They were in accordance with  the

stated  taxation  policy of the  Government,  which

aims  at  placing  the burden of  taxation  on  the

shoulders of those best able to bear it,  and  they

had the additional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>



advantage, since the first and last required  joint

action by the Federation Government, that they  had

all in the past been suggested by that Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was thought that the yield from these

proposals would probably go a very long way to meet

the deficit which would occur in 1956. Any further

revenue, which might be required could be obtained

by  judicious increases on certain customs  duties.

These  now showed a wide divergence from  those  in

force  in the Federation. It seemed clear that,  in

most  cases,  the  gap between the  Federation  and

Singapore  rates could, on the basis of  Federation

experience,   be   narrowed  without   consequences

harmful  either to the revenue or to the  consumer.

This  major  revision of the Customs  tariff  could

remain in reserve for use at a later date. The same

applied  to  any  major modification  in  the  main

income tax structure and to changes in company tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage I should perhaps mention the

question of purchase or luxury taxes. Proposals for

taxes  of this nature have been made from  time  to

time  in the past but for a variety of reasons have

never  met  with  favour. The  proposal  was  again

examined  in  connection with  the  review  of  the

revenue  potential. It was immediately  clear  that

the matter was fraught with difficulties. Singapore

is a free port, almost entirely dependent on trade.

If  any  system of purchase tax on a wide range  of

goods  were  to be effective, it would have  to  be

imposed  as  close  to  the  point  of  import   as

possible.  Imposition  at the  retail  level  would

clearly  be  difficult to control  effectively  and

might  well  prove impracticable on  that  account.

Imposition at import level would clearly have  very

considerable effects on the free flow of trade  and

would  have  to  be subjected to a  most  searching

examination as to its implications, possible  yield

and  effect on trade before any decision was  taken

about  it.  This examination could clearly  not  be

completed before the 1956 budget was introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration was also given to the imposition of

a  luxury tax on one or two commodities which  were

handled  by a comparatively few traders  and  which did



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>



not   enter   into  the  entrepot  trade   to   any

considerable extent. Apart from lack of  experience

in  Singapore of the administration of such  a  tax

and the difficulty of drafting suitable legislation

in  the time available, it was found that the yield

at the rate of tax which it was considered could be

imposed   in   the   first   instance   would    be

disappointingly small compared to  the  yield  from

other   measures  of  taxation  which  were   under

consideration and it was decided not to pursue  the

matter at least for the time being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was therefore decided to suggest to the

Federation Government that the rates of income  tax

and estate duty should be increased as proposed and

that an additional motor car registration fee should

be  imposed  in  connection with the 1956  Budgets.

This was done because of the desirability of having

a  common  fiscal policy and because, for at  least

two   of   the  proposals,  joint  action  by   the

Federation was essential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal was made on the 19th of September

and the details were discussed in Kuala Lumpur with

cordiality and understanding on the 6th of October.

Subsequently they were considered by the Federation

Government, and a decision was reached on  the  2nd

of  November.  The desirability of a common  fiscal

policy,  in  so  far as this was  practicable,  was

fully   appreciated   and   the   Government    had

considerable sympathy with the proposals which had

been  made. It was pointed out, however,  that  the

Government  had only come into power in August  and

had  been much pre-occupied since that date. It had

not  yet  had  time  to consider economic  planning

which  might require increased taxation or to  work

out a fiscal policy. In fact, in order to gain time

to  consider  these  matters  at  leisure,  it  had

decided  to adopt a standstill budget in  1956.  In

these  circumstances, it could not see its  way  to

introduce these proposals for new taxation  at  the

present time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This decision has placed this Government in an

awkward  predicament.  We  cannot  for  the  moment

proceed with the proposals for increased tax on the

higher  income  groups and for  an  additional  car

registration fee since these two proposals  require

joint  action in the two territories. On the  other

hand, steps must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



be  taken to meet the 1956 deficit. The whole order

of  the  taxation programme which I have outlined

has had to be reviewed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before proceeding to outline the results of this

review, I should perhaps explain why common  action

in  respect of income tax is regarded as essential.

The  close economic relations, which exist  between

the  two territories demand that the rates of  tax

should be the same in each territory. The wisdom of

this  view  has  been borne out by experience.  The

abandonment  of this position would  give  rise  to

grave   administrative   difficulties   and   would

adversely  affect the yield of tax.  The  proposals

for assessment of combined income would have to  be

abandoned if different rates of tax applied in each

territory, since neither would have jurisdiction to

tax  income  at rates different from those  imposed

under   its  own  ordinance.  Abandonment  of   the

provisions  for combined assessment under  which  a

single return is lodged and a single assessment  is

made  in respect of a person having income in  both

territories  would cause trouble  and  considerably

increase   the  work  carried  out   by   the   two

departments. A more serious consequence would be  a

fall  in  the  aggregate yield of tax. At  present,

individuals who derive income from both territories

and  who are either resident in one territory  only

or  resident  in both, receive one set of  personal

allowances.   If   there  were  entirely   separate

systems,  individuals  who  were  resident  in  one

territory  would  be  entitled  to  full   personal

allowances  in  the territory of residence  and  to

relief corresponding to that given under section 36

of  the Ordinance in the other territory in respect

of income arising there, while individuals resident

in  both territories would be entitled to a  double

set  of  allowances and would have their chargeable

income  in each territory taxed at graduated rates.

Again,  fiscal  policies  considered  in  isolation

would  lead  to differing rates of tax,  allowances

and reliefs, depending on the economic needs of the

territory concerned. Differences of this kind would

encourage  taxpayers,  particularly  companies;  to

change  their residence and capital would  tend  to

flow  into  the territory where the  net  yield  of

income was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



likely  to be greater. From the economic standpoint

of  Malaya  as a whole, the repercussion  would  be

most   unfortunate.  Evasion  of   tax   would   be

simplified  in  the case of persons having  incomes

arising  in  both territories Persons  carrying  on

similar  businesses  in each territory  would  have

little  difficulty in making notional transfers  of

stock   at  fictitious  prices  between   the   two

businesses  and  would be able to manipulate  their

profits at will. It would be necessary to introduce

double  taxation arrangements to provide for relief

in  respect of tax in both territories. These  are,

in  brief,  the  reasons why a  common  income  tax

policy has always been regarded as essential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common policy with regard to additional

registration fees on motor cars is desirable in view

of  the difficulties of control, which would  arise

if unilateral action were taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stated earlier, the second wave of our

proposed  taxation programme consisted of increases

on  customs duties, on liquor, petrol and  tobacco.

There were differences, in some cases wide, between

the Singapore and Federation tariffs. Experience in

the  Federation indicated that these gaps could  be

substantially  narrowed, if not closed  altogether,

without  harm either to consumption or to  revenue.

The  yields  would be substantial. For example,  an

increase  on  the duty on cigarettes to  Federation

levels  would yield $19 millions on present  levels

of   consumption.  It  was  proposed  to  introduce

measures  of  increased taxation progressively,  as

the   need   arose,  over  the  years,   until   we

approximated  as closely as possible to  Federation

levels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in view of the Federation decision, the

whole programme has had to be reviewed and switched

around.   The   whole  customs  tariff   has   been

considered, and it has been decided that  it  would

be  undesirable at the present time to increase the

tax  on  cigarettes  by even a  small  amount.  The

burden  of meeting the 1956 deficit therefore  fell

on  liquors and petrol. It was decided to raise the

duties on samsu half-way to Federation levels,  the

duties  on still wines and beer, ale and  stout  to

Federa-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>



tion  levels  and the duties on brandy  and  whisky

beyond Federation levels. The duty on petrol should

be raised to Federation levels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reaching these decisions, the Council of

Ministers had in mind that intoxicating liquor was,

in  fact, a luxury. It could not, by any stretch of

the  imagination,  be called a  necessity.  In  the

circumstances,  they  had  little   hesitation   in

raising  the  duties steeply, particularly  in  the

case of whisky and brandy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases in customs duties have already been

gazetted under the Public Revenue Protection

Ordinance. The increases in detail are as follows: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Brandy and other intoxicating liquor not

hereinafter provided for.</i> - The  full duty is increased from $61.50 per proof

gallon   to   $76.90   per   proof   gallon.   The

preferential  duty is increased  from  $53.80  per

proof gallon to $69.20 per proof gallon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Brandy in bottle.</i> - The full duty is increased

from  $48  per  gallon to $60 per gallon  and  the

preferential duty from $42 per gallon to  $54  per

gallon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Samsu</i>(including medicated samsu). - The import

duty  is increased from $27 per gallon to $31  per

gallon and the excise duty from $24 per gallon  to $27 per gallon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Still wines exceeding 26 per cent but not

exceeding  42 per cent of proof spirit.</i> - The  full

duty  is  increased from $15 to $18.75 per  gallon

and  the preferential duty from $11.25 to $15  per

gallon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Still wines not exceeding 26 per cent of proof

spirit.</i> - The full duty is increased  from  $7.50

to  $9.40  per  gallon and the preferential  duty

from $5.60 to $7.50 per gallon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ale, beer, stout, etc.</i> - The full duty is

increased  from $4 to $5.20 per gallon  and  the

preferential and excise duty from $3.60 to $4.80

per gallon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Whisky in bulk.</i> - The duty is increased from $61.50 to $76.90 per proof gallon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Whisky in bottle.</i> - The duty is increased from $48 to $60 per gallon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of a quart bottle of brandy and whisky

will  be  increased  by $2 as  a  result  of  these

increases in duty. The price of a peg on  a  24  to

the  bottle  basis  will be increased  by  about  8

cents.   Making  due  allowance  for   a   possible

reduction in consumption, it is estimated that  the

increased  duty  on  these  two  commodities   will

realise close on $1.5 millions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty on samsu has been raised slightly more

than  half-way  to  the Federation  level  and  this

increase will result in the price of a quart bottle

being  increased from $8.70 to $9.37 a bottle.  The

excise   duty  has  been  increased  to  $27,   the

differential between the duties on the imported and

local product being increased by $1. The cost of  a

quart bottle of local samsu will be increased  from

$5.50  to  $6. It is expected that these  increases

will yield about $300,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preferential duty on still wines has been

increased   to   Federation  levels,  the   existing

differential  between full and  preferential  rates

being maintained. The increased duties are expected

to yield $130.000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The import duties on ale, beer, stout etc., have

been  increased to Federation levels and the excise

duty  has been maintained at the same level as  the

preferential  rate. The effect of  these  increases

will  be  to increase the present price of  a  pint

bottle of beer by 10 cents and a quart bottle by 20

cents.  It  is  expected that these increases  will

yield about $2.8 millions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax on petrol will be increased from 68 cents

a  gallon  to  73  cents  a gallon  which  is  the

Federation rate of duty. This increase in the  cost

of  petrol  should  cause no  hardship  and  it  is

expected to yield $1.2 millions in a full year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed to increase the rates of

estate  duty.  The rates which are  proposed  are

given  in the Schedule to the Bill, which has  been

tabled  for  a  First Reading today.  Attention  is

invited to certain details of these rates.  In  the

first  place, it is proposed to exempt all  estates

of  under $10,000 from duty. The previous exemption

limit was $1,000.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



The  amount  of  duty collected  from  these  small

estates,  which it is now proposed to  exempt,  was

relatively  small.  The exemption  of  these  small

estates, besides assisting the beneficiaries,  will

result  in  considerable  saving  in  the  work  of

collection  of  duty and allow available  staff  to

concentrate on large estates. Secondly, it will  be

noted  that  the  same form of graduated  scale  as

applies in income tax has been introduced. This has

the  advantage of giving a smoother  curve  in  the

progress  of graduations and obviates the need  for

special  provisions for marginal  relief.  Thirdly,

the  scale provides for an increased rate  of  duty

along the whole range. The effect of this can  only

be  fully  appreciated if the  scale  of  effective

rates,  which is attached to the Bill for  purposes

of  information, is studied. For example, the  rate

of  duty  on an estate of $220,000 was 9 per  cent.

The effective rate under the new scale is 13.98 per

cent.  On estates of $920,000, the old rate was  23

per cent and the effective rate under the new scale

is 31.77 per cent and so on. It has been considered

for  some  time that the existing rates  of  estate

duty,   particularly  in  respect  of  the   larger

estates,  was unduly low and it is considered  that

the  new rates go some way to placing the incidence

of taxation on a proper basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures should yield about $7.5 millions

in a full year. This is likely to go only a part of

the  way  towards  meeting the  1956  deficit.  The

balance, when its size becomes clear, will have to be

met  from  reserves or else covered by  increased

taxation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, therefore, are the budget proposals for 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have shown, our immediate position is

reasonably healthy but the rapid increase  of  both

recurrent and development expenditure means that we

are  faced  with  mounting difficulties  in  future

years.  To  meet  these increased expenditures,  we

shall   have  to  find  increased  resources  since

neither  our  usable reserves nor the possibilities

of  borrowing are unlimited. In these proposals the

Government  is taking the first steps towards  that

increase of our resources and strengthening of  our

future financial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



position.  I  must emphasise that these  are  first

steps  only,  and  further  strengthening  of  the

position will be needed in future years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before closing, I should like to take this

opportunity to thank all those who have assisted in

the  preparation  of  the  Draft  Estimates.  Their

willing co-operation has made the task much  easier

than it would otherwise have been. In particular, I

should  like  to thank Mr I. R.  M.  Willis,  the

Principal  Assistant Secretary, and  Mr  Lan  Ying

Fong, the Estimates Clerk in the Treasury, on whose

shoulders the full weight has fallen.

<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Butterfield (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should like, as a preliminary, to express

my  regret that printed copies of the Bill were not

in the hands of Mem-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>



bers until yesterday. I fully appreciate, Sir, that

it is ordinarily very desirable that Members should

have   a   longer  time  in  which  to  study   the

implications  of  legislation which  is  introduced

into  this Assembly for their consideration; but  I

hope,  Sir,  that  the explanatory  note  which  is

appended to the printed copy of the Bill will  have

been  sufficient to inform Members of  the  purpose

and  the  effect of the amendments  which  are  now

proposed. I venture to hope, Sir that the nature of

those amendments will enable the Assembly to give a

welcome to this measure, a welcome which we on this

side of the House consider that it deserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, as is perfectly clear from the title of

the  Bill, its purpose is to amend the law relating

to  bankruptcy. It is, Sir, a branch of the law  of

which  relatively  few of us have  any  specialised

knowledge and with which most of us are,  I  think,

unfamiliar.  For this reason, Sir, it will  not,  I

hope,  be  out  of place if, in moving  the  Second

Reading  of the Bill, I were to preface my  remarks

with a few rather general observations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it can be stated, with reference to the

existing  bankruptcy  laws of  Singapore - and  I  am

speaking  very generally - that their purpose  is  to

preserve  and  maintain  a fair  and  even  balance

between the debtor who cannot pay his debts and his

creditors,  and  also to maintain  such  a  balance

between  the creditors as amongst themselves.  Now,

Sir,  to  achieve that purpose, a debtor's property

and  his  financial  affairs  are  taken  from  his

control  and  put into the hands of a  manager  and

trustee. Here in Singapore that manager and trustee

is  the Official Assignee, and it is, of course, to

the  Official Assignee that a bankrupt's  creditors

must look for payment of their claims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, this Bill is particularly concerned

with  two  provisions of the Bankruptcy  Ordinance;

the  first  of  those provisions being  that  which

enables  a  creditor to make his debtor a  bankrupt

where  the  debt amounts to $100 or more.  And  the

second of the two provisions with which the Bill is

particularly  concerned, Sir, is that  which  gives

priority to the claims of a bankrupt's employees



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>



in respect of unpaid wages up to a maximum of $250,

where  those  wages  have been earned  within  four

months of the date of the receiving order; that is,

the  order  which makes the Official  Assignee  the

receiver of the property of the bankrupt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the fall in the value of money which

has taken place in recent years, particularly since

the  last  war,  has clearly, in the  view  of  the

Government, made the two provisions to which I have

just  referred obsolete. Accordingly, what  is  now

proposed  by  this amending Bill is, firstly,  that

the sum of $100 to which I have referred should  be

increased to $500. That is effected by clause 2  of

the  Bill.  Putting  it  in another  way,  if  that

amendment becomes part of the law, the position  in

future will be that a debtor must owe a minimum  of

$500  before he can be made a bankrupt, instead  of

$100   as  at  present.  Now,  Sir,  this  proposal

necessitates  a number of consequential  amendments

to  the Bankruptcy Ordinance and those are detailed

in  the  explanatory note to which I have referred,

and  on that account I do not propose to refer  to

them in any detail at this stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second amendment of importance which is

proposed by this Bill is the raising of the  amount

of  an  employee's claim to which priority is given

in  the  distribution  of his  bankrupt  employer's

assets - the raising of his priority claim from  $250

to  $1,000 - and  linked with that  amendment,  Sir - which  is  made  by  clause  5,  the  proposed  new

paragraph  (c)  of  section 43  of  the  Bankruptcy

Ordinance, - is an amendment which gives priority to

wages  earned during the period of five  months  as

against   the   existing  period  of  four   months

immediately  preceding the date  of  the  receiving

order; or - and this is new - during any period of five

months within the twelve months preceding that date

where  the employee's services have been determined

before that date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the opportunity has also been taken, in

drafting this amending Bill, to insert provision to

give priority to income tax in the distribution  of

a  bankrupt's  property; and  a  further  provision

which is included in the Bill is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>



that made by clause 8, which is designed to enable

deductions, which are made from a bankrupt's salary

or  wages for the benefit of his creditors,  to  be

made  in accordance with the scale to be prescribed

by  the  Minister. These deductions, Sir, will,  of

course, remain, subject to variation by the  Court.

This  amendment,  Sir,  is also  considered  to  be

necessary because the existing scale is thought  to

be  out of date by reason of the fall in the  value

of  money which has taken place, particularly since

the war.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I should also refer at this stage, Sir,

to  the  proposal made by clause 5 (ii), the  clause

against   which   there   is   a   marginal    note

"Transitional provisions". With reference to  that,

I  would say very little more than appears  at  the

end  of  the  explanatory note and  merely  content

myself  with indicating that the purpose  of  those

provisions is to provide for the application of the

amendments  relating to preferential  payments,  to

which  I  have referred and which are  proposed  by

clause   5   (i),  to  cases  already   under   the

administration  of the Official Assignee  where  no

dividend  has been declared and no distribution  of

assets  has  begun,  but  that  those  preferential

amendments  should apply on a date to  be  appointed

under the clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think there is very little which I need

add  now in moving the Second Reading. I would like

just  to  say  this: that it is  the  view  of  the

Government that if the Bill is passed, it will go a

long  way towards bringing the Bankruptcy Ordinance

up  to date so far as changes in the value of money

are  concerned, and it will remedy those  parts  of

the  Bankruptcy Ordinance which are in this respect

considered to be obsolete. The amendments proposed,

Sir,  will  improve the position of  employees  who

claim  for wages from a bankrupt employer and  will

also  prevent  the  somewhat  drastic  process   of

bankruptcy being used for debts, which,  by  reason

of  the change in the value of money, are too small

to justify such a course. For these reasons, Sir, I

hope that the measure will be welcomed by all sides

of this Assembly, and I accordingly beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise  to  support the Bill before the House.  We

should do all we can to protect the unfortunate man

who   is  employed  by  a  firm  which  goes  into

bankruptcy. Only too often have we found  that  the

employees of such firms have been thrown  into  the

street  not because of their own fault but  through

adverse  circumstances  over  which  they  have  no

control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only possible argument in my mind that can be

made  against  this motion is that  some  creditors

would  say  we are favouring the employees  at  the

expense  of the creditors, but I do not think  that

this  argument  could hold water.  After  all,  the

creditor  can choose whether he will  or  will  not

give credit to the debtor, whereas the employee  is

not  in  a  position to do so. I therefore  support

this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very

happy  to hear from the Opposition support  for  an

amendment  of this character, and I feel  I  should

like  to  add to what has been said from  practical

experience.  As  a result of my Saturday  sessions,

Sir,  I  have learnt that there are at the  present

moment groups of workers who have been waiting  for

more    than   eleven   months   for   their   pay.

Unfortunately, what has occurred is this - they were

not  paid for several months and finally they  left

of  their  own accord the employment of an employer

who was not paying them; but it took the employer's

creditors  a  number of months before he  was  made

bankrupt and the receiving order was made in May of

this  year,  although  they  themselves  left   his

employment  last December. In those  circumstances,

Sir,  those  poor  people have  not  been  able  to

receive any part of their salary and rank merely as

creditors  to receive pro rata parts of the  assets

of  the firm when it is wound up. I feel, Sir, that

they  are deserving of the sympathy of this  House,

and  I  am  happy to note that this  House  is  not

quibbling  either about the increase from  $250  to

$1,000.  $250 may have been appropriate during  the

time,  Sir, when you could get a cook for  $30  and

$40 a month, but it is hardly appropriate now.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly happy to note that the Assembly

is  not  making any adverse comment in view of  the

short  notice  given.  It is  a  simple  Bill.  Its

urgency  lies  in the fact that there  are  a  fair

number  of  human beings who are suffering  at  the

moment   as  a  result  of  the  workings  of   the

Bankruptcy  Ordinance, and it is  desired  to  give

them redress at the earliest possible moment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provisions of the Companies Ordinance

provisions which correspond to those contained  in

the Bankruptcy Ordinance providing for preferential

payments   to  certain  classes  of  creditor,   in

Sir,   to   those  provisions  of  the   Bankruptcy

Ordinance  when I was moving the Second Reading  of

the amending Bill which was before the Assembly  a

few  moments ago. I think, therefore, there is very

little that I need add to what I have already  said

in that connection in moving this Second Reading. I

therefore  propose, Sir, to say no more than  this: that  this  Bill is complementary to the Bankruptcy

it does is this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency

the Governor's authority to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of

$5,640,872  should  be supplied to  the  Government

under the Heads of Expenditure and for the services

specified in Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 27 of 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An explanation for each item of expenditure

contained  in this message is given in the  Command

Paper.  I  will,  however, be glad  to  answer  any

further questions which Members may care to put.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan:</b> Sir, I second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Item No. 318, Sir. I

believe that the original grant under this head for

1955  was in the neighbourhood of $4 millions.  The

additional  vote  now asked  for  is  close  to  $3

millions,  coming near to the end of the  financial

year. May I ask the Hon. the Financial Secretary if

he would give some explanation of this large sum?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I think that my hon. Friend the Member

for Tanglin (Mr Ede) will recall that sometime  in

November   or  December  last  year  an  offer   of

increased  aid was made to all Chinese  schools  on

the basis of full aid given to English schools. The

Estimates for 1955 had already been framed by  that

time,  and,  speaking  from memory,  I  think  $4.4

millions or $4.5 millions had been entered for  aid

to  Chinese schools. It was then clear that further

sums would be required for grants-in-aid to Chinese

schools,  but  that  the exact  sum  could  not  be

determined  until  such time as we  knew  how  many

schools would apply for full



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>



aid.  At  that time, only 22 schools, if my  memory

serves,  had  applied. I discussed the matter  with

the   Standing   Committee  on   Finance   of   the

Legislative  Council  and  with  the  Director   of

Education,  and it was agreed that  we  would  wait

until we knew what our actual requirements would be

before   taking  a  supplementary  vote.   It   was

estimated that the amount provided in the Estimates

would,  in  all  probability, be  sufficient  until

about  June, depending upon the number of  schools

which applied for full aid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the position is that some 80 schools out of

over  200 schools in the city have applied for aid,

and  this  extra  sum  is  required  to  bring  the

original  provision  up to the amount  required  to

provide that aid to the end of the year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I refer

to  item  No.  314?  Under subhead  24 - launch,  110

feet - provision is required to cover an increase  in

the estimated cost of constructing a vessel for the

Customs  Department. I see a very alarming item  of

$215,000. I would like information, Sir, as to  the

estimated  amount  for the original  cost  of  this

launch, whether this work was undertaken by tender,

or  just on a cost plus basis, and how this  sudden

large increase has been incurred.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The original provision in the Estimates

last year for the cost of this launch was $785,000.

This  was  the  estimated  cost  of  building   and

engining a launch of 115 feet which was required to

patrol  the outer approaches of Singapore, to  keep

station  in  all weathers with ocean-going  vessels

and  shepherd  them  into  Singapore  in  order  to

prevent  opium being dropped from these vessels  in

the  outer approaches. The cost of the vessel  was

estimated  at  $785,000. It could not be  estimated

with   any  greater  degree  of  accuracy   because

detailed  plans  had  not  been  prepared  and  the

precise  type  of  engine  required  had  not  been

decided upon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenders have now been called for the hull, and

orders have been placed for the engines - diesel oil-burning  engines - which will give this launch  the

requisite  speed.  The  cost  of  the  engines  is,

speaking from memory, close on $400,000. As



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>

a result of these tenders, it is now clear that the

provision originally estimated for the cost of  the

hull   and   other   fittings  is   too   low,   by

approximately  $215,000. The  question  whether  we

should continue with the building of this launch in

view  of the increased cost has been most carefully

considered by the Council of Ministers, and it  has

been  decided in all the circumstances of the  case

that it is an essential requirement for Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, item No. 311. I

would  like  to  have  some  particulars  of   this

Regional  Literature Agency and the advantage  that

Singapore will derive out of this Agency.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the officer

in  question came out to Singapore, the Federation,

British  North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei in  order

to study the possibility of the establishment of  a

Regional  Literature Agency. In view  of  the  fact

that  there  is  so  little  vernacular  literature

emanating  from  the  territory,  and  taking  into

consideration our aim for ultimate independence and

the   necessity   for   giving  opportunities   for

appreciating   the  meaning  of  loyalty   to   the

territory  in  question, it was  thought  advisable

that  there should be some effort made to encourage

local authors and local publications. A report  has

been  received  and is under consideration  by  the

respective  Governments. No decision has  yet  been

reached  as to whether the recommendations  of  the

report would be accepted or not, but the matter  is

under active consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may  I  refer  to  item No. 331 which  involves  an

expenditure of $662,545? I would like to  know  how

many  officers are involved in this case  and  from

that   deduce  their  expenditure  per   individual

officer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I regret, Sir, that I cannot say

exactly how many officers are involved. I can  only

say that the Leave Regulations of the Government of

Singapore  do  give  expatriate  officers  of   the

service  an  entitlement to passages for themselves

and  their families once within the normal tour  of

service. Similarly,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>



locally-domiciled  officers  who  go  overseas  for

training  or  on leave are paid from this  vote.  I

cannot  say  how many people have gone overseas  in

that connection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, provision is made in this vote for the

cost  of sending delegates to overseas conferences.

Apart  from  this question of officers  who  go  to

conferences   or   who  are  sent   for   training,

expenditure from this vote is governed by the Leave

Regulations of the territory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the cost of the passages, that is

fixed   by  the  shipping  companies  and   airline

companies who supply the passages, and that is  not

a matter over which we have any control.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Will the Financial Secretary

give us a rough estimate of the proportions between

local and expatriate officers who have enjoyed this

singular privilege?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The great bulk of the vote is spent on

expatriate officers, as one would expect since they

are  entitled,  under their terms  of  service,  to

leave passages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of

$5,640,872  should  be supplied to  the  Government

under the Heads of Expenditure and for the services

specified in Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 27 of 1955.

<div align="center"><b>CONTROL OF IMPORTS AND EXPORTS ORDINANCE, 1950</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Assistant Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

move  the  motion in the name of the  Minister  for

Commerce and Industry, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, this Assembly, in accordance with

subsection  (2)  of  section 1 of  the  Control  of

Imports  and  Exports Ordinance, 1950  (No.  43  of

1950)  resolves that the aforesaid Ordinance  shall

continue in force for a further period of one  year

commencing on the 8th of December, 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Ordinance has been reviewed and its

continuation  approved on four previous  occasions.

Throughout this period, there has been a continuous

relaxation   of  import  and  export  controls   in

Singapore   and   those  now  remaining   cover   a

comparatively narrow field.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Committee, representative of the Chambers of

Commerce   and  the  Singapore  Exchange   Banks

Association, was set up to consider what further

relaxations were practicable. As a result of the

work of this Committee, every control that could

possibly be removed was eliminated. The position

has  now  been reached where nearly all  imports

from  non-dollar  sources are  on  open  general

licence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of licensing is to maintain a

record   of  imports  for  balance  of  payments

reasons.  Rice  is  still  subject  to   special

licensing  to ensure that importers comply  with

the arrangements for turning over the Government

stockpile.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Minister for Education (a) how many students are there at present in Singapore between the ages of 6 and 12; how many children, who have reached the school age, are unable to gain admission through lack of school accommodation next year; and (b) how many students have applied for entry into Form II; the number which can actually be accepted with the present school accommodation; and whether the Government have any plans for those not admitted into Form II.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) (i) It is estimated that the number of children in this six-year age group now in school is 138,900.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) This depends on the number of over-aged children still to be admitted and the number of under-aged children who will be admitted in some schools. There are, however, more than enough places for the children in any one year age group. There will be approximately 50,000 places available in first year primary classes, whereas the number of children aged 6 on 1st January, 1956, is about 40,000 and aged 7 on 1st January, 1956, is about 38,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) (i) 3,998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Approximately 2,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Yes. There is the Trade School at Balestier Road and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> The difficulties and hardships encountered by the old and sick persons who are obliged to call at the Social Welfare Department for relief have been closely studied by this Ministry. The appointment of substitutes to receive allowances at the Social Welfare Department relieves the sick and the aged from the necessity to attend in person. Many persons already take advantage of this facility. In addition payment of Public Assistance Allowances has been undertaken in Pulau Tekong and the Western Islands for all cases regardless of their age or state of health. An experiment in decentralization of payments has been initiated, but to do this on a large scale would place a heavy burden on the public purse, since more staff would have to be engaged to undertake the extra work involved in making the payments and in the maintenance of duplicate records and a more elaborate accounting system. Proposals for extended decentralization will depend to a great extent on the recommendations of the I.L.O. expert on Social Security who has recently arrived in Singapore.
