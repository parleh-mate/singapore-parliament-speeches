<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might also point out Standing Order No. 20 (2) .

called upon the Member who asked the question standing

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The following Question stood in the name of Tun Lim Yew Hock -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. To ask the Prime Minister whether he will make a statement on the talks,

to date, between the Federation of Malaya and the Singapore Government on the

financial arrangements relating to Head 17 (Finance) of Paper Cmd, 33 of 1961.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Ama Keng Village is served by the

Ama  Keng  Postal Agency located at 55A Lim  Chu  Kang

Road  and a mobile post office which makes a  call  at

the village every Monday from 12.20 p.m. to 12.50 p.m.

The  average postal business transacted at the  Postal

Agency  and the mobile post office for a month  is  as

follows:-



<pre>

                Registered Articles        26

                Sales of Stamps         $ 105

                Radio Licences              4

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the very small volume of postal business

there,  it  is  considered that  the  existing  postal

facilities are sufficient to meet the requirements  of

the  area. It is therefore not intended to build a post

office in Ama Keng Village for the time being.

Culture (i)  what is the estimated cost of building the

National   Theatre;   (iii)    what   is   Government's

contribution  towards  the  building  cost;  and  (iv)

whether it is necessary to work over-time and to  what

extent  in  order to complete the National Theatre  on

time.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the total

estimated  cost  of  the National  Theatre,  including

piling  and all necessary equipment, is $2.2  million.

The cost of the building itself is $1.36 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second question, the total

donations  received from the public to date amount  to

$785,671.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the third question, the Government

has  undertaken  to  meet the difference  between  the

total  estimated cost of $2.2 million  of  the  actual

cost of contribution, whichever is the lesser sum, and

the total amount donated by the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the fourth question, it is necessary

to  work overtime not only to enable the Theatre to be

completed  in  time for the South-East  Asia  Cultural

Festival   but  also  for  structural  reasons.   Some

concreting  operations  cannot  be  stopped  until   a

certain   stage  is  reached,  otherwise   the   whole

structure would be weakened. May I also point out that

the  Government does not pay for the over-time. It  is

the  responsibility of the contractor who is committed

to finishing the Theatre by a given specified time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the delegates

from Singapore attending the Afro-Asian Conference  at

Moshi  went on behalf of the Government and the people

of  Singapore,  the  majority  of  whom  have  clearly

indicated  their support far merger and Malaysia.  The

delegates went there because we knew



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



certain pro-Communist delegates were intending to  use

the Conference to move a resolution against Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government paid for the delegates'

expenses  and the Government is proud of their  modest

contribution  towards enlightening  our  non-Communist

and  non-aligned friends in Afro-Asia about  Malaysia.

The  delegation  went  on the  friendly  advice  of  a

neutral   Afro-Asian  country.  The  advice  of   this

friendly  neutral was that Singapore should  not  lose

the  opportunity to tell the truth about  Malaysia  to

the  non-Communist delegation of Afro-Asia  who  would

attend the Conference.

know  whether the Singapore delegation was  officially

invited to the Conference.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore

delegation   did  not  gain  admission  although   the

majority   of  the  delegation  from  the  Credentials

Committee  supported their admission. Because  of  the

unanimity   rule   for   admission,   the   Indonesian

Communists  were  able to frustrate the  will  of  the

majority, and even though they were not admitted,  the

delegation  did  manage,  by  patient  and   intensive

lobbying, to frustrate the anti-Malaysia resolution of

the  Indonesian  Communists. For this,  the  Singapore

delegation  deserves  the  thanks  of  all   patriotic

elements.

to  inform  the House whether they were  invited.  But

<div align="center"><b>CLOSURE OF AIDED AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS FROM</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>JULY, 1959 TO 31ST MARCH, 1963</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. <b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b> asked the Minister for

Education how many aided schools and private schools

have been closed by the Government from July 1959, to

31st March, 1963; of these, how many were (a)  Chinese

schools, (b)  English schools, (c)  Tamil schools and

(d)  Malay schools; and how many teachers have lost

their employment as a result of the closure of these

schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the

period  July 1959 to 31st March, 1963, two Government-aided  and  eight private schools were closed  by  the

Government  on  the  service  of  notices  under   the

provisions  of  the  Education  Ordinance.  1957.  The

breakdown is as follows:-

<pre>

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2 Government-aided schools were unable to comply

with health requirements and therefore were served

with notices of cancellation of registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, 13 other Government-aided schools have had

their grants-in-aid withdrawn for the following

reasons and have ceased to exist:-



<pre>

  7     for being unable to comply with

        health requirements and at the

        request of the school authorities

        themselves that the Ministry would

        post pupils and staff elsewhere;



  1     as a result of split in the Committee

        of Management and at the Supervisor's

        request;



  1     for withdrawal of grant-in-aid as a

        result of the Supervisor's failure to

        carry out a repeated request from the

        Ministry to submit the name of a new

        Principal for approval;



  1     Parents having exercised their preference

        to have their  children continuing

        education in the new Government Chinese

        school at Bukit Ho Swee;



  1     at the request of Principal-cum-Supervisor-

        cum-Manager on account of serious illness;



  1     at the request of both the Supervisor and the

        Principal who could not agree on how to

        administer the school;



  1     where  the Principal persistently refused to

        hand over administration of the school to his

        successor.

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been the policy of -the Ministry to ensure

that  before a Government-aided school is closed down,

whether  for  health reasons or at  the  schools'  own

request, every  pupil is first found  a  place  in  a

nearby  Government  or Government-aided  school.  Also

that  teachers  of  such schools wishing  to  continue

employment   will  be  assisted  to  find   employment

elsewhere  in  other  Government  or  Government-aided

schools. So far only 1 Government-aided school teacher

has not been re-employed but the decision would appear

to  be  his  own,  as he has failed  to  call  at  the

Ministry  and  therefore it is presumed  that  he  has

found  employment  elsewhere or is not  interested  to

continue teaching.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as no public funds are involved in respect

of private schools, the Ministry does not follow up on

the  fate  of teachers when private schools are  dosed

down.

effect from 1st April, 1963.

Economic  rentals  vary  according  to  constructional

costs.

for  228  units from 10th June, 1962 and an additional

120 units from 1st April, 1963. The Singapore Military

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, we have an adequate number of

fiats  to  allocate to Singapore citizens who  require

housing. We have made this arrangement because, as  we

all  know, after 31st August, 1963, the police and the

military  forces  will come under  Central  Government

control.  This is a temporary arrangement  and,  as  I

have  said,  when permanent barracks are fully  built,

they will evacuate from the fiats.

accommodation.  Of  these 290 families,  202  families

eligible  to  receive a rent subsidy  from  Government

funds  of  $7 per person up to a maximum  of  $35  per

family per month for three months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a further measure of assistance, the Housing

Board  relaxed its rules and allowed some families  on

their  request to share three-room flats. Twenty-seven

families  have  been transferred to cheaper  fiats  on

their  request. Other families who have  made  similar

requests   for   transfers  will  have   their   cases

considered  when the one-room flats at Bukit  Ho  Swee

are ready for occupation sometime at the end of July.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was decided at the last sitting of this

Assembly  to adjourn to the 7th of June, i.e.,  today.

But  since then many things have happened; events have

over-taken



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



our  original intention. When the decision  was

taken  to have this present sitting beginning  on  the

7th  of June, information as to the exact date of  the

Malaysia talks in London, at which Singapore  will  be

represented,  was not yet available.  Neither  was  it

then known what vital developments would ensue and how

the  course  of  our negotiations with the  Federation

Government  regarding  financial  arrangements   after

merger would run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last sitting of this Assembly, the inter-governmental discussions between Singapore and the

Federation on the financial terms of merger have  gone

on  and vital issues have come to the fore The date of

31st  of  August for the establishment of Malaysia  is

fast  approaching and there is very little  time  left

between the Malaysia talks in London which will  begin

towards  the end of June. Between now and  that  time,

the  financial arrangements must be finalised.  It  is

because of this that I considered that there would not

he sufficient time to do justice to the Budget debate,

and  on the 24th of May, I requested you, Mr Speaker,

Sir, to agree that in the public interest the Assembly

should be called to sit earlier than the 7th of  June.

I  suggested that arrangements be made for the sitting

of  the  Assembly  on the 29th of May  in  the  public

interest  under Standing Order No. 5. My  application,

however,  was rejected by you. I regretted  that  this

has happened



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



and  this has made the time available  for  inter-governmental discussions even more acutely  short.  In

these  circumstances, it is with regret  that  I  move

this  motion and I hope that this House will bear with

me  in  reducing the number of days set aside for  the

Committee  of Supply. The total time for  the  debate,

however,  has  not been reduced although Members  will

have unfortunately to put up with the inconvenience of

midnight  sessions.  I am moving this  motion  on  the

suggestion that you, Mr Speaker, have conveyed to  me

in reply to my letter of the 27th of May.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before I open up this motion for

debate,  I  would  point  out that  the  Minister  for

Finance has said he regretted the ruling which  I  had

to  make without indicating how he thought the  ruling

was  wrong.  I will therefore cause my ruling* to  be printed in the Official Report.

most  vehemently the motion before the  House,  and  I

want to register our vigorous protest against the high-handed manner in which the Government is treating  the

Opposition. The Government seems to forget that it  no

longer  controls 43 seats in this House. As  such,  it

cannot,  with  impunity, continue  its  arrogant  and

dictatorial  attitude towards the  Opposition.  Today,

this  arrogant, this dictatorial Government a salutary

lesson  that  the  interests of the people  cannot  be

brushed   aside  to  suit  the  convenience   of   the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget time is Opposition time, and the Opposition

will  unitedly  strive  to  zealously  see  that   the

Government is not allowed to encroach on this valuable

Opposition time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now proceed to give the reasons why this

motion  has to be opposed to the bitter end.  Sir,  if

the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



were  not  arrogant,  if it were not  dictatorial,  it

would have followed common parliamentary practice. The

Government,  through  its  Leader  of  the  House,  or

through  its  stand-in as the Leader of the  House - the

Leader  being on a jaunt overseas - should have  invited

the  Opposition for a discussion on the matter  in  an

honest attempt to persuade the Opposition to accept  a

curtailment of their rights under the Standing Orders.

If  such  an  honest attempt had been made,  we  as  a

responsible   Opposition  would  have  signified   our

acceptance if the reasons advanced were legitimate and

irrefutable.  But  no, this arrogant  and  dictatorial

Government  is  above common clay. The Opposition  has

been bullied since the P.A.P. took office in 1959. The

Opposition   can   and   still  should   be   bullied.

Admittedly,  the  Opposition has  gained  strength  in

numbers  to  the  extent of 25  against  25  (and  the

decisive factor is to come from Sembawang where no by-election  has yet been held since the death  of  Inche

Ahmad   bin  Ibrahim  nearly  a  year  ago)  but   the

Opposition is not united because of the difference  in

ideology. With this contention in mind, this arrogant,

this  dictatorial Government blunders on.  I  say  its

arrogant,  its  dictatorial  attitude  on  this  issue

before the House is a blunder, as it will find to  its

cost.  The  Opposition will rise united on this  issue

and   will   crush  this  arrogant,  this  dictatorial

attitude of the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come, Sir, to the correspondence exchanged

between  the Speaker and the Minister for  Finance.  I

quote the reprehensible paragraph of the letter of the

Minister for Finance dated 27th May, 1963:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In these circumstances, I am to state that the

Government  reserves its position on this  matter  and

after  consultation with the Prime  Minister  and  the

State   Advocate-General,  I  may  address  a  further

communication to you.'



<br><br>What  arrogance!  As  I  have said  on  many  previous

occasions,  Sir, despite the fact that the  Government

has  a  Ministry  of  Culture,  P.  A.  P.  Ministers,

Parliamentary Secretaries and Assemblymen know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



not  the  meaning of "culture". We do not care whether

they  have  culture or not, but where  their  lack  of

culture  leads  to  the  commission  of  a  breach  of

privilege,  this  House must take note  and  must  not

allow  such  a  blatant breach to pass unchecked.  The

tone  of  this letter of the Minister for  Finance  is

offensive  and, to us, a clear breach of privilege.  I

refer   to   the   Legislative  Assembly  (Privileges,

Immunities and Powers) Ordinance, 1962, Part V of this

Ordinance  deals with Offences and Penalties.  Section

30 reads, inter alia:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No person shall -

<div align="center"><h4>* * * * *</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) assault, hinder, obstruct or insult the Speaker

or  any  member  coming to  or  going  from  the

Assembly  on  account  of  his  conduct  in  the

Assembly or of anything done or said by  him  in

the Assembly;'.



<br><br>I  emphasise, Sir, "No person shall obstruct or insult

the Speaker on account of anything done or said by him

in the Assembly." Section 30, paragraph (f)  reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No person shall -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) threaten or send a threatening letter to the

Speaker or a member or challenge him to a  fight

on  account of his conduct in the Assembly or of

anything done or said by him in the Assembly;'.



<br><br>I  emphasise again, Sir, "No person shall threaten  or

send a threatening letter to the Speaker on account of

anything done or said by him in the Assembly". I bring

this  up at this time and in this speech just to  show

the Minister for Finance the error of his ways -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Do something about it!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - and that arrogance stems from a

lack  of  culture.  We resent this  obstruction,  this

insult,  this  threat  to  the  Speaker  who  is   the

personification  of this august Assembly,  and  unless

the  Minister for Finance duly sends his apologies for

his detestable conduct, it shall be my bounden duty to

move at the next available sitting of this Assembly  a

motion  to  have  this  blatant  breach  of  privilege

referred to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



the  Committee of Privileges with a view to  upholding

the dignity of this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> You do not have to

wait that long.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, another strong and cogent

reason  why we oppose this motion is this: in December

1961,  this Assembly approved the Estimates containing

a  Vote  on Account for Expenditure for the first  six

months  of  1963 (Paper Command 39 of 1961).  We  took

this  unprecedented step because of the appeal of  the

Minister  for Finance. We accepted his explanation  in

good  faith given to this House on 4th December, 1961,

and  we now find that he has broken faith with us  and

we cannot allow him to continue to hoodwink us. On 4th

December,  1961, he said inter alia, and I quote  from

Hansard, Vol. 15, No. 14, col. 1176:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is important that we in Singapore must not allow

lack  of preparation to hold up the implementation  of

merger  plans  because  of possible  hold-ups  in  the

administrative  machinery. We must not  only  look  at

what is likely to happen in 1962, we must also try  to

visualise events in 1963.'



<br><br>Further down:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government anticipates that the preparation of

a  budget  for 1963 will encounter numerous  technical

problems of details.'



<br><br>Still further down:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The preparation of the budget for the new State of

Singapore,  as a constituent member of the Federation,

will he even more complicated and onerous.'



<br><br>And at col. 1177:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To settle the details of allocation of votes and

revenue   between   State  and   Central   Government,

additional  work  will devolve on `Treasury  officials

and   those   Ministries  affected  by  transfers   of

responsibility,  and it is not likely  that  the  1963

Budget will be ready in time. This may well expose the

Government to criticism. There might even be a loss of

confidence in the administration. For this reason  and

in  fairness to the administration, I will  be  asking

the  House to approve a vote on account for the  first

six months of 1963.'



<br><br>And at col. 1178:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But let me add that the Treasury will, in spite of

the  heavy duties which the administration would  have

to  undertake in the coming months, try to prepare the

estimates  in time. If it can be done, the  Government

would then present these estimates to the Assembly  in

the normal way.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



These,  Sir,  are  the solemn words  he  said  on  4th

December,  1961.  And  now  let  us  examine  them  in

retrospect:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government anticipates that the preparation of

a  budget  for 1963 will encounter numerous  technical

problems of details.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of the budget for the new State of

Singapore,  as a constituent member of the Federation,

will be even more complicated and onerous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To settle the details of allocation of votes and

revenue   between   State  and   Central   Government,

additional work will devolve on Treasury officials...'.



<br><br>These solemn words of the Minister for Finance gave us

the  impression that the 1963 Budget would take  on  a

new  form because (1)  it will be a Budget for the  new

State  of  Singapore as a constituent  member  of  the

Federation,  and  (2)   it  will  contain  details   of

allocation of votes and revenue between the State  and

the Central Government. But what do we see in Cmd.  14

of 1963? These Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure of

the  State of Singapore for the year 1953 take  on  no

new  form.  In  fact, they are in a  less  informative

form.  They  have  not encountered numerous  technical

problems of details, as we were led -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> On a

point  of order, Mr Speaker. We are debating a motion

in  the  name of the Minister for Finance, and it  has

been  very clearly worded down here. The remarks which

have been made by the Member for Cairnhill surely  can

be  aptly  applied when we come to the debate  on  the

Budget statement itself.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It would appear that the Member for

Cairnhill  perhaps is straying away  from  the  motion

itself,  which is a business motion. Those remarks,  I

think,  would be apt when we are debating  the  Budget

statement.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, I am trying to

pin the Government down for causing the delay. If this

Budget  had  been  in  the new  form  and  if  it  had

contained  all the technical difficulties, if  it  had

contained  all  those technical problems,  if  it  had

contained  allocation of votes  and  revenue,  as  the

Government  gave a solemn assurance on  4th  December,

1961,   one  could  have  understood  the   delay   in

presenting this Budget.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



I am trying to point out to this House that this

inordinate  delay  is  inexcusable.  Because   it   is

inexcusable, the Opposition will resist any attempt by

the Government to bamboozle it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we were led to believe, as I said, that this

Budget  would take on a new form because of  "numerous

technical  problems of details". These  Estimates  are

not  more  complicated and onerous as we were  led  to

believe  by  the Minister for Finance on  the  4th  of

December.  1961.  They  do  not  contain  details   of

allocation  of  votes and revenue as we  were  led  to

believe  by the Minister for Finance on 4th  December,

1961.  In short, the explanation given by the Minister

for  Finance on 4th December, 1961, is nothing  but  a

tissue of falsehoods.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> As one who has had considerable

and practical experience of budgetary provisions since

1948,  I can say, without fear of contradiction,  that

these Estimates could and must have been ready at  the

beginning of this year. Why then did the Minister  for

Finance  hold up their consideration until  this  very

last  minute? What kind of a game is he playing?  What

are the stakes?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Billiards!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Assembly was prorogued in

September  1962 and the P.A.P. Government sat  on  its

haunches  until  the  end  of  March  1963,  when  the

Assembly was reconvened. The sitting in March came  to

an abrupt end at 6 a.m. on 10th April, and the Barisan

Sosialis  was  stifled and two of their  motions  were

pushed  down  to this sitting  - a delay of two  months.

Let  me  recount the crimes of the P.A.P.  Government.

For six months there was no sitting of this Assembly -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Ten months.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - and the P.A.P. Government had

their fun at the expense of the Opposition. Then  this

Assembly  was  reconvened at the  end  of  March,  but

sittings  were greatly curtailed. A further  delay  of

two   months  before  the  next  sitting,  i.e.,  this

sitting. Sir, they knew that the 1963 Budget had to be

presented.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



They had the Budget ready at the beginning  of

this  year. Surely they could have fixed a sitting  at

the  end  of  May. They did not do this. Why?  Because

they  are  arrogant;  because  they  are  dictatorial;

because  they are conceited and do not see  that  they

have  decayed to such an extent that the name  of  the

P.A.P. stinks worse than manure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us examine the reasons why the Government

feels  that the motion by the Minister for Finance  is

necessary and in the public interest. The Minister for

Finance  says that he has asked you, Sir,  to  arrange

for  an earlier sitting on 29th May as against the 7th

of June as originally fixed by the Government. Because

his request has been turned down by the Speaker, he is

now  asking  the Opposition to surrender their  rights

which  are protected by the Standing Orders,  so  that

the  P.A.P.  Government can go on their  arrogant  way

without being pulled up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we support the fully considered ruling of the

Speaker.  Had  he  ruled  otherwise  and  allowed  the

arrogant  P.A.P.  Government to have  its  dictatorial

way,   the  Opposition  might  have  been  forced   to

challenge the Speaker's ruling. Fortunately  for  this

House  and  for  Singapore, we have  a  Speaker  whose

independence  is unassailable. Sir, the  Minister  for

Finance says in his letter to the Speaker on 24th  May

that - and this is really laughable:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... there have been a number of vital developments in

connection    with    Malaysia    which    necessitate

finalisation  of  the  Federation/Singapore  Financial

Talks as soon is possible to enable the Malaysia Talks

to be held in London at the end of June. The timing of

these  talks  was  unknown when the  Government  first

arranged the Budget time-table.'



<br><br>"The  timing  of  these talks was unknown",  says  the

Minister  for Finance. Is it? We know. The  people  of

Singapore  know. In fact, the people of the  whole  of

Malaysia know that the talks in London will have to be

held at the latest in June if Malaysia is to come into

being  on  the  31st  August.  But  according  to  the

Minister  for  Finance, the P.A P. Government  do  not

know. Who is going to believe this? We are not. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



Federation/Singapore   financial   talks   have   been

protracted.  All  this is due to  the  Prime  Minister

playing  a  game  of his own - to try to gain  political

credit  for  something which is not true. I  wil1  not

speak  at length on this aspect of the financial talks

as  I  have a motion on the Order Paper, and I do  not

want  to  anticipate a debate, which  is  contrary  to

Standing Orders. I have a question on the Order  Paper

on Questions for Oral Answer asking the Prime Minister

whether  he  will  make  a  statement  today  on   the

financial  talks. The Prime Minister was not  here  to

give the answer. Sir, it has been the practice of  the

P.A.P. Government -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think, in fairness to the

Prime  Minister,  I  did  inform  the  House  that  my

information was that he is indisposed.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it has been the practice of

the  P.A.P.  Government to order  their  Parliamentary

Secretaries  to  answer questions on behalf  of  their

Ministers.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And to write letters.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> But there was no statement on this

question because the Parliamentary Secretary  was  not

ordered in this particular instance. Even the Minister

for  Finance was silent on a very important aspect - the

financial talks with the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would seem to me that the Prime Minister is

avoiding  the  issue, and I say that his absence  from

this Chamber is due to his fear of being confronted by

me  on this vital issue Although the P.A.P. is fond of

indulging in confrontation so long as confrontation is

to its credit, in this particular case, there is a lot

of  debit,  and  the  Prime  Minister  is,  therefore,

suffering from a diplomatic illness. May he  get  well

quickly and be up to his tricks again! May he be  here

on  Monday,  the 10th of June, to answer  my  Question

postponed by me to that date under Standing Order  20,

paragraph (2).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his letter to the Speaker dated 27th May,

the  Minister for Finance discloses that  his  request

for an earlier sitting is to enable the Prime Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



and him to attend the Malaysia talks in London. Is the

presence of the Minister for Finance really necessary,

especially  as  the Prime Minister has  already  taken

upon  himself  to  deal  with  financial  matters   as

evidenced  by the statements of the Prime Minister  on

the  Federation / Singapore financial talks,  and  the

Minister for Finance is just a silent partner  in  the

wake  of  His Master's Voice, known the world over  at

one  time as H.M.V. with a picture of a gramophone and

a dog sitting silently and obediently listening to His

Master's  Voice?  Sir,  is  it  right  for  the  Prime

Minister to attend the talks in London as he  has  not

yet  received a mandate from this House on the details

of  merger? He calls it merger. But I call it  nothing

but  a  closer association in a sort of confederation.

Sir,  the  Prime Minister did promise this House  that

such  details will be fully debated in this House,  or

is this another form of P.A.P. twist and double talk?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want it to be placed on record that the Prime

Minister  and  the Minister for Finance - that  is,  the

P.A.P  Government   - have no right  to  participate  in

talks  in  London until they get a mandate  from  this

House  to  finalise details on merger, especially  now

that  the  P.A.P.  Government does not  have  a  clear

majority in this House and is even afraid to fight out

the decisive issue at Sembawang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Budget time is Opposition time, and that is why

the rights of the Opposition are protected by Standing

Orders. Seven clear days' notice for the debate on the

Budget  Statement is laid down in the Standing  Orders

to  enable the Opposition to make a detailed study  of

the Budget Statement and a detailed examination of the

Estimates  in  relation to the Budget  Statement.  The

motion  of the Minister for Finance not only  deprives

the  Opposition of this detailed study and examination

of  an  important  issue affecting the  lives  of  the

people  but it also requires the Opposition to  submit

amendments  for debate in the Committee of  Supply  by 12.30  p.m. tomorrow. A detailed examination  of  the

Estimates  is usually carried out in relation  to  the

Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance, and even

if we the Opposition Members burn the midnight



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



oil   tonight,   we  cannot   adequately   and

effectively look after the interests of the people  in

so  far  as the 1963 Budget is concerned, and we  will

resist to the bitter end this arrogant and dictatorial

attempt by the Minister for Finance to choke us off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the Standing Orders, we are to have five

days  allotted for the Committee of Supply. The motion

limits  this to three days, and while it is  true,  as

mentioned  by the Minister for Finance in  his  speech

just  now,  that the extended time up to  12  midnight

each  day being asked for in the motion is to make  up

for  the  loss of two sitting days, this is an attempt

to  wear out the Opposition and to deny the Opposition

proper   facilities   to   prepare   criticisms    and

observations on the Estimates. We do not mind  sitting

up  to  midnight every day, or even right up  to  6.00

a.m., as happened during the last sitting, but what we

do  mind is this. We are denied the facilities to make

a  detailed  study and to prepare our  criticisms  and

observations  on  the  amendments  which  have  to  be

submitted  for discussion in the Committee of  Supply.

It must not be overlooked that the adjournment at 8.00

p.m. will provide the facilities which will be denied

us if the Assembly adjourns at 12.00 midnight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his letter to the Speaker on 24th May, the

Minister for Finance is prepared to have the  17th  of

June  as  the  last allotted day for the Committee  of

Supply,  and yet in his motion now before  the  House,

the  last allotted day is fixed for the 14th of  June.

Why  this change of mind? To me, this means that since

the  Minister  for Finance is going to be  hanged,  he

does  not  mind how he is to be hanged. The Opposition

is  aroused  and furious, and we are out to  hang  the

Government constitutionally and declare that they  are

well and truly buried.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because of this unity in the Opposition against

this   dictatorial  and  arrogant  attitude   of   the

Government, it makes it necessary for me to draw  your

attention to the practice of pairing off. I understand

the  Member for Bras Basah will not be able to  attend

Assembly sittings for some time, and I also can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



understand the feeling of the Barisan Sosialis  to  go

to  the Government and ask for a pairing off. Inasmuch

as  the  Government  will  never  go  to  the  Barisan

Sosialis for a pairing off, they always come to us. I,

as a Member of the Opposition, feel that that enforced

absence from the Assembly should be paired off by  the

Government.  If they have had sufficient  training  in

culture by their Minister for Culture, they would have

no  doubt undertaken to pair off on their own. But  if

the  Government do not offer to pair off  against  the

enforced absence of a Member of the Opposition, we  in

the  Alliance give this declaration to the Government:

at no time will we pair off any more with the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is rather

curious that the Member for Cairnhill should now  talk

of  trying to bury the P.A.P. constitutionally. If the

S.P.A. had  followed  an  anti-colonial   line   and

consistently  and  persistently carried  on  an  anti-colonial   fight,  there  would  not  have  been   the

necessity of debating this motion today. He  talks  of

accepting the word of the Finance Minister in 1961 and

says  that  the  Minister for Finance has  now  broken

faith  with  him.  How? As far as I  can  see,  it  is

because they both are now trying to fight for the same

piece  of  bone. That is all. It is their own inherent

contradiction, both trying to fight for the support of

the  masses  which they do not have. After  all,  what

does  the  S.P.A. think the P.A.P. will do?  Does  the

S.P.A. think that the P.A.P. will allow the Member for

Cairnhill  to  become  a member of  the  Cabinet?  The

Member  for Farrer Park might be taken in, because  he

has  been  seen  to  be  very chummy  with  the  Prime

Minister.  Anyway, Sir, it was the Member  for  Cairnhill  who  had  somersaulted  in  the  debate  on  the

Referendum  Bill  thus allowing  the  P.A.P. to  push

through  that Bill, rig the referendum and dishonestly

and  undemocratically force the people  to  chose  the

White  Paper.  It  is  always  good  to  talk  of  the

Opposition  rising in united action, but I would  like

to remind the S.P.A. that it is rather late in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



the day to think of things like this. They should have

thought  of  this long ago when we fought against  the

phoney   merger  and  when  we  fought   against   the

dishonest, sham referendum. And we might add -



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> On a

point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, you ruled once that there

should be no reference to the term "phoney merger".  I

think  the long recess has affected the memory of  the

Member for Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think I have ruled time and again

that matters which have gone through this Assembly and

have been agreed to by the Assembly cannot be referred

to in disrespectful terms.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I apologise, Sir. Possibly that

is  because  of my having been forced to stay  in  the

Central Police Station lock-up for three days and  the

Remand  Prison  for  seven days  by  the  undemocratic

P.A.P.  The  P.A.P. does not allow the individual  any

freedom in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I just want to remind the Member

for  Cairnhill  that  he  is  now  attacking  his  own

economic adviser of days gone by.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> What are you doing now?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We attack everybody who is

fighting for the colonialists.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You are fighting Soekarno!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The P.A.P. today, of course, is

in  a  great hurry to rush through this Budget because

it  knows  that  there are a lot of skeletons  in  the

cupboard  that will be disclosed and it does not  like

and  does  not  wish the people to see  all  of  them.

[Interruption] You can see, from the way the  Minister

for  Finance yawns in this Chamber, the disrespect  he

pays to this august Assembly. But, of course, that  is

nothing unusual. The manners of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>



Minister for Finance have been adequately expressed in

the letters that he sent to you, Sir,I do not think I

need  add  anything to that. From a normal adjournment

period  of  at least seven clear days, the P.A.P. now

wants  to  telescope this period into one of only  two

days,  because, if we leave out Sunday, it means  only

Saturday  and Monday. As has already been pointed  out

by the Member for Cairnhill, this is unprecedented not

only  in  the  history of Singapore but  also  in  the

history of all the parliamentary institutions  in  the

whole  world.  And, of course, it  is  only  with  the

P.A.P. that  we can get such unprecedented  practice.

But  I will enlarge on this later. Actually, according

to  the  suggestion put forward by you.  Mr  Speaker,

there should have been a debate on the 17th after  the

Budget  Statement  by the Finance  Minister.  Now  the

Finance Minister wants to make it the 11th. The  hours

too  have been similarly rushed. From the normal hours

it  has been extended to 12.00 midnight. That will, of

course,  give no facilities and time to the Opposition

to  carefully study and prepare for the  work  of  the

morrow.  This telescoping of the Budget debate,  which

took  10  days  in 1961, into just three days  further

adds  to the difficulties of the Opposition in  giving

an effective and detailed study of the Budget in order

to  expose  all the things which the P.A.P. hopes  to

hide and cover.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see what the hurry is. According to the

P.A.P.,  it  is because it wants to keep a time-table,

and  according  to what the Minister for  Finance  has

said,  many things have happened and many vital issues

have  cropped up. For what? In order that  the  P.A.P.

may  hand Singapore over to the Federation lock, stock

and barrel, on time, ignoring completely the wishes of

the  people  and not giving them any chance whatsoever

to  have a debate even on the Budget, something  which

concerns  every person in Singapore? Why  should  this

time-table  be  the  end  of June?  The  Minister  for

Finance talks of the 31st of August. Does he not  know

what  is happening now as a result of the Tokyo talks?

Does he not know that the Manila talks



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



mean no 31st of August? Does he not know that?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The whole world is talking of the

postponement of Malaysia. However much the Prime

Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister of the

Federation may insist on the 31st of August, it looks

as if circumstances will force them to agree to a

postponement, and the British themselves will

similarly be forced to agree because it affects their

interests too. They would rather cut their losses by

postponing Malaysia. And where does the P.A.P. come

in? The P.A.P. hopes to go through this so-called time-table in order to have a chance to take an extra trip

to London. It has been using the money of the

taxpayers for a long time, going on trips here and

there! It knows that after a certain date it will not

even have a chance to go to the Federation with the

taxpayers' money. I do not have to refer very much,

Sir, to the correspondence between you and the

Minister for Finance. I think the Member for Cairnhill

has already dealt with it adequately. But I wish to

say this, Sir,I wish to congratulate you, Mr

Speaker, Sir, for not having knuckled down to the

arrogance of the P.A.P. If you had been -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am getting a bit anxious about

the  Speaker being dragged into this debate a bit  too

much.  I  cannot prevent hon. Members from  mentioning

the  correspondence between me and  the  Minister  for

Finance.  But I would not like epithets to  be  thrown

around and a debate entered into on my ruling.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There was no such intention, Sir.

But this correspondence serves to throw new light on

the affairs of the State of Singapore. It is very

rarely that you see a civil servant daring to answer

back, so to speak, a Minister of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance talks of "crucial difficulties" and how the P.A.P. will have to iron out these difficulties in order to keep to its time-table in June. Why should the P.A.P. now try to give

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>



the   impression  that  it  is  trying  to  serve  the

interests of the people of Singapore? In hoping to win

the  support of the people of Singapore, it now  wants

to  play tough, and to give the appearance that it has

the  interests of the people at heart. But what is the

use  of talking of finance alone when the whole  thing

has  been  handed  over  to the  Federation?  You  are

talking  of  scratching your toes and feet  when  your

head  is already in the noose. If you want to get  rid

of  these difficulties, the only way is to get rid  of

the  White Paper. You will then he really going to the

root  of  the problem and dealing with the essence  of

the  matter.  Once political control has  been  handed

over  to the Federation, all talk of financial control

is  mere  humbug. And in spite of the Prime Minister's

assurance  on  financial  control,  the  Minister  for

Finance has already indicated that he does not want to

fight for financial control and according to -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is the hon. Member not going

into too much detail? We do not want a debate on these

financial  talks  yet. The debate will  arise  on  the

motion  filed  by the Member for Cairnhill,  that  is,

item 20.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I merely touch on it in passing,

Sir,In  fact, when it comes to that motion,  I  will

have  a  lot to say. Now I just want to say  that  all

this  talk  about  control is  nonsense,  because  the

Minister  himself  has  already  said,  "What  is  the

difference  of a couple of millions between  friends?"

All this is a play staged for the purpose of trying to

gain  popular  support. I do not wish to  touch  on  a

couple  of  points which the Member for Cairnhill  has

already  dealt with, namely, that it is not  necessary

that  the  Minister for Finance and the Prime Minister

be  present  when we discuss the Budget  Statement  or

debate  the  Budget in detail because - on  a  previous

occasion I did mention this - the whole Government  does

not  depend on one or two Ministers. And you yourself,

Sir,   have  pointed  out  that  there  is  collective

responsibility  of the Cabinet in the  Government.  Of

course, Sir, I must also remind the Ministers opposite

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



we  have  had no sitting from the middle of July  last

year,  except  for a few-hour affair  on  the  5th  of

September, until the end of March this year,  and  for

the  P.A.P. to insist on guillotining our debate  only

shows   what  it  really  thinks  of  the  Legislative

Assembly.  We said at that time when the Assembly  was

recalled that this was due to public pressure. But, of

course, the Prime Minister countered and said that  it

was not so. It was partly due to the insistence of the

Member   for   Cairnhill.  And  mainly   because   the

Government had to endorse the constitutional agreement

between Singapore and the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this proves one very important point, that the

P.A.P. considers the role of the Legislative Assembly

to be nothing hut a tool of the P.A.P. The Assembly is

merely to serve the P.A.P. to pass and endorse motions

which  the P.A.P. wants to pass and nothing  else.  If

the P.A.P. considers it not necessary to pass any law,

any  regulation or any motion, then the Assembly  need

not  even  he  recalled. This alone  proves  that  the

P.A.P. has   never  really  intended   to   practise

parliamentary democracy in Singapore. In fact, in this

way,  the P.A.P. is doing its very best to ensure that

the   people   of   Singapore  are   not   given   the

opportunities   and   facilities  for   constitutional

struggle  and  practise parliamentary  democracy.  You

will remember, Sir, that debate of the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara's  Speech was guillotined to a mere one  and  a

half days. Our motions on the February 2nd arrests and

the   inhuman  and  barbaric  treatment  of  political

detainees were not given a chance of a full and public

debate.  At  that time, the Prime Minister  said  that

because  he had to go to the Federation for  important

financial talks and that, because of the importance of

those  financial talks, therefore, the Assembly debate

had  to be cut short. But unfortunately for the  Prime

Minister,  following the quarrel with the M.C.A.,  Mr

Tan  Siew Sin, the Finance Minister of the Federation,

revealed  that the Prime Minister merely  went  up  to

play  golf. He had never attended any of the financial

talks. Sir, this is a very important point because  it

means that the Prime Minister was not telling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



the  truth.  May I remind you, Sir, of this  morning's

newspapers?  There  you  will  see  that  the  British

Minister  for  War said he did not tell the  truth  in

Parliament; and consequent on that, the comment of all

the  newspapers in London is that lying in  the  House

"hits at the roots of government" and that it "reduces

the  public trust in Parliament". Of course, with  the

P.A.P. in power, with its disregard of Standing Orders

and  its  Fascist way of going about things, there  is

already no trust in the Assembly. The only question  I

want  to  raise  is  this.  Will  the  Prime  Minister

similarly  have the courage to resign as the  Minister

for War in England has done?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is all this relevant to the

motion before us? Let us come back to the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> No more ghost writers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is very

relevant because we want the Ministers to speak the

truth -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, that is very desirable, but is

that relevant to the Business Motion which we are

debating?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is relevant this way, Sir.

That  they are giving excuses again, and who is  going

to  believe  anything they say? They  can  say  it  is

because of this or that. But who can ever say that  he

will believe the P.A.P. Ministers for what they say in

this  House?  If  the Prime Minister cannot  tell  the

truth  in  this  House, what can you expect  from  his

minions? I think I might add here, Sir, that theirs is

hardly a practice of parliamentary democracy. You will

remember, Sir, that in the Executive Committee of  the

C.P.A.,  we,  the  main Opposition  Party,  have  been

denied a chance -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have always insisted that as

far  as  the  C.P.A. is concerned, it  must  be  above

politics and elections are on that basis. Although the

results  might  prove  otherwise,  there  can  be   no

criticism  of  what  the C.P.A. does  on  a  political

platform.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will leave that then, Sir. But

what  are the real reasons for this motion? The Member

for Cairnhill has already mentioned the whole idea  of

this  guillotine. Telescoping of time-tables is  meant

to  deny us in the Opposition sufficient time to  deal

adequately and effectively with all the points we wish

to raise in the Budget. It denies us adequate time for

detailed  study  of  the Budget.  Thus  they  hope  to

prevent  the  Opposition  from  further  exposing  the

P.A.P. But in spite of all that they may do, we  shall

unravel and expose to the public gaze of the people of

Singapore what the P.A.P. has been trying to hide from

them.  Budget  time is Opposition time,  as  has  been

explained by the Member for Cairnhill, but the  P.A.P.

wants to make it Government time. It wants to give  us

the  minimum  time possible and in so  doing  makes  a

mockery  of all the tenets of parliamentary  democracy

that  we have in Singapore. There is a moral, a lesson

in  what  has  happened today, Sir, and  that  is,  in

Singapore  at  the present moment, there  is  no  such

thing as the rule of law. The P.A.P., in fact, is  the

law. As I have mentioned in the television forum,  the

P.A.P. is  the  court,  is the  law,  is  everything.

Because of the arrogance -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Since we have not come to the

Estimates and we are not discussing the provision  for

the   Television  service,  perhaps  the   Member   is

anticipating  future discussions.  This  is  a  motion

which has nothing to do with television.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon. Member for Queenstown

is  just mentioning that in passing to illustrate  his

point,  but  I  hope he does not go into details.  Dr

Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No, Sir, I have no intention of

so  doing. I only wanted the House to draw a moral,  a

lesson,  from this. The P.A.P. is always arrogant  and

undemocratic   and   always  resorts   to   the   most

undemocratic methods in all that it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



does. The law, as it stands in Singapore, today serves

only  the  P.A.P.  If according to  the  Minister  for

Finance,  it  becomes an encumbrance or  a  hindrance,

then,  of  course, the law goes. And the will  of  the

P.A.P. must be imposed regardless of all the  rulings

and  the reasonable and legitimate opposition of other

people.  The P.A.P., of course, thinks only of  P.A.P.

interests,  personal and sectional  interests  of  the

P.A.P.,  and not of the interests of the people.  This

is  Fascism in the raw and I would like to remind  the

P.A.P.   Ministers   that   merely   legalising   some

undemocratic  act does not make that  act  democratic.

And even if it should legally push through this motion

and  guillotine  our debate, that does  not  make  the

motion democratic in any way. It is still Fascism  and

I  would ask the P.A.P., before it completely gets out

of  the  political stage in Singapore, not to  further

sully the good name of this House by insisting on such

undemocratic ways.



<br><br>4.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is

easiest  to dispose of the points brought  up  by  the

Member  for  Queenstown, because, for the  most  part,

what  he had to say has nothing to do with the  motion

before   the  House  but  reads  something  like   the

ramblings  heard  from  the psychoanalyst's  couch.  I

quite  understand his predicament, because not  having

any   more  the  experienced  and  intelligent   ghost

writers, he just had to have a rehash of the collected

works  of  the Member for Queenstown which  have  been

accumulating in this Assembly for the last two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is a simple one, Sir. As the Minister for

Finance has indicated, we have to finish this business

of the Budget within a specific time, because, through

no  fault  of  our  own,  the negotiations  have  been

protracted,  and it is necessary for the Minister  for

Finance  and the Prime Minister to be in Kuala  Lumpur

to  finalise  the  merger talks. We did  not  set  the

dates.  Negotiations  went  on,  we  could  not  reach

agreement,  and it is essential that the Minister  for

Finance indicate that the talks should be concluded in

time for the necessary instruments to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



signed in London by the end of this month. I can quite

understand  the  Member for Queenstown  relishing  the

prospect of something happening to delay the talks  in

London,  because the Barisan Sosialis attitude towards

these  talks,  towards Malaysia, is now  dependent  on

salvation  from  outside. They  always  say  yes,  the

international  situation  is  going  to  ensure   that

Malaysia  and merger will not come about as prescribed

on  31st  August. So if anything can  happen  in  this

Assembly  to make that possible, to postpone or  delay

the  signing  of  the  terms, the federation  and  the

signing of the instruments in London, he would be only

too  happy.  He hopes some extraneous intervention  or

accident  would  help  to  postpone  our  reaching   a

settlement on the basis of the White Paper and getting

Malaysia through by 31st August.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Cairnhill, it is quite

obvious, Sir, what has been happening during the  past

few  weeks and I was not at all surprised that he  has

begun  his election campaign. The whole of his  speech

was  not bent on answering the legitimate points which

were  brought up by the Minister for Finance.  He  was

saying,  "Dictatorial P.A.P.!" Apparently there  is  a

funeral parlour in Cairnhill because he is talking  of

burying  the P.A.P., and generally spreading  euphoria

among  his  own followers. Incidentally,  they  are  a

little bit despondent themselves, because, as far as I

can gather, though the Grand Alliance has been formed,

the  Member for Cairnhill has not been able to get any

entree  and therefore he has decided in this  Assembly

to  espouse  the  cause of certain  gentlemen  in  the

Federation  who  have  other reasons  for  wanting  to

change  the  White Paper. Therefore, the plea  of  the

Member  for Cairnhill is that this Government  has  no

moral   right  either  to  conclude  talks  with   the

Federation  Government or to go to London, because  he

feels  that  he  would  like,  in  some  way,  to   be

associated  with what he knows is inevitable;  but  he

and  his  now united front colleague, the  Member  for

Queenstown, have for different reasons an interest  in

these   talks  which  are  essential  for  the  future

security of the people of Singapore and the Federation

of  Malaysia.  These talks are far more important  and

essential for the safety and welfare



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



of  Singapore, and therefore they have to get priority

over any other thing. That has been the basis on which

we  have worked during the past two years, and because

the  time-table and schedule is not determined by  us,

we   have   therefore   put   forward   a   reasonable

proposition.  Since  we have to carry  on  with  these

talks,  we  therefore bring forward this motion  which

extends  the sittings up to midnight. It  is  true  it

inconveniences the Opposition but it gives them  about

the  same length of time to discuss the Budget as they

would have if they had the other proposal of extending

the  period  by a couple of days, which would  however

postpone  the more urgent talks over the White  Paper,

which  the Minister for Finance and the Prime Minister

will have to carry out with the Federation authorities

and officials if we are to meet the London date-line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can assure them, therefore, that though the

Member  for  Cairnhill  now echoes  another  gentleman

outside the shores of Singapore and suggests that  all

this  is  because the Prime Minister dare not confront

him,  obviously  the  "Superman from  Cairnhill",  the

"Tarzan  from Cairnhill", suddenly from being  "Mickey

Mouse", thinks he has now become "Superman" -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Mighty Mouse!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - and therefore Ministers are afraid

to  confront him. I can assure him that if  the  Prime

Minister's sore throat - and that is the real reason

for his absence - has been cleared by then, there will

be   not  only  confrontation  with  the  Member   for

Cairnhill  but also it is more likely that the  Member

for  Cairnhill  would wish that he had  not  made  the

rather silly challenges he made here. I can assure him

that the Prime Minister will be here to deal with  the

rather interesting motion which is here in his name. I

do  not  wish to anticipate that debate, but  I  would

suggest  to  the Member for Cairnhill  that  there  is

nothing  undemocratic in asking the Opposition Members

to debate until 12 midnight rather than in closing the

debate at 8 p.m. and resuming it the next day.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown was also complaining that

this  was  not  democracy. The last  Assembly  sitting

finished on a rather melodramatic note when the Member

for Queenstown talked for something like twelve hours.

Sir,  where  in  the  world is  an  Opposition  Member

allowed  to  woolgather  in the  Assembly  for  twelve

hours?  Yet  the  Members showed such  great  patience

that, not wishing to disturb him in his flow of words,

they kindly went outside the Chamber and slept it off.

I  say,  Sir,  there is considerable  democracy  here.

Democracy means allowing anybody to say what he  likes

for as long as he likes. There is nothing undemocratic

in  this  motion, though I would concede  that  it  is

inconvenient.  I say, however, that that inconvenience

is  small compared to the more vital task before  this

Government  of seeing that the White Paper  terms  are

speedily concluded and that the necessary agreement is

reached in time for the talks in London.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the Member for Queens-town and the

Member for Cairnhill have announced a new united front

on  the  basis that if they do not hang together  they

are  going  to  hang  separately. So  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  has  called  for  a  united  front  of  the

Opposition,   much   to   the   amusement   and    the

consternation of the Member for Queenstown. Let me ask

the Member for Cairnhill what would he say to this - we

can go on debating the Budget for as long as he likes,

but  that  would  mean unnecessary delay  in  reaching

agreement on the talks over the White Paper.  Contrary

to  what the Member for Cairnhill has indicated,  that

we  are somehow protracting the talks, it will he made

clear,  when  the  facts, figures  and  documents  are

produced and when we debate his own motion, where  the

delay  is and who is responsible for it; whether  they

are  his friends on whose behalf he speaks here today,

or whether the delay is on our side. Let me assure the

House,  but not the Barisan Sosialis, of this, because

they  want  to  see  how  they  can  stop  merger  and

Malaysia. If they can do something here to delay that,

they  will  be only too happy to summon their  friends

outside  this  country who have  tried  very  hard  to

postpone  Malaysia. But even they have now to  concede

that although they still oppose Malaysia, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



are  not  going  to  halt Malaysia.  That  is  a  very

depressing outlook for the Barisan Sosialis. We say to

the  Opposition Members that though we regret, and  we

admit  that,  we have inconvenienced them by  adopting

this  procedure, it is not because we want to  or  are

afraid  to  discuss  for one or  two  more  days,  but

because the time-table is such that we have no  choice

but  to  proceed  as indicated in the  motion  of  the

Minister  for Finance. I beg therefore to support  the

motion.



<br><br>4.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the effect of the motion

which the Minister has moved is that, firstly, it will

shorten   the  time  for  the  study  of  the  Budget.

Secondly,  it will shorten the time for the debate  on

the  Estimates,  and, thirdly, Sir,  but  not  in  the

least,  it  will  lessen  adverse  publicity  for  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so far the reasons advanced for shortening the

debate on the Estimates is that the Prime Minister and

the  Minister  for  Finance will have  to  go  to  the

financial  talks  and that the timing  of  the  London

talks  is  such that a shorter sitting of the Assembly

is required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, I would like to say that these

are reasons advanced merely to provide a cover, in the

same fashion as various reasons have been provided for

all  their undemocratic and dictatorial acts. I wonder

whether    the   Government   Members   realise    the

implications of what they say. If they are saying that

because  the  Minister  for  Finance  and  the   Prime

Minister have to be away, they are not able to sustain

the debate on the Estimates: they are, in fact, saying

that insofar as the Government is concerned, there are

only two men Who are capable of sustaining the debate.

Surely the Minister for Finance is not suggesting that

all the other Ministers, the Parliamentary Secretaries

and  the  hack-benchers of the P.A.P. are  incompetent

nincompoops!  They are not suggesting that  there  are

only  two  men  who have to carry the  burden  of  the

Government,  who have to be present here  to  transact

Government business



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



and  that all the others are "passengers", incompetent

and incapable of looking after Government affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is the simple implication of a motion of

this nature. We do not believe the Government was  not

aware  of the timing of the talks. This is yet another

example  of  P.A.P. dishonesty.  As  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  has pointed out, the Government  had  ample

opportunity  to  present these Estimates  long  before

now,  but  they  waited  for no  reason  at  all.  The

Estimates   are  being  presented  at   this   moment,

according to them, two months before Malaysia; and  on

the  pretext of hurry, urgency, they want to deny  the

Opposition their rightful time for a proper debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we oppose this motion because we know that this

is  yet  another example of the manner  in  which  the

P.A.P. Members have been conducting themselves in  the

Assembly. This is just another example of the  conduct

of  a Government which claims to defend the democratic

system.  If  it  were  an exception,  it  would  be  a

different matter. I am sure everybody in Singapore and

every Member in this House knows that this is not  the

first  time  the  Government  has  attempted  to  curb

debates  by  introducing motions of this  nature.  The

speech  of  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  was  a  good

example.  The  debates on the Address  normally  lasts

about  a  week;  we had only about a day.  The  motion

moved  by  the  Member for Queenstown on  the  arrests

carried  out  in  February was forced  to  be  debated

within  a  short time and at a time when the publicity

which  had  been adverse to the Government  was  at  a

minimum. There are many other examples, Sir, which  we

have  witnessed from time to time; and far from  being

an  exception, it has become the rule of the  day  for

the  P.A.P.  They  hope that by virtue  of  the  small

majority  and  the  strength that they  have  in  this

Assembly, they could from time to time move guillotine

motions - motions that will mean the Opposition has less

time  or no time at all to bring out the dirt  of  the

Government, that will prevent exposures being made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure we all remember how eloquently the

Prime Minister has talked



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



about confrontation. One of his favourite acclamations

is  that the Government fear no open debate. I suggest

that  the reason why today they are trying to  prevent

the  Opposition from sufficiently exposing them in the

debate  on  the  Estimates  is  that  they  fear  open

debates.  Only recently there was a very good  example

of  the  P.A.P.'s courage to meet us in  open  debate.

They   turned  down  an  invitation  by  the   Nanyang

University Social Science Society for a forum. All the

P.A.P. representatives   were   not   there.    Open

confrontation!  They only dare have it perhaps  within

the confines of Radio Singapore. Even there, Sir, they

do  not suggest as many forums as they did once.  They

have  turned  down an invitation by the University  of

Malaya Socialist Club for a forum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are some of the recent examples. There

have been examples of banning of rallies, because they

fear that we will inform the people of things and acts

of  this  Government which will be  adverse  to  their

political interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have the newspapers gagged. Men who claim to

welcome  open  debate have the newspapers  gagged  and

have got them to play down Opposition views which  are

adverse to the P.A.P. interest, and play up Government

views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I suggest that the attempt which is being made

now  in this Assembly is in the same way motivated  by

fear  of the Government of open debate. Sir, to  them,

open confrontation means, tie the giant down in chains

and  then they come in as heroes. We tell them to have

the  basic courage necessary for a man. Play the  game

according  to  the  rules. If we are  given  the  same

rights and privileges that they give themselves, in no

time people like the Minister for Culture will have to

go  back  to his rubber estate somewhere in  Seremban.

Perhaps the Minister for Finance will have to go  back

to his stock-broker company business, and the Minister

for Education to his insurance company business. There

will be no P.A.P. then, and perhaps the Prime Minister

will be at number 10-B Malacca Street.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No. 10 Downing Street!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> No. 10-B Malacca Street, not Downing

Street.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not given these basic rights because

they know that if we are given these rights which  are

fundamental to us - rights and privileges  which

they use for themselves - their political life will be

much shorter than it appears to be now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion before the House, however, takes the

cake!  It is unprecedented for any government to  deny

Opposition  time to debate the Estimates.  The  Member

for  Queenstown has said there are many  skeletons  in

the  cupboard, and that is why they fear. We are  told

that  the  sittings  will be up to midnight  and  that

therefore the total time will be the same. Sir, if the

intention of the Government is to give the same length

of  time  in  number of hours as we would have  if  we

followed  the  normal course, why does the  Government

not  suggest sitting in the morning instead of sitting

after 8 p.m.? They do not suggest  - I am not suggesting

they do this - sitting, say, from 8 in the morning up to

4  in  the  afternoon. Why do they not  suggest  this?

There  is a very good reason why they suggest that  we

sit  from  8 p.m. up to midnight. One reason  is  that

they want to give the impression that they are fair -

they  want to make up for the time: they want to  give

the   public   the  impression  that  they   are   not

dictatorial,  that  they  do  not  want  to  deny  the

Opposition  of their time. That is one of the  reasons

why  they  try  to  extend the time  from  8  p.m. to

midnight,  but  particularly from 8 p.m. to  midnight

because the Press will not publish many of the  things

that are said after 8 p.m. in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said earlier, the Government fear

publicity  which is adverse to them, and  though  they

have  the Press gagged, it is inevitable for the Press

to carry or give the Opposition at least more coverage

than they give for the normal times of a sitting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we firmly reject this motion, for acceptance

would  simply  mean  making a farce  of  parliamentary

practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must say that any attempt by the Government to

deny  us  sufficient time for a study of the Estimates

and preparation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



for a proper debate of the Estimates will  be

rejected  by us. If the Government have no confidence,

if  the  absence  of two Members will mean  that  they

cannot sustain the debate, then the logical thing  for

them to do is to quit office. We are satisfied that if

the  Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance  want

to  go on further golfing trips, it is their business.

We  are  further  satisfied that there are  sufficient

Members  on the Government side who should be able  to

manage the affairs of the Government in their absence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to end by saying this: if the P.A.P. had one

achievement  since  1959, it  is  to  have  thoroughly

discredited the democratic system in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we

have often heard the Party in power claim itself to be

the champion of democratic socialism, the champion  of

parliamentary democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the occasion when the Government can

prove  themselves  to  be champions  of  parliamentary

democracy   by   observing  democratic   parliamentary

procedure which seems to he a handicap to them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a parliamentary democracy, the rules and

practices  are meant to ensure fair play to  both  the

Government and the Opposition. Very often,  the  rules

are  in favour of the Government since virtually  they

are  in the majority, but at times the rules are meant

to protect the Opposition. In the case of Budget time,

the   Standing  Orders  are  laid  down  so  that  the

Opposition may have adequate time to study the  Budget

statement and the Budget Estimates and he able  to  do

justice to the debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Sir, we have seen the tendency of the

Party in power to honour democracy with their lips but

not  with  deeds,  and,  in this particular  instance,

because  the  observance  of  parliamentary  procedure

would  mean  some inconvenience to the  leaders,  they

have  decided  to  put  party  interests  before   the

interests  of  parliamentary democracy  and  they  are

trying to cut down on the rights of the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in previous years, the P.A.P. tried to stifle

the  Opposition  by smears, ridicule and  the  use  of

intimidatory language. Today, they seek to reduce  the

rights  of  the Opposition by this motion  before  the

House. It seems to me that they are still applying the

principle that as they can inflict arbitrary pay  cuts

on  their  own  workers,  they can  therefore  inflict

arbitrary cuts in the time of the opposition in  spite

of the protection accorded us by the Standing Orders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, where are the safeguards in future if this

intolerant attitude is unopposed? If the rights  of  a

parliamentary Opposition can be reduced or ignored  at

will  by  the  Party in power for its own convenience,

the same thing can happen to the rights of the people.

There  will  then  be no assurance of  fair  play  and

justice  because the ruling Party will then be  a  law

unto  themselves.  They can rise  above  certain  laws

meant  to  protect  the rights  of  other  people.  Of

course, the Government side will say that by extending

the  time  to  midnight  each day  they  have  thereby

provided  sufficient time for debate.  Actually,  this

makes matters worse from the Opposition point of view,

because  we  know very well that the daily papers  can

only  print  so much about what happens in this  house

per day, and that the speeches of the Ministers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



must  be given full play. In three  days'  time,

more  Ministers will speak with less space  available,

and,  therefore,  the speeches of  Opposition  Members

will be either pushed out for lack of space or just  a

few  paragraphs or a few lines are reported.  So  this

arrangement proposed by the Minister for Finance  will

work badly for the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know very well that the Ministry of Culture

with  all their experts have been able to work  out  a

strategy in the use of their radio and television,  so

that  it becomes a fine art to them as to how best  to

put  forward  the image of the P.A.P. to  the  people

through speeches made regularly at official functions.

Here again, it seems as if this is a way by which  the

Government side is trying to bolster themselves up  at

the expense of the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Culture has, through

experience,   developed  a  skill  in   twisting   the

statements  of Opposition Members. This time,  he  has

managed  to twist the opposition to this motion  as  a

united front against Malaysia. I think that is totally

wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir,I

never said that it was a united front against Malaysia

but that it was a united front of the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad he

has clarified that part because the indirect inference

was  that  we  have  now become united  in  an  unholy

alliance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the preservation of the freedom of

the  rights  of  the  people and  the  rights  of  the

Opposition,   naturally   the   Opposition    Members,

regardless  of  party affiliations,  must  be  united,

otherwise  there will be no Opposition at all  in  the

future.  We  on  this  side  of  the  House   want   a

responsible  Opposition regardless of whichever  Party

is  in  power, and it seems to me that if the Minister

for  Finance  was really interested in preserving  the

rights of the Opposition, he would have consulted  the

Opposition leaders and presented his case, so that  if

there  was really no way out, I am sure the Opposition

leaders  would have been only too glad to  accommodate

him. But this is another



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



instance  of  the  Party in power, by  virtue  of  its

majority,   trying   to  ride   roughshod   over   the

Opposition, and in this case of depriving the right of

the Opposition to more time in debating the Budget and

Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I regret to say that I have to oppose the

Government on this motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  opposing the motion by the Minister for Finance  I

feel that I have to add some points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will not allow us sufficient time to

have  a debate on the Budget by resorting to very mean

tactics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the letter dated 24th May written by the Minister for Finance to you, we can see that he has suggested to hold a Legislative Assembly sitting on 29th May to discuss questions relating to the Budget. When the Minister for Finance wrote to you, could he not have expected the type of reply he

would  get  from  you? Could the Government  not  have

known  in  advance  the  provisions  of  the  Standing

Orders?  I believe that when the Minister for  Finance

wrote  to you he already guessed what your reply would

be.  Therefore,  the whole motive of the  Government's

letter  to  you  is to create an impression  that  the

Government  intends  to give sufficient  time  to  the

Opposition to debate the Budget and that it intends to

hold    the   sittings   earlier,   but   that,   very

unfortunately,  the  Speaker  refuses  to  allow   the

Government to do so according to the Standing  Orders,

so that no blame will be attached to the Government. I

am  of  the  opinion that the Government is playing  a

political game which is rather mean. This incident  is

not the first one. It is a second incident, because in

February   this  year  when  the  Opposition   Members

requested  an emergency sitting of this Assembly,  the

Leader  of the Party in power, knowing very well  that

the  Assembly was in recess, did not want to say  that

he  would not like to convene a special sitting but he

wrote a letter to you requesting for a special sitting

of the Assembly so that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



you  had  to refuse the convening of a special sitting

according  to  the  Standing Orders.  Therefore,  this

action of the Government in February was also intended

to create an impression that the Government was not to

be blamed for not having convened a special sitting. I

feel  that this kind of mean tactics by the  Party  in

power in a parliamentary democracy should be condemned

by this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a small matter. It is not a very easy

matter  to  discuss financial business and the  Budget

because   the  Budget  provides  for  every  item   of

Government expenditure in a whole year. So it is not a

trifle.  If the Government want to show up the  merits

of  parliamentary democracy, then they should give the

Opposition  sufficient time to prepare for and  debate

this very important business of the Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while ago, the Minister for Culture said

that  we oppose the present motion because we want  to

delay  merger. He was not correct in saying  that.  We

Members of the Opposition oppose the motion because we

want  to  protect and safeguard our legitimate rights.

If  the  motion  by the Minister for Finance  has  not

infringed upon the rights of the Opposition,  then  we

in  the Opposition will not have reason to condemn the

motion irrespective of our Party affiliations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

very  sorry  to say that this Legislative Assembly  of

Singapore  has  now  been reduced to  nothing;  it  is

merely  a rubber stamp of the P.A.P. Government.  When

it  suits  their  purpose, it  is  convened  at  their

pleasure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, were it not for the fact that this Government

requires  this Assembly by this month to  supply  them

with  the  funds  to carry on the government,  and  at

other  occasions to pass laws in order  to  carry  out

their  administration or to repress the Opposition,  I

am  afraid  this Assembly might not even  be  convened

once a year as provided for under the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have now very little left of parliamentary

democracy,  and  what has happened here  is  a  living

mockery of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



the   P.A.P.  Government  and  its  contempt  for  the

parliamentary  system. During the past two  years,  we

have  noticed  that whenever sittings  are  held,  the

P.A.P.   Government  has  used  every  means  at   its

disposal,  every  contrivance  it  can  think  of,  to

suppress  and reduce the time for the Opposition:  for

instance,   the  introduction  of  the   12   midnight

guillotine  motion  at almost every  sitting  and  all

sorts  of  tactics which it can think of, so that  the

Opposition  will have as little time  as  possible  to

ventilate the views of the people they represent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that every speech we make after 7

p.m. or  8  p.m. finds little space in the  following

morning's paper. This does not mean that speeches made

before 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. find a fair representation  in

the papers. [Interruption] The main purpose of this 12

o'clock  midnight guillotine is that it  provides  the

Minister for Culture with a good reason to direct  the

Press not to give space to speeches made after 7  p.m.

or 8 p.m. This has happened especially during the past

one year, and that is why during the past one year  we

have always seen the Government moving motions to have

all-night sittings and debates lasting to 12 midnight.

It  does  not  mean  that  we cannot  stand  all-night

debates or sittings lasting to 12 midnight. I think we

are quite experienced in these matters. [Interruption]

I  think we are physically stronger than the Ministers

present  in this building. But we know that the  whole

purpose  of  this exercise is to stifle  parliamentary

democracy  and to repress the views of the Opposition.

That  is  why  today  the Opposition  are  all  united

against this move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why is the Government so scared? Why is it so

afraid  of giving a fairer and adequate period to  the

Opposition to express their views? What has it got  to

hide?  What has it been guilty of? Why is it so scared

of us?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Nobody is scared.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Rumours are going round the town

that  the  Minister  is shivering on  account  of  the

Member for Hong Lim and that he intended to put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



him  away  under the P.P.S.O. last time in the  I.S.C.

but he could not get it through. [Laughter].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Let us not embark on what may be

called  fairy tales. Let us go back to the  motion.  I

did  suggest that speeches should be short. We have  a

heavy Order Paper before us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Sir, we know that since December

1960,  the Government has tried to find ways and means

to  reduce  this Assembly, this forum -  the only  place

left  in Singapore where there is a little bit of free

speech which at present they are even trying to stifle

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- to nothing but a rubber stamp to suit the

Government's convenience. Sir, is there any Parliament

in the world where the institution of Parliament is so

much held in contempt by the party in power? Even  the

Speaker, the guardian of this august Assembly, is  now

being intimidated and insulted!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I did try to ask Members to keep

the Speaker out of this debate, because I do not think

it is correct to allege with such certainty that there

has been intimidation or insult.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Sir, I am not suggesting that the

P.A.P. Ministers are so inexperienced to directly  and

openly  intimidate the guardian of this  Chamber,  but

they are more capable of indirect suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this motion moved by the Minister for Finance

which consists of one, two, three, four, five parts:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Assembly resolves -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that notwithstanding

the Standing Orders.'.



<br><br>You  can see that this Government does not pay respect

to  the  Standing Orders. You will remember  the  last

time  when  they  also tried to violate  the  Standing

Orders  by  moving  a  suspension  motion  against  an

Assemblyman, and today we also have another example of

an  attempt  to  waive the Standing  Orders.  Why  not

repeal  the  Standing Orders? Let us have no  Standing

Orders  and the Government can just run this  Assembly

by a majority vote!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Assembly is reduced to just a farce, to a

mockery of parliamentary democracy. Today's motion  by

the  Minister  for Finance is to curb the Opposition's

time on the debate on the Budget and the Estimates. It

has  been  recognised in parliamentary democracy  that

Budget time is Opposition time. Today's instance shows

how  desperate  these  men are.  They  will  make  any

attempt,  no  matter  how low it is,  to  repress  and

suppress the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Keep on talking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I will not be long. These moves to

give as little time and opportunity as possible to the

Opposition  to  express the views of  the  people  are

additional weapons in the P.A.P.'s armoury,  like  the

P.P.S.O. and section 55 which are meant to repress the

Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the excuse given by the Government that it is

because  of  the  Malaysia talks is, I think,  another

excuse.  The  people do not believe in the  Government

any  more.  They had so many months to introduce  this 1963   Budget.

They  could  have  introduced  it   in

September,  October, November, or December last  year.

We  have  had  no meetings for many months.  What  has

happened is that, as far as I know, for the first time

in  the history of Parliament, a Government has  spent

money in advance for six months and then come to  this

Assembly begging and saying, "Come on, do not talk  so

much.  Just speak for three days and forget about  it.

Let us have the money."



<br><br>5.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is with regret that

I  cannot see eye to eye with the Minister for Finance

on  this  motion.  In any Session, in a  parliamentary

democracy,  the  two  most important  events  are  the

speech of the Head of State and the Budget debate. The

first  one - the  speech of Head of State - sets  out  the

policy  of  the  State for the ensuing year;  and  the

Budget - the  financial statement by  the  Minister  for

Finance - sets  out  the financial arrangements  whereby

the policy of the Government can be implemented.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the Standing Orders, it is incumbent on

the  Government  to  see that the  Assembly  does  not

debate  the  speech of the Head of State  until  seven

clear  days  have passed. Similarly with that  of  the

financial  statement  by  the  Finance  Minister,  the

Standing  Orders impose an obligation on the  part  of

the Government, and therefore a corresponding right to

the  Opposition, to see that no debate ensues  on  the

financial statement until a lapse of seven clear days.

Mr  Speaker, it is for some definite specific  reason

that  time  is  given to Members of the Opposition  so

that  they might study these two important statements,

one  by the Head of State and the other by the Finance

Minister, for seven clear days and consult among Party

members   and  come  prepared  to  debate  those   two

statements  in an intelligent and constructive  manner

that  will help not only the Government, but  possibly

the  country  at  large;  so  that  what  the  Finance

Minister is asking the Opposition to do in his  motion

is  to  give  up its right in this matter.  There  are

occasions when it is right for the Government  to  ask

the  Opposition to give up certain of its rights.  But

when such a request is made. I think it is only proper

courtesy  and  fair  play that  the  Finance  Minister

should give adequate reasons for so asking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the time given in this matter is not so much a

question of the Opposition trying to get the better of

the  Government.  We are being given  sufficient  time

under  the Standing Orders, which is the sum total  of

human  experience in parliamentary democracy,  because

to  debate  a financial statement, which is  the  most

important  thing in the financial life of  a  country,

one  has to have time to study it, think about it  and

then debate it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does the Finance Minister ask us to do in this

motion?  He  is going to deliver his statement  today,

apparently,  and we have to come back on  Tuesday  and

debate  it  intelligently, I hope, and  thereafter  to

debate the Budget Estimates on three successive  days,

and on each day sitting up to 12 o'clock midnight.  No

doubt, the time asked for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



equates  to the time given under the Standing  Orders.

The  Minister  made great play about  that  and  said,

"Well,  what are you complaining about? You  have  got

the  time  allotted under the Standing Orders  by  our

giving  you three sittings and extending the  time  on

each  day."  But he did not explain away  the  erosion

into  the  seven-day period of time which is given  to

Members  of  the Opposition to study the statement  of

the  Finance Minister. That has not been accounted for

at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what are the reasons the Finance Minister has

given  in  asking the House to approve this motion  of

his? Frankly, Sir, I was disappointed with his speech,

which  is  very  curt, and, if I might  say  so,  Sir,

somewhat  arrogant and not courteous to the  House  at

all, particularly to the Opposition. He is asking  the

Opposition  to  agree with him on a  motion  which  is

abridging  the rights of the Opposition  on  a  matter

such  as  this, and he does not even have the courtesy

to  give good coherent reasons as to why he wants  it.

All  that I understood him to say was, "I the  Finance

Minister want it this way; therefore, you agree to it.

Otherwise you have had it." Mr Speaker, Sir, that  is

no  way  to  treat the Opposition in this matter.  His

colleague, the Minister for Culture, tried to come  to

his assistance and did try to give some reasons as  to

why the Opposition should agree with this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently the Prime Minister and the Minister for

Finance have got to go to the Federation for important

discussions with the Federation Government, and  after

that, it would appear that both the Prime Minister and

the  Finance  Minister have got to go  to  London  and

conduct talks there and conclude an agreement, all  of

which  should happen, so it seems, before the 30th  of

June.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, why cannot the Minister for Finance, having delivered his Budget statement today, go off with the Prime Minister to the Federation and come back eight days later and deal with the Estimates? There is nothing to prevent him from doing this; absolutely nothing. No doubt he has certain

Bills. Under the Orders of the Day he has a number  of

Bills  which he is going to move. He is going to  take

the Second



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>



and  Third  Readings  of  the  Singapore  Society   of

Accountants  Bill  standing in his name.  He  is  also

moving  the  Second and Third Readings of  the  Rubber

Estates Assessment (Amendment) Bill. He is also  going

to take - or is he going to take, or is his deputy going

to  take -   the  Financial Procedure  (Amendment)  Bill

(Minister for Finance) - Second Reading. Then again, the

Local Government Integration Bill, Second Reading: the

Planning     (Amendment)    Bill     (Minister     for

Finance) - Second  Reading. The Housing and  Development

(Amendment)   Bill   (Minister  for  Finance) - Second

Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, is he going to take all these Bills in this

House, or is his Parliamentary Secretary going to take

them?  I  dare  say his Parliamentary Secretary  could

have  taken  these  Bills and,  as  his  Parliamentary

Secretary  has done on other occasions,  the  Minister

could  have gone off to the Federation, concluded  his

business  there  and,  as  far  as  we  can  see  from

statements in the Press by the Prime Minister and  the

Minister for Finance from time to time, everything  is

going on swimmingly. All it needs now are a couple  of

meetings. That is all we hear from the Press. A couple

of  meetings  and everything will be all right.  In  a

couple  of  meetings  everything  will  be  tied   up.

Correct.  In  seven days they can  hold  more  than  a

couple  of meetings. And the Minister for Finance  can

come  back  fortified  that he has  reached  financial

arrangements   with  the  Federation  and   face   the

Opposition calmly, coolly and collectedly. Instead  of

which he takes the other course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not agree. I think the

truth  of the matter is that the Minister has made  up

his  mind that this is what he wants and this is  what

he  thinks he is going to get. I dare say he will push

it  through,  but  he will push it through  against  a

joint Opposition stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another excuse on which the Minister for

Finance  sought to exculpate himself. He said that  he

had  tried to get an earlier sitting, and that he  had

failed  because an earlier sitting was not allowed  on

the grounds which he had suggested it could be called.

Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



Speaker,  Sir, you have ruled on it and I accept  your

ruling. Might I ask the Minister for Finance, when  he

does  reply  to his motion, why is it that his  Budget

could  not have been presented much earlier? There  is

absolutely  no reason that I can find today  why  this

Budget could not have been presented in December 1962.

We  gave the Government a Vote on Account for the year

1963.  The  reason  given to the Opposition  was  that

officials  were  going to be so busy on administrative

matters  connected with integration that  it  was  not

possible to spare them. Subsequent events proved  that

the  Finance  Minister was unduly pessimistic  in  his

statement to the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on this side of the House feel that this Budget

could  quite  easily  have been presented  months  and

months  ago.  It  could  easily  have  been  presented

without  having  to ask the House to give  a  Vote  on

Account for the first six months of the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the Opposition is concerned, we feel that

this  motion  is completely unnecessary,  and  if  the

normal  time  set  by  the Standing  Orders  had  been

followed, the Prime Minister and the Finance  Minister

could  have  concluded their business  in  the  places

where  they had wanted to go to. If they had not  been

in  the  House  and  if there was  a  suggestion  that

because  of  the equality of the number  of  votes  of

Government  and  Opposition, surely pairs  could  have

been  arranged for the Prime Minister and the Minister

for  Finance. That has been done previously. The Prime

Minister  has  paired off today with  someone  in  the

Opposition. And if the Opposition had been  told  that

the Finance Minister and the Prime Minister had to  be

away  in  the  Federation and in England on  important

State  business,  surely, Sir,  some  Members  of  the

Opposition  would  have paired off with  them.  To  my

mind,  Sir, this motion is completely unnecessary  and

all that it is intended to do and will, in fact, do is

to stifle discussion on the Budget Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not intend

to  dwell at length on the boisterous remarks made  by

the  Member for Cairnhill. Obviously he is under  some

illusion that the position of his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



Party is stronger than it actually is, but he has  got

the  time dates all mixed up in attacking the  motion.

Now,  may  I  get the dates right because  this  is  a

matter  of  some importance? The Member for  Cairnhill

said  that when we asked for a Vote on Account,  there

was an indication from me that the Budget, when it was

delivered,  would  have contained  certain  provisions

allowing  for  a division of expenditure  and  revenue

between   the   State  Government  and   the   Federal

Government, and he found what he termed an undertaking

from me had not been carried out. I think it should be

remembered  that the Vote on Account was  approved  by

this  Assembly on 4th December, 1961, just  after  the

merger  terms of the White Paper had been agreed  upon

and  we  were by no means certain by what date  merger

with  the Federation could have been achieved. At that

moment,  31st August, 1963, was not on the  cards.  It

could well have been a much earlier date, and in  that

event  a completely different form of Estimates  would

have been presented to the Assembly. But events having

taken  their course, it is obvious that for the  major

part of this year Singapore will remain in its present

constitutional  position and  therefore,  under  these

circumstances, it was not possible to allocate revenue

and   expenditure  between  the  State   and   Federal

Governments,  more particularly so as  he  knows  that

final   agreement  has  not  been  reached  with   the

Governments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great play has been made by the Members of the

Opposition  that  the  present  difficulties  in   the

financial  talks  consist largely of make-believe  and

play-acting. Mr Speaker, Sir, nobody would be happier

than I if in fact these difficulties were not real.  I

can assure the Member for Cairnhill and the Member for

Farrer  Park  that we have run into real difficulties,

that   representatives   of  both   Governments   held

genuinely and honestly to their respective stands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crux of the matter is this. It is not a question

of  Government  wanting  to repress  or  suppress  the

Opposition  and  deny them of their rights  at  Budget

time.  If  that was the case, how is it  that  in  the

debate on this motion the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



speakers between themselves have occupied no more than

twenty  minutes and the Opposition speakers  have  had

nearly three hours' run of time?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Guilty conscience. That is all.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It has been conceded by the

Opposition that there had been no shortening of  time.

In  fact, the total number of hours, under the  Budget

arrangements,  is something like two hours  more  than

the  normal  arrangement.  I  readily  admit,  and   I

conceded  at  the  beginning,  that  there  would   be

inconvenience.  This inconvenience would  have  to  be

borne  not only by the Opposition speakers but by  the

Government benches as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crux of the matter is this. Is this a dodge to

deny  the  Opposition the time and the right to  speak

and the right to publicity in the newspapers? The real

reason  is that a real urgency has been brought  about

by   difficulties  which  we  have  run  into  in  our

financial talks with the Federation Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, perhaps, if I could give exact dates, I may be

able  to  convince,  if  not  other  Members  of   the

Opposition, at least the Member for Farrer Park, whose

opinion is esteemed on this side of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time-table for the next constitutional process

over  Malaysia  is to have an agreed document  by  the

27th  of  this month. If we were to continue with  the

original  time-table, the Assembly would complete  its

deliberations on the Budget on the 23rd of June.  Now,

is  it humanly possible, Mr Speaker, Sir, to clear up

all  outstanding  issues  between  Singapore  and  the

Federation in two days - the 24th and possibly the 25th?

The Member for Farrer Park says that it could be done.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> You said so. You said two more meetings.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I never said so.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Your Master's Voice said so.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I said nothing of the sort, Mr

Speaker,  Sir.  Well, if he is right, then,  all  goes

well. But supposing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



he  is not right. The date for the initialling of  the

Treaty is an important one, because there again it  is

linked  to the parliamentary time-table of the British

Parliament,  taking into account that in August  there

will  be a recess, after which, of course, it  is  not

possible to carry on with the job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Farrer Park says, "Well, why not

carry  on according to the original time-table?  After

today's speech, then the Minister for Finance  can  go

off tomorrow, or the day after." Well, there is not  a

chance, because the Chairman of the Inter-Governmental

Committee,  Tun Razak, who is now in Manila,  will  be

away for perhaps a week or so. So I do wish to impress

on the House, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the time-table is

extremely tight, that vital issues are at stake, and I

reject completely the suggestion that this is a  dodge

to  deprive  the Opposition of time and publicity.  It

was  recklessly  suggested  by  some  Members  of  the

Barisan, and I think possibly the Member for Hong Lim,

that  there has been in some way a breach of the rules

of procedure or a flouting of parliamentary democracy.

If this were the case, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I suggest

that  you  are  the  person  who  is  guilty  of  such

breaches,  because the time-table that we adopted  for

quickening this Budget session was at your suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must not let that pass. I

think all the Speaker did was to indicate a way out of

a  difficulty.  That is all. There was  no  suggestion

that that way should be taken.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, that is undoubtedly true,

but  everyone  will  agree that  you  would  not  have

recommended a way that is unconstitutional  and  anti-democratic.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves the financial policy of

the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. Government has this week completed

its  fourth year in office. Many momentous events have

taken  place during this period. And now we  stand  on

the very threshold of independence through merger with

the  future Federation of Malaysia. Although, at  this

moment,  the  constitutional  arrangements  concerning

finance  have not reached finality, I am hopeful  that

on  the resumption of talks, final agreement would  be

reached.  Only  two outstanding issues  remain  to  be

settled,  namely, the quantum of our contribution  for

Federal services, and the terms under which the common

market  is  to be established. While it is unfortunate

that at this very late moment agreement could not have

been  reached on these matters, we should not overlook

the   fact  that  discussions  in  the  official  sub-committees  and in the plenary sessions of the  inter-Governmental committee had resolved successfully  many

complex   and   intricate  problems  to   the   mutual

satisfaction of both Governments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In presenting the Budget for 1963, I recognise that

there  must  necessarily  be  less  interest  in   the

Estimates  now  before the House than  is  usual.  The

obvious  reason is that nearly half the year is  over.

What the House is asked to ap-prove



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



is  really to provide finance for the remaining

six  months of 1963. In December, 1961 the House voted

and approved a vote on account for expenditure for the

first half of this year. For reasons I have explained,

it was not possible then to present the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such being the case, I wish, in this speech to

devote  more  time  to  an examination  of  the  basic

financial and economic problems confronting the  State

than  to  discussing the details of the Estimates.  In

doing so, I would like to undertake a review of events

in  the last four years and assess the performance  of

the   P.A.P.  Government  against  the  financial  and

economic policies on which it was elected to office in

1959.  I  will also attempt a pre-forecast of probable

trends after Malaysia, although this forecast must, in

the  nature of things, be tentative. Nevertheless,  it

is  worth  making it, if only to discover  the  limits

within   which  the  future  financial  and   economic

progress our State is likely to make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It falls outside my province to review progress in

the lion-economic aspects of our programme such as the

Women's  Charter,  labour  legislation,  the  work  of

nation  building, educational progress and other  non-economic  matters.  I shall refer  to  these  only  in

passing  and in so far as they have relevance  to  the

economic and financial policies of the Government.



<br><br><i>Basic Problems</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959, we saw with far more insight than other

political  Parties what the basic problems  were  that

faced  Singapore  then.  On  the  economic  side,  the

problem stems from the high rate of population  growth

in  the  postwar  years. The average  annual  increase

between  1947/57 was 4.3 per cent, a rate higher  than

that known to be achieved by any country in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This population explosion, as it is commonly known,

brought  about two sets of immediate problems  to  the

State.  The first is to maintain a rate of expenditure

on the social services - health, education, housing - to

maintain a rate on these services adequate to keep  up

with population growth and to allow for improvement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second problem is to create a sustained rate of

economic   growth   which   would   afford   increased

employment  opportunities to absorb the  thousands  of

young men and women who would be looking for work each

year. In 1959 we told the electorate (and I quote from

The Tasks Ahead, Part I, page 19):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Although unemployment is a serious problem now, it

is  trivial when compared with what would happen after

1962  if  no steps are taken now to expand the economy

and increase opportunities for work.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first problem, that is expanding the social

services, is a comparatively straightforward one  from

the  point  of  view of finance. It  is  a  matter  of

finding  money to pay for new schools and  houses  and

clinics  and to pay for the salaries of the  teachers,

nurses,  doctors  and other personnel  that  would  be

required.  And this is possible, if we were  to  avoid

punitive  increases in taxation,  only  in  a  bouyant

economy yielding increasing revenues to the Treasury.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second problem of economic expansion is a more

intricate one. It is a problem common to all the newly

independent countries of Asia and Africa. This is  the

problem    of    sustaining   economic    growth    of

underdeveloped countries, which in the  postwar  years

received  unprecedented attention among  international

organisations  such  as  the United  Nations  and  its

specialised     agencies,    national     Governments,

universities  and  the  enlightened  public  of   most

countries. A vast literature has proliferated  on  the

subject  of the techniques and policies which national

Governments should pursue to achieve what is  commonly

termed "the take-off into self-sustaining growth". Not

only  has  there been great interest but recent  years

witnessed  an  upsurge  of  confidence  that  economic

growth   is   possible  in  underdeveloped  countries.

Indeed,  no less august a body than the United Nations

has termed the 1960s as the decade of development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has taken but 3½ years of this decade to bring about

a growing disenchantment about the prospects of this take-off into self-sustaining

economic growth.  The countries of Asia have, one after another, experienced not only

a  slowing down of  growth but actual decline.  We have only to look outside  our country

to see several of our neighbours in dire economic distress.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



But for Malaya and Singapore, the first  three

years  of  this  decade have been  years  of  promise.

Substantial economic expansion has taken place both in

the  Federation  of Malaya and in Singapore.  And  the

reasons  are  not  far to see. We both  possessed  and

still  so far have retained all the pre-requisites  of

economic growth. We have a strong and stable currency.

There is a firm legal framework in which contracts are

enforceable, thereby making future business  relations

predictable. There is also an effective administration

and  a  reasonable  supply of  experienced  managerial

skills.



<br><br><i>Economy of Singapore</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of Singapore, however, is unique in Asia.

The  large Asian countries have their economies  based

on  the production of food grains, especially rice, an

occupation  which engages the energy of  nearly  three

quarters  of  the population. We in Singapore  do  not

produce a single grain of rice and our agriculture  is

limited  to  intensive  market  gardening  and  highly

capitalised poultry farming and pig rearing.  This  is

an  advantage  to  us because the production  of  food

grains generates low per capita income even under  the

most favourable conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another peculiarity of Singapore is the complete

absence of natural resources, but this factor is  more

than  balanced  by our central geographical  position,

our  excellent  natural harbour and our  talented  and

energetic  population.  Because  of  this,  the   most

important  pursuit  in  Singapore  is  trade  and  its

related  occupations,  such as banking,  shipping  and

transportation. Singapore's pre-eminence as a  trading

centre of South-East Asia Is known to all of us and is

not a matter upon which I need elaborate. But this has

led  to  two  difficulties in bringing about  our  own

economic growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that the expansion of trade largely

depends on external factors not within our control. If

our  neighbouring countries decide to introduce import

controls or exchange controls to reduce the volume  of

trade  with us, then there is little we can  do  about

it.  And  even  if this does not happen  there  is  no

reason to expect that trade will grow in keeping  with

the growth of our population.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second difficulty arises in the slowness with

which  capital and enterprise can be transferred  from

trade  to other sectors of the economy which could  be

expanded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our trading communities are not short of

managerial skills, such skills are specialised and the

business  attitudes generated by trade are  dissimilar

from those required in other pursuits. I shall develop

this point at some length later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we took office in 1959 we were convinced that

the  laissez  faire approach in economic matters  that

was  characteristic of past administrations could  not

be  relied upon to generate economic growth. Some form

of  positive  State action was required.  But  it  was

necessary first to assess and define problems  of  our

economic growth. From such an appraisal, we should lay

down  the strategy for promoting economic growth  and,

on  the basis of such a strategy, we could create  the

necessary  financial and economic institutions  needed

to  carry  out  the  immediate and long-term  policies

dictated by this strategy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broad approach to these problems had been

enunciated  in  the  Party's  The  Tasks  Ahead.   The

policies  outlined  in  this  document  needed  to  be

elaborated  in detail and translated into a  programme

for  administrative implementation. And this was  done

soon after we took office in the Four-Year Development

Plan  of  the  State. This document was presented  and

approved by the Assembly early in 1961.



<br><br><i>State Development Plan</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Four-Year Plan sets out in detail the

development projects to be carried out in  the  public

sector.  These include the new capital projects  which

are  to  be  carried  out by the  Government  and  the

Statutory  Authorities of the State,  such  as  Public

Housing, the Public Utilities, the port, the Telephone

Board  and the rest of them. It is possible,  however,

in  going through the Four-Year Plan to get lost in  a

morass  of  details and not to see the  wood  for  the

trees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may therefore be excused if I now give a brief

resume  of the underlying strategy to promote economic

growth



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



which  we,  in the special circumstances of Singapore,

must employ in our pursuit of prosperity. The approach

adopted in this Plan is a flexible and empirical  one.

Recognising that the creation of new jobs is of  over-riding  importance, the Government believes  that  the

attack must be mounted on a broad front.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we should maintain and develop the

traditional strong-points of the economy, our trading,

banking,  shipping and communications  services  which

have  sustained  our entrepot trade. It  would  be  an

error  to  take  measures harmful to  our  established

economic functions in the quest of something  new  and

uncertain. Not only should we maintain and improve our

efficiency  as  a  trading  centre,  hut  also   other

established lines, particularly our agriculture  which

consists   mainly  of  market  gardening  and   animal

husbandry, should also be improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While improving the traditional pursuits, we should

also  try to seek new lines of expansion. Because  our

land  space  is  limited and no mineral  resources  of

value exist, only a narrow range of opportunities  are

open to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Singapore is the fifth largest port in the

world,  it  is obvious that employment on board  ships

offers  promise of expansion, particularly in  respect

of  ships in the international sea routes. Accordingly

the Government instituted special training courses and

made  special  arrangements  with  shipping  lines  to

increase the enrolment of Singapore citizens  in  sea-going  occupations. Over the last two years. Singapore

provided  1,800 new entrants to employment  in  ocean-going ships. The Government intends further to enlarge

opportunities  for young men to obtain  employment  in

ships  and  will  introduce a  comprehensive  training

scheme of deck, engine rooms and catering services  to

be  conducted  on  a training ship  in  the  Singapore

harbour.  Last  year  15 Singapore  citizens  obtained

foreign   going   and   home  trade   deck   officers'

qualifications. The Polytechnic is preparing a  steady

flow of students for these examinations and more local

citizens are also qualifying as harbour pilots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another line of activity which promises rapid

expansion  is  tourism. The opportunities  offered  by

tourism were not, at first, fully appreciated by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



Government.  In  fact, in the 1959 election  platform,

there  was  no  mention of tourism.  A  study  of  the

subject  made after we took office reveals that  there

are  considerable  potentialities  for  expansion   in

tourism. This industry can add to our national  income

and   increase  employment  in  the  catering,  hotel,

entertainment  and  transportation industries  of  the

State. The Plan to develop tourism is being worked out

now and will be put into operation in the near future.



<br><br><i>Industrialisation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all these activities, our traditional entrepot

trade,  shipping, banking, agriculture, together  with

the new lines of employment on board ship and tourism,

cannot  provide  sufficient outlets  for  our  growing

population even when they are pushed to the limits  of

their  existing potentialities. The one  hope  of  our

island  State  lies  in  expanding  the  manufacturing

industries. And this must be done largely  within  the

framework  of  a  competitive free enterprise  system,

unless  we  are  prepared to suffer an  immediate  and

severe  decline  of  our standards of  living  brought

about by high cost of production of goods that we buy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject of industrialisation is one which has

been  exercising  the mind of the  Government  at  all

times.  It is a matter of over-riding importance,  for

on  the success of its effort to industrialise depends

the  survival  of  the State. If we fail,  then  there

follows  inevitably mounting unemployment  and  misery

and  this  will  bring  in its train  mounting  social

tension  which  will  finally  lead  to  an  explosive

catastrophy  of  some kind. This  being  the  case,  I

intend  to devote some time to an examination of  what

we  can  do in Singapore, what we have done  and  what

still remains to be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First what can Singapore hope to do by way of

industrialisation?  A  large   nation   with   a   big

population  and  an  extensive  land  area  with  many

natural  resources can afford to experiment with  high

cost  industries set up under a prohibition of imports

or  a high tariff wall. Such a country can allow these

high cost industries to survive even if the industries

are not efficient in the first instance, by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



passing   on  the  increased  Cost  to  the  consumer.

Industrialisation  on these lines  can  be  rapid  and

spectacular  if it is pressed forward with  sufficient

energy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, however, lacks the prerequisites for such

an  endeavour,  namely,  a  large  population,  varied

natural resources and extensive land area. This  being

the  case,  our plan of industrial expansion  must  be

more  circumspect and judicious. Particularly  as  our

economy   still  rests  so  much  on  trade,  enforced

industrialisation at the expense of trade  can  be  an

uncertain gamble with such a small domestic market  as

we have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In The Tasks Ahead the essential strategy is

outlined which is needed to promote industrial growth.

Three  basic  policies  were recommended;  first,  the

establishment   of  an  Economic  Development   Board;

second,  expansion of technical education; third,  the

setting  up of a Malayan Common Market. That  was  the

programme  which we recommended to the  electorate  in

1959   and   the   policies  recommended   have   been

implemented or are at some stage of realisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the policy in 1959. What has been the

performance?  As  Members already know,  the  Economic

Development Board was established towards the  end  of

1961.  I recollect the many questions that were  asked

in this [louse in the first two years, which showed  a

natural  impatience  over  the  establishment  of  the

Board. I had explained that industrial promotion was a

novel venture in the State and that the Government had

to    give   the   most   thorough   preparation   and

consideration  of  all aspects of the  subject  before

embarking upon it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to say that the Economic Development

Board  is now firmly established and work is  in  full

swing. The Board is staffed by both overseas and local

experts.  There are six expert personnel  provided  by

the  United  Nations. They consist of the Director  of

the Board, a Chemical Engineer, a Mechanical Engineer,

a  Cost  Accountant, an Industrial Consultant and  the

Chief   of  the  Technical  Consultant  Services.   In

addition,  the  short-term  services  of  three  other

United  Nations experts for specific duties have  been

obtained.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



namely, a Naval Architect, an expert on tanneries, and

an  industrial food consultant. But the main numerical

strength  of  the Board comes from local staff.  Local

personnel  of  the  Board at  the, expert  level  now

numbers  31.  They cover a wide range of  professions.

Most  of  them belong to some branch or other  of  the

engineering profession-civil, mechanical, chemical and

electrical.   There  are  also  chemists,  economists,

accountants and architects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Industrial Research Unit was

established only last month. It is staffed by  various

professional experts provided by the Government of New

Zealand with local counterparts under training. So  it

can  now be said that the Economic Development  Board,

in   terms  of  financial  and  technical  competence,

constitutes  a  powerful agency to promote  industrial

growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have been the results so far? We can discuss

this  under two aspects. First, that of providing  the

basic services needed for industry, such as industrial

sites  complete  with  roads, railways,  ports,  water

supply,  power,  telephones and  other  services.  The

achievement  of  the Board in this  respect  has  been

nothing  short of spectacular, as any visitor  to  the

Jurong Industrial complex can testify.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than $16.7 million have so far been spent at

Jurong. Hills have been levelled and swamps have  been

filled.  An area of 900 acres is immediately available

for   occupation  as  factory  sites.  More  than   60

applications   have  been  received  and   these,   if

approved, would cover a total area of 340 acres.  More

than  11 miles of roads have been laid of which 7 have

been  metalled or will soon be metalled.  The  railway

line  is due to be laid and construction will commence

in  a  few  weeks'  time, the  work  of  planning  and

surveying having been completed already. Work has also

commenced on the construction of 5,000 feet of  wharf.

This  is  due  for  completion by  the  end  of  1964.

Telephone cables have been laid, so have power  lines,

and water supplies should be ready sometime this year.

The other smaller industrial estates, one at Redhill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



and the other at Tanglin Halt, are in an advanced

stage  of  completion. Redhill Estate is fully  booked

and  25  factories have been completed or are due  for

completion  soon.  The 43 acres at  the  Tanglin  Halt

industrial  estate have been almost completely  booked

and  new  industries  are  starting  up  there  at   a

satisfactory pace. The industries at these  two  small

industrial  estates  cover  a  wide  range  of   light

manufactures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-four Pioneer certificates have been granted

and  19  firms are in operation or will soon  commence

operation.   The   new   pioneer  industries   already

established  represent a total capital  investment  of

$130 million and are providing permanent jobs for more

than  3,500  people.  Another 13 pioneer  certificates

will  be awarded shortly. The companies concerned will

have  a  subscribed capital of $14.3 million and  will

provide jobs for 1,150 people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the production of a wide range of

manufactures  has  been  under  investigation  by  the

Economic  Development Board for some time.  Since  the

Referendum  in  1962,  there has  been  a  substantial

increase  in  interest, both locally and overseas,  in

establishing  industries in Singapore. The  industries

on which a decision to establish can be expected to be

made  this  year include a wide range of  manufactures

such  as  bitumen,  fertilisers, ceramic  wall  tiles,

ceramic sanitary ware, calcium carbide, caustic  soda,

chlorine,   car   batteries, ammonia   and   ammcnium

sulphate, plastic products, leather, ground phosphate,

electric  light  bulbs, insulated  cables,  pipes  and

galvanised  iron  sheets and various  items  of  food-processing. This new range of industries, if and  when

they  start off, will involve a capital investment  of

$56  million  and  will provide employment  for  1,620

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large part of the industries I have mentioned

above  represents the direct result of the promotional

effort  of  the Economic Development Board.  All  this

promotional  work was undertaken against a  relatively

unfavourable   background  of  political   strife   in

Singapore and politically inspired labour troubles. It

should  also  be remembered that these new  industries

are being set up without



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



the  tariff  protection  which  most  other  countries

consider  essential.  I have no doubt  that  with  the

tariff  protection  accorded by a  Common  Market,  we

shall see a rapid acceleration of industrialisation in

Singapore. I shall deal with this subject later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the second approach advocated in The

Tasks   Ahead - the   development  of   scientific   and

technical  skills  at  all  levels.  Modem  industries

require  men trained in a wide range of skills.  At  a

professional level, we have the Singapore  Polytechnic

and   the   Science  Faculty  of  the  University   of

Singapore.  For  courses not  provided  at  these  two

institutions,  the  Government has  made  arrangements

with   various  Colombo  Plan  countries  to   provide

increasing  numbers  of  places  for  scientific   and

technical education. In fact, today there are no  less

than  139 scholars abroad engaged in undergraduate  or

postgraduate  studies in various branches  of  science

and engineering.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot afford to neglect the training of

personnel  at  the  lower  level  of  technicians  and

craftsmen.  The,  Ministry of Education  has  examined

this  aspect with some thoroughness. A plan is now  in

hand to expand technical education to provide industry

with   an   increasing  supply  of   technicians   and

craftsmen. There is now a Vocational Institute with an

enrolment  of nearly 1,000. There are in addition  two

secondary technical schools with an enrolment of 2,500

pupils.  Next  year, no less than four  new  secondary

schools  will  be  ready  to  admit  a  total  maximum

enrolment  of  7,680 pupils in two sessions'.  And  in 1965  an  additional  three new  vocational  secondary

schools  will  be  established to provide  places  for 5,760 pupils in two sessions.



<br><br><i>Common Market</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third policy is to establish a common market.

Our  election programme in 1959 declared that a common

market   with  the  Federation  of  Malaya  would   be

essential  to fast economic industrial growth  in  the

two territories. Members are aware of the efforts made

by the Singapore Government to obtain the agreement of

the Federation Government to establish a common mar-ket.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



Initially, progress had not been as fast  as  we

would have desired, but nevertheless definite advances

were made towards this goal. The breakthrough occurred

in  February this year when a World Bank Mission under

the  leadership of Professor Jacques Rueff came to the

Federation   of  Malaya,  Singapore  and  the   Borneo

territories,  for  a  study of the  subject.  The  two

Governments  have  received the report  of  the  Rueff

Mission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not at liberty to disclose recommendations

of  the Rueff Mission nor do I wish to anticipate  the

future  course of negotiations which will  take  place

between the Governments of Singapore and Malaya. But I

have  no hesitation in saying that the Report of  this

Mission will prove to be of profound importance to the

future of Malaysia and will find an authentic place in

the annals oil the economic history of this territory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish here to give a broad outline of how the

economy  of  Singapore would be affected by  a  common

market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me explain, without going into intricate

technical   details,  the  basic  issues   which   the

establishment of any form of common market will  bring

about,  given  the  existing tariff systems,  and  the

present  economic  structures  of  Singapore  and  the

Federation  of  Malaya. As I have stated  before  this

House  on  previous  occasions,  there  would  be   no

difficulty whatsoever in getting agreement on a common

market  with  the  Federation of  Malaya  if  we  were

prepared  to join them in a full-scale customs  union.

This  means  that  we  shall  have  to  introduce   in

Singapore  the same tariff scales as in the Federation

of  Malaya. The trouble about this proposal  is  that,

while  it  will  give a decided impetus to  industrial

growth, it will also dislocate the entrepot trade to a

dangerous   extent.  A  complete  customs   union   is

therefore not a feasible proposition for Singapore  at

the present juncture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have therefore proposed a limited form of common

market  whereby goods manufactured in the  territories

of   Malaysia   will  be  subject  to  common   market

treatment.  That is to say, there would be  protective

duties  imposed on these goods when imported into  any

part of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



Malaysia  while  local manufactures  can  move  freely

within  the  area  without duty. On  the  other  hand,

tariffs  on  goods which are not now manufactured  and

are  not  likely to be manufactured in  the  Malaysian

territories would not apply to Singapore.  This  would

reduce  the degree of dislocation that would be caused

to the entrepot trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the limited form of common market which we

consider  practical in the present circumstances,  the

range  of imported manufactures which will be  subject

to  import duties will be extensive. This is likely to

increase  in  time when manufactures of an  increasing

range of goods previously imported will be possible in

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How would the common market affect trade and

industry in Singapore? The first point to be noted  is

that  protective tariffs in Singapore will apply  only

to  manufactures  and  not to tropical  raw  materials

which form the greater bulk of our entrepot trade.  So

the  traditional  entrepot trade  in,  rubber,  copra,

coffee,  sago, spices, jungle produce and other  goods

will not in any way be affected by the common market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, even where import duties are placed on

imported goads, every facility will he given to the re-export trade. An elaborate system of bonded warehouses

with adequate facilities for handling and packaging of

goods  will  be  set up as part of the  common  market

arrangements. The bonded warehouses will enable  these

goods  to be re-exported without duty and in this  way

will  help to sustain the competitive position of  our

re-exports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of all that we can do to safeguard our re-export trade, it is necessary that traders engaged in

the entrepot trade in manufactures should undertake  a

basic  re-appraisal of their future prospects. I  must

make it clear that the lamest sng1e market for our re-exports  of  manufactured goods is the  Federation  of

Malaya.  It  is likely that, under the common  market,

industrialisation in the Federation of  Malaya  itself

will gain an added momentum and it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>



certain  that many of the goods which she now  imports

through  Singapore will be produced in the  Federation

itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is not open for the traders to say that

if  Singapore keeps out of the common market then they

can  hope  to  retain  their re-export  trade  to  the

Federation.  If  Singapore keeps  out  of  the  common

market, then the Federation would industrialise by her

own  efforts and produce many of her goods  which  she

now imports through Singapore. In this event, we would

lose our re-export trade to the Federation without any

compensating advantage in the way of local  industries

to produce these goods in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My advice to importers and traders now engaged in

these  lines  is  to take a more serious  interest  in

industrialisation  than they hitherto  have  done.  If

they  divert  their  energies and business  talent  in

gradual  stages from trade to industry, then there  is

no  reason  why  their  present prosperity  cannot  be

maintained in the future. The profits which  they  now

make in trade in imported manufactured goods will come

in  a different form in the shape of profits in making

these  goods themselves. This will happen  if  traders

are  sufficiently  alert and  aware  of  the  changing

economy  of  Malaysia.  The Government,  `through  the

Economic   Development  Board,  will   do   everything

possible to enable traders to move into industries  in

the line of products they have experience in handling.

On  the  other hand, if these traders refuse to accept

the new challenge and grasp the new opportunities that

arc  offered, then they only have themselves to  blame

if  the  diminution of their re-export  trade  is  not

matched by an accretion of income from new sources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common market is the last of the three-point

programme  of industrialisation which we announced  we

would  carry  out in 1959. This has been  the  missing

link  of  Singapore's drive towards industrialisation.

It  is  by  far  the  most decisive single  factor  in

accelerating industrial growth. For nearly four  years

we  have  strained  every resource  and  ingenuity  to

achieve  it, but this objective has until  now  eluded

our   grasp.  Now  at  last  the  Government  of   the

Federation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



of  Malaya  has announced that it accepts in principle

the  establishment of a common market in Malaysia.  It

only remains for the terms of this common market to be

worked out and agreed upon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that the common market in Malaysia

will    provide    a    greater   impetus    to    our

industrialisation effort than anything else can do. It

will, in addition, also quicken the pace of industrial

growth  in other parts of Malaysia. If we conduct  our

affairs with intelligence, energy and resourcefulness,

there  is every reason to hope that Malaysia will,  in

the  1960s, fully live up to the expectation that this

will be a decade of development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore it means that we would have found at

last a solution to our problem of unemployment. If all

goes  well, the thousands of young men and  women  who

would  be  looking for decent and secure jobs  in  the

years  to  come will find the jobs available.  And  if

they  are  prepared to go through the many courses  of

technical  training which will be  made  available  to

them,  then  they will not only secure for  themselves

better  jobs  in  industry  but  they  will  also   be

providing  our growing industries with a  much  needed

supply of skilled labour.



<br><br><i>1962 Economic Review</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to a general review of economic

activity  in 1962. By all accounts, 1962  was  a  good

year  for Singapore, even better than 1961. There were

marked advances in most fields of activity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are a trading centre, a review of economic

activities should properly begin with trade, in  1962

our  total imports came to $4,036 million as  compared

with  $3,964  million  in 1961.  Exports  amounted  to $3,419  million  as  compared with $3,308  million  in 1961.  There  was therefore a small though significant

increase so far as the value of our external trade  is

concerned.  But  it  should be  remembered  that  1962

prices  of  major commodities were considerably  lower

than  those  obtaining  in  1961.  For  instance,  the

average  price  of rubber in 1962 came  to  only  78.2

cents per pound as compared with 83.8 cents the previous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



year. There were also substantial falls in  the

prices  of  practically every item entering  into  our

entrepot trade, particularly products such as  coconut

oil, pepper and coffee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This decline in prices conceals the real expansion

in  the physical volume of trade conducted through our

port.  For  Singapore, it is the  physical  volume  of

trade that really matters, for we draw our income from

handling, processing and packaging of goods through  a

number of stages, and the larger the volume, the  more

work and income are generated. In physical terms,  the

amount  of cargo loaded in Singapore was 7.66  million

tons  in 1962 compared with 6.51 million tons in 1961.

This  represented an increase of 18 per cent of  cargo

loaded in our port, both at the Harbour Board wharves,

in  the roads and at our oil terminals. The volume  of

cargo  discharged in 1962 was 13.40  million  tons  as

compared  with  11.75  million  tons  in  1961.  `This

increase comes to some 14 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But quite the most spectacular expansion of our

economy occurred in the construction industry. In 1962

the  Housing  and  Development Board completed  12,230

houses  as  against 7,320 in 1961. Exact  figures  for

private housing are not available, but visual evidence

of  private  construction now in progress at  so  many

places  in  our  island suggests  that  a  substantial

increase  did  take place in 1962. The  statistics  on

building materials bear this out. The output of bricks

showed  an increase of 51 per cent in 1962 as compared

with  1961.  Retained imports of  cement  amounted  to

260,000 tons in 1962, representing an increase  of  39

per  cent  over  the  1961  figure  of  186,000  tons.

Retained  imports  of  structural  steel  amounted  to

45,000 tons in 1962, showing a percentage increase  of

36.8 per cent over the 1961 imports of 32,000 tons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labour statistics on the number of workers employed

in  the  building  industry also  show  a  substantial

increase  between  1961 and 1962.  There  were  10,372

workers  in  the building industry in  March  1961  as

compared with 13,033 in September 1962, an increase of

26 per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>



cent.  The  actual  increase was probably  larger,  as

statistics on the activities of small contractors  and

sub-contractors in the building trade are  notoriously

difficult to collect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This increase in the general level of economic

activity  is  reflected in the statistics on  finance.

Loans and advances by banks in Singapore over the year

came to $706.7 million as compared with $625.5 million

the previous year. There was a substantial increase in

bank  deposits from $880.9 million in 1961  to  $983.9

million  in  1962.  This  increase  in  bank  deposits

occurred  in  all  categories,  for  example,  current

accounts,  time,  as  well as  savings  deposits.  The

increase  in  time  deposits was particularly  marked,

being of the order of some $80 million. This expansion

in  private  commercial  banking  is  matched  by  the

performance in public finance. I shall deal with  this

aspect when I come to the 1962 expenditure and revenue

accounts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be expected that with heightened economic

activity, people will be better off and would buy more

goods.  Here  again  the  statistics  show  that   the

consumer  in Singapore did well in 1962. He  bought  8

per  cent  more motor-cars than in 1961, spent  6  per

cent more on refrigerators, 8 per cent more on radios,

27  per  cent more on cameras, drank 7 per  cent  more

liquors, used more petrol, went to cinemas more often,

wore  more  and  better clothes, and generally  had  a

better  time than in 1961. But we are still  far  from

being  an affluent society. It is our business to  see

that  the affluence which is now enjoyed by a  limited

section  of our society is extended to everyone.  This

is  not  a  matter-if I may be permitted a metaphor-of

sharing  our existing cake in equal slices  all  round

but  of  producing a bigger cake so that everyone  can

have   a  larger  slice.  In  other  words,  it  means

producing  a  larger  national  income  through   fast

economic growth.



<br><br><i>Revenue and Expenditure in 1962</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to a review of revenue and

expenditure  in  1962. From my brief  account  of  the

economic situation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



last year, it would hardly come as a surprise  to

Members  if  I were to say that the financial  outcome

for  that  year  was not unsatisfactory.  The  revenue

collected  amounted to $418.8 millions and  the  total

expenditure was $351.7 millions. With the transfer  of

$30  millions from current revenue to the  Development

Fund,  this  means that the total surplus  on  current

account  in  1962 was $97.1 millions. Ordinarily  this

might    have   been   a   subject   for   unqualified

satisfaction,  but,  however,  recently   our   annual

financial   surpluses  have   been   the   object   of

embarrassing attention in certain quarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, 1962 was a good year financially and

the reserves both in the Consolidated Fund Account and

the  Development Fund Account were strengthened by the

end  of  1962, when they stood at $208.8 millions  and $141.6   millions  respectively.  This  was  a   great

improvement on the $87.2 millions we started  with  in 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that Members will be pleased that this

strong  position had been achieved in  spite  of  very

heavy expenditure incurred in providing the people  of

Singapore with increasing numbers of houses,  schools,

roads, standpipes, lighting, community centres and, of

course, the massive Jurong industrial complex.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidence in the Government was reflected in the

support   for   the  $60  million  loan  raised   last

September.   The  World  Bank  undertook  a   detailed

financial  and  economic  review  of  the  State   and

endorsed  the  sound financial standing  and  economic

policy  of  the  Government.  On  the  basis  of  this

favourable  report  on  the credit-worthiness  of  the

State of Singapore, the World Bank agreed to a loan of $45  million  for  the  extension  of  electric  power

supply.  The loan agreement has since been  signed  in

Washington  on  the 16th May, 1963. I  should  mention

here  that construction work at the new Pasir  Panjang

Power  Station had not in any way been delayed at  any

stage  because,  while  the  loan  negotiations   were

proceeding,  tenders for Construction of  the  Station

and the supply of equipment were proceeded



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



with  simultaneously. Members are also aware  that  an

application has been made to the World Bank to finance

the Johore River project to ensure that there will not

be  any  shortage of water in the foreseeable  future.

The  World Bank loan for the power project carries  an

interest of 5« per cent a year and is repayable over a

period   of   20  years.  These  terms  are  eminently

satisfactory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to delve in too great a detail

into  the  revenue and expenditure account  for  1962.

Revenue exceeded the estimates by $26.5 millions while

a  shortfall  of  $47.8 millions  was  experienced  in

expenditure.  This shortfall in expenditure  has  been

recurring  for  some years and in my  previous  Budget

speeches  I  have  explained the  main  reasons  which

brought  about  these savings. Some of  these  reasons

still  held good in 1962, but there were a  number  of

other  factors which cropped up during the  course  of

the  year,  including certain economy  measures  which

were introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Estimates Committee of the Assembly has examined

certain  cases  of over-estimation of expenditure  and

the   recommendations  of  the  Committee  have   been

accepted by the Government. It would be impossible  to

guarantee that there will be no further shortfalls  in

future   estimates   of  expenditure.   So   long   as

departments are expanding and so long as the  services

provided  to  the  public are being  expanded,  it  is

virtually  impossible to avoid shortfalls,  especially

in  personal emoluments. In most instances,  provision

has  to  be  made for staff for the full year  in  the

Estimates,  whereas in practice, time is  required  to

recruit staff. This means that the full complement  of

staff  will not be available as from the first day  of

the  year but sometime during the year with consequent

savings in expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In passing, I might mention the big items of under-expenditure in the various Ministries. There was a

shortfall  of $4 millions in the Ministry of  National

Development of which $3.4 millions was in  respect  of

O.C.S.E. items   and   $½ million   under   Personal

Emoluments. The main reason was that the Work  Brigade

did not expand to the full extent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



we  provided  for. This was principally  due  to

better economic conditions which resulted in a smaller

number  of  applicants joining the Work  Brigade.  The

Public  Works  Department experienced a  shortfall  of $1.6  millions, nearly all of which was in respect  of

Personal Emoluments. There was a saving of $3 millions

under  Public Works Recurrent, a smaller  figure  than

previously  experienced. The Ministry of Health  spent $5  millions below their estimates, of which half  was

due to savings in personal emoluments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expenditure for pensions, retirement allowances

and  gratuities saw a shortfall of $9.1 millions,  and

this was principally due to faulty estimation. One  of

the  reasons was that the amounts that had to  be  set

aside in the past for Malayanisation compensation  had

not been sufficiently reduced. The Ministry of Culture

underspent by $2.2 millions, and most of this was  due

to over-provision for the television services. A large

staff of technicians, programme assistants, cameramen,

studio   floor  managers,  costume  designers,  script

writers  and other grades had to be engaged to  run  a

television service, and by the end of the year, it was

not  possible  to engage more than a fraction  of  the

full  complement.  Since  then,  however,  substantial

progress has been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence Services underspent by $1.4 millions and

this  was due to the slowness in recruiting the Second

Battalion of the Singapore Infantry Regiment.  Finally

the Ministry of Education underspent by $7.5 millions,

most of which was in respect of personal emoluments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the yield of revenue which, as I said,

had  exceeded  the  estimates by $26.5  millions.  The

additional revenue resulted from the buoyant  economic

conditions which existed during the year, particularly

after  the  Referendum. The Inland Revenue  Department

had  a  good  year, income tax exceeding estimates  by

$8.5  millions,  while property tax,  stamp  duty  and

estate  duty taken together yielded some $1.8 millions

in  excess  of  the estimates. The Customs  Department

also exceeded their estimates. The excess was $5.3



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



millions  and  was  distributed more  or  less  evenly

between   petroleum,   liquor  and   tobacco   duties.

Entertainment  duty  showed a modest  half  a  million

dollars excess over the estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the yield of property tax by $0.4

million  was  particularly noteworthy in view  of  the

concessions  that  were made to  owner-occupied  attap

houses. Until the granting of tax concessions to these

persons,  the  rate  of  tax on  owner-occupied  attap

houses  in  the  city  areas  was  36  per  cent.  The

Government  felt that these properties did  not  enjoy

the same benefits by way of roads, lighting, water and

electric  supply as compared with permanent dwellings.

Accordingly, on grounds of equity, it was  decided  to

reduce  the rates of tax from 36 per cent  to  27  per

cent.  The  Government has also decided to follow  the

Federation  policy in respect of exemption  of  income

tax  from all owner-occupied houses. We have, however,

imposed a limit of $3,000 net annual value by  way  of

tax exemption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recollect that when the Property Tax

Ordinance   was  passed  by  the  Assembly,   it   was

specifically provided that property tax should be paid

on  unoccupied buildings. The reason for this measure,

as  I  then  explained to the House,  was  that  under

conditions  of acute housing shortage, which  we  then

experienced,  there  was  no  valid  reason  for   any

dwelling to remain unoccupied for any length of  time.

We  also  know that sonic property owners are  holding

out  at  high  rents to take advantage of the  housing

shortage, and hold the prospective tenants to  ransom.

Obviously  exemption  from tax during  the  period  of

vacancy  of his properties would encourage him  to  do

this.  I  promised the Assembly that when the  housing

situation  improved, I would make a review.  With  the

unprecedented boom in both public and private  housing

construction  now in progress, the time  has  come  to

make  this review. Accordingly, I have authorised  the

Inland Revenue Department to exempt from Property  Tax

all  unoccupied buildings as from the 1st January this

year, subject to certain conditions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Revenue and Expenditure 1963</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the revenue and expenditure for 1963.

When  I  asked for a vote on account in 1961  for  the

first  six months of expenditure for 1963, I then  had

in  mind the possibility of agreement on the financial

terms  of  merger which will enable the Estimates  for

1963  to  take into account the changing circumstances

following the setting up of Malaysia. As Members know,

final  agreement  around the  corner  has  yet  to  be

reached.  Accordingly, the Budget for  1963  had  been

prepared on the basis of maintaining existing services

wherever possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keynote has been that of maintaining the

services  as they are. But, however, there are  a  few

cases  where  it  is  necessary to  implement  certain

proposals    immediately   which   would    facilitate

amalgamation  after  Malaysia.  For  instance,  it  is

necessary  to  establish the Second Battalion  of  the

Singapore  Infantry Regiment now rather than  to  wait

for  merger.  There  are  also  certain  consequential

increases  in  the Defence services  as  well  as  the

Police   Force.  As  regards  other  Ministries,   the

expansion  on  education expenditure, which  has  been

particularly rapid since this Government took  office,

continues. We have now reached a stage when  there  is

de  facto  free  primary education  for  all  children

between  the  years  of 6 and 14. If  we  compare  our

achievements  in education with those of other  States

in   Asia,   we  shall  have  cause  for   pride   and

satisfaction. At the same time, we must not forget how

much  we  owe  to the dedicated corps of teachers  and

school  principals whose hands will mould  the  future

generation  of  Malaysians. This year  $94.7  millions

have  been  provided for the Ministry of Education  as

against $89.1 millions last year. The increases  cover

staff  for the new schools, increases in bursaries  to

the  Universities of Singapore and Nanyang,  and  Ngee

Ann College and the Polytechnic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  will recollect that  in  1960  I  drew

attention  to the burgeoning expenditure on education.

This  was  the result both of the population explosion

as   well  as  our  policy  to  achieve  free  primary

education. Members will learn



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



with  some  relief  that there has  been  a  sustained

decline  in  the birth rate over the last five  years.

The  number  of births appears to have been stabilised

at  between  59,000 and 60,000 a year, and  this  will

afford  some relief in future years on the  increasing

sums  that have to be spent on primary education.  But

the  task  of  building  more  secondary  schools  and

expanding    higher    technical,    vocational    and

professional education will remain with  us  for  many

years  and  threaten to make severe inroads  into  our

finances in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of new services have been introduced and

financial provisions have been made for them  in  this

year's  estimates. In Head 29 (Industrial  Arbitration

Court),  a  provision of $348,010  has  been  made  as

against last year's provision of $171,300. This is  to

pay  for  the  cost of a second Industrial Arbitration

Court, which is necessary because of congestion in the

first  Court. The television services introduced  last

February  call for an increase of $3.3 millions  under

the  Ministry of Culture. In the Ministry of  Finance,

Head  33, there is an increase of $6.8 millions  which

is  due  to  a  new item under Other Charges  Annually

Recurrent,  namely,  a  subsidy  to  the  Housing  and

Development Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a new departure from previous policy and I

wish to comment on it at some length. It has been  the

practice  of  previous  administrations  to  give  the

housing  authority,  then  the  Singapore  Improvement

Trust,  a concealed subsidy by way of favourable  loan

conditions. Loans extended to the housing authority in

the  past  were repayable in 60 years,  and  this,  of

course,  reduced  the annual cost of  amortization  on

public  housing.  In addition to this,  low  rates  of

interest were charged, sometimes as low as 2½ per cent

per year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the view of this Government that subsidies to

public  housing should not be disguised  or  concealed

and   that  the  full  amount  should  appear  in  the

financial  estimates. The loans now  extended  to  the

Housing  and  Development  Board  are  made  on  terms

approximating as closely as possible to  the  existing

market rates. As against this, a subsidy is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



given  to  the  Board which represents the  difference

between  the open market loan terms and the subsidised

loan  terms.  I should mention here that a substantial

subsidy  arose  from the uneconomic  rents  which  the

previous  administration  had  fixed  during   1958/59

shortly before the general elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basis of the subsidy and the details of the

computations   of  sums  involved  have   been   under

negotiation  for more than a year between the  Housing

Board and the Ministry of Finance. The details will be

announced when final agreement has been reached on all

matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to draw the attention of the House to certain

substantial decreases in expenditure. The Ministry  of

National  Development, Head 20, shows  a  decrease  of $1.4   millions.   Head   35,   Pensions,   Retirement

Allowances  and Gratuities have been reduced  by  $7.1

millions and Public Works recurrent by $1.5 millions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to revenue, I expect the favourable

conditions of last year to continue. Accordingly,  the

estimated yield of the main items of revenue has  been

increased.  There is an increase of $4  millions  over

last  year's  estimates of income tax,  and  increases

have  also  been  allowed for in  respect  of  customs

duties.  The  total  yield of  liquor,  petroleum  and

tobacco duties is expected to be $6.5 millions  larger

than  last year's estimates. Increases have also  been

allowed for in respect of stamp duties, estate  duties

and   entertainment  duties.  Telecommunications   and

postal  services are expected to show an  increase  of

$2.1  millions. The estimate for Registration Fees  in

respect  of  motor  vehicles  has  been  substantially

increased by $3.5 millions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sum, the total revenue expected to be received

for 1963 had been set at $409.7 millions as against an

estimated expenditure of $411.7 millions. The accounts

therefore just about balance.



<br><br><i>Administrative Reforms</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is only proper that I should

conclude  this  report of the administration  with  an

account  of two basic reforms which we have completed.

The first is the integration of City Council



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>



departments into the Government Service, and  the

transfer  of  the rest -  members of the  staff  of  the

trading departments of the City Council - to the  Public

Utilities  Board.  As  Members know,  the  first  step

towards  this integration was undertaken in 1960  when

two  Bills were approved by the Assembly, namely,  the

Property Tax Ordinance, 1960, (No. 2 of 1960) and  the

Local  Government  (Financial Integration)  Ordinance,

1960,  (No.  64  of 1960). Both these Ordinances  took

effect  as from 1st January, 1961. Together  with  the

Local   Government   Integration  and   the   Pensions

(Amendment)  Bills  now before the  Assembly  and  the

Public  Utilities Ordinance, which was passed  by  the

Assembly  earlier this year, the legal  framework  for

the integration exercise is complete.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board was established last

month.  All  the assets and liabilities  of  the  City

Council  connected with its water, gas and electricity

undertaking  have  been  transferred  to  the   Public

Utilities  Board. These assets include those  portions

of the City Council common user property hitherto used

for the utilities departments, such as portions of the

Treasurer's  Office, Transport Centre and  City  Hall.

Public street lighting and public standpipes, however,

have   been  transferred  to  the  ownership  of   the

Government. The assets and liabilities connected  with

public loans of the City Council and the sinking funds

for  these  loans have been transferred to the  Public

Utilities  Board, with the Government contributing  to

the  Board for the portions of outstanding loans which

were  used  for purposes unconnected with the  trading

activities of the former City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been a major administrative exercise of

considerable scope and complexity. The number of staff

involved  is  13,420. Of this, some  8,370  have  been

transferred to the Government and the balance 5,050 to

the Public Utilities Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not unexpected that numerous problems of

establishment,  pay,  service conditions  and  related

matters follow from the integration exercise. There



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



have  been prolonged and numerous negotiations between

the  unions affected and the Government. Matters still

outstanding have been referred to a Board  of  Inquiry

set up by the Minister for Labour under section 70  of

the  Industrial  Relations Ordinance.  This  Board  of

Inquiry  deals with the salary structure  and  service

conditions  of  monthly-rated employees  of  the  City

Council  on  their  transfer to  the  service  of  the

Government or the Public Utilities Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outstanding matters involving the daily-rated staff

of the City Council have been referred to a Commission

of  Inquiry under the chairmanship of the Commissioner

for   Labour.   These  protracted   negotiations   and

reference  to  a Board of Inquiry and a Commission  of

Inquiry consume much valuable time and energy of  both

the  staff  of  the  Government and officials  of  the

unions.  But  they  are  an  essential  part  of   the

democratic  process  whereby an  acceptable  and  fair

settlement  of disputes between employer and  employee

can be reached.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reform of importance which was carried

out  during  last  year  concerns  the  acceptance  in

accordance  with our election pledge of the  principle

of equal pay and equal treatment for women officers in

the Civil Service. Equality for women took effect from

1st   March,  1962,  and  some  4,500  women  officers

benefited  from  this  reform  in  several  ways.  The

equalization  of salary scales is one  obvious  method

whereby previous discrimination against women officers

has  been  abolished. Secondly, married women officers

who  had been debarred from appointment on a permanent

and  pensionable  basis on account  of  marriage,  now

stand   to   benefit   from  the   removal   of   such

disqualification.  They thus  stand  to  gain  greater

security  in  tenure  of office and  better  promotion

prospects  and, of course, better retirement  benefits

by   way   of   pension   rights.   Other   forms   of

discrimination against women officers, such  as  lower

age   retirement,  downgrading  of  women  clerks   on

marriage   to   assistant  clerks  and  discrimination

against women officers in the highest echelon  of  the

Civil   Service  were  abolished.  Before  the  P.A.P.

Government came to office, the administrative  service

was the preserve of men. Since



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



then  seven women officers have been appointed to  the

Administrative  Service aid, in fact, in  last  year's

recruiting   exercise  the  majority   of   successful

candidates  were women. We have accorded  women  equal

treatment and we look forward with confidence to equal

performance by them.



<br><br><i>After Malaysia</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, earlier in my speech I told hon. Members that I

would   say  something  about  probable  trends  after

Malaysia.  I  deal  first with Singapore.  So  far  as

Singapore  is concerned, the most important  objective

is  to ensure that the economic expansion of the  last 18  months  or so should not be allowed  to  lose  its

momentum.  Without Malaysia and the common market,  it

is  likely  that this expansion will be  difficult  to

sustain  beyond  a  few years,  even  under  the  most

favourable  conditions. In fact, without Malaysia,  it

is  likely that we shall witness a return to political

strife inspired by the pro-Communist elements who  are

now  being  kept  under control. With  the  return  to

instability,  whatever gains that have  been  made  in

recent  months will be rapidly dissipated and economic

decline will inevitably set in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with Malaysia and the common market, we look

forward  with  confidence not only to the continuation

of  the  present rate of expansion but to  its  actual

acceleration.  Industrial growth is likely  to  gather

momentum  from year to year after Malaysia and  before

long,  industry will be making a greater  contribution

to our national income than trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important in the years to come that we deploy

the  maximum resources in money and men to  accelerate

the growth of our industries. At present, we have more

capital   than  we  can  profitably  use   in   direct

investment  in  industry.  This  is  because  of   the

limitations of the present economic situation. But  it

will not be tong, however, before the position will be

reversed when we shall be in need of more capital than

in fact we possess.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some extent this can be made good by the inflow

of  overseas  capital. But we must remember  that  the

basis of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



future growth must come mostly from our own resources.

Further,  as  I shall explain soon, we shall  have  to

bear  a  fair  share  of  the  responsibility  in  the

provision of capital for the development of the Borneo

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One encouraging element in our present situation is

the  slowing  down  of population growth  to  which  I

earlier  referred. In future, the development  of  our

social  services,  which is necessary  to  sustain  an

increasing  standard of living,  will  take  the  form

largely   of   improvement  of  quality  rather   than

quantitative  extension  of  services   at   a   fixed

standard. While this decline in the rate of population

growth is welcome, the present rate is still too  high

and  we  should continue in our endeavours further  to

reduce it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking Malaysia as a whole, the future is full of

both  promise and challenge. There will be a territory

of  129,000  square  miles with  a  population  of  10

million.  The resources of the States of Malaysia  are

valuable  and  varied.  Much  of  these  still   await

development  and exploitation. The Borneo  territories

in  particular are in urgent need of development. They

need  to develop not only their natural resources  but

also to develop their social services, particularly in

education. A large section of the population in Borneo

still  live  in tribal societies often in  remote  and

inaccessible  places.  The  cost  of  providing  these

communities  with roads, schools, health services  and

other  modern  amenities  will  involve  a  staggering

amount  of finance which is quite beyond their present

domestic   resources   to  provide.   Therefore,   the

wealthier  sections of Malaysia, such  as  Malaya  and

Singapore, must fulfil their obligation to provide the

capital that will be needed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are likely to prosper in Malaysia and it is only

right  that  a  share  of  the  additional  prosperity

brought about by Malaysia should be made available  to

the  under-developed parts of Malaysia. As  the  Prime

Minister  of  the  Federation of Malaya  has  put  it,

Malaysia  will be the goose that will lay  the  golden

eggs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



in  Singapore. Indeed, in his own words,  Tunku  Abdul

Rahman  has said that Singapore shall be the New  York

of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be wrong for us in Singapore to adopt a

selfish and grasping policy after Malaysia and to  try

to  hog the whole prosperity for ourselves. This  will

bring  resentment in other States of Malaysia  and  in

the  end this will rebound to our disadvantage. At the

same time, we cannot share the golden eggs before they

are laid. If I can mix my metaphors, we must not count

our  golden geese before the eggs are hatched.  If  we

prosper,  and the indications are that we will,  I  am

sure  that the people of Singapore will not be wanting

in generosity and enlightened self-interest in sharing

the additional prosperity with all in Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we live in an era where momentous events are taking place. In Singapore, the history of the last ten years have been full of strife, tumult and excitement. There are many people who consider that we have had more than our share of strife and that it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



is  about time that the energies and effervescence  of

our  youthful society be diverted towards constructive

endeavours.  There  is much wisdom in  this  approach.

Malaysia will provide the solid framework within which

we   can   create  in  Singapore  a  progressive   and

prosperous society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
