<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 19 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

over  and above the questions raised by the  Member

for  the  Southern Islands, I wish  to  raise  this

particular  question. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  you  will

notice,  under  sub-head 18, the  words  "Temporary

Staff"  appear. As far as this House has been  able

to  understand,  it would appear that  the  parking

meter  scheme has come to be regarded as  something

which  will be permanent in Singapore. If  that  is

so,  is  there  any  point  in  keeping  the  staff

temporary? In those circumstances, should  not  the

staff be made permanent?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye): Mr

Speaker,  I  will take this opportunity,  first  of

all, to review the position of the car parks. Since

we  started opening the pay-as-you-park  scheme  on

the  21st of December last year, up to the 30th  of

last  month we have collected altogether a  revenue

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



$351,337.  The total charges amounted to  $168,260.

That brings into the Consolidated Fund a profit  of

$183,077. Apart from the dollars and cents  of  the

business,  it is more gratifying to note  that  the

scheme   has   given  employment  to   77   parking

attendants and six other staff. The reason why  the

staff  engaged  on  this scheme has  been  labelled

temporary is that when the scheme was initiated, it

came  under  the  supervision of the  Registrar  of

Vehicles, which was then a department of  the  City

Council. As Members in the House know, we  are  now

in the process of integrating City Council services

with  the Central Government. The staff engaged  on

this   scheme  must,  therefore,  come  under   the

temporary category, as distinct from those  on  the

establishment.  In other words,  they  are  paid  a

provident fund, but they do not receive a  pension.

Moreover,  such staff are not transferable  to  any

other   department  of  the  Government.  In   this

connection,  I  may draw as a basis for  comparison

other  staff who are employed on schemes  like  the

Work  Brigade. Members of the Work Brigade are also

on  the  temporary establishment, as distinct  from

those  on the civil list. That, I hope, will answer

the question raised by the Member for Farrer Park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Member for the Southern Islands

mentioned  that  some motorists  were  dissatisfied

with the service provided in the car parks. I would

like  it  very much if the Member for the  Southern

Islands  could give me specific instances where  my

car  park attendants have been discourteous, and  I

will promise him that investigations will be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since the car park scheme was started, I have

received  only  two letters of complaint  addressed

personally   to   me.  Both  of  them   have   been

investigated. One of them was found to be the fault

of  the  motorist himself; and in the case  of  the

other one, we found that the car park attendant was

not in any way responsible for scratches being made

on his car.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car park attendants are provided with uniforms

after  their  probationary period of three  months.

Those who are newly engaged are in mufti, but after



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



they  have  been tried and they satisfy the  senior

parking  attendant of their capabilities, they  are

confirmed  and  are issued with uniforms.  However,

they  are  not  given a number, and  the  idea  put

forward by the Member for the Southern Islands that

car park attendants should be so distinguished will

be looked into. Nonetheless, I would like to inform

the  Member for the Southern Islands that in  every

car park there is always a senior parking attendant

who  is located in a kiosk, and if any motorist has

any   complaints  to  make  against  a   car   park

attendant, he is at complete liberty to go straight

to  the  senior  parking attendant  and  lodge  his

complaint, or, alternatively, write a letter to the

Registrar  of  Vehicles and his complaint  will  be

attended  to.  But  in  justice  to  the  car  park

attendants,  I  would say that not  all  the  blame

falls  upon  them.  It  has  been  brought  to   my

attention  by  the  car park attendants  themselves

that   many   motorists  are  selfish.  They   park

overtime; they then quietly steal into the car park

and   drive   off  without  paying  any  surcharge.

Naturally,  when they are stopped by the  car  park

attendant, some of these motorists begin to protest

quite  violently. I would say that my  sympathy  is

more  with  the car park attendants than  with  the

motorists, because the job of a car park  attendant

is  not an easy one. He has to stay out in the  sun

or in the rain to look after the car park lots, and

he  has  to  be patient with motorists who  can  be

adamant, stubborn and may even be non-co-operative.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

his  speech  just  now, the Deputy  Prime  Minister

described the car park attendants as his  car  park

attendants. If they are his car park attendants, it

would  seem  to  appear, Sir, that  the  allegation

outside  that these car park attendants are  P.A.P.

members  has  a foundation. As Dr Toh himself,  he

has  no car park attendants, but as a member of the

Government, yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car park attendants are the servants of the

Government  and  therefore  the  servants  of   the

public.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> You see, Mr Speaker, I am

quite different from the Member for Cairnhill -



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Ex-Member for Havelock.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I expect loyalty from those who

serve  under me, as the head of my Ministry; so  it

is  natural  that  those  who  are  working  in  my

departments should expect a degree of loyalty  from

their  Minister.  When  I refer  to  the  car  park

attendants  as my car park attendants, I  refer  to

the  civil  servants equally as our civil servants,

or  the civil servants in my department as my civil

servants.  But I presume the Member for  Cairnhill,

when  he was once upon a time Chief Minister, never

had  that  sense of bringing the civil servants  in

sympathy with the policies he was carrying  out  at

that  time, and so he could never at any time refer

to  his  civil  servants  as  his  civil  servants.

However,  I would like to kill the charge  made  by

the   Member  for  Cairnhill  that  the  car   park

attendants  are  all  P.A.P. members.   Car   park

attendants are appointed not because of their party

affiliations;  and  if  the  Member  for  Cairnhill

wishes  to  know,  I  can inform  him  that  these

attendants were recruited from the Labour Exchange.

They were selected by a committee set up under  the

City Council's Welfare and Labour Section. Most  of

the  candidates  have come from the  Work  Brigade.

That is in keeping with the declaration made by the

Government some months back that in future most  of

the Division IV posts will be filled by members  of

the Work Brigade, and we see no reason why car park

attendants should not also be recruited  from  this

Work  Brigade. However, to lay the charge that they

are  P.A.P. members and are therefore appointed  as

car park attendants is quite unfair.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have never

laid  any  charge  at  all.  I  said  there  is  an

allegation  outside  that car park  attendants  are

P.A.P. members, and that is why the  Minister  has

described  them  as  his car park  attendants.  His

reply  now shows that although he cannot  say  that

all car park attendants



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



are  P.A.P. members, he does admit that  there  are

quite  a good number of P.A.P. members who are  car

park attendants.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, what particular party the

car  park  attendants  belong  to  is  none  of  my

business.  They  are chosen because  of  their  (1)

honesty, (2) ability to deal with the public.  This

is  a Division IV post really where members of  the

public  service  have important relationships  with

the public at large. No one is taken on because  he

is  a  P.A.P. member, but he is taken on if he  can

show that, first of all, he is honest, that he will

not  pinch  money,  or  that he  will  defraud  the

motorists.  That  is the simple criterion  for  the

selection. The Member for Cairnhill has  said  that

he  has not made the allegation but by repeating it

here, he has made an imputation and, therefore,  it

is up to me to clear the point.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, English is indeed a

difficult  language. If I were to  keep  on  saying

what  I  have said, it will not get through to  the

Deputy Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, may I come back to the point of my

question,  leaving aside the constitutional  issues

involved  in  the Minister calling  his  staff  "my

staff"?  On  "Temporary Staff",  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister  gave the House the impression that  these

people  will  continue to be designated  temporary,

even though the parking meter scheme has come to be

a permanent feature of the Budget, and he sought an

analogy with members of the Work Brigade. The point

there  is quite different. The members of the  Work

Brigade  are  only  there in  order  to  carry  out

certain  schemes of the Government,  and  if  those

schemes  are not voted for from year to year,  then

the  need for the Work Brigade goes. But here where

the  parking meter scheme has become a  feature  of

our national life - and I expect it to be a permanent

feature - should  employees working  on  that  scheme

continue to be labelled "temporary"? I do not think

it is fair to them.

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems to

me   that   the   Minister  concerned   has   given

clarification  at length, but he has not  clarified

my point. Possibly he thought that the reason why I

brought up this amendment was that the workers  are

P.A.P. members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that the service given by the parking

attendants  is  not  satisfactory.  Their   uniform

cannot be distinguished from that of drivers.  When

we  wish  to park our cars, we have to look  around

for  the parking attendants, and sometimes it takes

about  ten minutes for one to come along. A  person

who  uses these parking places is usually  one  who

has  important business to attend to, and he cannot

afford to waste time. Therefore, if he has to  look

around for an attendant, I feel that the service is

not   satisfactory.  It  is  only  right  that  the

Government  should  look  into  this  matter.   The

attendants could be given a distinctive uniform  so

that  they could be easily distinguished from other

people  in  the parking places. That is the  reason

why I brought up this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> In reply to the Member for the

Southern Islands about motorists having to wait for

some   time  before  they  can  find  a  car   park

attendant,  I would like to inform the  House  that

each  attendant has to look after 26 parking  lots.

If  we  give  an  allowance  for  absences  due  to

sickness, leave, and so on, on the average it works

out  to  each  attendant having to  look  after  30

parking  lots. One way of solving the  problem,  of

course,   would  be  to  engage  more  car  parking

attendants so that one attendant can look after  15

parking lots. But that would not be economical  for

the  simple reason that if one car parking  lot  is

full,  it  remains so for hours, and then  we  will

have idle attendants and under-worked staff. It has

never  been  brought to my attention as a  specific

complaint that a motorist has got to wait  as  long

as  ten minutes for a car parking attendant to come

to  him.  But  if,  as I have said previously,  the

Member  for  the  Southern Islands could  state  in

which particular car parking lot he experienced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



such a difficulty, I will assure him that all these

little problems could be ironed out.

question  raised by the Member for Farrer  Park.  I

we  are now in the process of integrating the  City

Council  services with the central government,  and

until that is completed, they do not yet come under

the   control  of  the  Establishment  Office.  But

presumably,  when  integration is  completed,  they

will  come  under  the control of the  Ministry  of

Finance. The Establishment Office will then be in a

position to decide what services are temporary  and

what services are to be permanent.

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (1) of  sub-head

16.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item (1) of sub-head 16 reads "Co-operative

Education...$1,500".  I  seek  information  as   to

whether  the  Government is going to encourage  the

expansion  of co-operative societies in  Singapore,

or is this matter to be treated as "frozen"? If one

looks  at  the expenditure for 1959, one will  find

that  over  $5,000  has  been  allocated  for  this

purpose.  I  cannot  find  any  portion   of   this

expenditure being allocated elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, I would like to bring to the

notice  of  this House the sad state of affairs  in

some   co-operative  societies  which   have   been

established  for quite some time. There  is  now  a

shortage  of  officers  to run  them  successfully.

Previously,  there  was  an  officer  who  received

training abroad and, as far as I know, this officer

has now been transferred to another department; and

he  has been replaced by his assistant who is short

of  staff to help him in his job. I would  like  to

say   that  several  long-established  co-operative

societies  will  be forced to close  down  for  the

reason that they cannot function successfully. This

can  be  attributed to the fact that their  members

are  not very active. In particular, I know of  two

co-operative  societies  in  the  Southern  Islands

which  are  run  by  officers who  have  a  limited

knowledge  of  how to run them. They need  guidance

and   education   from   the  proper   co-operative

department.  As  a result of the  shortage  of

co-operative officers skilled in administrative  work,

there  is  no doubt that some of these co-operative

societies  do  not receive the guidance  that  they

should receive. The co-operative movement should be

expanded and the societies should be guided to  run

on  economic lines. It is appropriate therefore for

the Government, if it is their intention to see the

expansion  of the co-operative movement, to  engage

more  Co-operative Officers, keep  an  eye  on  the

existing  co-operative societies,  and  render  all

assistance  to these Officers by disseminating  the

principles of co-operative societies, and so on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the provision of $1,500 for

Co-operative Education is intended for the  purpose

of  defraying expenses for persons attending  talks

and    lectures    on   co-operative    principles,

organisation and methods, accounting systems,  etc.

during the time when they are free.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for the Southern Islands

mentioned  an  officer who was  trained  and  later

transferred to another Department. This is a matter

which  happened at the time when I was not  in  the

Ministry of National Development. But as far as the

Ministry  under me is concerned, we know  that  the

officer  who is in charge of co-operatives will  be

retiring  very soon, and we are looking forward  to

recruiting  a  young man who could be  trained,  so

that  he  could help in giving lectures to officers

of  co-operative societies all over the  Island  to

revive the activities of such societies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 1960, due to a reorganisation of the

Department  and  preparatory work in  strengthening

the  co-operative movement, not much work was  done

to  give  such lectures to officers of co-operative

societies.  But  I can assure the  Member  for  the

Southern  Islands that when the training of  a  new

officer has been finalised, measures will be  taken

to  improve  facilities to train  officers  of

co-operative  societies to revive  the  activities  of

such societies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this provision, the vote says, "Allowances to

part-time   inoculators,   rural   organisers   and

Minister  concerned  whether the  increase  in  the

provision



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



is  for  additional  strength of  inoculators  from

Government  service, or whether it  is  to  provide

inoculation courses for the rural people. As far as

I  know, there are no inoculation facilities in the

Southern  Islands,  so that the islanders  have  to

come  to  Singapore  for the inoculation  of  their

poultry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, part-time

inoculators  are persons employed  from  the  rural

areas to work in the same district where they  come

from.  All of them have a rural background and  are

engaged  in  agriculture in one  form  or  another.

Their  main  functions are to  carry  out  pig  and

poultry inoculation for farmers, under supervision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present there are 33 part-time inoculators, and

14  other  part-time inoculators are engaged.  That

accounts  for the additional expenditure stated  in

the  Estimates.  The 14 part-time  inoculators  are

specially recruited to carry out the inoculation of

young  chicks.  It is intended to  inoculate  these

young chicks at Telok Ayer Quarantine Station  when

they  are  a day old, so that protection  will  be

given  to  them. When the chicks are six days  old,

another  inoculation is done free  of  charge.  The

reason  why  I  engage  these  14  other  part-time

inoculators  is  that  we want  to  provide  better

services   throughout  the  island  of   Singapore,

including the Southern Islands.

therefore the

reasons  which  the Hon. the Deputy Prime  Minister

advanced for the temporary nature of this staff  do

not  apply? The second point is: there  is  a  vote

"Yang di-Pertuan Negara" under Head 1, and I submit

that  this particular vote should appear under Head

1,  so  that the public would know exactly what  it

is for 55 daily-rated mandores, motor mower drivers

$3.15  per day onwards. Their duties include  grass

said in the Hansard.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may come back to

my own particular problems. The first problem which

I  raised,  Mr  Speaker, was Government  employing

people  who  have  been in Government  service,  it

would  appear, for a number of years, and yet being

treated as temporary. That I think is a question of

principle which the Government must fairly meet and

solve.  Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will run your  eye

over  sub-head  5,  item (I), you  will  see  under

paragraph  (vii), "Other Temporary Staff - $109,850".

The  only  persons,  it  would  appear,  to  be  in

permanent  employment in the  Botanic  Gardens  are

people  who  hold  grades like  Mandore,  Grade  I;

Watchmen;  Mason.  Grade II; Carpenter,  Grade  II;

Gardeners, Grade II; Signwriters, Grade  II.  There

appear to be about ten permanent employees only  in

the  Botanic Gardens As for the rest of them. I  do

not  know how many there are. If $75,000 is for 55,

then I take it $109,000 might be for well over 100.

So  it  would  appear that in the  Botanic  Gardens

there  are  about 11 permanent employees and  about

150  temporary  employees. If  that  is  so,  I  am

suggesting  to the Government that the position  is

very unsatisfactory and they should look into it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. May I just comment on that?

That  obviously  is  a matter  of  principle  which

appears  to me to come under the portfolio  of  the

Minister for Finance (Establishment). Therefore, if

an  opportunity presents itself, perhaps the Member

would like to raise that point when we come to Head

28.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The other point, Mr Speaker, Sir,

involved  in  the  question raised  by  me  is  the

question  of  the Istana Negara Domain,  which  has

certain  items of expenditure under  it.  This  may

appear to be a small matter, Mr Speaker, Sir,  but

I think the principle



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



involved  will be accepted by the Government,  that

if  part of the Istana Negara Domain is occupied by

Government  servants, then I  would  like  to  know

whether  the grounds which are appurtenant  to  the

houses   occupied   by  Government   servants   are

maintained by these daily-rated employees. If  that

is  so,  then  I  think it would  not  be  correct,

because   other  quarters  occupied  by  Government

servants are not maintained by the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not aware

of  what the Member for Farrer Park has just  said,

that  is, about Government servants staying in  the

Istana  Negara Domain and whether the  grounds  are

being  kept  by these employees. If the Member  for

Farrer Park has information of that kind, and if he

will give it to me, I will certainly look into it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I take it that this may be an

appropriate item for the Estimates Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is perhaps

an  appropriate item for the Estimates Committee as

to whether it should appear under this head or some

other  head.  But  the point  I  wish  to  make  in

principle is this. Under the previous Government  I

know  for  a fact that certain houses were occupied

by  Government  servants.  But  under  the  present

Government  I  am  not  quite  sure  whether  those

quarters  which  had  been occupied  by  Government

servants are being occupied by Government servants.

If  that  is  so,  and if their grounds  are  being

maintained  out of this vote, then I am  suggesting

to  the Government that that is not proper. In view

of  that,  Mr Speaker, Sir, might I have leave  to

withdraw  these  two amendments? I  will  take  the

necessary  steps  for  the Estimates  Committee  to

consider them.

that,  during the course of the ensuing year,  some

Superintendent of Richmond Bungalow is Mrs  Balik,

who has been employed in this post since April 1960

on a basic salary of $105 per month. The reason why

she  is  getting such a low salary is that she  has

other  duties  for  which  she  is  paid  by  other

sources, these duties being supervision of  holiday

bungalows  owned by the Federation Government,  the

Malayan Railway and some private people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, am I to understand from the

Minister's  reply that this lady has several  other

avenues  of employment, and that the basis of  this

item is that it should be related to the emoluments

which   she  gets  from  the  other  two  employing

authorities? If that is so, and if it  is  intended

to  run  Richmond Bungalow with any efficiency  and

sense  of decorum and propriety, then it is  hardly

feasible  that there will be discipline in Richmond

Bungalow - and I suppose it is necessary that holiday

bungalows  should have discipline - if the cook  gets

more  than  the Lady Superintendent, and the  house

and  mess  servant gets more than the cook.  It  is

hardly  likely  that the Lady Superintendent  could

discipline them. That is the only point. Although I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I do not think that goes to the root of

the  matter, Sir, It might assist the Deputy  Prime

Minister in his philosophy of life to poke  fun  in

that  way,  but  I think as a system of  budgeting,

there  is  a  system of employment where  different

grades are given different salaries because one  is

superior  to the other. Assuming that that  is  the

correct way of maintaining discipline, then  paying

the  Lady Superintendent, who appears first on  the

list,  a  lesser salary than the other  two  hardly

conduces to discipline. As I was sitting down, Sir,

my neighbour, the Lady from Mount-batten, says that

perhaps  it is because she is a woman that  she  is

being  paid  less.  I  do not know.  There  may  be

something in that. But anyway there it is.  But  if

you  run your eye over page 143, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

you  will find that the Lady Supervisor there  gets

quite a handsome emolument, whereas this particular

Lady  Superintendent that we have  been  discussing

seems to be, on the face of it, ill-paid.

less  but  merely to draw a comparison  that  while

this  lady  gets $1,280, the other Lady  Supervisor

gets $6,000 a year. Could the Minister for National

what  the  other Government and the private  bodies

are  paying  this  Lady  Superintendent.  But  this

arrangement  has  been going on for  quite  a  long

time.  Ever  since  it  came about,  the  Singapore

Government has been paying only part of  this  Lady

Superintendent's  total  wages.  In  addition,  she

receives  wages  from  the  Federation  of  Malaya,

Malayan  Railway  and  private  organisations.  The

emolument  paid to her by the Singapore  Government

can  therefore be treated as only an honorarium  in

respect of the supervision of the bungalow itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has touched on the Lady

Supervisor  of  Government Holiday Bungalows.  This

Lady Supervisor of Government Holiday Bungalows  in

Singapore  is paid a salary of $423.08  per  month.

This post also carries a travelling allowance.  The

Lady Supervisor of Government Holiday Bungalows  in

Singapore  is  responsible for the maintenance  and

upkeep  of  all  Government  Holiday  Bungalows  in

Singapore,  and  for  checking inventories  of  all

furnished  Government  quarters  and  institutional

quarters.  She  also supervises watchmen  who  look

after  vacant  Government quarters. Her  duties  in

supervision  of  caretakers and bungalow  servants,

checking   inventories,  making  surprise   checks,

providing  replacement of crockery, cutlery,  linen

and  furniture, and the raising of public  debtors'

too  far.  The only point I wish to make,  Sir,  is

that  it did not make good reading, looking at  the

Budget, for the Lady Superintendent to be  getting

very  much less. But it would appear from what  the

Minister has said that she is an employee of  three

or  four different authorities and, therefore, this

$1,280  is related to the emoluments she gets  from

the  other authorities. If that be so, Sir, why did

the  Lady  Superintendent of the previous year  get

$1,400,  whereas the employment of the one who  has

that public demand, Government and the City Council

cost, and as a result of that, those two crematoria

were  constructed.  As far as I can  remember,  Mr

years  ago. But I understand that they are  not  in

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, could the Minister concerned first clarify whether the cooks in the General Hospital

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Sheng Nam Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if

yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> For patients and others?

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, apart

from these cooks, could I be informed whether there

are other cooks? Are there Muslim cooks? Because  I

am told by people of Islamic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



faith,  who  are patients in the General  Hospital,

that from the food prepared it cannot be determined

whether  it is cooked mixed or otherwise.  But  the

crockery used to serve the food is irrespective  of

whether the patients are of Islamic faith or  other

faith.  This state of affairs will make the  Malays

reluctant to go to the hospital for treatment. As I

have said, one of the main reasons is that the food

is being mixed freely.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Sir, I would like to be informed

whether these are the only cooks. In the opinion of

the Ministry of Health, the number of cooks may  be

sufficient  and there is no necessity  to  increase

the  number. Are the duties of these cooks  carried

out according to a fixed schedule?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have had

occasion  during previous sittings to  remark  that

the  Member for Kampong Kembangan is wont to  speak

on false premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to state here categorically that, in so far

as  the  diets in the hospital are concerned,  they

are  not mixed. Muslim patients have Muslim  diets,

and  the other patients have other diets. The diets

are  never  mixed. Neither is the  crockery  mixed.

Perhaps  the Estimates do not show the position  of

the  cooks as clearly as it is. Item (287) of

sub-head  1 provides only six cooks and item (285)  one

hospital cook. This does not mean that the  General

Hospital employs only seven cooks to look after the

diets   of  more  than  1,000  patients.   Due   to

arrangements  made  in  the previous  regime,  many

cooks  have  been  classified  under  hospital  and

health  servants. In fact, at the  present  moment,

there are 31 medical and health servants working as

cooks in the General Hospital. The cooks designated

in  the Estimates are actually head cooks and cooks

in  charge  of  particular kitchens and  particular

diets.  Under  item  (287),  where  there  are  six

Special  Grade Cooks, only four cooks  are  holding

substantive posts, and two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



posts  have been vacant for some time. My  Ministry

has  asked  the  Establishment Office  to  unfreeze

these two posts so that circulars or advertisements

could  be put out for Malay cooks in particular  to

fill  these posts. Actually one of these posts  has

been  unfrozen  and we have put out  circulars  for

Malays  and Muslim Indians only. So far  there  has

been  no applicant. Because the post is a promotion

post, only serving officers of Grades I, II and III

are  eligible  to  apply. We have  therefore  again

written  to  the Establishment Office  to  ask  for

approval   and   permission  to  circularise   this

particular  post to all serving officers,  limiting

the  applicants to only Malays and Muslim  Indians.

In  so  far as the other cooks are concerned, there

are  31 medical and health servants performing  the

functions  of  cooks, and of these  there  are  two

Muslims  who  prepare the Muslim diets  and  Muslim

food.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

But  I  am  surprised  that  when  we  ask  for  an

explanation  we  are alleged to be people  who  are

forced  to  get  food from outside. I  raised  this

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Item (3) of sub-head 104 reads

"Crockery  and  Cutlery".  Perhaps  it   would   be

convenient to discuss this topic as well, as it  is

on the same principle of segregating Muslim food. I

take  it that there are no objections. Inche  Ahmad

Jabri.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on

the  subject of Muslim food, this is quite  an  old

story concerning the Malays. This matter is brought

up  in  this Assembly with a view to improving  the

state   of  affairs  concerning  Muslim   food   in

hospitals.  It  is  proper that matters  concerning

Muslim  food  should be put right. It  is  not  our

intention  to  bring this matter  up  in  order  to

belittle  those  who are non-Muslims.  We  want  to

avoid giving such an impression in respect of

non-Muslim  patients  in the General Hospital.  It  has

been  said that the Malays do not prefer to receive

treatment in hospitals because they have more faith

in  the bomohs. But I say here frankly that that is

not  the  true  reason.  The  reason  is  that  the

treatment  in  the hospitals does not conform  with

their   religious  requirements  as  regards  their

particular diet. If we believe in the principle  of

upholding  religious  freedom,  then  this   matter

should  not be treated lightly. We have,  in  fact,

brought this state of affairs to the notice of  the

hospital authorities, and they have replied to  the

effect  that it is not possible for them to provide

special treatment for Muslim patients on the ground

that  this will incur additional expense.  This  is

not  proper reasoning. As stated by the Member  for

Kampong  Kembangan,  the real grouse  is  that  the

different diets are brought to the patients  placed

on  the  same  trolley and the  same  crockery  and

cutlery  is  being  used.  Naturally,  the   Muslim

patients feel that they have no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



appetite  to partake of food served by the hospital

authorities. This state of affairs should be looked

into   by  the  hospital  authorities  and  special

attention  should be paid to the  needs  of  Muslim

patients so as to make them happy in the hospitals.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

stated  just now that the diets supplied  to  Malay

patients  are  not  mixed  with  those  for   other

patients, and I say it again here that the utensils

are  definitely separated from the utensils for the

other  patients. I am not aware that they  use  the

same scoop or the same spoon for scooping different

diets. The instructions are that Muslim food is  to

be scooped with a special scoop reserved for Muslim

diets only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of the trolley, however, I am

unable  to assure the House that different trolleys

are  used,  simply  because of the  fact  that  the

trolleys used in the Hospital are very expensive as

they   are  electrically  operated,  with   heating

devices  and  other  gadgets. It  is  not  actually

possible  to  provide the use of one  trolley  for,

say, one patient per ward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the trolleys, utensils and other items

are all separated.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the

Government's  budget for 1960 showed a  surplus  of

$6.8  million,  and I think an amount  expended  to

show respect to peoples of various religions cannot

be  an  expensive item of expenditure - in this  case

the   purchase  of  trolleys  for  different  uses.

Another point I wish to raise is that from  what  I

know  special attention is given to food  for  Sikh

patients, but no special service is given to Muslim

patients.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



been  very  persistent  on matters  concerning  the

Muslim    religion.    We    all    realise     the

susceptibilities and sensitivities of the  Muslims,

the  Christians,  the Buddhists,  the  Hindus,  the

aethists,  and  so on; but if we were  to  run  the

State  according to the innumerable sects  that  we

have  in  Singapore, I am quite sure that it  would

not  be  possible  for  any administration  to  run

smoothly.  I  would only like to make  this  point:

that  while  the great teachings of all  religions,

including  the  Muslim religion, are tolerance  and

liberalism,  I  would like to  point  out,  as  all

Members  of this House know, that there are  public

eating  places to which Muslims go where  there  is

even  much  less care or division of  crockery  and

utensil  as  has  been taken  now  in  the  General

Hospital.

concerned  and where Malay attendants are available

to  do  it. I might state here that my Ministry  is

paying  particular attention to the  employment  of

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of

the  first  things  the new  Government  did  on

assuming  office  was  to open  the  avenues  of

employment in the nursing and midwifery services

to  people from the vernacular schools. As  soon

as  we  came into power, we announced  a  scheme

whereby  we  opened  the doors  of  the  nursing

service  and  the midwifery service to  students

qualified  in  Chinese and  Malay  schools.  The

qualifications  in general for  Pupil  Assistant

Nurses  and  Pupil Midwives are  very  much  the

same -  Form III or the equivalent in  any  other

vernacular  schools. It is interesting  to  note

that  in all the advertisements the Ministry  of

Health  has  put out in relation to applications

for Assistant Nurses and Pupil Midwives, we have

always stated that the requirements are Form Ill

or  a Chinese school equivalent of Junior Middle

III,  or  the Malay school equivalent of  Darjah

VII.  I would like to state here, Sir, that most

authorities on Malay do not consider that Darjah

VII    is   the   equivalent   of   Form    III.

Notwithstanding the expert opinion  and  advice,

we  have insisted upon inserting "Darjah VII" in

all  our  advertisements, so as  to  give  Malay

girls  a chance of applying for these particular

training  posts.  The qualifications  for  Pupil

Midwives  are  exactly the  same  as  those  for

Assistant  Nurses. Up to date, we have  received

several   applications  from  Malay  girls   who

possess  Darjah  VII, and they have  been  taken

into the service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the racial analysis of the

nursing  service and midwifery service,  I  have

some figures here: there are at present 33 Malay

Staff  Midwives, 14 Pupil Midwives. 57 Assistant

Nurses. It has been the policy of my Ministry to

give priority to all Malay applicants in all the

various fields.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



4 15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last Assembly Budget sitting here, my

Minister gave an assurance that we would look  into

the  health  of  the  Malays, particularly  in  the

kampongs and the rural areas, and it is with a view

to  fulfilling  this  promise  that  we  have  paid

special  attention  to Malay applicants  so  as  to

enable  us  to  send  more Malay nurses,  assistant

nurses, and midwives into the rural areas to  bring

medical and health services to the Malay people  in

the kampongs and the rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir, I

feel  that  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the

Minister  for Health has not replied  to  my  other

questions.  Who  are the people  who  will  recruit

these  applicants? Is it the Ministry of Health  or

the Public Service Commission?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> The Public Service Commission

recruits all the staff for the public service.  But

it  always  seeks  the  advice  of  the  Ministries

concerned as to what qualifications are needed  for

the filling of the various posts. In this case,  we

have  advised them specifically that Darjah VII  is

acceptable to us.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, that

explanation is quite clear. But I still would  like

to  know this. Yesterday the Prime Minister told me

that the Public Service Commission has carried  out

its  work with integrity and justice. But just  now

the  Parliamentary Secretary has told us  that  the

Public Service Commission would get advice from the

Ministry of Health in regard to vacant posts in the

Ministry.  Therefore, how could it be possible  for

the  members  of the Public Service  Commission  to

recruit people with Darjah VII when there are other

people  with  better qualifications? For  instance,

there are quite a good number of people with Senior

Cambridge  qualifications. Therefore, I cannot  see

how  the  opportunity is really  open.  Perhaps  my

doubts   could  be  clarified  at  length  by   the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps I

have  not been clearly understood. I only said that

with   regard  to  technical  matters,  the  Public

Service Commission always seeks the advice  of  the

Ministry  that  is  requiring the  staff.  In  this

particular instance, the Ministry of Health is  the

only competent authority to say what qualifications

and  what  standard of education are  required  for

people   performing  specialist  duties,  such   as

assistant   nurses,   doctors,   pathologists   and

surgeons.  I  think  it  has  nothing  to  do  with

slurring the Public Service Commission. The  Public

Service Commission seeks advice on technical points

and the Ministry of Health offers such advice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the other question concerning the

availability   of  so  many  people   with   Senior

Cambridge  qualification, the answer is that  there

are two categories of nurses. Nurses in general and

assistant   nurses.   Those  people   with   Senior

Cambridge  qualification are entitled  to  and  are

eligible to apply for the posts as nurses  and  not

assistant nurses. The assistant nurses are a  crass

of  posts  created  some few years  ago  to  absorb

especially the less highly qualified members of the

public  into the service with, of course,  a  lower

emolument.   They  are  two  different   types   of

officers.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

understand  that.  I  do not wish  to  pursue  this

matter  any  further. But in  policy  we  see  that

Darjah  VII qualification is acceptable,  and  Form

III  and  the  Senior Cambridge qualifications  are

high qualifications. Therefore, people who wish  to

go further into the subject of health science, etc.

would surely be given opportunities. I do not  wish

to pursue this matter any further. I merely wish to

raise the hope that the matter will be looked into.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would suggest to Members of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 25 be

1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Kandang Kerbau Maternity Hospital, Mr

Speaker,   there  appears  this  particular   item,

"Specialists  Allowance - $9,000"  for  the   ensuing

year. But for the approved Estimates for 1960,  the

specialists allowance is put down at $50,000. On an

examination of the whole Budget, Mr Speaker, there

are  specialists  allowances with regard  to  other

hospitals where the quantum of money voted for  the

ensuing  year  remain the same. In this  particular

instance, the vote is being reduced from $50,000 to

$9,000.  Could the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister for Health inform the House why it is that

a reduction is necessary? Is it because there is no

further  need  for the large number of  specialists

that   used  to  be  at  Kandang  Kerbau  Maternity

Hospital?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the

Member  for Farrer Park will look under the Remarks

column, he will notice an item "Title changed  from

Fees  to  Specialists". I would also refer  him  to

page 222 of the Estimates under sub-head 119. There

exists  a  new item, "Specialist fees for  services

performed  by  University of  Malaya  staff"  under

Kandang  Kerbau Maternity Hospital. The  specialist

fees  actually increased from $50,000  to  $69,000,

and the Treasury, on re-examining the Budget before

this  particular one was presented, felt that  fees

payable  to  the University specialists  should  be

entered as a separate item from that being paid  to

the  Government  servants, because  the  specialist

fees  due  to  the  Government servants  come  from

Government revenue, and the specialist fees for the

University  specialists  are  monies  collected  on

behalf  of  the  University by  the  Hospital.  The

previous Budget provided only $6,000 for specialist

allowances  for  Government  medical  officers   or

specialists  within that $50,000  sum.  This  year,

however, it is proposed to appoint the

Sir,  - if you doubt my word, you can find out  from

outside   this  Assembly - there  are  many   Malays,

whether  they  come from the Malay or the  Boyanese

community, who find it difficult to get these jobs.

The  population  of  Singapore  is  increasing  and

vacant  posts are very scarce. Therefore,  to  find

vacant  posts  such as these is still difficult.  I

hope  that  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the

Minister for Health could tell us whether today, in

order to qualify as drivers, it is necessary for  a

driver to have a licence which is not only good but

he must also know the national language, and so on.

I   do   not   know  if  there  are   any   special

qualifications required to recruit drivers. At  the

moment,  it is very difficult for Malays to  become

drivers.

these two clinics and who have left the service are

invited  back to perform the functions  of  private

consultants.  They  are  employed  on  a  sessional

basis, being paid $25 per

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this particular item has in past years shown

a vote of $80,000. As far as I can gather, in 1958,

1959  and  even 1960, there was a vote of  $80,000.

Now  for  1961,  it is proposed  to  reduce  it  to

$63,200.  I am wondering whether this reduction  is

due  to  the  fact that the Government  anticipates

that,  because of its family planning drive,  there

will  be  less children next year, or is it because

the  Government  feels that there  should  be  less

feeding of children?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

reduction  is  actually based on the actual

under-expenditure incurred in 1959. I am quite piqued  by

the  Member  for  Cairnhill when he suggested  that

this reduction might be in anticipation of the very

effective   publicity  campaign  evinced   by   the

exhibition  held a few days ago. I had never  dared

to  expect  such a quick reaction. However,  if  it

does  occur, I will be most pleased to  notice  it.

However,  there  is no intention  on  the  part  of

Government  to  reduce  the  distribution  of  milk

powder  to  the  more  needy and  less  unfortunate

children  of Singapore. This cut is actually  based

on  the actual under-expenditure incurred in  1959.

My  Ministry  is  prepared  to  apply  for  A.S.V.,

supplementary provisions, should the sum  appearing

in  the Budget for 1961 be insufficient to meet the

demands.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister   for  Health  has  used  the   expression

"effective publicity campaign". I am wondering  how

he  knows  straight-away whether his  campaign  has

been  effective. Surely, he should be  patient  and

wait for time. Only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>



time   can  tell  whether  his  campaign  has  been

effective.  But,  however, Mr  Kandasamy,  if  the

reduction in the vote is due to the fact that there

has  been  an  under-expenditure for  the  previous

year, surely the more realistic way of doing things

is  to  see that more of it is distributed to  more

infants rather than treat this like any other  item

in  the  Budget  where there  has  been  an

under-expenditure. That must be the real norm; treat that

as the norm.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, on the first

point  raised by the Member for Farrer Park, I  did

preface  my  statement  by  saying  that   if   the

predictions of the Member for Cairnhill came  true,

I  would  be most pleased. Actually I did also  say

that I myself had not expected the effects to be so

quick.  But  then it was at the suggestion  of  the

Member  for Cairnhill that I expected such pleasant

surprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point, I have mentioned that we are

fully prepared to apply for A.S.V.s in the event of

the vote being insufficient to cover the needs.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+The same amendment stood in the name of Mr A.P. Rajah.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the debate on the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

speech  earlier this year, I had occasion to  point

out that the rate of child mortality amongst Malays

in  Singapore was extremely high. The position  has

not  changed  since then. The latest issue  of  the

Annual  Report of the Medical Department  indicates

that  whilst  the  infantile  mortality  rate   for

Indians  and  Chinese  is 40 and  35  per  thousand

respectively, the rate for Malays is  still  85.  I

wonder,  Sir,  if the Ministry of Health  would  do

something  about it. Vast sums have been  spent  by

Government  on  family  planning  and  tuberculosis

control  in  the hope of producing  a  healthy  and

vigorous  nation. This is another branch of  health

education   which  the  Ministry  could  profitably

embark upon.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point on this head, Sir, on which

I would like to talk. That is the question of

post-mortems on Muslim bodies. This is a subject which I

am sure most Members of this Assembly are aware of,

for many of them have been approached by bereaved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



Muslim  families  for help. I am not  saying,  Sir,

that   the  post-mortem  on  Muslim  bodies,  where

necessary, should be done away with, but I  do  say

that  there  is  a  large  section  of  the  Muslim

community in Singapore who abhor the very idea of a

dead  body  being  dismembered. Today  most  Muslim

countries do conduct post-mortems, but the idea has

not caught on yet amongst the Muslims in Singapore.

A  lead  from  Government would certainly  set  the

minds of the Muslims at rest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have here, Sir, in Singapore a body known as

the  Mahkhamah Shariah; we have a Chief  Kathi  and

also  the Muslim Advisory Board. I wonder, Sir,  if

these bodies or organisations which are

Government - appointed and which understand the issue cannot  be

persuaded to issue a fetua (ruling) so as to  allay

the fears of the Muslims in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

earlier  in  the  year  when  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's  speech  was debated, I  had  occasion  to

assure  the  Member  for  Geylang  Serai  that   my

Ministry  would  give the utmost  consideration  to

looking  after  the health of the  Malays  and,  in

particular, would attempt to raise the standard  of

living and lower the infant mortality rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that the Member for Geylang Serai quoted

from  the  Medical  Report issued  some  time  ago.

Perhaps he might like to tell us the year that  the

Medical Report refers to, and then we might be able

to tell whether the indications in that Report have

anything  to  do with the present circumstances  in

Singapore. In any case, it is not possible to raise

the   standard  of  living  or  lower  the   infant

mortality rate of any particular section of  people

in  a  very quick time. These things have  to  take

time    and   can   only   proceed   very   slowly.

Superstitions,   habits,  customs   and   religious

beliefs  are  subjects not easily changed  and  not

easily  touched upon without very much opposition.

However,  I would like to take this opportunity  to

assure the hon. Member once again that the Ministry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



of  Health  is paying the utmost attention  to  the

health  of the people in Singapore in general,  and

the Malays in particular.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point of post-mortems, being a

doctor  myself, I feel somewhat qualified to  speak

on  this subject. We all know that in Singapore the

Malays  and Chinese abhor post-mortems  to  a  very

high  degree.  The Muslims have their  religion  on

their  side  and  the Government  has  always  been

careful when post-mortem examinations are performed

on Muslim patients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, in general, two types of post-mortem

examinations. The doctor in charge wants to examine

a  deceased person either because he is required to

do  so  by  law  or because he wants to  study  the

disease or the process of the disease which led  to

the  death  of  that  particular  person;  and   by

acquiring such knowledge, the doctor would be  able

to  prevent or forestall the death of persons  with

similar symptoms in future. In the first case,  the

post-mortem  is a legal obligation and nothing  can

obstruct  the process of the law. Even so, whenever

the  Ministry of Health has to perform post-mortems

in  such cases, my Ministry has always taken  pains

and  care to consult the various important  members

of  the Muslim Advisory Board, the Chief Kathi  and

the  various leading Muslims in the country.  After

our  explanations on the need for such  post-mortem

examinations, they always indicated that they  were

sympathetic to the course. Even though the right to

perform such a post-mortem examination is legal, we

have  always  sought the advice of all the  various

leading Muslims in the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second type of post-mortem examination is the

one  which  doctors  perform  for  the  benefit  of

medical   knowledge   and  for   medical   advance.

Sometimes  we  find  quite a  lot  of  difficulties

whenever  we have to perform these post-mortems  on

Malays.  In  such  cases, we always  speak  to  the

people  concerned,  and  if  they  refuse  to  give

permission  for  such examinations,  we  resort  to

asking  other well-known Muslims to advise them  or

we try to advise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



them  as best we can. However, if such advice fails

to produce any result, we usually never perform any

post-mortem examinations on such bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to impress upon this House is

that  even  though the Government has a full  legal

right  to  carry  out post-mortem  examinations  on

Muslim  bodies, we have never exercised that  right

indiscriminately,  and we have  always  sought  the

advice  of  the leading Muslims in this country  to

effect such examinations.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Kandasamy, Sir, this is the

first   time   I   have  heard   that   post-mortem

examinations are performed where there is no  legal

obligation.  Could the Minister  assure  the  House

that in future no post-mortem examinations will  be

performed  on Muslim bodies in the second

category - where there is no legal obligation?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, the performance of a

post-mortem  examination is not something to be  thought

of very lightly. The post-mortem examination itself

is expected to help the doctor to better understand

the  disease  and  the disease process.  There  are

several  diseases  which are  peculiar  to  various

racial groups, and unless such diseases are studied

in greater detail, aided by the performance of

post-mortem  examinations, it is unlikely that a clearer

understanding of the diseases can be obtained.  The

performance of a post-mortem examination is  really

in  the  interest  of the people  and  not  in  the

interest   of   the  doctor,  because   the   risks

associated   with  the  performance  of  postmortem

examinations are very great.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Kandasamy, Sir, I quite

understand a post-mortem examination of that nature

would  be of assistance to doctors, but I  do  not

see  how it can help the dead. In any case. Sir,  I

would  like  to  Withdraw my motion  but  there  is

another speaker on the same subject.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The  Chairman (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> I am afraid  the

hon.  Member  cannot  withdraw the  amendment.  The

Member  for  Farrer  Park has  not  spoken  on  the

amendment yet.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rajah.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Kandasamy, you may remember that

when  the last Budget was being discussed  in  this

House, I raised a number of questions on the Budget

with  a  view  to  eliciting information  from  the

Minister to indicate to the House that the staffing

position  in the Ministry of Health was in  such  a

condition that the facilities the Ministry have  to

provide to the public would not be provided for  at

the level which was considered reasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to inform the House

whether  since  then  the  staffing  position   has

improved   or  deteriorated.  As  far  as   I   can

understand,  and  as far as the talk  in  the  town

goes, people believe that the staffing position  in

our hospitals has not improved; if anything, it has

become  worse.  It  is  felt  that  the  member  of

specialists  provided for in the various  hospitals

in   Singapore  are  no  longer  available  to  the

Government  to give specialist advice  that  is  so

essential  and  so necessary in the maintenance  of

public health, and, what is even more important, in

the   maintenance  of  public  confidence  in   the

institutions   of  health  which   Singapore   does

provide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Mr Kandasamy, how difficult it

was  to persuade the people in Singapore some years

ago  to use the hospital facilities, because  there

was a fear that if they did go to the hospital they

might  never come out. Even during the lifetime  of

the  Minister for Culture, that was so  and  it  is

even  going to be more so if something is not  done

quickly  by  the  Ministry of Health.  There  is  a

growing  fear  now  among the people - more  than  it

existed   before -  that  the  facilities   of   the

hospitals are not adequate. I have heard complaints

from  various people that they do not get attention

and care in the hospitals. By "care", I do not mean

care  at the lower levels, but expert medical  care

which  is required if the patient who goes  to  the

hospital  voluntarily  and willingly  hopes  to  be

cured  of the ailment in respect of which he  seeks

admission.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, could the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister  inform  this House whether  the  staffing

position,   as   far   as  he  is   concerned,   is

satisfactory  not only at the mere hospital  doctor

level but also at the intermediate level as well as

the  top  level, and, what is even more important,

at the specialist level.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, I am obliged to the

Member  for Farrer Park for having broken down  the

medical  officers  into various  grades  so  as  to

enable  me to describe in greater detail where  the

shortage lies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the specialists are concerned, during

the  past  year,  Government has  unfrozen  various

vacancies  and filled them substantively  by  local

appointees.  The  post  of  the  Obstetrician   and

Gynaecologist  of the Kandang Kerbau  Hospital  has

only  very  recently  been  filled.  The  posts  of

surgeons, the eye surgeon, the physicians  and  the

orthopaedic surgeons have all been filled recently.

Actually,  we  are in the process  of  filling  the

other vacant posts at the moment, and we expect the

posts to be substantively filled early next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the junior specialists - what the

Member  for  Farrer  Park considers  as  high-level

medical  officers - we are very well off, having  now

the   services  of  the  many  graduates  who  have

returned  from  abroad. In fact,  in  the  surgical

department,  at  present  there  are  more   junior

specialists than any other type of officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of medical officers, doctors, who

perform the daily chores of the medical service, we

are  a little short, and we are making arrangements

to   recruit  doctors  and  medical  officers   and

specialists from Israel and Japan. The arrangements

have  been under way for some time and  we  expect

results early next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when all these vacancies are filled next year,

the  Government would not be short at all. In fact,

there  are  only  53 vacancies for doctors  in  the

Ministry  of Health and we expect to fill  them  by

next year.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon.

the  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for

Health  said  earlier that if a  post-mortem  is  a

requirement of the law, there is nothing  they  can

do  about  it.  I  am sorry to disagree  with  him,

although he has always been a very intelligent man,

giving  very intelligent answers In this  case,  on

the  surface of it, it is a very intelligent answer

and  nothing else could have been the answer.  But,

unfortunately, I have had experience where  I  feel

that  some  cases of post-mortems on Muslims  could

have been avoided if there had been a little bit of

reorganisation, and a little bit of pains had  been

taken to see that instructions were carried out.

o'clock that morning. A post-mortem then had to  be

performed; the law had to take its course.  If  the

post-mortem  was  postponed two  hours  later,  the

death  certificate could easily  have  been  issued

from  the Tan Tock Seng Hospital. The man's  family

came  to  my  house  at about two  o'clock  in  the

morning and told me all that. I managed to get  the

doctor  out of bed, and he did stop it.  Well,  that

was  one  case that was stopped. I feel that  if  a

reorganisation could have been implemented and some

rearrangements made about the hours of  post-mortem

and  doctors'  certificates, then probably  several

cases  of  post-mortems on Muslims could have  been

avoided.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for Mountbatten having prefaced her remarks with so

much  flattery and compliments, I find it difficult

to  rebut except to congratulate her for her public

consciousness in helping this particular Muslim  to

get an exemption from legal requirements. This, Mr

Speaker, Sir, is just one instance to show that the

law  is always rigid. It is the application of  the

law that can be relaxed, and not the law itself. So

I  do  not  think  there is any  reorganisation  or

redrafting  of  the  law  necessary,  hut  a   more

intelligent  application  of  the  law.  That,   of

course,  will  have  to be left to  individuals  to

implement.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry

I   gave  the  wrong  impression.  I  do  not  mean

reorganisation of the law. I mean reorganisation of

the working hours of the hospitals or the orders of

the  doctors - whatever it is,  he  as  Parliamentary

Secretary  should know best - so that  this  kind  of

incident where a post-mortem has to be performed on

a  man just because of the difference in hours does

not take place.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when we were

talking of the reorganisation of the hours of  work

of teachers, I remember the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



Mountbatten was most stormy in her expressions. May

I  ask  her  whether  she  is  advocating  that  we

reorganise  the  hours of work of the  doctors  and

make them work 24 hours a day?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, no,

definitely   no.   I  am  sure  the   Parliamentary

Secretary  knows  what  I  mean - arranging  not  the

number  of  hours  of  work  of  the  doctors,  but

arranging that the post-mortem does not take  place

two hours before the doctors begin work.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hours of

work of the Post-mortem Department have to be a bit

earlier  than  the hours of work  of  the  doctors,

because  the doctors, after seeing cases where  the

patients  are alive, often like to have a  look  at

the  post-mortem  results. So if a  post-mortem  is

being  performed  at the same time  as  the  doctor

begins  his work, then he will either have to  give

up  his work and see the post-mortem, or not to see

the post-mortem at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may come back to

the  matters which I have raised? The problem which

I  posed  to  the  Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister  for Health was this: that as a result  of

the  staffing situation in the Ministry, efficiency

is  running  down; and as a result  of  that,  the

services  which the public have a right  to  expect

are  not  being provided for. He has  informed  the

House  that  in  certain  ladders  of  the  medical

profession,  the situation seems to  be  all  right

from  the staffing point of view. But, Mr Speaker,

Sir, he has not answered this question: whether  he

has  the  number of specialists which he  thinks  a

city like Singapore requires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that in the

debate on the Budget last year, it appeared to  the

House that a number of substantive posts were being

held  by  persons in an acting capacity.  From  the

answers given then, it appeared that most of  those

appointments  were held on an acting  basis.  Could

the Parliamentary Secretary inform the House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



that  that situation no longer prevails,  and  that

these posts are now being filled substantively?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to

the  first question, the answer is that most of the

posts on the establishment are being filled. It  is

a  fact that we are appointing a few specialists in

the  service  on  supernumerary  appointments.   In

answer   to  the  second  question,  most  of   the

professional  officers who were acting  during  the

earlier  part  of this year have been substantively

appointed.  There  only remain a  few  professional

officers  performing  administrative  duties  whose

posts  remain unfilled. This is because of a ruling

in  the  Establishment  that  for  officers  to  be

appointed  higher  than  Grade  G  level,   it   is

necessary first to promote them to Superscale Grade

G,  so  that most of the Superscale Grade D  and  E

posts  are  still  held by people  who  have  been

recently  promoted  from Timescale  to  Superscale

Grade G, and they are therefore still acting.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, earlier in the

debate,  the Parliamentary Secretary has said  that

he  is  negotiating for the appointment of  doctors

from  overseas,  which  will include  doctors  from

Israel.  I  wonder, Sir, whether  Government  would

think  again  about employing doctors from  Israel,

since  this is one of the sensitive attitudes which

have   been  adopted  by  certain  groups  in   the

Federation of Malaya and also in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not

the  intention of the Ministry of Health  to  limit

the  recruitment  of doctors only from  Israel.  In

fact,  the Ministry will recruit doctors  from  any

part  of the world where doctors are available  and

where  it is known that the available doctors  meet

the  requirements  of our very rigid  standards  in

medical practice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, as I understand the Parliamentary

Secretary,  he has informed the House  that  he  is

taking  every possible step to recruit specialists,

that   he  has  taken  steps  to  make  substantive

appointments, and that in future he will.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



continue  to see that as many appointments  as  are

made  should be made substantively. It is for  this

simple  reason, Mr Speaker, Sir, that if a  person

is  made  to  hold  a post too long  in  an  acting

capacity,  he  tends  to  lose  interest  and  get

frustrated, and a frustrated officer in the  higher

levels is not a good thing for the service. I  hope

the Minister will keep that in mind.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

perhaps  relevant to note and to mention here  that

in   the   18  months  of  office  of  the   P.A.P.

Government, more substantive appointments have been

made  in the medical service than in the last  five

years of the Labour Front Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> There is a simple explanation to

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the

P.A.P. took over the City Council in June 1959,  we

found that due to the process of integration, there

was  no  necessity to have a Secretary to the  City

Health  Department.  The Secretary  to  the  Health

Department  was a University graduate, and  because

he  had  no  work to do, I transferred him  to  the

Singapore  Telephone Board. I believe  that  lately

this  post  was filled on a temporary basis  by  an

officer.  The  idea of filling it  on  a  temporary

basis  was  to avoid the Local Government Ordinance

which  lays down that posts which come under  Class

IV  in the City Council Scheme of Service should go

to  the  P.S.C. I wonder if this is the way to  get

away from the P.S.C. in order to give a job to this

particular  officer who happens to be a

brother-in-law of a Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this

particular officer, Mr M. R. Marcus, resigned from

the  service  some time last year as  a  result  of

intimidation  by  the previous Mayor  of  the  City

Council. After the City Council was transferred  to

the  care of the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister

gave  an assurance to all those people who had been

chased away or frightened away for no reason by the

previous  Minister  for  National  Development,   a

chance to return to the service. Mr Marcus is  one

of the seven Asians and expatriates who returned to

the  service. He is an experienced man well  versed

in  the functions of the City Council, having  been

previously  appointed as an Assistant Secretary  to

the  Secretariat, Class III, on a salary  scale  of

$740.  His temporary appointment carries an  all-in

salary  of $670. Because of the integration of  the

City  Council with the Government, it was felt that

the  services of such an officer would be  valuable

to  the City Health Department, and it was on  that

basis that he filled it `in a temporary capacity.

nepotism.  I  do not believe in it.  I  have  never

anybody  in  this Assembly, I can say that  I  have

brothers in the City Council, and none of them will

ever be promoted at any suggestion from me. You can

be  quite sure of that. As for the Member for  Hong

used  to  it.  It  is against my  very  nature,  my

temperament.  I  do  not  believe   in   the   Batu

Pahatisation  or the Byrnisation of civil  servants

of  the City Council. I do not believe in all those

that  the Chair did not get up quick enough to stop

these  personalities, which I have tried  to  avoid

from  the very beginning. I ask the Member for Hong

Lim to refrain from any further personalities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one further

point. The officer concerned has been named. I  can

assure this House that when it was necessary for me

to  take a stand even against the brothers of  this

officer  when  I  thought that  their  conduct  was

disreputable,  I  did  so in  public  and  made  my

position  very  clear as far as his  brothers  were

concerned. I am often touchy by nature and I have a

temper. But I can assure this House that, as far as

I  am concerned and as long as I am what I am, this

will  never happen. Nepotism is not a thing that  I

particular person who had been reengaged after  the

Prime Minister had taken over the Ministry had left

the  City  Council  service because  he  had  been

frightened  into  leaving  it.  This  is   a   very

interesting point which he made - that he  was  taken

frightened  away. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  have  heard

that  other  officers  were also  frightened  away.

Park. Officers had resigned during my time. But  in

the  case  of this particular officer, it  happened

written under the name of this particular officer:-

"Resigned  w.e.f.  [with effect from]  the  2nd  of

June,  l959" - before the P.A.P. took over  the  City

Council on 5th June, 1959, and during the time when

I was not the Mayor of the City Council. I remember

that  I  resigned some time during  the  middle  of

April.  Why did he resign? Everybody who has  taken

an interest in City Council matters should know. He

was  re-engaged not in October 1959, when the Prime

Minister  took over the City Council, but  on  30th

July, 1960. So, Mr Speaker, Sir, it took him  more

than  a  year to tighten up his belt, put his  hand

over  his  heart  to see that there  was  no  more

throbbing, boost up his courage, and then  approach

the  Prime Minister, saying, "Would you please take

me  back?"  Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Parliamentary

1960.  That  is  one  year. But  that  is  not  the

interval of time that is relevant. The interval of

time  that  is  relevant is when he was  given  the

opportunity to return. That was the time.  I  would

have thought that these are elementary things,  Mr

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would not

know  when each particular officer was offered  the

opportunity to come back. I thought that if as  the

Prime Minister had said that he had given a general

offer  to those City Council officers who had  been

frightened by the Mayor (particularly such type  of

officers who were frightened even when I  was  not

in  control), and he must be very frightened  if  I

was in control of the City Council - I would not know

whether  the Prime Minister, when he took over  the

City  Council,  gave  a general  amnesty  to  these

officers, asking them to come back

to know.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, he does not know

when  they  were invited and he makes his statement

of  fact - an alleged statement of facts - that the man

weighed  the  matter in his mind for  one  year.  I

suggest that this is absolutely typical of the  way

in which the Member for Hong Lim makes his reckless

mis-statements  of fact. Sir,  I  do  not  want  to

pursue  this any further, but I just want  to  draw

attention to the very lighthearted approach of  the

Member  for  Hong Lim when he comes to getting  his

facts straight.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, according to

the  logic of the Minister for Finance, there might

still   be   officers  coming  back  in  1962   and

1963 - officers not frightened by the Member for Hong

Lim,  but perhaps officers frightened by the Member

for  Farrer Park in 1950, when he was in charge  of

the City Council.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The difficulty is for the

Chair, of course, to draw the line somewhere.  When

the hon. Member for Hong Lim touches on details  of

a  particular officer, I myself cannot see of  what

interest  that is to this Committee of Supply.  But

when  he  touches on the general principle  of  the

post  to  be  filled, then, of course, he  is  very

relevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the principle

is   this,   that  such  posts  should  be   filled

substantively. A permanent post in the first  place

should  not  be filled by a temporary  appointment.

The  technique of a temporary appointment is to

by-pass the P.S.C. Mr Speaker, Sir, for instance,  in

the  case of this particular officer. He has  taken

away  his Provident Fund from the City Council  and

is not qualified



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



for  the post. As I understand it, there are  about

30   or  40  scholars  of  Nanyang  University  who

graduated  last year and who are still  unemployed.

The salary which is paid to this particular officer

will  be  enough to engage three Nanyang graduates.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I hope the Government will  stop

this type of appointment so that other persons will

be given a chance.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must again

point  out the irrelevancy of the Member  for  Hong

have  stated just now that this person  is  filling

this  post  and is held against it because  of  the

integration that is going on between the Government

and  the City Council, and because an officer  with

his  experience  is  of value  in  the  process  of

integration.  I  cannot see how a Nanyang  graduate

can  perform functions where his lack of experience

in this particular field is the operative factor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, may I come to the only point that

interests  me  in this debate? It is the  statement

for  Health  that all those persons  who  had  been

frightened  away by the former Mayor,  the  present

Member   for  Hong  Lim,  have  been  offered

re-appointments.  I  know  of  specific  cases   where

persons have left because of the previous Mayor and

who   have  not  been  offered  reemployment.   Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  will bring the  names  of  these

persons to the specific notice of the Minister, and

perhaps he might be able to help them.

this.  When  the Prime Minister, I understand,  was

this  officer who has been appointed.  I  think  we

further on the principle?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, I just want

to  stress my point that this particular officer is

held  against this particular post not  because  of

his  usefulness in the Ministry of Health,  or  the

City  Health Office, but because of his  experience

in  the City Council and because it is deemed  that

he  would be useful in the integration of the  City

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I have here a copy

of  the  Hansard, col. 614, Vol. 13,  No.  9  (21st

September.  1960).  It was  an  oral  answer  to  a

question  by  a Member, asking about the  Assistant

Markets and Hawkers Inspectors employed by the City

Council. The question was this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Inche Mohamed Ali bin Aiwi asked the Prime

Minister  how many Temporary Assistant Markets  and

Hawkers  Inspectors  were  employed  by  the   City

Council  as at 31st August, 1960: how many of  them

were  appointed from among former serving  officers

of  the  City  Council, and  how  many  passed  (a)

English  Standard Eight, (b) Chinese Junior Middle,

(c)  Malay  Standard Seven, and (d)  an  equivalent

standard in Tamil.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reply given by the Parliamentary Secretary to

the Prime Minister was this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There were 25 Temporary Assistant Markets and

Hawkers Inspectors employed by the City Council  as

at 31st August, 1960. None of these were from among

former serving officers. Seven have passed English'

Standard  VIII.  Four  have passed  Chinese  Junior

Middle, and one has passed Malay Standard VII. None

has  passed  the equivalent standard in  Tamil.  In

addition  to the above, three possess the Cambridge

School  Certificate, and nine possess  the  Chinese

Senior   Middle  Certificate - these   being   higher

qualifications than those referred to by the Member

for the Southern Islands.'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have done a bit of addition

and  I found that the total of those appointees who

do satisfy the qualifications just now given by the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Health

is   only   24.  I  see  one  missing.  Could   the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Health

explain the missing link?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member's arithmetic is correct.

Dr Sheng, there is one missing.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall

undertake  to provide the answer to the Member  for

Hong Lim as soon as I have the explanation myself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand

the  missing  link was provided  by  one  who  has

driven  the  Prime  Minister.  He  is  one  of  the

applicants, I believe, who is not qualified. He has

not even a Chinese primary school certificate. That

provides the key to the missing link. Mr Speaker.

Sir, I  understand  that  the  Health  Department

rejected  this applicant, although it was suggested

to them that this person is of great importance. It

is laid down that the Hawkers Inspectors must carry

out  certain  duties provided them by law.  One  of

these  duties is to be able to enforce the  Hawkers

and   Markets  bylaws  made  under  the   Municipal

Ordinance (Cap.133). He cannot be a semi-illiterate

person. He cannot be a person who is not qualified.

That  is why it is insisted that persons must  have

certain  educational qualifications.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  I  believe that an imperial edict was decreed

and  that this particular officer was thus put into

the City Health Department.

Member  for Hong Lim was referring to the  official

driver attached to the Prime Minister's Department.

He  has  live chauffeurs provided in the Estimates.

Or  was  the  hon. Member referring to the  private

chauffeur  of  the Prime Minister? I just  want  to

clear a few points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am trying to point out is that there are

two types of law as far as the Singapore Government

mind - that  there  is  an  officer  who   has   been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



it  is  true or not that the applicants  for  these

posts  at that time were interviewed by Assemblymen

from   the  Government  side.  At  that  time   the

integration  of  the  City  Council  was  not   yet

implemented.  From what I know, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

when  it came to the turn of a Malay to appear  for

the  interview, it was conducted in Malay, but when

a  Tamil  applicant was interviewed, the  interview

was  not  conducted in Tamil. I would like to  know

whether   this  is  true  and  I  hope   that   the

authorities concerned can give me a reply.

in    Tamil,   I   think   the   answer   is   very

straightforward and simple. If I could speak  Malay

as  well  as  the hon. Member can, I would  be  now

speaking  in  Malay because Malay is  the  national

Malay will be the national language. It means  that

it  is  not so yet. But we have declared that Malay

is  the  national language. Perhaps the Member  for

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before this debate gets out of hand,

I  think  the  question posed  by  the  Member  for

not  applicants were interviewed by members of  the

City  Council staff who could speak Malay. I  think

translated  into  Malay.  If  that  was   how   the

should address himself on that particular aspect.

the Government side can give a clear reply?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, when I say that I am

unaware, I say so on behalf of the Government.

Government  is  unaware that such an interview  did

take  place,  is the Government aware  that  P.A.P.

Assemblymen ever interviewed candidates for posts?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> In so far as the Ministry of

Health   is  concerned,  the  answer  is  that   no

Assemblyman  has  interviewed  any  candidates  for

posts.  I  am  only answerable for the Ministry  of

Health and I am sure the other Ministers will  give

the same answer as I have given.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I only asked that question because the

Parliamentary  Secretary  did  say  that   he   was

speaking for the Government. That was what  induced

me to ask him that question. The answer, of course,

is now limited to the Ministry of Health and so the

question  is  still open in so  far  as  the  other

Ministries are concerned.

Member for Kampong Kembangan have said, there was a

P.A.P.  Assemblyman  in the Committee  interviewing

applicants  for the posts of Assistant Markets  and

Hawkers  Inspectors.  I give an  assurance  to  the

House that I will look into the matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 27 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 183.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would appear that this amendment of mine

is  the last one on City Council Health and  is  in

respect  of "Cleansing". Sir, many people not  only

citizens  but  visitors  too  who  move  around  in

Singapore have occasion to remark that the disposal

of  refuse  leaves  much to  be  desired,  and  the

offence  is  mostly committed in  the  markets.  No

doubt the Minister will say that there are dustbins

provided  in  the markets and that  these  dustbins

should  be  the  receptacles for  the  refuse.  But

unfortunately  that is not so. The refuse  is  just

thrown anyhow on the road, and sometimes swept into

a  heap,  and  any  passer-by  will  find  it  most

obnoxious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the debate on the amendment that has just

been  disposed  of there was a suggestion  that  in

regard to Assistant Markets Inspectors there was  a

missing  link.  But  in  regard  to  the  Cleansing

Department,  Sir,  I think there  are  the  missing

dustbins!  Hon. Members will remember that  at  the

time of the great

Mayor  of  the  City  Council,  they  presented   a

wonderful sight to the people of Singapore, and  to

me  too, because I had an aluminium dustbin  placed

by the lamp-post near my house. I was told that all

these dustbins had disappeared. I would not believe

it,  and so I went round certain parts of Singapore

and  I found that it was true - they had disappeared.

Would  the Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister

for  Health  be  good enough to  explain  away  the

missing dustbins?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Item (7): are they called "Street

to street bins or dustbins?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tan Lim Yew Hock: Whatever bins they are, Sir,

they are for cleansing.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I see that item (7) is "Street

bins - for  replacement".  So  that  perhaps  is  the

missing link. The Question is, "That the sum to  be

allocated for Head 27 be reduced by $10 in  respect

of sub-head 183."



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> These missing aluminium

that  it  would  be  for  another  Member  of   the

Opposition to answer.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Is the Minister now suggesting

that   there   is  no  such  thing  as  "collective

responsibility"?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I would just like

to  say  that it is the function of the Government,

in  particular the Ministry of Health,  to  provide

all  facilities  for the removal  of  rubbish,  and

therefore  the  previous Health Department  of  the

City  Council has provided the dustbins. As to  why

the dustbins and other "has-beens" have disappeared

from  the scene, we cannot be responsible. In fact,

if Members of the House would wish to know, I could

also  inform  them  that I  had  also  come  across

manholes  whose  covers had been stolen.  They  had

been  stolen for scrap-iron, and to stop this petty

pilfering, the manhole covers have now been made in

concrete.  However,  it is  rather  unfair  of  the

Member  for  Cairnhill to place the blame  for  his

missing dustbin upon the steps of the Government.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I was just asking for some

detective  to explain away the missing dustbins.  I

have  not  accused the Government of  stealing  the

dustbins  and putting them somewhere else.  Surely,

Sir,  the City Council had spent a lot of money  on

these  aluminium  dustbins. They were  a  beautiful

sight  at  that time. They cost a lot of  money!  I

hope  the  Government would tell us how much  money

was  spent on them - they were paid for out of public

funds.  It is definitely the responsibility of  the

Government to see to it that public funds  are  not

squandered in that way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let us have

none  of  this mock anger! Coming down to the  tone

which  sparked off this whole thing, may I ask  the

Member  for Cairnhill what happened to the  dustbin

that was in front of his house?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> All I can say is that I did not

steal  it;  in fact, it was not worth  stealing!  I

would  like  to see it there, because  when  it  is

there, I always have something to look at and  say,

"Ah,  this is one of the indiscretions of the  City

Council."



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Was it a dustbin or a

the  Member for Cairnhill whether he has looked for

it under his house!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Let us be a little more serious,

shall we?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Let us get down to a more

serious  tone. The cost of the dustbins  was  borne

out  of  public  funds. There was  great  publicity

given  to them. I do not know how many hundreds  of

thousands of dollars had been spent on them. And to

suggest   that  anyone  could  go   and   pinch   a

dustbin - that it is quite all right; it is free  for

all - is  totally wrong. Surely the Government should

be more watchful-



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Over your dustbin!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

the properties of the City Council.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let us get

the facts right. When these aluminium dustbins were

put   all  over  Singapore,  one  Member   of   the

Opposition was the Mayor and another Member was the

Chief  Minister.  Why on earth should  we  be  held

responsible for these things?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, if the Minister wants

facts,  let  us be more factual. When  the  present

Member  of the Opposition was the Mayor, he  was  a

PAP. Mayor. He was acclaimed as a great hero of the

P.A.P.  And  if  the P.A.P. now say that  what  the

P.A.P. Mayor did is not their responsibility,  then

I think, in due course, the P.A.P. would say. "What

this Government did is not our responsibility."



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> At that time the Member for

Cairnhill  was  the  Chief  Minister,  and  he  was

responsible  for the Police. And therefore  it  was

his  job  to  put  the police on to  look  for  his

dustbin.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, may I say this: that the

dustbins were taken away after the P.A.P. came into

power?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are wandering away really from

the  principle  of this debate. The  item  is  "For

replacement", and the Member for Cairnhill wants to

find    out   whether   these   replacements    are

replacements for the dustbins. I think that is  all

there is to it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> The sum quoted in the

Estimates is for replacement of the dustbins.  They

are,   in  fact,  revoted  from  the  City  Council

Estimates. The relevant section of the City Council

Estimates is available, if the Member for Cairnhill

wishes to have the information.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I have no objection to this

vote for replacement. Now that the City Council  is

integrated  with  the Government,  may  I  ask  the

Government to see to it that these street bins  are

no longer pinched?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the more

spectacular  doings of the ex-Mayor  was  to  place

street bins on street



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



lamp-posts. Whether the Mayor did it on or  against

the  advice of his officers, only the Mayor himself

will  know. But I always felt, when I walked  along

the  streets of Singapore and saw these street bins

on the lamp-posts, that that was a mistake, because

they  could  so easily be pinched. I  only  mention

that,  Sir, because of this reason: is the  present

Government,  which is proposing  to  replace  these

street  bins, going to do the same thing  again  by

making aluminium bins and placing them against

lamp-posts? This will merely induce and invite people to

steal them.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, may I beg leave to withdraw

this amendment, especially when the missing bins

principles, and I take it that Mr Rajah  will  now

speak on the incumbent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 28 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (3) of sub-head

1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to touch upon the

principle    involved   in   employing    Political

Secretaries  in  any particular  Ministry,  because

that  has already been dealt with. What I  wish  to

speak   upon   this  evening  on  this   particular

amendment  is  the  particular  incumbent  of  this

post - whether in the circumstances he is  peculiarly

suited  to  help  our very brilliant  Minister  for

Finance. The particular incumbent of this post,  if

I  understand the position correctly,  is  Mr  Lim

Chin  Siong. I understand he is a very  able  trade

unionist,  and  in  his line there  could  be  none

better - so I am told.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can make out, none of the functions of

the  Minister for Finance is connected  with  trade

union  disputes or in negotiating matters  relating

to  trade union disputes. That is left in the  able

hands  of  the  Minister for Labour and  Law.  Now,

although I do not agree with the principle  of  the

employment of Political Secretaries, the Government

having  accepted them on the basis that the persons

are  there because of their peculiar background and

virtues,  and that they will be able to assist  the

Minister  in  matters  where the  Minister  himself

might not be able to reach out to the people,  that

is  a  possible basis for employment, and one  must

concede   that  that  is  a  possible   basis   for

employment. Accepting that basis, one must  examine

whether the present incumbent of that post conforms

to  that  basis. I am suggesting to  the  Hon. the

Minister for Finance that this particular incumbent

does not fit into the bill at all. Sometime ago the

Member  for  Cairnhill, I think it  was  yesterday,

Sir, said that this particular officer was never in

the  Ministry of Finance but was always frequenting

the  corridors of the Labour Court and the Ministry

of  Labour and Law. In those circumstances,  I  ask

the  Minister whether he is a fit and proper person

to continue to hold this post.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I was not

present  in the House when unkind words  were  said

about my Personal Secretary (Political). Had I been

here  I  would have rushed to the defence  of  this

bright  young  man.  I can assure  the  Member  for

Farrer  Park that he is very fitted for this  post.

There seems to be a misunderstanding, namely,  that

whoever  holds that post should be an economist.  I

think  that  was the point made by the  Member  for

Cairnhill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tan Lim Yew Hock: No.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, if the reports I read in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



several  outstanding men in this field. As for  his

occasional absences from the Ministry, that is only

to  be expected. It is his duty to be in touch with

the  masses, and if he spends all his time  in  his

office,  I would have grave doubts whether  he  had

been performing his duties as rightly as he should.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, "in touch with the masses" - I will

take up where the Minister for Finance left off. In

touch  with  the masses on what matter?  Is  it  on

finance,  on  matters  related  to  his  particular

Ministry? Shall we examine the Ministry of Finance?

Head  28-  Ministry of Finance; Head  29- Charge  on

Account  of the Public Debt. It might be  a  public

burden,  but how does Mr Lim Chin Siong  fit  into

the  picture of conveying to the masses  the  great

burdens  the  Minister  for Finance  bears  on  the

Charge on Account of the Public Debt? What kind  of

publicity,  what  kind  of  groundwork  does   this

gentleman do which the Minister himself,  with  the

able assistance of the Minister for Culture, cannot

do?  The  next item, Sir, is "Pensions,  Retirement

Allowances, Gratuities, etc." I cannot see how this

gentleman fits into this particular Head.  Head  31

- "Contributions  and Charitable Allowances".  I  do

not see how he fits in. Head 32- I do not see how he

fits  in  the  Accountant-General.  His  department

deals  with figures. That is where you sit at  your

table  and  work  at them, not in the  field.  Head

33- Customs  and Excise. I do not see how  he  comes

into  Customs and Excise. Exchange Control. Imports

and   Exports  Control  and  Registration,   Inland

Revenue,  Statistics, Supplies, and Timber  Office.

Now  I ask the Minister for Finance not to shoot  a

line. He has asked me not to shoot a line. Might I.

with equal respect, ask him not to shoot a line?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Farrer Park is

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I suspect, Mr Speaker, Sir,

Mr   Speaker,  that  I  have  not  the   slightest

intention  of satisfying his curiosity.  These  are

matters of grave importance and are State secrets.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, while I can understand that

the kind of advice the Political Secretary gives to

the Minister for Finance is a State secret, I would

like  to say this. He says that I have said  unkind

things   about  his  Political  Secretary  in   his

absence. I said the same thing during the debate on

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech. The Minister  for

Finance was there when I said those things, and  he

did  not stand up to defend his Political Secretary

as  he  is now trying to defend him. I said, and  I

repeat  it  here, since he was not here  yesterday,

that this Political Secretary of his and he do  not

see  eye to eye on a number of things. They do  not

even see each other. I say this in all sincerity in

this  House: they do not see eye to eye  with  each

other, nor do they want to see each other; and  yet

the Minister says that his Political Secretary  is

a  man of great versatility. We all know. Sir,  the

versatility of his Political Secretary. But I  hope

that his versatility will not include an element of

his  political  commissarship of the  Minister  for

Finance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I understand

it,  what they are now reconciled to is that it  is

very  necessary  for Ministers  to  have  Political

Secretaries,  but  that in the  choice  of  certain

Political Secretaries, they should take the  advice

of Members opposite. Certainly, Sir, the best judge

of who is to advice whom is the Minister concerned,

and  the  contention that this particular Political

Secretary  is not qualified in economic matters  is

not  much to the point, because I see later on that

some  of the hon. Members opposite, who are  by  no

means  economists, are going to delve into subjects

in which they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



probably not as fully qualified as the Minister for

Finance  is. In choosing a Political Secretary,  we

are  not interested in the economic knowledge  that

that  particular person might have. Though I  might

mention  that  I did see this particular  Political

Secretary   one  day  with  a  book  on  elementary

economics, which does show that he has ambitions at

least  of  following what is,  being  done  in  his

particular  Ministry.  But  the  purpose   of   all

Political  Secretaries is to  sense  the  political

atmosphere prevailing at a particular time, and the

fact that this particular Political Secretary is  a

trade unionist with some experience, as .the former

Chief  Minister has had ample opportunity to  know,

is  of  some  importance. Because of his  political

knowledge,  he provides the Minister concerned  and

the  Ministers generally with data. To  assess  the

political  situation, to that  extent  he  plays  a

useful  part.  But  it does not mean  that  when  a

Political Secretary does not quite see eye  to  eye

with  the  Minister in any particular matter,  that

itself  indicates that he is of no particular  use.

The  fact  that he is a trade unionist is  of  some

relevance, because, if you will remember,  about  a

few  weeks  ago  the Minister for Finance  did  put

forward  a memorandum showing how essential  it  is

for  the trade unions to be able to play their part

in  helping  the  Government as a  whole  to  carry

through  its economic plans. So the fact that  this

particular  Political Secretary has some  knowledge

of, and some contact with, the trade union movement

as  a  whole  is  a valuable asset in  helping  the

Government to carry through its economic plans.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it would

appear  that  because I say that the  Minister  for

Finance  does not see eye to eye and does not  even

see  face to face with his Political Secretary,  it

is left to the Minister for Culture to come and say

that  they do. So long as he does not reply and  so

long  as the denial does not come from him, I would

like  to submit, Sir, that it is true. He says that

this  particular Political Secretary is a  man  who

has been of great



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>



use  to  the  Minister for Finance. He is  a  trade

unionist, and then he brings in the question of the

Minister  for  Finance having sent a memorandum  to

the  T.U.C. on the industrialisation programme  of

the  Government,  and  is  seeking  the  views  and

comments of the T.U C. I respectfully submit.  Sir,

that  that is all eye-wash. If that trade  unionist

is  really a Political Secretary, surely  he  could

have  consulted  the  Political  Secretary  on  his

views,   and  the  views  of  the  other  Political

Secretaries who are trade unionists and who, at the

same  time, are Assistant Secretaries in the T U.C.

Why  cannot they consult them in the quiet of their

rooms and say, `Look, we are going to do this. What

is your view?' Instead of which, having a Political

Secretary  who  is to advise him on  the  political

implications  of the plan in so far  as  the  trade

unionists  are concerned, he sent it to the  T.U.C.

and then the Political Secretaries in the office of

the  T.U.C. send their reply back to him. What kind

of Political Secretary is that?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I find this

altogether  too  tedious. If the  hon.  Member  for

Cairnhill  cannot understand how these matters  are

sorted out between ourselves and the T.U.C., then I

will  not attempt to enlighten him. He says that  I

do  not see eye to eye with my Political Secretary;

I  do  not  see  eye  to eye with my  Parliamentary

Secretary;  I  do  not  see  eye  to  eye  with  my

colleagues on many points. It is inevitable. So may

I  suggest,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that since  so  many

words have been wasted on this topic, we pass on to

more enlightening subjects?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the passing on to more

enlightened  subjects is, of course,  left  to  the

Opposition. Sir, when the Prime Minister  was  here

yesterday, he did say, on the subject of  Political

Secretaries, that regarding things that  are  of  a

serious  and important character - since the Minister

for  Finance was not here yesterday - there are a lot

of  things  that are best left unsaid;  and  if  he

agrees that there are a lot of things that are best

left unsaid, then I am prepared to agree with him.,

There  is  no  need to say, let us not  bring  this

subject up, because it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



is rather embarrassing to him to have to defend

something which he is not convinced he is prepared

to defend.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am not at all embarrassed,

Mr Speaker, Sir, but utterly bored.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, may I say something about what the

Minister  for Culture has said? He sought  to  give

the  impression  to  the  House  that  we,  on  the

Opposition,   have  accepted  the  appointment   of

Political Secretaries. We have not accepted that at

all.  You  may remember that I raised this question

in the first instance, and I am still not satisfied

that  these appointments are required. I agree with

the  Hon. the Prime Minister that once the  matter

has  been  debated and voted upon, it need  not  be

raised from year to year. But the fact remains that

we  are  opposed  to the appointment  of  Political

Secretaries. What we are now debating, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  is  this - is this particular incumbent  suited

for  this particular post? The Minister for Finance

says that he is bored because we are querying that.

He  is  not making out a good case at all. In fact,

if  any case is being made at all, it is being made

out  by  the  Minister for Culture and not  by  the

Minister for Finance. All he says is this, "Let  us

pass  on  to something more interesting."  Does  he

find  this  topic so distasteful that he  wants  to

leave it in a hurry and go on to something else?  I

would  have  thought  that if  he  had  a  suitable

appointee  in this post, he would have got  up  and

defended him in the most vigorous manner that he is

capable  of. But since he is not defending  him  at

all,  I must naturally assume that there are things

which he himself does not want to say, as the Prime

Minister  has  said, and, therefore,  he  wants  to

hurry on to some other topic.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are two

reasons  why I ask them to move on to new pastures.

First, nothing new has been turned up by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it would appear that the

Minister  for Finance is bored when the  Opposition

is  trying  to explain to the Government  that  the

Government should see to it that public  funds  are

spent  for  the  good  of the people  and  not  for

political debts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Tun

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*That the sum to be allocated for Head 28 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (59) of sub-head

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I was just wondering whether this

item  is connected with amendment (8)+ which is  at page  273 of the

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (59) of sub-head

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder whether the Minister

for  Finance  would be kind enough to tell  us  for

whom  the  Political Study Centre has been  run  or

organised;  what  type  of political  studies  take

place  there; whom the course benefits - the students

or the State?
