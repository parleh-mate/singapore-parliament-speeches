<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

last  Friday, I said that the brightest feature  in

the  speech  of His Excellency the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara was the admission that there had been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>



mistakes  and  shortcomings,  and  that  also   the

promise was made that in future there would be more

patience  and  that  zeal would  be  tempered  with

understanding.  Sir, it seems to  be  a  very  good

beginning,  to undo those mistakes that  have  been

made,  and  in the light of that promise,  I  would

like  to  bring to the attention of the  Government

certain  things which have brought  about  a  great

deal  of unhappiness to many parents, teachers  and

students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the most important cause of much unhappiness

amongst  these  people  is the  six-day  week.  The

parents have said that they have noticed that their

children  show signs of undue strain. On Saturdays,

they seem to have no relish for school work and, of

course,  homework  must  be  given.  As  usual,  on

Sundays,  they  have to do their  homework  and  on

Monday  the round begins again. So these  perpetual

rounds  give  no real break to students  and  those

engaged in the teaching profession. Sir, it may  be

said  that  in the past the Chinese-medium  schools

had  a six-day working week, but actually they  had

5.5 days, as it was pointed out by the Minister for

Education.  That half a day was usually devoted  to

recreational activities. Now in England I have been

told that two half days are devoted to recreational

activities so that actually they too have five full

days  of school work. Sir, if it is important  that

extra  languages must be taught, I suggest that  it

could  be  done  by the substitution  of  an  extra

language period for a period that can be done  away

with.  Or let the school start, say, half  an  hour

earlier each day, but let there be a five-day  week

or  a  compulsory  five-day week with  half  a  day

optional for most schools in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a meeting, Sir, in Kuala Lumpur on 6th

June,  1960,  and there was a report  in  the  Free

Press  of 7th June, 1960, which stated that at  the

first  session of the Asian regional conference  of

the  World  Confederation of Organisations  of  the

Teaching  Profession,  the delegates  came  to  the

conclusion and recommended that the teaching period

"should be fitted into a five-day week, for  it  is

essential  that  children get  a  real  break  from

school work each week.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



Where  home  conditions are  so  poor  that  it  is

desirable  for  children  to  spend  more  time  in

school,  this  time should not  be  used  for  more

teaching but for recreation and hobbies." Sir, that

is  the  opinion of professional people at a  world

conference. Let us not forget, Sir, that by  having

a  six-day week, poor parents must spend  about  20

per  cent  more  on  their children's  expenses  in

school.  Let us not forget also that we are working

here  under climatic conditions that are  different

from those existing in temperate regions. I am sure

some  of  the Members on the Government side,  Sir,

will  remember that whereas in London, one can walk

for  miles and miles and for hours without  feeling

tired,  we  cannot do the same in  the  heat  of  a

tropical country like Singapore. Sir, therefore, if

the  Government  wishes to restore  the  morale  of

teachers,   students  and  parents,  we   earnestly

request them to consider the restoration of a five-day  week  or  a five-day week plus a half  day  on

Saturday for recreational activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another sore point among teachers today is

the  new  kind of formula which seems to go against

all  arithmetical principles. We used to learn that

if  we  want more work to be done, we have  to  get

more  men.  Today  the formula seems  to  be:  More

activities, more work but less manpower. Of course,

economy  is very important, but you can go to  such

lengths  that economy defeats the very  purpose  of

introducing   economic  measures,  when   we   have

demoralising  effects  and  when  the  standard  of

efficiency  goes down. We have had  cases  where  a

teacher  in,  say, the Malay medium or the  Chinese

medium  was called upon to substitute for a teacher

in the English medium, to carry on a regular lesson

in  the  English medium or vice versa, just because

there was a shortage of teachers in a school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all agree, Sir, that the principle of equal

treatment is a principle we want to adopt,  but  in

the measures adopted to implement this principle of

equal  treatment,  let  us  make  sure  that  equal

treatment  does  not become equal Maltreatment.  We

all  agree that there must be equal treatment. Sir,

we hope



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



that these things will be looked into carefully and

rectification be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point to be clarified under

"University",  Sir. In column 20 of  Hansard  dated

20th  July, 1960 (Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech),

it is stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the two Universities, Nanyang University and

the Singapore Division of the University of Malaya,

are geared to serve the needs of the State.'



<br><br>Sir, we hope by that it does not mean that the  one

to manipulate the gears is only the Government, but

that  before  the gears are changed there  will  be

consultation  and that the views of the  University

authorities  will be properly appreciated  so  that

over there also there will not be this feeling that

equal  treatment means equal treatment on  a  lower

level.  We  all want equal treatment on the  higher

level so that it becomes equally good treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all desire to improve conditions and

standards in education, but the improvements should

not  be  such that the levels go down.  I  believe,

Sir,  that  we  can maintain the high standards  of

education  in  our country. On a five-day  week  we

have  produced  brilliant scholars like  our  Prime

Minister.  Only  three years ago we  sent  a  local

student  to the London University and I  have  just

received  a  report, Sir, that in  the  Engineering

College (University of London), he topped the  list

of first-class honours last week. That, Sir, was on

a five day week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the amendment standing in my

name. I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"at end, to add -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`but urges the Government to consider restoring

to its employees the cut in variable allowances

which was made last year'."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I may be wrongly accused again

for  having brought this up in order to  revive  an

old  sore. Sir, let us consider again the facts  of

the case when the cut in the variable allowances of

Government  servants was introduced. About  a  year

ago,  when the Minister for Finance introduced  the

cut,  Sir,  the  main  reason given  was  that  the

Government  faced  a  threatened  deficit  of   $14

million. I pointed out then, Sir, that it was  only

a threatened deficit and that, judging



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>



from  what  had  been  done by  previous  Financial

Secretaries, an expected financial deficit  usually

turned  out  to be a surplus. But the Minister  for

Finance  insisted  that the ship was  sinking,  and

that unless steps were taken it might be too late.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,

we  read  in  column 6 of Hansard dated 20th  July,

1960:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The State ended the year's budget with a small

surplus of $9 million.'



<br><br>Sir, if there had been an expected deficit of  $14

million  and  the year ended with a surplus  of  $9

million, then the Government has been able to  make

good  by something like $23 million. I am not  sure

whether  the  financial year ended in  November  or

December  1959 - I  would normally expect  it  to  be

so - but  if  that were so, then in half a year  they

have  made  good the deficit and there was  also  a

surplus  of $9 million. Sir, the principle I  would

say  is this: if we want to get rid of the deficit,

the  first thing should be to economise, not to cut

the  pay of our employees. As an example of a model

employer, to resort to pay cuts should be the  last

thing,  and not the first. If the surplus is  money

which  has  been obtained through the  cut  in  the

variable  allowances, and since the speech  of  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara states that the country  is

economically   stable,  the  time   seems   to   be

favourable to rectify this mistake. We do  not  say

that   the  mistake  was  intentional - we  all  make

mistakes.  But  it is understood,  Sir,  that  once

errors  are  made and found out, it is  only  right

that  we  should rectify them, otherwise they  will

remain errors and a running sore throughout.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister was reported in the

Straits  Times of Friday, 3rd June, 1960,  to  have

said the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There were some mistakes, and there were hard

feelings. True, the cut in allowances of Government

servants  was  painful. True, school teachers  were

pushed too far in the extra half session.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rectifications had to be made. Half sessions have

been dropped. Professional allowances were paid  to

certain  categories of officers in  the  Government

service.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Prime Minister himself has

admitted   the  principle  that  once  errors   are

discovered,  rectifications are necessary.  However

the rectifications have not been fully made. It may

not  be  realised by many, Sir, that half  sessions

have  not  been completely withdrawn. The  teachers

were told that if they had not volunteered for  the

half  sessions, their turn would come once in three

years. So, actually the half sessions have not been

completely  dropped,  and  very  likely  the  Prime

Minister was misinformed. Sir, some people may  say

that  I  am  going to benefit by this if Government

should become generous. Let me say here, and I give

you my word, Sir, that if anything comes out of  it

I  do  not  wish to benefit from it. There  may  be

others also who do not wish to benefit from it, and

would be glad that if anything should come to  some

of us, that money be given to the unemployed. There

are  those  who feel that the cut was very  painful

because they had committed themselves in advance to

housing loans, education of their children,  and  I

know of certain cases where the children have to be

pulled back from universities because their parents

could  not  afford  to lose their allowances.  Sir,

this  is a question not only of principle,  but  of

sincerity,  a test of sincerity. Just a last  word,

Sir. At the big rally at the Happy World Stadium of

teachers  in Singapore, the Prime Minister  noticed

the  look of unhappiness among the many faces  and,

being   a  person  who  knows  human  nature  well,

suddenly  introduced something in  his  speech.  He

promised  the  teachers that  if  things  improved,

although he was not the Finance Minister, he  would

recommend restoration of the pay cuts, if not  all,

at least part of it.

were  present. I hope that that is remembered, Sir,

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in moving the

motion of thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, the

Prime  Minister  mentioned that the Government  was

aware  that  Communist elements had been regrouping

and  reorganising  in Singapore immediately  before

the  last elections. This fact should be considered

in the interests of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>



peace and prosperity of the State of Singapore.  If

these  Communist  activities  are  allowed  to   go

unchecked, it means that we condone them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it should be remembered that `at the present moment we are at the stage of achieving

independence   for  Singapore.  We   realise   that

independence can only be achieved through a  merger

with  the  Federation of Malaya. We are sincere  in

wishing to achieve our aim, and should not give  up

halfway in our efforts because of our own acts, and

without careful consideration of the ways and means

of achieving our objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fully confident, Mr Speaker, that what has

been said by the Prime Minister has been said in an

atmosphere  of  worry and the  realisation  of  the

dangers confronting the Government. But what I wish

to  know, Mr Speaker, is that during the  last  14

months that the Government has been in office, what

steps have the Prime Minister and his Cabinet taken

to  forestall or curb the threat of Communism?  Has

the  Prime  Minister been sitting still,  a  silent

spectator to the activities of the Communists,  and

waiting  for the moment when steps could be  taken?

Or  has he resigned himself to fate, hoping for the

best  in  the future? Or is that a further  mistake

made by the Government over the last 14 months?  To

the  best  of my knowledge, Mr Speaker, to-date  I

cannot  recall any positive action  taken  by  the

Government   in  suppressing  Communist  subversive

elements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently I heard it announced in this Assembly

that  two  journalists had been detained under  the

P.P.S.O. on  the ground that they were  associated

with pro-K.M.T. subversive elements. Mr Speaker, I

hope   the  Prime  Minister  and  Members  of   the

Government will declare frankly their stand. I ask:

are they prepared to get themselves mixed up and be

involved  with  Communists? I warn them  about  the

Malay  proverb: "You cannot befriend the tiger."  I

say  honestly  that these methods  are  wrong.  For

these  reasons,  we  are almost suspicious  of  the

present Government. We will not change our stand so

long



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>



as the Government cannot come out into the open and

take  action  to  wipe  out  Communist  activities,

whether  the activities are within their  Party  or

outside.  We will give our wholehearted support  if

the  Government takes positive steps towards wiping

out these Communist activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us, Mr Speaker, we are sincere, determined

and  honest  in facing Communist subversion.  There

are  people who allege that our opinions are  based

on fanaticism. But I would like to ask this. Is the

concept  of anti-colonialism also fanaticism?  With

this  non-Communist policy, Mr Speaker, the  Prime

Minister has mentioned three possibilities that may

happen  to his Party. First, what is good  for  the

P.A.P. may not be good for the M.C.P. What is  good

for the P.A.P. may also be good for the Communists.

What is not good for the P.A.P. may be good for the

Communists. Unfortunately, Mr Speaker,  the  Prime

Minister  has  not  given us  examples  as  to  the

difference   in   meaning   between    the    three

possibilities mentioned by him. But if I  could  be

`permitted to give an example of what may  be  good

for the P.A.P. but not good for the Communists,  we

could say this-the Government's efforts to get help

from  the British Government will not be acceptable

to  the  Communists. Secondly, on what is good  for

the  P.A.P. may also be good for the Communists,  I

could  say  this. For instance, we  repatriate  all

those  in  key  posts still held by expatriates  to

their  country  of  origin, and replace  them  with

local personnel who the Government feel can do what

they   dictate.  Whether  they  are  competent   or

otherwise, it does not matter at all. Thirdly,  the

possibility  that what is good for the  P.A.P. may

not  be good for the Communists. For instance,  Mr

Speaker, recently the Singapore Government  sent  a

congratulatory message to the Federation Government

on  the  termination of the Emergency  there.  This

action of the P.A.P. is taken because, if we do not

offer our congratulations, it may not be good  from

the point of view of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



relationship between the two territories.  But  for

the Communists this gesture is directly opposed  to

their interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the problem of merger with the Federation of Malaya, we realise that Singapore

cannot  survive  by itself. But  what  we  fail  to

understand   is  that  we  can  only   charge   the

Federation of Malaya for refusing to accept us as a

unit  of  Malaya. Mr Speaker, we are only wise  in

pointing  an  accusing finger at a  man  if  he  is

wrong.  If we ourselves do not wish to rectify  the

mistakes  that  we  have  committed,  or  adopt  an

unacceptable  attitude, then we cannot  accuse  the

other Party of refusing to accept our views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know, Mr Speaker, that by our merely saying

that this is good and so on, it will have no effect

on  anybody. The listeners will weigh our words and

consider our deeds and actions. Then only will they

form  certain  conclusions. But if  we  preach  one

thing  and  practise another, then it follows  that

they will not have faith in us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P., Mr Speaker, has admitted that the

Malays  in the Federation are afraid that a  merger

will  mean that the Malay population there will  be

swallowed  up. I want to be honest in this  matter.

It is not communalism - it is a fact which nobody can

deny  or  repudiate. It should not be  misconstrued

that  it  is communalism, as though communalism  is

the  greatest  danger  both in  Singapore  and  the

Federation  of  Malaya - putting aside the  Communist

threat. We consider it a small matter. It is wrong,

Mr  Speaker,  to consider communalism  in  Malaya,

because   the   multi-racial  people   have   lived

peacefully side by side for hundreds of years,  and

they  have  faced different political  developments

together  until  the creation of a  Government  for

which  all the people are responsible. Sir,  there

should   be  no  reason  why  this  problem  should

constitute  a danger, although there are  among  us

those  who  have no feelings of sympathy,  and  who

simply refuse to see facts. They base their actions

on  sentiment, and exploit this communal issue  for

their  own  benefit. But if they see the facts  for

themselves  based  on sympathetic consideration,  I

think, Mr Speaker,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



it  will  be  clearly seen that from  the  time  of

British  colonialism  we  can  always  come  to   a

compromise to avoid undesirable events happening in

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the concern of the Malays in the

Federation, at the moment I think they  are  having

good  hopes of living in a house comprising various

races, and they are moving towards the building  of

one nation based on a strong foundation. But if  we

look  at  the situation in Singapore, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  we cannot foresee this hope, although we  are

working  under a Government with a Constitution  in

which  it has clearly been enunciated that positive

steps  should be taken to help the Malays. On  this

matter, all  the  relevant  provisions  cannot  be

distorted  or twisted; as, for instance, by  giving

Malays  free  education. Free  education  has  been

given,  from  the primary level up  to  the  middle

school  and  university level. During  the  British

era,  free education was also in existence, and  in

the   English  schools  were  found  special  Malay

classes. Special privileges were given to those  in

these classes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in other matters, we cannot be proud

of  anything which leaves no impression at all.  So

what  the  Government should do is  to  initiate  a

special    programme   as   required   under    the

Constitution.  Although Members of  the  Government

charge  that  this is communalism,  it  is  clearly

enunciated in the preamble to the Constitution.  We

cannot set aside the Constitution if we are  to  go

by the Constitution which we have all accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as has been mentioned by the Opposition side, we are reviewing the work of the

Government  during  the 14 months  they  have  been

holding the reins of power. They should rectify the

mistakes they have made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite sure the Government will not find it

hard  to change their attitude and I feel they will

fully  implement  the paragraph about  the  special

rights of the Malays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point which I would like to express,

Mr Speaker, speaking on the inter-racial ties, and

that  is,  special  attention should  be  given  to

Malays  of Islamic religion. The Malays are opposed

to Communism. They are of the opinion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



that  the  Communists are atheists.  So  also  with

Christianity  and  Buddhism - they  are  opposed   to

Communism.  If  the  Government  fail  to  adopt  a

positive attitude, it follows that the followers of

the  religion  I have just mentioned will  have  no

faith  in  them.  They will not  believe  that  the

Government  will  take  definite  steps   to   curb

Communist activities both in Singapore and Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give an illustration which may be

a  little  shocking  to  the Muslim  population.  A

concert  about "Ketuhanan", meaning godliness,  was

recently presented over the Malay Section of  Radio

Singapore. This story, Mr Speaker, has resulted in

protestations  coming from the Muslim  people.  One

section feels that the presentation of this concert

has  caused the Holy Koran to be insulted or looked

down  upon  with contempt, whereas another  section

feels that this is a progressive move. There is yet

another group which is of the opinion that this  is

Communist propaganda to test how deep is the  faith

of  the  Muslim people towards Islam. This sort  of

thing  will create an unhealthy atmosphere. A close

scrutiny  will make it obvious that it will  result

in  clashes  between  various people  of  different

faiths,  and  that it will be bad  for  Singapore's

peace   and   prosperity.  I  hope   the   Ministry

responsible will conduct an investigation  so  that

there will be no recurrence of such a thing.  I  am

suspicious   of  the  Government's  attitude.   The

Government,   on  the  one  hand,   realises   that

Communist  activities are becoming more active.  On

the  other hand, it has not produced a White  Paper

so that the public will know what it stands for. If

I am not mistaken, the previous Government issued a

White Paper declaring its stand and mentioning  how

Communist  activities  had  been  on  the  rampage,

subverting trade unions and other cultural  bodies.

But  in  Singapore during the past  14  months  the

Government  has  not  done  anything  positive   or

definite  to  control  the  people's  associations,

trade  unions, etc. We would like to know what  the

Communists have done during the past 14 months that

the  P.A.P. has  been in power. If the  Government

really wishes to make the people realise the danger

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



Communism, it is important that it should  issue  a

White Paper on the subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in addition to what I have already said, it is hoped that the Government, in the year

ahead  will pay attention to and take steps on  the

matters  which  the Opposition has raised,  because

the  time  has  come  when we do  not  wish  to  be

considered  any  longer  as,  to  quote  the  Prime

Minister, "gunny bags fit for bayonet practices  by

the  Japanese". We are not here just to offer blind

opposition,  but  we are here  to  offer  and  have

offered constructive and useful criticisms. We have

given  the Government an opportunity to show  their

capabilities  by  carrying  out  plans  which   are

beneficial to the people. It is clear now that  the

matters  raised by the Opposition have  caused  the

Government   to   consider  them   seriously.   For

instance,  the  Trade  Unions  Bill.  Although  the

Government did pass the Trade Unions Bill  in  this

Assembly,  I am quite sure that the Government  has

now  given second thoughts to it, as it will be re-introduced at a later date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point on which I would like to touch in

this   Assembly,   Mr   Speaker,   is   the   good

relationship  between the Indonesian and  Singapore

Governments. The people of Singapore gladly welcome

this.  But  on  behalf of the  inhabitants  of  the

Southern Islands, I would like to raise this  point

in this Assembly, and that is, that this Government

will  convey to the Indonesian Government,  on  the

basis  of our good relationship, the hopes  of  the

inhabitants  concerning the methods of  entry  into

Indonesian-owned islands. I know  of  the  existing

facilities  accorded  to  the  fishermen   on   the

Southern  Islands to fish in Indonesian territorial

waters  which have been going on well, but  what  I

have  in  mind  is  the  relationship  between  the

inhabitants of the Southern Islands and those of  a

neighbouring  island  outside the  jurisdiction  of

Singapore [meaning an island in Indonesia]. Some of

these people who are Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>



citizens marry Indonesian subjects, living  on  the

neighbouring  island.  From time  immemorial,  they

have  had  this social intercourse.  Now  they  are

encountering  difficulties  with  the   Immigration

Department. What I am told is that in the past they

were  issued with special identity cards valid  for

one  year,  and  the possession  of  these  special

identity  cards  would enable them to  move  freely

between  the  Indonesian Islands for  the  specific

purposes,  as  mentioned on the identity  cards.  I

hope  this  system  will  be  reintroduced  by  the

Immigration Department, as it will facilitate entry

of the wives or children into Singapore, the object

of  which  is relationship between one  family  and

another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, Mr Speaker, I hope the Minister

for  Education will be in a position in the  coming

year to build a school on Blakan Mati. I am told by

the  Education Ministry that the school  at  Blakan

Mati  in the past year was outside the jurisdiction

of  the  Ministry of Education. It was at the  time

under  the  control  of  the Ministry  of  National

Development.  For this year, however,  there  is  a

school site and building plans have been completed,

except that the Education Ministry has no money  at

its disposal, and I hope this year a school will be

built on Blakan Mati because the difficulties faced

by the pupils are great indeed in that they have to

travel  by  ferry  across to the island  of  Blakan

Mati.  Sometimes  they experience  difficulties  in

using the ferry supplied by the War Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly with the Prime Minister who is in

charge  of rural areas. During the past year  there

was  no  vote  for  the development  of  these  two

islands - Blakan Mati and Pulau Brani. Hence  in  the

coming year I believe there are provisions for  the

development of Pulau Brani. One of the  things  for

the  Ministry to provide is a jetty in the  kampong

called  Telok Saga. At the moment the people  there

are  using,  as a bridge, only a piece  of  timber,

which is dangerous.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. is a Party of strength

and  full  of  revolutionary spirit.  It  will  not

accept any compromise with the colonialists. Before

the  general elections last year, we expounded  our

Five-Year Plan. At present, the Government  of  the

self-governing  State  of  Singapore  works   under

certain restrictions contained in the Constitution.

The   Government  has  therefore  found  it   quite

impossible to fulfill all the hopes and aspirations

of  the  people.  The  P.A.P. Government  will  not

disappoint  the people because of the  restrictions

contained in the Constitution. The achievements  of

the  past  year have clearly shown that the  P.A.P.

Government   has   been  doing  its   best - although

restricted  by  the  Constitution - to  fulfill   the

desires and hopes of the people, especially in  the

expansion of local industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, our colleagues and I are

still not satisfied with the Constitution. Our aims

are  the same as those of our people. If the people

want  to achieve their aims, they must always stand

united  with  a Left-wing political Party  that  is

firm  in  its policies. Such a party is the  P.A.P.

Our  Party  is a Party that has the best  political

policies  in  the  history of Malayan  nationalism.

Being  a  Left-wing  Party  and  an  up-holder   of

nationalism, we will not lose sight of the original

noble  objectives of our struggle (we have a  long-term aim) amidst the political turmoil, and we will

not  be made use of by any political opportunists..

All  intelligent  Left-wing thinkers  are  able  to

analyse  the present situation of political  unrest

and   turmoil.   No  matter  what   the   political

opportunists will do, or have done, they will fail,

just  like  Mr  Marshall's  Workers'  Party.   The

progressive  forces are always united together  and

will   struggle  against  colonialism   and   semi-feudalism  to the end. At the same time, the  P.A.P

will continue to struggle by not wavering from  its

firm policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people know that, since the

P.A.P. came into power and governed the State under

the Constitution, we have been enforcing our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



revolutionary   policies   to   reform   Government

organisations, to cut out unnecessary expenses,  to

wipe  out bureaucracy, to end corruption completely

and   to  make  public  servants  more  polite  and

courteous  to  the public. These policies  will  be

enforced  as  long as the P.A.P. is  in  power.  If

anyone  tries  to  disrupt us,  we  will  take  the

necessary action to suppress him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continuous increase of population has created

more  unemployment  among  the  young  people.  The

Government   attaches  great  importance   to   the

creation  of  more jobs for the young  people.  For

this  reason, the Government is trying its best  to

expand  local  industries all the time.  This  year

will see the beginning of industrial expansion  and

it  will also be a year that will decide the future

of  the P.A.P. The l½ million people of the  State

will  begin  to  enjoy  an  era  of  economic   and

political   stability.  There  is   no   limit   to

industrial  expansion. The Government has  complete

confidence in the expansion of industries.  During

the  past  few months, many firms have invested  in

pioneer industries and have signed agreements  with

the  Government. These firms are now building their

factories.  There are 13 firms which have  sent  in

applications. The total investment capital is  more

than $100 million. We believe that, in future, more

local  and foreign capital will be invested in  the

building of factories. Because of the establishment

of  more  factories,  the Government  is  gradually

solving  the problem of unemployment. The State  is

on  the  road to prosperity, and the livelihood  of

the people will be secured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the expansion of industries, the Government is

concerned  about and has regard for the welfare  of

the  workers. The Government will not allow similar

unhappy events of the past to recur and it will not

allow  the basic rights and benefits of the workers

to  be  exploited. The Government will protect  the

rights of both employees and employers based on the

principle of mutual benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although the important duty of

the  Government  is to expand local industries,  we

have not neglected the welfare of the farmers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



The  Government regards the welfare and  living  of

the farmers with importance. They were an oppressed

and  forgotten  lot  by the colonialists.  The  old

Government  was  not sincere in looking  after  the

livelihood  of  the  farmers.  Many  of  them   had

cultivated  land to support their families  through

their  own  sweat  and blood - not  forgetting  their

forefathers - for    the    past    decades.     Some

unenlightened landlords had forced the  farmers  to

vacate  their land under the old law which favoured

the  landlords. At the same time, the  farmers  did

not  get  even  a  single cent as compensation  for

their  evacuation. The farmers had to  leave  their

lovely  houses, knowing that there was  no  clearly

defined  laws  to protect them. Due to  a  lack  of

legal  protection, the farmers felt  insecure.  The

P.A.P. fully sympathises with the suffering of  the

farmers.  So  during  the  first  session  of   the

Assembly  we  passed an Ordinance to protect  them.

This  has  given  them a feeling  of  security.  In

column 11 of Hansard dated 20th July, 1960 (Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech), it is stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Legislation to give farmers better security of

tenure  is under preparation and will be introduced

in the Legislative Assembly during this session.'



<br><br>Therefore,  we  can  say that  during  the  present

session of the Assembly, the dwelling-houses of the

farmers  will be protected by law. We believe  that

the  farmers will greatly welcome this legislation.

This   proves   that  the  P.A.P.,  Government   is

interested  in  looking after the  welfare  of  the

farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on 3rd August, 1960, the Member

for Kampong Kembangan blamed the Government for not

having  been  able to achieve the same  results  in

construction projects for the villages and kampongs

during the past 14 months as those achieved by  the

old  Government. Maybe the hon. Member has not gone

to see the kampongs since becoming a Member of this

House. He just lives a private life and knows  only

how   to  criticise  the  ineffectiveness  of   the

Government's policies. He is just like a blind  man

who is feeling an elephant's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



body and, on touching its tail, shouts out at once

that the elephant is a short rope.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the other day -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I understand that yesterday a Member

was  likened  to a dog. I think this time  an  hon.

Member  is  likened  to  an  elephant,  unless  the

interpretation is wrong. If that is not  so,  then,

of  course, the Member for Pasir Panjang  must  not

say that a Member of this Assembly is likened to an

elephant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

just now, when I spoke about an elephant, I did not

mean that the hon. Member is an elephant. I only

meant that he was like the blind man who, in the

story, was feeling his way round an elephant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the other day, my colleague the

Member  for Choa Chu Kang spoke on the achievements

of  the  Government in construction works  for  the

villages.  I  would like to inform the  Member  for

Kampong Kembangan that, since the setting up of the

City  and Rural Advisory Council 14 months ago,  we

have  achieved  splendid results in  the  city  and

rural  areas.  Many  city and rural  dwellers  have

written  letters  to the Council  asking  for  more

roads and more public water-pipes, etc. The Council

will  concentrate  on the areas where  improvements

are  badly needed. In this connection, I would like

to  remind  the  Member for Kampong Kembangan  that

during the July meeting of the Council, it approved

a vote of $1,104,000 for the building of more water-pipes,   roads,   sheltered  bus-stands   and   the

installation of street lights. This is solid  proof

that  the  P.A.P.  Government  regards  with  great

importance the welfare of the people living in  the

city and rural areas.



<br><br>3.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

not  an  eloquent speaker like the Hon. the  Prime

Minister or other hon. Members that this House  has

seen  in  the past. I do not claim to  be  a  David

Marshall. I am, therefore, extremely puzzled,  Sir,

why my mere silence - a silence which half the hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



Members on the Government Benches have emulated - did

call  for stern strictures from the Hon, the  Prime

Minister  and the public. He has even seen  fit  to

make  unseemly jokes about my silence. Mere silence

seems  to  gnaw at his heart. However,  that  is  a

thing of the past, Sir. But, Sir, there are reasons

why   I   kept  silent.  Perhaps  my  silence   did

contribute to the split in the P.A.P. Had I  spoken

too  much, both sides [indicating] would have  gone

for me.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> This is of course, the hon. Member's

maiden speech in this Assembly. Perhaps he does not

know  that  I  do  not like gestures.  Pointing  at

Members,  I think, is completely out of order.  The

hon. Member must remember that he is addressing the

Chair and not the Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> I apologise, Mr Speaker. As you

say,  I  am making my maiden speech and, of course,

one  gets  rather exuberant after a  long  silence,

particularly when one has been thumped in the  back

so many times for keeping that silence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I was very happy to see you pull up

the  Hon, the  Prime Minister  for  calling  me  a

parliamentary jester.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There again I think the hon.

Member is slipping. When the Speaker has ruled on a

topic,  that  ruling stands. I do not  think  there

could  be  any  more  debate  or  comment  on   it.

Otherwise, we will have every Member debating every

ruling of the Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> I stand by your ruling, Sir, but

may  I  just quote an old proverb that many a  true

word has been spoken in jest, and say that that  is

a  proverb  which the Hon, the Prime  Minister  may

like to remember when he cracks unseemly jokes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to say, Sir, is this: although

I  have  been silent, I have not been blind  and  I

have not been deaf. This is the highest assembly in

the  entire country, and we expect debates in  this

House  to  be dignified. You have been  put  there,

Sir, to see that dignity is enforced in this House.

There  are hopes that we will not have our  debates

conducted  like  a coffee-shop quarrel,  where  one

party would say. "Hi, pe-nyapu-lu,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



kasut  burok-lu," and the  other  party

would  reply,  "Chilaka-lu," and no merits  of  the

case  come  out at all in the argument. Both  sides

get heated up, and the debate ends up in a brawl or

with everybody not understanding anything at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Minister for Culture has told

you that an occasion like this is traditionally the

opportunity for reviewing the past, the present and

forecasting the future. I think he did mention  the

past  actions of the Government, but I  would  say,

Sir, that we ought to go further than the past  one

year's   actions  of  the  Government,   to   fully

understand the mentality of the hon. Members on the

opposite Benches, and through them the mind of  the

Government  which issued the speech  which  is  the

subject  of  this debate. We must go  further  back

into the very history of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1819 Sir Stamford Raffles bought Singapore,

and  for many decades, Singapore was nothing but  a

little  shop  in the British Empire.  In  1853  the

great    Queen   Victoria   issued    the    famous

proclamation, whereby she proclaimed that  all  her

subjects  of  whatever race, colour or creed  would

have  their customs and laws respected by her,  and

these would prevail in her empire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, Sir, if I may be allowed to humbly say so,

is the beginning of politics in Singapore. That was

the first ray which gave the people of this country

the  hope  that one day we would have independence.

Then,  Sir, from 1853 until the first World War  in

1914, we were ruled as a colony: from a little shop

to  a  little colony. As a result of the tumultuous

happenings of the first World War, we evolved  into

another   stage  of  our  history  when  the   word

"trusteeship"  first  became  prominent   in   this

country.  England  became  the  trustees   of   her

colonial people, and not the owners of the  colony.

Then  the people of this country realised that they

should start stirring up arguments for independence

or  its compromise - self-government. In that period,

Sir,  which, if  I may be allowed  to  allocate  a

chapter  would end somewhere around the  beginnings

of  the  1930s, we  had the  real  giant  fighters

against the colonial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



power - we  had  Sir Ong Siang Song [Laughter] - laugh,

my  friend, but these were the real fighters in the

colonial  war. These are the people whose  eloquent

speeches were heard in Whitehall which caught their

attention that the people of this country were just

as capable as the people of any other country in so

far as speech-making and merits were concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we get into the stage when the immediate

past  fighters in the colonial war were  in  power,

the  Tan  Chin  Tuans, the C. C. Tans [Laughter] - my

friends may laugh differently when I finish.  These

were  the  people who fought the anti-colonial  war

for the peoples of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, we had the second World War. In the

second  World  War,  this country  was  very,  very

upset.  A good many of the elders, a good  many  of

the  pioneer  fighters  in the  anti-colonial  war,

died.  There remained people who had no background,

people  who "jumped the wagon", if I may  use  that

phrase.  In  this period of the Japanese occupation

of this country, the very young, even boys of 8 and

12,  did a great deal of work and were able to earn

more  money than their elders. There was a complete

change  of  the  social structure of  this  country

during that period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the end of the Japanese occupation, and

we    had    the    beginnings   of   parliamentary

representation in this country. We had elections to

the  then  Municipality, subsequently City Council.

We  had  our  first Mayor, and that is  a  distinct

stage in the history of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1954 came a group of people who formed

themselves  into  the People's  Action  Party.  The

members of the People's Action Party, Sir, are very

honourable gentlemen. Many of them are firm friends

of  mine.  I  have the highest regard for  many  of

them.  They are also very well qualified. The  Hon.

the  Prime Minister, Sir, if you will allow  me  to

make  individual mention, gained a triple first  in

the Law Tripos at Cambridge. And I think that brain

of his is a very valuable brain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>



for  this country if used in the proper manner, and

not for cracking jokes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Jester!



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> Who is the jester? I beg your

pardon,  Sir, I must not mention that  word  again.

Sir, what I would like to express by this review of

the history of this country is this: to be able  to

govern this country for the present and the future,

you  must know your past. In the past, this country

has     made     many    mistakes,     politically,

administratively, and economically. If we know  the

mistakes of the past, we were less likely  to  make

mistakes  in  the  year 1959, as  admitted  in  the

speech,  and,  more important still,  Sir,  in  the

second decisive year o the Lee Kuan Yew Government.

By  the way, Sir, I do not like the ominous note in

those  words  of  the Hon, the Prime  Minister - "the

decisive  second  year" - has he got any  instinctive

feeling  that  there might be some  danger  to  his

continuing into the third year?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, let us say that the collective

unconscious  of politics in Singapore  is  just  as

important  as the immediate past, the  present  and

the immediate future. Now we know, Sir,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I nearly pointed [to a Member] - why the speech of

the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is made

in  such general terms. The drafters of the  speech

have  no background, Sir; that is why. They are  so

intense, so enthusiastic in their social revolution

in  the  present and in the immediate  future  that

they  do not know anything about the past and  have

forgotten  about  the  past.  Their  treatment   of

everybody  in this country, who may not be  members

of  the People's Action Party, well, I will not say

it   is   insulting,  because  that  may   not   be

parliamentary,  Sir,  but  it  is   certainly   not

encouraging  to Members of (I must not  point)  the

Opposition and to the other people -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am sorry I have discouraged

the  hon.  Member  from gesturing.  I  have  merely

indicated  that too much pointing  is  not  what  I

would  like  to see in this Assembly. But  sweeping

gestures,   gestures  which  the  Prime   Minister

sometimes uses, are, I think, quite in order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. I

wonder  if speakers could be allowed to drink  some

water  whilst  they  are going  on.  My  throat  is

getting a bit dry after 14 months of silence!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is about time the People's Action

Party stop talking about their sweeping majority in

the  elections  of 1959. After all, the  number  of

people who voted for the 43 candidates, for the  43

winners of the People's Action Party, numbered only

273,000.  The  people  who  voted  for  the   other

parties,  that  is the Opposition  to  the  P.A.P.,

numbered 243,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam:</b> How many did you get?



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> I got 6,100 votes as compared to

the P.A.P. candidate of 5,300.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Next time you will get 60 votes!



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> To be sure - Well, I had better not.

As I said. I do not want a coffee-shop brawl. So  I

had  better  set an example, Mr Speaker,  whatever

may be the provocation [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Members on

the  Government Front Bench should set an  example,

and  I might also remind once again the Member  for

Joo Chiat that he is addressing the Chair. Possibly

if  he  looks  at  the Chair he  might  not  notice

interruptions.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not the

looks  but the sounds. However, Sir, if  I  may  go

back  to the speech, bearing in mind the background

with which we shall deal with this speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Hon. the Prime Minister has accused the

Opposition  in toto of being completely  unable  to

debate   with   him  on  subjects   of   tremendous

importance in this country. Well, Sir, there is one

thing which I must say. It may be that we so highly

respect  the  brain that gained a triple  first  in

Cambridge that we would like to give him  a  chance

to  show  us  what  such a brain can  do  for  this

country. The other thing, Sir, is that whatever  we

say in this Assembly gets steamrollered out of this

Assembly. But he has very kindly invited us to help



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



him.  That  is  the gist of his invocation  to  the

Opposition   Members.   Let   us   put   a   kindly

interpretation  on what he said. I cannot  remember

his exact words, Mr Speaker. It may be nice to  us

or  it may not be nice to us. But the gist of it is

this.  "I  would like the Members of the Opposition

to  speak strongly and debate strongly so  that  we

can  get  somewhere in the crucial matters of  this

country." Right, Sir. We shall now give it to  him.

In  this  nuclear age, Sir, the entire country  was

waiting  with trembling knees for a highly  charged

and   dramatic  speech  from  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara.   We  were  hopelessly  disappointed.   The

speech.  I  think  the general  word  used  in  the

country  today,  was  "tame". Mind  you,  Sir,  the

entire  country heaved a sigh of relief  when  they

heard  the  speech.  No general  policy  of  higher

taxation.    No   general   policy   of   increased

assessment. Thank goodness for that kind of speech!

But,  Sir, there are dangerous inaccuracies in that

speech  which must not be allowed to go by  without

emphatic remarks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the statement in the speech that we

are  now  enjoying economic prosperity  which  this

country has never seen during the last 15 years.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the hon. Member would

like  to  read the passage of the speech because  I

cannot  see the word "prosperity" in that  passage.

I  might have been looking at the wrong passage, of

course.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> Sir, it is in Hansard, Vol. 13 No. 1 col. 5:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The correctness of the policy laid down in the

Five-Year  Plan  has been shown by  the  fact  that

under  the  new Government. Singapore  has  enjoyed

greater  political and economic stability  than  it

has known during the last 15 years.'



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Where is "prosperity"?



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> Why did you not include

"prosperity"? That is the point.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am sorry to have to keep

interrupting the hon. Member. But I can assure  him

I  did not write the speech. But when he says "you"

he is referring to the Chair.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> I apologise to you, Mr Speaker,

for  the exuberance of a maiden speech! And I blush

for  it.  Sir, now that I come to see it, it  is  a

peculiar thing that the word "prosperity" has  been

left  out.  I  think it was the  intention  of  the

Government  to make people believe that  after  one

year   of   their  government,  this   country   is

economically in a wonderful position. But they dare

not put it in words, because they would immediately

then  be  faced with this grave fact.  Whereas  the

whole of Europe and America are today enjoying  one

of  the  biggest booms in the world,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  our stomachs are getting more and more hungry

as  we  go  on  from  day to day under  the  P.A.P.

Government,  except  in the case  of  people  of  a

certain inclination who may have got their salaries

raised  by  promotion from civilian  life  to  non-civilian  life.  I think it is well  known  whom  I

mean.  They  are the people whose total  income  in

previous  days may have been $100 a month  and  who

are  now  getting  $500  a month.  Or  are  certain

political parties taking so much of their  Members'

money  that  the  Members  do  not  get  the   full

allowance that they are entitled to under the  law?

People of a certain class who used to earn $800  or

so - I  will not look where - are now earning much more

than  that.  Those people, of course, are  enjoying

greater political and economic stability than  they

have known during the last 15 years, than the whole

of  their  lives. Apart from that, we  cannot  deny

that  this  is  the first time in  the  history  of

Singapore,  the  first time  since  1819  and  even

before  that, that Singapore has a slump  when  the

rest of the world is enjoying a very great boom.  I

hope   the  Prime  Minister  will  give   us   some

explanation of that when he replies in this debate.

He has the last word, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I hope the Member will give

some  authority to say that there  is  a  slump  in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This is getting to be like a

coffee-shop! I think the hon. Member had not  given

way when the Prime Minister spoke.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh</b> resumed his seat.

I have not noticed it in the market report.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that remark of

the  Prime  Minister is typical of him and  of  the

entire P.A.P. Government. They blind themselves  to

the facts. Does he not know the prices of shares on

the  Malayan  Stock Exchange today as  compared  to

those  of 15 years ago? Or we need not even  go  so

far. As socialists, they may say that they are  not

shareholders.  But  as  the  Government   of   this

country, the prosperity of this country is a matter

in their hands, and they should know it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What do we not know?



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> I will reply, Mr Speaker, Sir,I

am  just  in  the  first half-hour  of  my  speech.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We will never get on this

way.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker. Sir, far

from  enjoying political and economic stability,  I

would  say  that  in  the last  year  the  economic

condition  of  this  country has  never  been  more

unsatisfactory.  That  is one  inaccuracy  which  I

would  like to point out in the speech.  I  do  not

want  to go too much into it. I will now say it  in

general terms - that it is full of inaccuracies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think one paragraph in this speech

typifies the entire speech. That is in col.  13  of

Hansard,  Vol.  13 No. 1, under the title  `Poultry

Farming'. "Chickens" to those who do not  know  the

word!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`An improved strain of chicks has been bred which

will  grow  much faster than the local Canton  fowl

and which will lay 40 per cent more eggs. Each fowl

of  this  strain will lay up to 150 eggs  per  year

whereas  the local Canton fowl can lay only between

90  and  100 eggs per year. Day-old chicks of  this

new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



strain will be distributed to farmers to improve

their livestock.'



<br><br>That is the quotation. A tremendous enunciation  of

a  wonderful  policy! I suppose this paragraph  was

put  in  for  the  benefit of the farmers  of  this

country whom the P.A.P. are so bent on currying - no,

Sir,  that may not be parliamentary - whom the P.A.P.

are so bent on -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On helping.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> Now, listen to this. `Helping' is

the  word of the Hon, the Prime Minister. Does  the

Hon, the  Prime Minister know the true facts?  The

White  Leghorn - before I say anything, Sir,  let  me

say  that whilst a few of the hon. Members  on  the

opposite  side  were just crawling alongside  their

cradles,  I have been keeping chickens. [Laughter].

Is  there anything wrong, Sir, in keeping chickens?

I know what is in their minds.

there is a joke, I do not understand it. I hope -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Speaker has not laughed.

[Laughter] Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> Sir, it is a wonderful inspiration

to us to have a Speaker who is so dignified in this

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Leghorn can lay up to 280 eggs per

annum  as compared with the marvellous breed  which

the   Government  proposes  to  introduce  in  this

country  and  which can lay only 150 eggs.  280  to

150.  There is another difference, Sir.  The  local

eggs  are  l oz. to  1¼ oz. in  weight.  The  White

Leghorn  egg is 2 oz. to 2½ oz. in weight.  Sir,  I

know  there are people in this country who  do  not

like  White Leghorn eggs because they are  coloured

white. Of course, in time to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>



come they may not bother about it as long as it  is

fresh. But for the time being. I concede that White

Leghorn eggs may be a little unpopular even  though

the  noble White Leghorn can produce 280  eggs  per

annum  as compared to the 150 super strain of  fowl

which the P.A.P. Government proposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another breed which produces a

pinkish  egg. And that is the New Hampshire  breed,

in  particular,  the Japanese New Hampshire  breed.

They  have  been imported into this  country.  They

will  survive  in this country. They will  eke  out

very  well  in  this  country. I  speak  also  from

personal experience -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You do not lay eggs!



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> Mr Speaker, you and I did not

hear  that remark. However, they are pinkish  eggs,

and  they  also weigh a minimum of 2 oz., generally

2½  oz.  Sir,  the  New  Hampshire  eggs  are  very

desirable in this country. I have imported  50  New

Hampshire chicks lately. They are, according to the

people  who  export  them  and  according  to   the

experiences  of  the people who  have  experimented

with them on quite a large scale in this country, a

breed  that will produce a minimum of 240 eggs  per

annum.  What  has the Government got to  say  about

this  marvellous, nameless strain of  theirs  which

can  produce  only  150 eggs  per  year,  Sir?  An

inaccuracy  which  can be very  dangerous,  because

money will have to be spent on purchasing these day

old  chicks  to  introduce  the  strain  into  this

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, mathematically, I will prove to the

House  that  the  help which the P.A.P.  Government

wish to give to the farmers of this country will be

their undoing and will lead to their bankruptcy. It

costs  approximately 3 cents per day  to  feed  one

laying  hen. That is what is known in the trade  as

the  free range system of keeping layers. In  other

words, it costs roughly 90 cents to $1 to keep  one

hen.  If  that  hen can produce only 150  eggs  per

year,  that  will  be approximately  12½  eggs  per

month. Sir, the present wholesale price of eggs  is

8 to 8½ cents each. Therefore, there will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



be  no profit for the farmer. So where is the help?

That  is the simplest calculation possible, without

taking into consideration the services rendered and

the employees the farmers may have to employ to run

the  farm. With this production cost of eggs on the

market,  there  will be no profit.  Help  from  the

P.A.P. to the farmers! Sir, that is, in my  humble

submission, typical of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the last paragraph of the speech is a saving

grace:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The second year of office of the P.A.P

Government will be a year of construction.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as an independent Member of this Assembly, I

say that as things stand at the present moment,  we

do   not   see   any  alternative  to  the   P.A.P.

Government. I for one, Sir, although I will  do  my

best emphatically to criticise them, will also  not

be  behind in giving them encouragement.  Let  them

make   the  second  year  of  office  a   year   of

construction.  We  wish them well.  We  have  on  a

number   of  occasions  said  that  we   mean   it,

regardless  of the insults thrown at  us.  We,  the

older  Members of this Assembly, do hope that  with

the  passage  of  time the younger Members  of  the

Government will mature with age and bear the  heavy

responsibilities, of governing this  country.  Let

them  spend their time, Sir, in administering  this

country  and  not  in  blowing  hot  air   at   the

Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I sit here and hear comrade blasting at

comrade,  I  sometimes wonder whether we,  the  old

pioneers  who  have  sweated  in  the  service   of

Government  to prove our point that the  people  of

this  country are capable of governing  themselves,

did not step on the accelerator a bit too hard.  We

had  hoped  that  self-government in  this  country

would  produce prosperity and the other good things

of  life. The Government had promised us this,  and

this last paragraph, Sir, is full of good promises.

But  it  still  rankles  in our  minds,  Sir,  that

instead  of  making a sporting admission  of  their

mistakes  of  the  first year, they  mix  with  the

words,  "We  have made mistakes," these words,  "We

will still say it is a period of reorganisation." A

reorganisation,  Sir,  can  be of   many   forms.

Tumbling things over, turning



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



things  topsy  turvy, and calling it reorganisation

may  go  down  with certain people,  but  not  with

intelligent  people. Anyway, we do  hope  that  the

Government in their second year will call a spade a

spade within their councils. We do not care a  hang

what  they  say  outside, but we pray  that  within

their  councils they will call a spade a spade  and

that  they  will call the first  year  a  year  of

complete  failure and a year of amateurish methods,

which  cannot  but produce failures  and  mistakes.

Sir,  the  old hands in this country did not  fight

just  to have amateurs take over the Government  of

this country and experiment with the people and the

economics of this country. We are still prepared to

help the Government if the Government will speak to

us in a civil tone and not in a bantering and -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You still want to try?



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> - angry tone. I almost feel

tempted to reply to the side remark of the hon.

Prime Minister, but you may not like it, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the time when the Hon. Prime Minister was

in  the Opposition and at the time when he had  his

quarrels  with his own comrades, he  did  get  help

from the Lim Yew Hock Government to dispose of  his

opponents  within his own Party.  Sir,  that  power

wielded  by the Lim Yew Hock Government is  in  the

hands  of the Lee Kuan Yew Government. Let  us  now

see whether the Hon. Prime Minister will act as  he

had  asked the previous Government to act. We,  the

outsiders  in this tremendous struggle between  the

two factions of the P.A.P. will be only too glad to

see   strong   measures  taken   by   the   present

Government. We hope there will be no vacillation on

the  part  of  the  Hon.  Prime  Minister  and  his

colleagues in the Cabinet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the speech of the Hon. Prime Minister in

opening this debate was a wonderful speech. I  give

him  every praise for it. It is the kind of  speech

which  I do not think any Member of the Opposition,

either   inside  this  Assembly  or  outside   this

Assembly, can improve on. It is a real product of a

brain which gained triple honours in Cambridge.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> Hear, hear! Sir, whether it is a

speech   a  Right-winger  might  make  or  not   is

immaterial. Both that side and this side  agree  it

is a wonderful speech. But some parts of it are not

so  wonderful. The part which strives  to  belittle

the amendments of the Opposition. It is a favourite

technique of the P.A.P. immediately and at the very

beginning  to  rebut a good argument by  belittling

it - a very well-known tactic of the hon. Members  on

the  other side of the House. And because they have

seen  fit  to  belittle my two amendments,  I  find

great  encouragement in thinking that they must  be

tremendous amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish I could ask this House to stand in

silence  for  two  minutes  [Laughter] - it   is   no

laughing  matter - to commemorate the  death  of  Mr

Wong  Siong  Yin,  a  victim of a  kidnapping  (the

second  of  the victims of the kidnappings  to  pay

with  his life). Kidnapping is not a small  subject

in  Singapore today. The Hon, the Prime Minister in

his  speech said that I was introducing  a  subject

which  affects only a few rich people,  meaning  to

infer,  of  course, that I have turned  capitalist.

But, surely, his intelligence is not as low as  all

that.  Surely,  his Intelligence department  within

our  Scotland  Yard could not be so inefficient  as

not to give him reports of what is going on in this

country.  Whether admitted officially or  not,  and

whether  reported to the Police or not,  kidnapping

is not the affair of a few, Sir. As a result of the

wave  of kidnappings business has been tremendously

curtailed  in this country. Perhaps as a result  of

moving  about with a certain class of  people,  the

Members of the Government have failed to appreciate

the full significance of these kidnappings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the economy of this country which we are

so keen to improve is not in a prosperous state, we

will all suffer. The economics of this country  are

affected  by  the  actions of  certain  classes  of

people  in this country. A very important class  is

the  merchant  class. Whether they are millionaires

or not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



and  whether they are in big business or not, these

are  the  people who control the economics of  this

country, Sir, and these people today are in a  very

jittery state. They dare not go to their clubs - that

is,  those remaining clubs which are allowed to  be

in existence by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Which club?



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> And, Sir, whether the Government

laughs or not, a great deal of the business of this

country  is done in the clubs. It may be right,  it

may  be wrong, it may be anything you like; but the

fact  stares you in the face that a great  deal  of

the  business of this country is done in the clubs.

Because  of  this  fear  of  being  kidnapped,  the

merchants - big and small - of this country are  afraid

to  go  to  their  clubs. There  was  a  kidnapping

outside  one  of the biggest clubs of this  country

which  ended  these  night  visits  to  clubs.  The

purposes of these night visits to clubs could  have

been  various, but the main purpose was to  do  big

business, Sir. The Government may like to check  on

that.  We  have a sufficiently intelligent  section

within  our  Scotland Yard to check on that  simple

fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when these merchants get into that

frightened state of mind and refuse to do too  much

business, it must result in a deterioration of  the

economic condition of this country. If there  is  a

deterioration  in  the economic condition  of  this

country,  it  is the poor man who will suffer.  The

rich man will not suffer because he will be able to

buy  his  food and his luxury. If he stops business

or  if  business activity is curtailed, then it  is

the  poor  man who is going to suffer - and the  poor

will   suffer  in  large  numbers.  And  yet,   the

Government of this country says that they  are  the

Government for the poor! And yet the Hon, the Prime

Minister   wishes  to  belittle  the   subject   of

kidnapping. Perhaps I could give an illustration in

that  strain,  Sir.  We  have  a  large  number  of

restaurants  in this country. In those restaurants,

big businesses used to give dinners attended by big

business  people.  But  now  with  this   fear   of

kidnapping, big business people will no longer use



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



these  restaurants.  Who  will  suffer,  Sir?   The

workers  in the restaurants will suffer.  And  yet,

the  P.A.P.  Government says.  "Kidnapping  affects

only a few rich people."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another aspect of kidnapping, Sir,It is

beginning  to be said in this country that  if  the

rich  people  who  can afford to pay  for  security

measures  are  unable to protect  themselves,  then

what  chance  is  there for  the  poor  to  protect

themselves from the evil elements in this  country?

The  entire  Police  system is in  disrepute,  Sir,

because  of the kidnappings and their inability  to

catch the kidnappers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might remember, Sir, that in the Tan Puay

Choo  kidnapping,  the  Police  were  notified   12

minutes  after the kidnapping. In the Ng  Sen  Choy

kidnapping, a much longer interval elapsed  between

the time of kidnapping and the information reaching

the Police. In both cases, Sir, the kidnappers were

brought  to  book. In the Tan Puay Choo kidnapping,

the Hon. the Prime Minister defended the kidnapper.

Thank  goodness his skill failed and the  kidnapper

was  hanged. In the Ng Sen Choy kidnapping, Sir,  a

man  was  also  arrested.  The  point  I  want   to

emphasise,  Sir, is this. In both cases,  the  time

interval was much longer than the time interval  in

the  C.  K. Tang kidnapping. The Police received  a

telephone  call  (on  their  admission) - unless  the

newspapers  are wrong - within three minutes  of  Mr

Tang  being taken by the kidnappers, and they  were

not  able  to arrest anybody. What kind  of  Police

have   we  got?  How  much  earlier  notice  of   a

kidnapping  do they want before they  can  catch  a

kidnapper?  I suppose there must have  been  shouts

within a few seconds of the kidnapping of Mr C. K.

Tang. Where were all the Police? What have we  been

paying  millions  of dollars  for?  It  is  a  very

dangerous  state of affairs, Sir, when the  country

loses  confidence in its Police. Yet the Government

say  that they want Assemblymen to have talks  with

the  Police  in  order  to  create  closer  liaison

between  the Police and the public. The surest  way

of  ensuring confidence in the Police is to  ensure

results - results every time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Prime Minister tried to belittle the

kidnappings.  We  all know that the  Straits  Times

never copies big articles from the other newspapers

in  this  country. Yet it had to copy  the  article

concerning  the alleged proposals of the Government

regarding  kidnapping from the  Chinese  newspapers

three  or four days after the latter headlined  it.

Why,  Sir, did the Straits Times do this? Could  it

be  that  the  Straits Times was compelled  to  say

something  because  the whole  country  is  talking

about it? People from the highest to the lowest are

talking about this subject of kidnapping. Everybody

is  terrified  to  go  out of his  house.  Yet  the

Government  says  that it is a little  matter  with

which Mr C. H. Koh wishes to break his silence  in

this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second part of my amendment deals with

the  recall  of those civil servants who  resigned.

Sir,  in  the  past  one year,  we  have  lost  the

services of Government servants in many ways.  Some

have  retired on attaining the age limit. Some have

been  properly  dismissed. And  there  is  a  third

category.    Sir, - those   who   resigned    because

conditions  were made so intolerable  for  them  in

their  departments  that they  had  to  resign.  Of

course, the Government can easily laugh it off, but

there  is the other side to the problem. Sir,  most

of  these  people are not the rank and  file.  They

are,  what  we can call, the foreman class  in  the

country. I have told you, Sir, that we have Cabinet

Ministers  with  great qualifications -  from  Oxford,

Cambridge, the University of Malaya, etc.  We  also

have  the working rank and file who are very  good.

They  have learned technical subjects and they  are

acknowledged  to be quite good by world  standards.

But,  Sir,  there  is a middle stratum - the  foreman

stratum.  Without the foreman of works,  the  works

might  go awry. It is all very well for the Cabinet

Ministers to evolve wonderful policies. It  is  all

very  well  that we have the workers to carry  them

out. But if we have not got the foreman to come  in

between,  all their works will fail.  And  that  is

what has happened in the last one year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, the subject of my second

amendment is not a puny little subject.  It  is  of

great  moment  if Government is serious  about  the

last  paragraph  of the speech. If  they  seriously

want to construct, then they must have the foremen.

And  if  they  want the foremen,  the  key  to  the

solution  of  construction,  they  must   give   an

opportunity to those Government servants  who  left

not  because  of rightful dismissal  but  on  other

grounds.  I  think  it has been acknowledged  that

mere   age - the  retirement  age  is   55 - need   not

necessarily  be  a  bar  to coming  back  into  the

service,   provided  the  man  is   strong   enough

physically  and has the necessary skill  which  the

service requires. It is for that reason, Sir,  that

I  have introduced the second part of my amendment,

and I do pray that the Government will not just try

to  laugh, because in its third year they may  have

to laugh the other side of their face.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is just one subject, Sir, that has not been

mentioned  in  the policy speech, which  one  would

like to see. And that is this, Sir: we have today a

Ministry of Law and Labour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Labour and Law.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> Labour and Law - thank you. The

Ministry of Labour and Law is causing great concern

to  many people, It is an unusual combination.  The

Minister  for  Labour must stand by the  labourers.

The  Minister for Law must introduce laws which are

agreed  to by both sides, labour and law.  Would  a

man,  prejudiced in favour of labour, be the  right

man  to  introduce impartial laws into the subject?

The  concern  became  greater  when  the  Hon, the

Minister  for Labour and Law said, in  a  loud  and

hardly the thing that is likely to bring about laws

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad that after 14

months  of silence the Member for Joo Chiat has  at

long  last  awakened  to the events  of  the  world

outside   and   brought  forth  this  world-shaking

problem  of  kidnapping  which  has  afflicted  the

wealthier and more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



fortunate  members of our society. This is  not  to

belittle the gravity of the problem. Only  that  it

is  a little disappointing that after 14 months  of

profound thinking, the Member for Joo Chiat  should

bring  up not an issue based on some high political

principles  affecting  the  very  fabric   of   our

society,  but  this  minor issue  of  no  political

significance. In so doing, I hope the suspicion  of

the   kidnappers  would  not  be  aroused  to   the

possibility that the Member for Joo Chiat might  be

in  the same class of this minority section of  the

population and make him their next target. This  is

not  to say that the Government is not going to  do

anything  about it, or is not doing anything  about

it;  but  rather considerable efforts and  manpower

have been devoted to this problem of kidnapping out

of all proportion to the number of people affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of kidnapping has attracted so much

attention  principally because of  its  sensational

news  value,  since men of wealth and  high  social

prestige  are the vicious. On the other  hand,  the

poor   hawkers,  trishaw-riders  and  small  stall-keepers,  who  have been forced to  submit  to  the

demands of criminal elements for years, have  never

received such headline attention in the newspapers.

Unlike  the  hawkers and others, these wealthy  men

have  the  means  and  the  resources  to  minimise

considerably  the  risk of being kidnapped.  I  can

assure the House that the Police is, in fact, doing

all  it can under the circumstances to protect  all

citizens  from  criminal gangs and  thugs.  Indeed,

substantial  results  have  been  achieved  by  the

Police. But to be more effective, there must be the

will  to  resist and sincere cooperation  with  the

Police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is no good criticising the

Police  publicly for not protecting them  while  on

the  sly  ransom money is paid and the  Police  are

kept in the dark. Obviously no police force in  the

world  can  keep watch over every millionaire  when

there is a host of defensive or preventive measures

that the potential targets of kidnapping gangs  can

avail  themselves  of, such  as  by  accepting  the

Police offer of providing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



escorts  and other devices at a price that all  the

victims  of  the recent kidnapping  wave  can  well

afford.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two aspects in tackling this problem.

The  first  is  to  try  and restrain,  as  far  as

possible, the activities of kidnapping gangs,  that

is,  to  take preventive measures. And second,  the

investigation aspect by the police. In  as  far  as

preventive  measures can be taken by the  potential

victims, the best means at present is the offer  by

the  Police of providing Police escorts.  Yet  when

this offer was made, the response was disappointing

indeed. The stock argument that the presence of  an

escort  will  only  attract the  attention  of  the

kidnappers  is  ridiculous, because the  kidnappers

are  not  men  without any intelligence  as  to  be

unable to distinguish between men of substance  and

men too insignificant to merit their attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to say that after the kidnapping of Mr

C.  K.  Tang,  the response is now better.  In  the

meantime,  mechanical devices such as radio  phones

and alarm bells can be installed in motor cars, and

defence  weapons  such as the  American  tear-smoke

weapon,  will  be made available when requests  are

received.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these preventive measures, Mr Speaker, Sir,

are within the means of the millionaires, including

the Member for Joo Chiat.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> You are right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> As for tie investigation

aspect, an anti-kidnapping squad of the C.I.D. has

been  formed,  with men detailed  specifically  for

this, task. Since the beginning of June 1960,  when

this  anti-kidnapping squad commenced operation,  a

total  of 23 persons, including a woman, have  been

arrested   under   the  Criminal   Law   (Temporary

Provisions)  Ordinance.  This  figure   does, not

include the Chia Yee Soh case, in which 11  out  of

14  perpetrators  have been arrested  and  detained

under   the  Criminal  Law  (Temporary  Provisions)

Ordinance,  and the two cases involving schoolboys,

in  which  the gangsters concerned have since  been

convicted for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



seven years. Members of the House may wish to  know

that  in  the case of Tan Beng Siong, four  persons

have  since  been  detained and  three  are  to  be

arrested. In the case of Tan Boon Khak, 14  persons

have  been  detained  and  seven  more  are  to  be

arrested.  In the case of Tan Eng Hooi, one  person

has been arrested, and in the case of Koh Eng Pang,

which  should  more appropriately be classified  as

murder, seven were detained while 10 more are to be

arrested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigation reveals that from a highly

organised  gang  of 20, led by an ex-prisoner  with

secret  society  connections,  mushroom  gangs   of

kidnappers  have sprung up. This is due perhaps  to

the  fact that kidnapping has proved to be far more

profitable  and relatively easier than robbery  and

kindred  offences.  To-date, four  different  gangs

have  been  uncovered.  As a  result  of  intensive

investigation  and  interrogation  of  the  persons

arrested, it was discovered that attempts have been

made  to  abduct three towkays. But these  had  not

actually  been  carried  out  due  to  a  lack   of

opportunity. One of the three potential victims has

since  confirmed  the  Police information  that  an

unsuccessful  attempt was made on  him,  while  the

other  two have since been warned by the Police  to

take adequate precaution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worthy of note that of all the 23 arrests

made,  not  one  has  been  as  a  result  of   the

cooperation  given by the victims or their  agents.

It  was entirely due to the Police effort that such

detentions were made. More arrests could have  been

made  if the victims or their agents had cooperated

wholeheartedly with the Police. Indeed  the  Police

has  reasons  to  believe that a  number  of  these

victims are in a position to identify some of these

23  persons arrested, but have refused to give  the

necessary  assistance to help bring these gangsters

to   Court   with  a  view  to  imposing  deterrent

sentences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the poor co-operation given by the

relatives of the victims, the Government intends to

change  the policy on police action, which  has  so

far  been avoided as it might jeopardise the safety

of  the  victim.  The Government also  proposes  to

institute measures to arrest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



those  who pay as well as receive ransom  money  in

cases  where  friends and relatives of the  victims

have not cooperated wholeheartedly with the Police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will take any action they can to prevent

persons  hindering  their work  regardless  of  the

safety  of  the  victims,  and  even  place  police

officers  in any houses or offices in which  ransom

demands may be expected to be received.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, consultations with the Minister

for  Labour  and Law will be held with  a  view  to

imposing  a  death  penalty for  a  conviction  for

kidnapping, and the possibility of amending the law

to  include  a presumption that unless evidence  is

produced  to the contrary, the drawing of  a  large

sum of cash or the borrowing of a large sum of cash

by  any  relative  or associate  of  the  kidnapped

victim may be regarded as .evidence of abetting the

offence of kidnapping.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole object of these measures is to make

kidnapping a less attractive business and  to  make

it  more  hazardous. The Government  believes  that

with  the  adoption  of these  measures,  increased

efficiency  of  the police and greater  cooperation

from the public and the victims of the families  in

particular,  the  police can deal more  effectively

with  this  problem. The amendment  motion  of  the

Member for Joo Chiat is therefore pointless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are concerned today with fundamental political

issues  affecting  the survival of  the  democratic

system  of the State and the freedom of the people.

In  the  face of all this, the amendment motion  of

the  Member  for  Joo  Chiat  appears  trivial  and

insignificant  and an anti-climax  to  all  the  14

months of silent wisdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I oppose the amendment.



<br><br>5.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Hon. Minister for Home Affairs has chided  the

Member  for Joo Chiat for having broken  his  self-imposed  silence  by moving this amendment  to  the

motion.   He   says  it  is  a  matter   of   small

significance  which has agitated the  mind  of  the

Member for Joo Chiat. The Minister says that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



this  is a matter which only concerns the wealthier

and  more fortunate members of society, such as now

exists  in  Singapore. He also says that kidnapping

has   no  political  significance  whatsoever  and,

therefore, the amendment to the motion is of little

importance to him as Minister for Home Affairs,  in

whose  portfolio lies the safety and protection  of

individual citizens in the State, be they  rich  or

poor.  I  do not think even the Minister  for  Home

Affairs would dare challenge that statement. It  is

no  sin, Mr Speaker, to be wealthy. It is no crime

to  be wealthy. In the state of society such as now

exists  in  Singapore,  the  search  for  and   the

amassing of wealth is not a crime. Even the P.A.P.,

after  one year of government, has now come to  the

conclusion  that,  in view of the  conditions  that

exist  in  Singapore  and  around  it,  they   must

tolerate  the  capitalist system of  society.  They

have  admitted  that  and they have  announced  it.

Whether  as  a  matter of policy  or  a  matter  of

political  ethics  that  is  right  or  wrong,  Mr

Speaker, it is entirely a different matter. But let

us face the facts as they are. The P.A.P. are self-confessed realists. At least I have heard them  say

so  on  a  number of occasions here.  They  take  a

realistic view of the situation even though it goes

against their political credo.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a situation where, whether they like it

or not, the capitalist system has to exist for some

considerable time. In a capitalist system there  is

capital,  and  when  there is capital  there  is  a

wealthy class. Therefore, a Government which  rules

such  a  society as ours has an obligation both  to

the  rich  and to the poor. Therefore,  it  creates

very  little confidence in Singapore not only  from

the  citizens' point of view but from the point  of

view  of  the  world at large, when  a  responsible

Minister,  particularly  the  Minister   for   Home

Affairs, gets up and says, "What is the Member  for

Joo  Chiat  worried  about, he  being  one  of  the

wealthier  and more fortunate members  of  society?

His amendment has no political significance. Has it

an     economic    significance?    Or    political

significance?" I am sorry the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



for  Finance is not here. I think he will say,  "If

we  do  not succeed economically, we are  bound  to

fail politically."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These wealthier people are the people who are

keeping  the  wheels of industry and  trade  moving

smoothly in this country. If you pooh-pooh them, if

you  do not give them a place in your society, and

if  the  Minister laughs at them, what sort  of  an

impression is created. Mr Speaker? What sort of an

impression will the world at large get? The  P.A.P.

want Singapore to succeed. We all want Singapore to

succeed.  And yet very often, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I

hear  responsible Ministers making statements which

belie what they say in general terms. They say, "We

want  to  do this," and yet they pooh-pooh somebody

else  who  is  doing it effectively. This  sort  of

statement by Ministers, Mr Speaker, Sir, has  gone

on for a long time. If the P.A.P. Government really

intend the second year of their Government to be  a

year  of  construction and success, one which  will

lay the foundation for the next three or four years

of  their Government, then they will have  to  stop

making,  if  I  may be permitted to say  so,  these

childish statements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, kidnappings have a great economic significance in Singapore. It upsets the mercantile

community,   and  the  mercantile   community   are

essential to the life of this country. There is  no

use  denying it. If one is a socialist, just as the

Minister for Home Affairs is, must one laugh at the

capitalists?  I  concede the point  that  he  is  a

socialist and a good one; but, unfortunately, he is

connected  with a country which cannot be socialist

in  every  respect. It is wedded  to  a  capitalist

economy for the time being, and so long as that  is

so, then, if he is going to be a good Minister,  he

must  look after his capitalists. There are no  two

ways about it. He must resolve to do so, whether he

likes it or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have read in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech of Ministers who have gone abroad

looking  for  money in England and in  America.  We

want capital from abroad



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



and  we want capital from within in order that  our

industrial  and building programmes  will  succeed.

What  sort  of  news does, this  make  locally  and

abroad - Mr  C. K. Tang, the curio king,  kidnapped?

Mr   C.  K.  Tang  is  a  figure  of  some   world

importance,  because  every tourist  who  comes  to

Singapore  visits  the House of Tang.  Whether  the

Minister for Home Affairs likes it or not, that  is

what  is happening. Every visitor who sets foot  on

this  island  goes to the House of Tang.  And  from

being merely a wealthy man, after his kidnap he has

become  the  king of the curio world. I understand,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, that the news of his kidnap  was

headline news in London and America. What  sort  of

confidence  do the people of the United Kingdom  or

America have in Singapore when somebody tells  them

that kidnappings are daily occurrences in Singapore

and  there  is  nothing  that  the  police  or  the

Government can do to prevent them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not blaming the police. I

do  not want to go that far. All I am interested in

is  in  assessing  the objective results  of  these

kidnappings in so far as the State of Singapore  is

concerned.  It  is  doing us  no  good  whatsoever,

either internally or externally, and the sooner  we

realise it, and not mock at the rich men or mock at

the kidnappings, I think the better it would be for

all  of us. I am glad, Sir, that the Government are

considering active measures which they  think  will

bring an end to kidnapping, if not an end, at least

minimise  it.  Some  of  the  measures  which  they

propose  to take and which they outline  here  seem

very serious. I am not quite sure whether the death

penalty  for  kidnapping  is  the  correct   thing.

However,  it is a matter which we will consider  at

the  proper  time when measures are  introduced  to

that effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Minister for Home Affairs taking every

possible step he can to minimise these kidnappings?

He has told us that he has had inaugurated an anti-kidnapping squad, or anti-kidnapping squads, within

his  Criminal Investigation Department. I  am  also

told that guard and escort units are available  for

wealthy people, even for not so wealthy men. People

temporarily in positions of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



power  could  avail themselves of  this  guard  and

escort unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the news of the C. K. Tang kidnapping broke,

the Police Secretary put out what I thought at that

time  a  very  peevish and childish statement.  The

first thing he did was to complain about how nobody

co-operated with the police, and that  is  why  all

these things were happening. He may be right. But I

would have thought that, in those circumstances, he

should  have dote something else before making  the

peevish  complaint. What I do hear  is  that  these

people,  who  would like to engage  protection  for

themselves, for reasons best known to them, are not

very  keen on engaging guard and escort units. They

are  not  very keen on engaging the anti-kidnapping

squads  which the Minister has had formed  for  the

protection  of the people in imminent danger  of  a

kidnap.  Sir, there may be many reasons  why  these

people do not wish to engage them. It could be that

these  people have not got the confidence in  these

units.  Whether  they  should  have  confidence  is

another  matter. But the factual position  is  that

they do not have the confidence in these units, and

they  would  like to engage somebody else  to  look

after  their  persons. And when such  requests  are

made  to  the police, I understand the  police  are

most uncooperative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that a person might be detailed to

protect the future victim, it is necessary that the

protector should be provided with a revolver.  When

a  request is made to the police that the person is

willing  to look after a millionaire or  a  wealthy

person and that he be provided with a revolver, the

police very often turn that request down. They say,

"Well,  if  you want protection, we  have  got  our

guard  and  escort  unit; we  have  got  our  anti-kidnapping squads. You can go to them.  If  you  do

not  go  to them, well, we do not care what happens

to  you."  I can understand the diffidence  of  the

police  in  wanting to give this revolver,  because

they  want to be satisfied that the persons to whom

they give these revolvers are trustworthy persons.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand there is an organisation in

Singapore which engages police officers who are  on

the  retired  list  of  the police  force  who  are

drawing  pensions. I explicitly mention  that,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, because, as they are officers of  the

Government  drawing pensions, I take  it  they  are

reliable  persons; and as police officers who  have

been  pensioned, their record has been  clean  with

the  police.  When  a person has requested  that  a

retired  and  pensioned police officer be  provided

with  a  pistol  to guard him the answer  from  the

Commissioner  of  Police has  been  no.  This,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I consider a most unhelpful  way  of

solving a very difficult problem. However,  Sir,  I

personally  welcome the proposals of  the  Minister

for  solving  this problem, not because  I  hold  a

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara described the first year  of

office of the People's Action Party Government as a

year    of   reorganisation, consolidation    and

preparation. The resounding victory of  the  P.A.P.

in  the  general elections last year reflected  the

confidence  of  the  people  of  Singapore  in  the

collective   leadership  of  the  Party   and   the

progressive policies it pursued. But the P.A.P. did

not  achieve power by making false promises to  the

people.  We  have  always  been  conscious  of  the

limitations  under which we would  have  to  govern

this   island  State  for  the  next  five   years.

Accepting  these limitations, Sir, particularly  in

the   fields  of  internal  security,  defence  and

foreign  relations, one must admit that  the  first

year of office of the P.A.P. Government has been  a

year of progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on the measures taken by

the  Government in the fields of communications and

rural development. I need not stress the vital role

of  shipping, civil aviation and communications  in

the  economy of Singapore. The Government is taking

active  steps  to  train  our  citizens  to  become

qualified marine engineers and naval architects. We

have  to redouble our efforts in this direction  to

make   up   for  the  inactivity  of  the  previous

Government in training local personnel for jobs  in

the merchant marine. It is expected, Sir, that very

soon  the  new administration block at  Paya  Lebar

Airport will be ready for occupation. We would then

be  better  equipped  to  offer  the  most  modern

facilities  at  the Airport to meet the  increasing

demands made on the Airport in the jet age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has paid special attention to

rural  development  during  the  last  year.  Flood

alleviation schemes are being pursued with  vigour.

Water and electricity supplies have been brought to

the  remote  rural areas, and many new  link  roads

have been built. Great strides will be made by  the

Government  in  improving  the  lot  of  the  rural

population  in  the year ahead, in accordance  with

the Party's Five-Year



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



Plan, it  should be remembered, however, that  the

success  of  the  Government  in  implementing  its

policy  will depend to a very large extent  on  the

political and economic conditions we may expect  in

the  year ahead. During the last year, we have  had

periods  of calm. We have had also periods of  less

calm.  If  any government in power were  to  pursue

extremist and short-sighted policies such as  those

advocated by the Member for Hong Lim, then  it  can

only  result  in utter disaster for the  people  of

Singapore.  It  is  much easier  to  shout  popular

slogans  than to govern the country wisely  with  a

view to improving the lot of 1½ million people  who

have  just  emerged from a long period of  colonial

rule.  The declared objective of the Government  to

create  a  more  just and equal society  cannot  be

achieved  merely by shouting slogans  and  parading

the 16 resolutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore, Sir, will judge the

P.A.P.  Government  on the basis  of  the  concrete

achievements of the Government in the years  ahead.

The  Prime  Minister gave a vivid analysis  of  the

many  dangerous  forces now at  work  in  Singapore

trying  to create political instability. It is  our

duty, Sir, to see that extremist elements are  kept

in  check and stopped before they can grow powerful

enough  to  pose  a threat to the security  of  the

State.  Every loyal citizen of Singapore should  be

made  aware of the disaster that awaits us if these

extremist  elements  ever  gain  control  of   this

island.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Leong Keng Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  last Friday and today we have  heard  the

speeches made by the Member for Mountbatten and the

Member  for  Tanglin. We have seen their  political

myopia. They only see one side of things. They only

see  the one side that is black but they cannot see

the opposite side that is white.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin only sees the problem

facing the religious schools, English schools,  and

civil  servants.  But  he never  sees  the  problem

facing the non-religious schools, the non-English



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



schools,  and the poor masses. The hon.  Member  is

against the six-day week, and wants a five-day week

for  teachers  and  school  children.  But  in  our

Chinese  schools, there has always been  a  six-day

week  and  things have always been  peaceful.  This

state  of  affairs has been so for many years.  But

the  Member  for  Mountbatten and  the  Member  for

Tanglin  only  see  the religious  issues  and  the

problems  facing  religious schools,  because  they

want  to  go  to  church on Saturdays  or  Sundays.

Therefore they only consider the interest of a  few

people.  They  never give thought to  the  children

attending  non-religious schools, the non-religious

parents  and  the  non-religious teachers.  If  the

children  of  non-religious parents do  not  go  to

school  on  Saturdays  they  will  roam  about  the

streets and mix with bad and evil men. We know that

all  teachers must be responsible for the education

of these children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the bursaries, scholarships and

allowances -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Parliamentary Secretary is

touching on variable allowances, he is, of  course,

out   of   order.  We  have  dealt  with   variable

allowances.  He  must not touch on that  topic  any

longer.  It was the subject matter of an  amendment

which has been disposed of.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I support the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech.

In  our  education  policy, there  are  three  main

principles:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) equal treatment to all the four streams of

education;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the acceptance of Malay as the national

language; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the increasing of facilities for the

teaching of science and mathematics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that the rulers in the colonial era

appreciated only one thing - to find ways  and  means

of procuring for themselves the maximum profit from

society.  They never gave a single thought  to  the

problem of how to educate the local people, to  see

that  they were given the fullest encouragement  in

education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



so that they could acquire a considerable amount of

knowledge and modem technical skills. We  all  know

also  that  the aim of the past colonial government

in  the  field  of education was to create  only  a

white-collar   class   and,   therefore,    English

education  was  greatly expanded. Malay  education,

which  was comparatively backward was not nurtured.

Chinese  education, which was in  a  more  advanced

stage  was suppressed. The purpose of such a policy

was  to  perpetuate the colonial  rule.  Therefore,

during  the colonial regime, the education  of  the

various communities was not on an equal status with

English  education. However, in the  self-governing

State  of  Singapore  today, the  education  policy

pursued by the Government is based on the principle

of  equality. In accordance with this principle  of

equality  of treatment to all schools and with  due

regard   to  our  economic  situation  and   social

demands,  the  Government is building more  schools

for  children  of school-going age in  this  State.

Each  year,  the Government intends to  build  five

secondary  schools and 14 primary schools  for  the

four  streams of education. Malay secondary schools

and  Tamil secondary schools have been established.

Special allowances have been paid to principals  of

schools of the various language media. Teachers who

have  had  more than 10 years' teaching  experience

are  normally  allowed to cross the efficiency  bar

regardless of the type of school they are  teaching

in. All these things go to show that the schools in

the   four   language  media  are  accorded   equal

treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's acceptance of Malay as the

national language is completely in accord with  the

present  state of our society. To create  a  common

outlook,  and mutual understanding among people  of

various races so as to enable them to become  loyal

citizens  of  this  country, we  have  courageously

accepted  Malay as our national language.  This  is

the  only way by which people of various races  can

understand   one  another.  Mutual  suspicion   and

distrust can thereby be eliminated. Therefore,  the

creation of a national language has become  a  very

effective means in bringing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



about racial unity. The Government's policy to make

Malay  the  national  language  has  received   the

enthusiastic support of the people. The  Government

will take positive measures to foster the growth of

our  national  language so that it will  acquire  a

practical status in the near future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third aspect of the new policy is the

increase   of   teaching  time  for   science   and

mathematics.  The  main purpose  of  our  education

policy  is  to train our children to become  useful

citizens  so  that  they  will  be  able  to  adapt

themselves  to our economic policy and  play  their

part  in national construction, so as to lay a firm

foundation  for  our future socialist  society.  In

other  words, our education is geared to  the  need

for   industrialization.   Hence,   our   education

programme must turn out more people with scientific

knowledge and productive skill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth aspect of our policy is the promotion

of  adult education and mass literacy. Today, there

are  500,000 illiterate people in our society, i.e.

about  one-third of our population.  This  poses  a

very  grave social problem. Illiteracy is a typical

by-product  of a colonial society and an  unhealthy

social phenomenon to our self-government State. The

campaign  to  wipe out illiteracy  will  raise  the

cultural standard of our people. Hence it is social

education.  The  Adult  Education  Board  has  been

formed  by  Government to carry out this  important

task. In this respect, the aim is not only to teach

the illiterate section of the people to be able  to

read   and  write,  but  also  to  teach  them   to

understand the democratic system of government  and

to  observe  and  know how to use their  democratic

rights   effectively.  The  task   of   eliminating

illiteracy  is a difficult one, and  takes  a  long

time  to accomplish. To succeed, there must be  co-operation  between the people and Government.  Only

then  can  we  get  rid  of this  unhealthy  social

phenomenon  which  we  have  inherited   from   the

colonial society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the special position of the Malays,

Government  has promised to provide free  education

in primary schools for the Singapore Polytechnic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



and  the  University of Malaya, to Malays  born  in

Singapore, or whose parents are Singapore citizens.

The Government has also promised to give to Nanyang

University the same amount of financial aid as that

enjoyed   by  the  University  of  Malaya  provided

Nanyang University carries out a reorganisation and

maintains its academic standard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's education policy is based on the

urgent needs of the present society - to bring up our

future citizens to be loyal citizens and willing to

serve  this  country.  The  aim  of  our  education

programme  is  to  give ample  opportunity  to  our

citizens to benefit by education so as to give them

the  chance  to  acquire  knowledge  and  technical

skill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our Prime Minister has said, "Our Government

comes  from  the  people and will go  back  to  the

people." Therefore, basically, our policies reflect

the  aspirations of the people. In short, they  are

determined  by whether they serve the  interest  of

the people or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion of thanks for the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech.



<br><br>6.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, at the sitting last Friday,  I  heard

the  hon. Member for Tanglin say that in the little

booklet  of  the P.A.P., it is stated therein  that

the  Government  is anti-religious.  This  is  very

strange and untrue. I myself am a Christian  and  a

Member  of this Assembly. At the time of  the  last

elections I prayed to God for victory. Today  I  am

an  elected  representative of the  people,  and  I

thank  God for it. But I must also thank the people

in  my constituency who supported me. At that time,

the  opposing candidate in my constituency was also

a  Christian. He was Mr Ling Ngo Lin  and  he  was

very  pious. He used to go to church every  Sunday.

But now he does not go to church. When I prayed  at

that  time,  I said, "Oh, God, I have not  been  to

church  for  a  very long time and  I  have  sinned

against  you,  but if I am elected, I  will  go  to

church regularly." I still go to church. Therefore,

this shows that our Party is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



not  against  religion.  In  our  Party  there  are

religious people, Christians and others. It is true

that we are not against religion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin said that in the P.A.P.

booklet,  it is stated that man-kind must  rely  on

themselves. He said this is wrong, because man must

depend  on God. We do not say that everything  must

depend  on  God.  We must depend on ourselves  too.

Those  who read the Bible know that in the Book  of

Genesis, it is stated that after Adam and  Eve  had

sinned  against God He drove Adam and Eve from  the

Garden of Eden. He said to them, "You must toil and

sweat  before  you can have your stomachs  filled."

So,  therefore,  we must use our own  strength  and

depend  on  ourselves to build a  new  country.  We

cannot  entirely depend on God. I remember  when  I

was a boy I was very lazy. I did not like to study,

but  I  used to pray. I said, "God, please  let  me

have  good  results  and be the  first  boy  in  my

examination." But in the end, I got zero  and  also

my  results  were bad. This shows  that  we  cannot

entirely  depend on God. This is a  common  mistake

made  by  the  Christians. This is a contradiction.

The Member for Tanglin said that we must depend  on

God.  I am not against God, but I say that we  must

also depend on our own strength.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In building a new nation, everybody must do more

work  in  order to compensate for the lack  in  the

past.  For  instance, in our education  policy,  we

have  introduced  the six-day week.  An  Opposition

Member  said that this was oppressing the  teachers

and  putting too much strain on them. Just now  our

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Education said that we must not look at one side of

a question and support one particular party, but we

must  look  to the considerations of all.  This  is

correct.  We Christians want to have half  a  day's

rest  on  Saturday and to go to church  on  Sunday.

This  is  good,  but what about those non-religious

people? The Government must take into consideration

all  aspects of the matter. We must not  only  take

into  consideration the interests of those who  are

Christians. We must also look



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



into the wants of non-religious people too. Only in

this   way  can  we  be  correct.  Therefore,   our

education  policy is correct. We must insist  on  a

six-day  week. The education policy up to  now  has

been  very poor. Therefore, our children  must  now

study more. The Opposition Member's accusation that

parents and students are all against our new policy

is wrong. Last year, at a teachers' conference held

in  the  Happy World, our Prime Minister  requested

all  teachers  to  give some more time  and  effort

towards  educating the children. All  the  teachers

who   attended  that  meeting  supported   him.   A

representative  of  the  teachers   expressed   the

support  of  the teachers. There is proof  for  it.

Parents  have also supported our education  policy.

If  there is no schooling on Saturday many children

will  roam  about in the streets making  themselves

bad. Therefore our education policy is correct.  We

say that to make Saturday a school day is correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin asked why we wanted to

oppose foreign investment. This is not correct. Our

purpose  is to encourage our local capitalists  and

rich  people to invest their capital for industrial

expansion so that they can contribute to the  well-being of the people and our country. Our policy  is

correct.  On  the  other hand, we  must  also  have

foreign capital in order to strengthen the building

of our country. This is also correct. I do not want

to  speak at length. My colleagues can elaborate on

this. This is only what I have to say.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

from  the speeches of the Opposition, I cannot help

feeling  that  they  have not been  fulfilling  the

function   of   the  Opposition  in  a   democratic

Parliament. As you know, Sir, I have been appointed

a  delegate  of the Singapore Branch to attend  the

Seventh  Regional Conference of C.P.A. Branches  to

be  held in the course of the week at Kuching.  The

subject  for discussion happens also to be  on  the

functions   of  a  Government  majority   and   the

Opposition in a democratic Parliament. I dread



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



to  think  how  our Opposition would  stand  up  in

comparison with the Oppositions imbued with a sense

of  responsibility  in the other Assemblies  around

us.  Here was our Prime Minister giving an incisive

analysis of the political situation. And what  sort

of reaction did we get from the Members opposite?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up stood the Member for Mountbatten, and in the

name  of her Party, challenged the statement, which

has   been  repeated  a  few  times  already,  that

"Singapore   has  enjoyed  greater  political   and

economic  stability than it has  known  during  the

last 15 years" in the introduction of the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech. According to her, there is

no  stability. Then came a senior executive of  the

same Party, the Member for Tanglin. In answer to  a

jibe  of  the  Opposition being  irresponsible,  he

asked,  how  would  he  know of  the  interplay  of

political  and social forces at this juncture  when

everything was so rosy? Sir, may we ask,  whom  are

we  to  believe? The Opposition have only very  few

representatives in the House, and different Members

speak  differently  on the same subject.  All  the

views are contradictory. Perhaps the S.P.A. too has

to think of rectification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, instead of rising to the occasion and seeing

things  in  their proper perspective,  and  perhaps

thus  learning  how to serve the people  better  by

giving  thought to more momentous affairs of State,

they  merely  stick their noses  into  the  mundane

business  of pay cuts. They dodge the criticism  by

saying  that we are seeking their support  in  what

the  Member  for Tanglin calls the  crisis  in  the

P.A.P.  Surely,  there is no  necessity  to  get  a

mathematician to count the number over here, though

a  bit  depleted now, and the number over there.  A

Primary  II  schoolboy will be  able  to  tell  the

difference between 40 and 11, and 40 is many  times

11.  Of course, if a school teacher cannot make out

the  difference between 40 and 11, and  insists  on

calling  that  instability in the Government,  then

perhaps  there  is  justification  after  all   for

reporting such ignorance to the Ministry. To  quote

Shakespeare, who lived in a feudal age,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>

allowed  words  like `kindergarten' and  `childish'

already,  but the hon. Member has placed  a  little

more  venom  in  the  word `puerile',  and  I  must

therefore say that `puerile' is unparliamentary and

must be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I thought it was only

childish, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There seems to be a habit

arising  in  this  Assembly  of  contradicting  the

Speaker. I asked the Member to withdraw, and  there

must be an unqualified withdrawal.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I withdraw, Sir, and would

substitute instead -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Not worthy of a school master.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Not worthy of a school master.

Then there is the voice from the wilderness. All of

us  thought  that  some  gem  of  wisdom  might  be

forthcoming  at  last, but instead  we  only  found

platitudes, a recitation of a page from  a  Primary

II  school book, and a dissertation on how  to  lay

eggs,  and  finally - a request for water. I  suppose

that was because of the blowing of hot air that  he

was  complaining about. All he could  say  of  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech was  that  it  was

"tame",  and that it was inaccurate. What  sort  of

constructive criticism did he offer? Nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten ranged over all the

Government's activities, and, as usual, blamed  the

Government for all the faults under the  sun.  Most

of  these  charges  are time-worn,  and  have  been

convincingly  answered before.  Fancy  calling  our

Ministers  a pack of playboys! She must be  jesting

and she really cannot be serious. Look, Sir, at our

Minister  for Labour and Law. Does he look  like  a

playboy?  Or our Deputy Prime Minister?  These  are

Ministers who work 14 hours a day.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> They never play!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They devote all their time and

attention  to the affairs of State. I do not  think

the  wives  of our Ministers would take  kindly  to

such  an  attack from the only lady Member  of  the

Opposition.  But the perennial charge  is  that  of

P.A.P. inconsistency. Now consistency is a quality

entirely foreign to the S.P.A. set-up. No amount of

high-pressure  cooking,  as  she  called  it,  with

Carnegie courses, will make people believe that the

S.P.A. can  ever believe in such  a  thing  called

consistency. On the other hand, consistency is part

and  parcel  of  the P.A.P. Let  me  now  give  two

examples that have been mentioned in the speech  of

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara. These are things  the

Opposition  will never know very much  about.  They

not  only  prove P.A.P. consistency, but also  that

the  P.A.P.,  in  all its actions, has  always  the

interest and welfare of the people as its first and

only  consideration. It has all along been our plan

and   policy   to  encourage  intelligent   planned

parenthood.  Singapore  is  a  small  island   with

limited resources, and has a very high birth  rate.

This bears repeating, and, incidentally, this is an

example  of revolutionary zeal being tempered  with

adaptation  to  local surroundings. For  there  are

other    socialist   countries   which    encourage

population    increase   because    of    different

surroundings.  However,  in  dealing  with  such  a

situation  in Singapore, we have been practical  in

our approach. We cannot afford to wear blinkers  as

the  past Government did. Still less can we  afford

to bury our heads in the sand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the poor masses who are the greatest

sufferers  in health and education as a  result  of

unplanned  and  unrestricted parenthood,  which  is

also  a  major  contributory  factor  towards   the

causation  of  slums. Bearing  all  this  in  mind,

therefore,  Government has promised to  initiate  a

campaign  for  intelligent planned  parenthood.  We

hope  to bring knowledge and enlightenment  to  the

ignorant,  and  sunshine  and  happiness   to   the

superstitious, fatalistic and neglected. We want to

help wipe out the misery of the masses and, at  the

same time, show them a way how they can help



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



others  as  well  as themselves.  To  many  of  our

younger  children and to those as  yet  unborn,  it

would mean a better opportunity to go forward to  a

more equal and just society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other example, Sir, I wish to bring forward

is  our policy of equal treatment given to the four

streams  of  education. Parallel  to  this  is  the

recruitment  of  non-English  educated  nurses  and

midwives  into the medical services. Gone  are  the

days  when  certain  sections  of  the  people   of

Singapore   were   discriminated  against,   simply

because  of  language difficulties. New ground  was

opened  up  for the people to serve in  the  health

services   with   the  formation  of   the   P.A.P.

Government.  It has all along been and will  always

be  the  struggle of the P.A.P. to have more  equal

opportunities  made available to the  people.  Only

then  can there be any meaning in democracy. Others

may  crow and preach about democratic practice  and

anti-colonialism and so on. But it has been left to

the P.A.P. to make democracy real and meaningful to

the   people  and  to  lead  them  step  by   step,

democratically and constitutionally, towards a more

equal and just society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to our ex-comrades, I feel a little sad,

Sir,  and  puzzled too, as to how and why  our  ex-comrades  have  railed  so vehemently  against  our

Party.  The  Member for Hong Lim has  given  us  to

understand  that bad blood exists only between  him

and  two  of our Ministers. All the rest are  still

his  friends, he claims. Yet he attacked the Party,

and  not  on  a factual basis. This has been  amply

demonstrated  and testified to in all the  speeches

so  far. It appears to me that he attacked with,  I

would  not say malice, Sir, but certainly  with  an

unholy  desire to see that everything in the P.A.P.

goes  wrong. In so attacking the Party to which  he

once  belonged,  he  is not only  attacking  a  few

Ministers, but he is attacking each and  every  one

of  us  inside the Party. How can he still call  us

friends then? His actions belie his words. That  is

why I said "puzzled" because it does not add up. In

this debate, the Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



for Hong Lim has clearly shown that since he cannot

get  control of the P.A.P., the next best thing for

him  to  do would be to destroy it. We see a person

like a megalomaniac who thinks -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the word was

"megalomaniac".  If  that  is  the  word  then,  of

course,  it is completely unparliamentary. It  must

be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We see a person -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think the Member has

withdrawn that word yet.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I withdraw, Sir. Anyway, Sir,

illusions  and delusions are the strange bedfellows

of such a person, and when the soap bubble which he

thinks is carrying him up and up finally bursts and

he  starts tumbling down, there will be a  terrific

crash and a terrific anti-climax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been harangued with lectures on

Colonialism  both  by lecturers  here  as  well  as

lecturers  outside.  It has been  very  extensively

commented  on  in  the House,  and  it  is  not  my

intention  to  bore  Members here  with  a  further

discussion  on  the  subject.  Colonialism  in  its

various forms, political as well as economic,  past

and   present,  has  been  studied,  discussed  and

analysed  to the minutest detail in various  books.

Similarly  with socialism. But I say to the  Member

for Hong Lim that if he thinks he is the only anti-colonialist  in the House, then he is  gravely  and

woefully mistaken. We cannot speak for the  Members

of  the House opposite, but all of us on this  side

of  the  House, the Front benchers as well as  Back

benchers, are as anti-colonial as anti-colonial can

be.  We  do  not  have to shout from  rooftops  and

advertise ourselves as anti-colonialists.  It  does

not  necessarily  follow that he who  shouts  anti-colonial  slogans is an anti-colonialist; nor  that

he  is more anti-colonial than another who does not

shout and who does not use the Badminton Hall to do

so;  nor  that he is therefore necessarily  also  a

revolutionary. A true revolutionary, Sir, faces the

problem  squarely.  He collects  all  the  relevant

facts  and  data, sifts them through  with  a  fine

comb, studies the problem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



from all angles, puts up all the pros and cons, and

after  exhaustive discussion and analysis with  his

colleagues,  he puts up certain possible  lines  of

action. And further elimination of these one by one

leads  finally to a solution most likely to produce

success. This has been done in the P.A.P., and  the

fruit  of the Party's labour is to be found in  the

4th  anniversary  souvenir of the  Petir.  Has  the

Member for Hong Lim similarly worked out a workable

line to better the life of the masses in Singapore?

If he has, then we know nothing about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you can see that to be a revolutionary does

not  mean  that  one  has to be  doctrinaire.  Even

Marxian textbooks tell us never to be bound by  the

strait-jacket of doctrinarism. A true revolutionary

therefore  applies  basic  principles  with   local

adaptations  and in the circumstances obtaining  in

Singapore  today - that has been  often  repeated - the

P.A.P. line  of democratic socialism is  the  only

sensible  and practical line. All other  approaches

end up in blind alleys. Of course, society is never

static and conditions, change. But until conditions

change  and new social forces enter the  arena,  we

have  to do the best we can. That is why the P.A.P.

have  captured  the hearts and  the  minds  of  the

intelligentsia as well as the masses of  Singapore.

We  are both progressive and realistic at the  same

time.  Sir, deep inside each and every  one  of  us

there  is  a burning desire to right the wrongs  of

the  present society, and also a burning desire  to

help  level off the unequal opportunities  and  the

unequal  distribution  of wealth  inherent  in  our

present  system. Socialism, in the words of Bernard

Shaw,  is merely a proposal to divide up the income

of  the country in a new way. And this is where  we

differ from the Communists. The P.A.P. proposal  of

effecting   the   change   is   through   peaceful,

constitutional, democratic socialism. It is a  slow

and  painful  process, perhaps  too  slow  to  some

shortsighted   self-styled   revolutionaries.   But

still,  we  prefer it to the bloody alternative  of

wanton  destruction  with the  toll  of  lives  and

misery  that follow. What we cannot do today,  Sir,

we shall have to leave to our children to do better

tomorrow.

<br><br>6.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

today's speech is my maiden speech in this Assembly

after 14 months during which I had never been given

a  chance  to speak. The right of speech of  P.A.P.

Assemblymen  is  decided  by  the  Prime   Minister

through the Whip.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, this Assembly sitting has been

converted  from  a  debate on the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's  speech to a forum on the Member for  Hong

Lim.  What  are  these  rantings  compared  to  the

horrors  of  the secret trial which the Member  for

Hong  Lim  had experienced on 20th June, 1960,  and

which  I witnessed? "Carry on with these rantings,"

said  the backseat Dr Goebbels. "Mass-produce more

of them!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Gobble!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Events during the past six weeks have

proved  that personal and unprincipled attacks  and

distortions  will do these people  more  harm  than

good.   Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's   speech   did   not   say   a   word   on

Malayanisation. I wish to remind the Prime Minister

what he said in 1956 in this Assembly. I would like

to  quote  cols. 1806-9 of Hansard, Vol. 1  of  4th

April, 1956, which read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Merdeka comes first. So much the better, but even

without  Merdeka, let us take charge of the control

room, as this (Malayanisation) Report puts it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are parts of this Report which I think

the  House would forgive me if I make reference to.

The introduction reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Self-government would be an empty phrase unless

the  government  is  entirely  or  almost  entirely

carried  out  by the people of the country  and  to

have  the Public Service staffed by expatriates  at

the  highest  levels where policy  formulation  and

execution  take  place would be derogatory  to  the

dignity  of the people of a self-governing country.

Therefore,  self-government and Malayanisation  are

closely  related,  and  in order  to  satisfy  this

legitimate   aspiration   complete   Malayanisation

should  as  far  as  possible not  lag  behind  the

attainment of self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to place the subject in its proper

setting we should see it in historical perspective.

History  shows  that  a group of  people  can  only

function  as an entity if there is cohesion  within

the group, and this cohesion does not depend merely

on  the  homogeneity of the population but  on  the

sameness of purpose created by the stimulus of  the

common



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



geographical  and human environment, and  can  only

exist  if  the people are thrown together to  brave

the  same  dangers and share the same  fate.  There

must be no alternative. -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a section of the population..."',



<br><br>and the Secretary-General of the P.A.P. pointed out

that that means the Hon. the Chief Secretary,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"has the option of returning to their country of

origin  when  faced  by some unpleasant  challenge,

that  section constitutes a weakness to  the  state

and  can  never contribute to the cultural progress

of  the  country. In other words,  success  in  the

building  of  a  nation can only be achieved  by  a

group  of  people if they have no ties  of  loyalty

with  the  country which they have  left-they  must

burn their boats and give undivided loyalty to  the

country of their adoption."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It then goes on at great length to prove that if

you are in receipt of an expatriate allowance, you

cannot give undivided loyalty to this country.' -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member must

differentiate between what he is quoting  and  what

he  is adding to the quote. I do not know where  he

has  reached  at the moment, but he  must  remember

that all he can do is to quote extracts and not the

whole speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just now I have

quoted  extracts. I was just reading extracts  from

columns 1806 to 1809.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member hopes to

stop him because they are definitely not extracts.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is out of order if the

of the imagination, be termed extracts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, I am not going to read very much

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am sorry to interrupt the hon.

produced  so that hon. Members, if they so  desire,

could  follow  whether or not  those  extracts  are

complete extracts or taken out of context.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, times have changed.

The  Assemblyman who said those words  is  now  the

Prime  Minister, and constancy is  the  virture  of

fools.  This  is  what the Lee Kuan Yew  Government

says  now.  May I quote from the Straits  Times  of

16th July. 1960:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He [meaning the Member for Hong Lim] had no plan

because his Malayanisation was so complete that  he

had  no  architects and planners, local or foreign,

to draw up plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malayanisation does not mean just throwing out

people.  It  means  getting rid of  expatriates  by

putting  qualified local men in  their  place.  And

that    is   how   the   other   Ministries    have

functioned - and  that  is  why  they   continue   to

function efficiently.'



<br><br>Can  the  Lee Kuan Yew Government explain  how  the

4,000  units of S.I.T. flats mentioned in the  Yang

di-Pertuan Negara's speech have been drawn  up?  By

men  from  Mars?  Are they not the  work  of  local

architects newly engaged by the Member for Hong Lim

when  he  was in charge of the S.I.T.? These  local

technicians  were recruited to take  the  place  of

expatriate  technicians who  were  Malayanised  and

they are now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



doing  all  the  construction work in  the  Housing

Board, which is mentioned in the policy speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is meant by the second paragraph? Does it

mean  that  those Government departments which  are

under  the  control of so-called colonial "dynamos"

are  functioning more efficiently  than  when  they

were  under the Member for Hong Lim? The Government

kicked  out the Member for Hong Lim and substituted

the  colonial "king-pin". Meadows. It kicked out  a

local  accountant  Mr Owen  and  brought  back  an

expatriate. Mr Scales, to take charge of the  City

Council  Treasurer's Department. Before Mr  Scales

came   back,   an  expatriate  officer   from   the

Government named Hibberd who cannot multiply 450 by

60  was  sent to sit with Mr Owen and to supervise

the  latter's  work as an accountant. Mr  Speaker,

Sir, have a look at the paying counters in the City

Council Treasurer's Department now and you will see

the long, long queues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, listen again to the speech of

the  Minister  for Labour and Law in  the  Assembly

debate on 4th August, 1960. After all, the Minister

had  been  promoted to Permanent Secretary  due  to

Malayanisation by the Lim Yew Hock Government. This

is what the Minister for Labour and Law said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Thomson was the former Director of

Information Services -'.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> No, it is not in Hansard.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hope I have made myself

understood. If that is a quotation of a speech made

in  the  Assembly, then the hon. Member must direct

me to the appropriate column in the Hansard.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, this is an extract taken from

the Straits Times of 5th August, 1960.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I understand that it has not come out in Hansard yet, if the hon. Member can

produce  a copy of the Straits Times, then  he  can

read the extract from it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, I do not have a copy of the

Straits  Times here. Can you give me time to  bring

it from the C.P.A. Room?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have very often said in

this Chamber that if an hon. Member wishes to quote

from   a  newspaper,  he  ought  to  produce   that

newspaper.   Even  cuttings  from  newspapers   are

strictly out of order. If a newspaper is available,

it ought to be produced. But as the hon. Member has

not  got a copy of the Straits Times with him, will

he  then  undertake to produce that paper later  on

and  lay  it  on  the Table? I  allow  him  now  to

continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Thank you, Sir. This is what the

Minister for Labour said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Thomson was the former Director of

Information  Services, but he was also  a  lecturer

and  good lecturer, at the University of Leeds. The

policy of the Political Study Centre was controlled

by  members of the Government and Mr Thomson could

only lecture within the scope of that authority.'



<br><br>So  when  Thomson  worked  for  the  Lim  Yew  Hock

Government,  Sir,  he  was called  by  the  present

Ministers  a  colonial propagandist who  should  be

sacked.  But as he is now working for the Lee  Kuan

Yew  Government,  he  has been transformed  into  a

"good lecturer from the University of Leeds." He is

now  ably "controlled" by members of the Government

to indoctrinate civil servants, P.A.P. Assemblymen,

the  Police  and headmasters on the aims  and  prin

ciples  of  the  P.A.P.  Mr  Thomson  is   now   a

"socialist" and a staunch "anti-colonialist". He is

indeed  a  good  lecturer from  the  University  of

Leeds, who is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



capable  of  changing  from a  staunch  colonialist

propagandist to a P.A.P. propagandist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about Mr Meadows, who was once recommended

to  be the Director of Special Branch, and who  now

controls  half  the  State of  Singapore?  The  ex-Minister for National Development sent him  to  the

Southern  Islands because he was  deemed  what  the

Prime  Minister aptly described in 1956, in Hansard

Vol. I, column 58, as:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...I would not call it sabotage, but I would just

say, general dislocation...'.



<br><br>On  12th August, 1959, the ex-Minister for National

Development was hauled up by the Prime Minister and

was  rebuked  for  this  "ungracious"  act.  It  is

believed that Mr Meadows, the Minister for  Labour

and  Law and the Minister for Finance were very old

friends   when   they   were  in   the   Government

departments together. I believe, Sir, that they are

still good friends now - firmer friends with a common

bond.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, take the case of Mr Owen, a local

accountant  whom the Minister for  Labour  and  Law

tried to smear. Mr Speaker, Sir, permit me to take

some  time to make some clarification on behalf  of

Mr  Owen  who is now overseas, to clear  away  the

personal smears on him. Why should a Minister  and,

in  fact,  a  big-sized Minister,  talk  about  Mr

Owen's  marriage  to an Australian  girl?  What  is

wrong with inter-racial marriage? Mr Owen was born

in Singapore and is a qualified accountant from the

University   of   Adelaide.   He   had   years   of

professional experience in Australia and he entered

City  Council  service during  the  time  when  the

Member for Farrer Park was in the City Council  and

he  was not, as was said, engaged by the Mayor. The

Member  for Hong Lim knew him only months after  he

became  the  Mayor.  Mr Owen resigned  because  of

persecutions   against  him.   For   instance,   an

expatriate (Mr Hibberd) was transferred  from  the

Government  to sit in the same room with  him,  and

Mr  Owen had to take orders from this Mr  Hibberd

who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



knows  geography but not accountancy.  I  can  show

you,  Sir, correspondence to prove that Mr Hibberd

does  not  even  know how to multiply  450  by  60.

Needless  to say, Mr Hibberd would not  understand

the  difference between a credit entry and a  debit

entry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I crave your indulgence to

allow  me  to read this letter dated 31st  January,

1960,  from  Mr Owen addressed to the  ex-Minister

for National Development.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon.. Member has

gone as far as he ought to in these details. We are

not  debating  Mr  Owen or Mr  Hibberd  on  their

capacity   for   figures.  We  are   now   debating

Government policy. I think the hon. Member has made

his point: that is, perhaps in his view, the attack

on Mr Owen was unfair. I do not think he should go

into further details.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Owen has been

considerably smeared in this House, and I hope  you

will  permit  me  to  read some extracts  from  the

letter.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have already indicated that there

are  other  methods of bringing  these  matters  to

light,  and  one  method is to request  a  personal

explanation  under  Standing  Order  22.  I   might

explain  that  a Member is entitled to  a  personal

explanation to explain away any smear on any member

of  the public who is not in this Chamber. So  that

there  is  an opportunity under Standing Order  22,

subject, of course, to the proposed statement being

submitted  in  full  to  the  Speaker  (or  in  his

absence, the Deputy Speaker) before it is  made.  I

do  not  think that this Assembly should be worried

with details of that nature in this debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, I would like to read a letter

from   Mr  Owen.  He  wishes  to  come  back   to

Singapore, but the letter said, "I cannot do so  in

the  present circumstances." Can I quote  one  more

extract from his letter, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already indicated to

the  Member for Aljunied the steps he can take, and

I think he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>



would be advised to take those steps if he feels so

strongly about the matter. Let us now proceed  with

the debate on the Address.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, Mr Owen had to leave the

country   for   reasons  best   known   to   us - the

persecutions of the Lee Kuan Yew Government. I must

put  it on record in this Assembly to clear up  the

smear made by the Minister for Labour and Law,  and

later   by  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the

Minister for Finance, on the professional integrity

and  on  the  personal life of this  man.  This  is

absolutely necessary for him for he hopes  to  come

back  to  the  society where he really belongs  and

where his heart lies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the policy speech implied that

we  are  now no more under colonial rule.  However,

two  weeks later, in his speech, the Prime Minister

slightly  touched in a lukewarm manner on the  word

"colonialists".



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Not "worm"!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> This was after one year of eerie

silence  and  unnecessary suspicions about  anybody

who  attacked  colonialism.  Sir,  Members  on  the

Government benches may laugh at my English. Well, I

am  not  so  well  educated as the Prime  Minister,

because my father was only in a position to provide

me  with  a Std. V1II education. Sir, may I  remind

the  Prime  Minister about what is written  in  the

Petir   editorial  (English  edition)  of   August/

September, 1956 issue, entitled "The Tasks Ahead":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Unity of all Races and Classes in Malaya



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution of our economic and social ills has

always  been  clear. We must be rid of colonialism.

To  be  rid  of  colonialism all races  must  unite

against  it.  To  unite  effectively  all  classes,

workers  by  hand  and  or  brain,  merchants   and

national industrialists must unite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To unite all races and classes in the Federation

and Singapore we must work out a national programme

to benefit all communities and all classes.



<div align="center"><h4>*** *** ***</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaya is a country rich in natural resources.

Our people are resourceful and hardworking. But the

wealth  that they produce is largely channelled  to

the   benefit  of  the  British  and  a  few  local

compradores and merchants.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>



The  people  are  therefore discontented  with  the

Colonial regime.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now talk on

Malayanisation  and colonialism.  The  basic  fight

today is still between the colonial forces and  the

anti-colonial  forces,  as  stated  in  "The  Tasks

Ahead".  Can  we deny that in Singapore  today  the

forces  of colonialism are stronger than ever?  But

let us hear what the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister  for Health said on 4th August,  1960,  in

this Assembly, as reported in the Straits Times  of

5th August:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I cannot help feeling disappointment to hear him

[meaning   the  Member  for  Hong  Lim]   rant   on

Colonialism  and  Malayanisation  on  notes   which

sounded both false and hollow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disappointed, because he saw fit to shout at us,

in  this  House,  slogans out of  context  both  in

relation to time and space.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I state categorically that the P.A.P. is anti-colonialist, but we are realistic enough to know

that  in  order to survive the interplay of  forces

between the extreme left and extreme right we  must

compromise.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they now have to compromise. To compromise

with whom? Is it with colonialism? So that they can

keep  their  cushy jabs? Why not say it before  the

elections?  The  Prime  Minister  used  the   words

"flexible tactics". The Parliamentary Secretary  to

the  Minister  for  Health used  "compromise".  The

latter  is frank and should be given a bouquet  for

it.  "Compromise" - that is the word. These  are  the

people  who have compromised, and who have betrayed

the aims and the policies of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these are the people who are

now  afraid of Mass Rallies and of freedom  of  the

Press.  They  have rejected on three occasions  the

use of Hong Lim Green to the Member for Hong Lim. I

also sent in an application on 2nd August, 1960, to

the  Land  Office of the Prime Minister's  Ministry

for  the  use of Shenton Way open field on  Sunday,

14th  August, 1960, between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.  This

is  a  historic place where the P.A.P. used to hold

its meetings. Is the Prime Minister going to reject

it? Or is the Prime Minister going to wait till the

last  day  and then approve it so that we  have  no

time to organise?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I believe there is to be no Assembly

sitting until 21st September, l960 - no more sittings

like  before, once every three weeks.  Some  "good"

reasons  can always be given. Why should  there  be

Assembly   sittings  when, as  the   Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Health has described,

the  Member  for Hong Lim can rant on  colonialism?

Why  should there be mass rallies? Why should there

be  freedom of the Press when, as the Minister  for

Culture says, the Member for Hong Lim can "stir  up

tension  and agitation"? This is exactly  what  the

Lim  Yew Hock Government said of the P.A.P. before

the general elections, "Why should one worry unless

one  is  politically bankrupt?" The Prime  Minister

now  says that all this talk of democratic  rights,

laissez-faire   liberalism,  freedom,   and   human

rights, in the face of the stark realities  of  an

underground struggle for power can only confuse the

English-educated world. How nice if we have a  one-man  rule  like the K.M.T. A one-man  rule  in  the

P.A.P. is  not  satisfying enough;  There  is  now

seldom any talk of collective "leadership". We have

exploded its myth, and convinced the people that it

is  a  one-man  leadership. It  is  now  collective

responsibility. One-man leadership, but  collective

"responsibility".  Slowly but surely  this  one-man

rule  of the Party is extending to one-man rule  of

the State. What is their present view of democracy?

It is, "All this talk can only confuse the English-educated world."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interesting thing about the speeches heard

during  the past few days is that it is an  all-out

unprincipled attack on the Member for Hong Lim.  No

interest was shown in the policy speech of the Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara. No interest  in  attacking  the

Member  for  Cairnhill. After all, the  differences

between them were like the differences between  the

former  Labour  Front  and the  Liberal-Socialists,

which  attacked  each other before  they  formed  a

national coalition. Are the Prime Minister and  his

Minister for Finance going to accept the advice  of

Huang   Tze-chin   and  form  a  second   "National

Coalition"?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speeches by the Minister for Labour and Law

delivered  in  this Assembly on 4th  August,  1960,

have not done the Lee Kuan Yew Government any good.

If  it is something which is actively helping us to

raise  our prestige, it is definitely the  speeches

of   the  Minister  for  Labour  and  Law.  He   is

reasonable if he does not lose his temper.  But  it

is a pity that he is so easily instigated.. When he

gets  angry, he is capable of saying all  sorts  of

things, including how the Member for Hong Lim tried

to  bribe  him with a cigarette case  worth  $5  on

Christmas Day.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It was worth $50!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Most of these people,. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  are  being forced to speak or not  to  speak.

Those  who  had  not  spoken at the  Special  Party

Conference,  and  particularly  those   whom   they

considered waverers, will be required to attack  on

one   occasion  or  another  in  order  to   commit

themselves.  This  is the usual  technique  of  the

Prime Minister. After the Special Party Conference,

the   Member  for  Punggol  and  other  Assemblymen

present  at an Assemblymen's meeting on 21st  June,

1960, at  3  p.m. in  the  former  City  Council

Chamber,, were given blank sheets of paper  by  the

Prime  Minister  and  asked to write  up  "charges"

against   the   Member  for  Hong   Lim.   If   any

Assemblyman had any difficulties in writing out the

charges,   there   were  two   Nanyang   University

graduates   present  to  assist.  Let  the   people

understand this clearly: the Prime Minister is very

fond  of  forcing people to read or  sign  prepared

statements,  "charges", prepared speeches,  and  so

on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister is also fond of the tactic of personal smear. We fight on political principles.

We  do  not believe in calling names and using  unpleasant  adjectives. Mr Speaker, Sir,  while  you

were  absent from the Assembly during last Friday's

debate, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for  Finance  had used words, which I am  sure  you

would  have stopped him from using if you had  been

present.  The  Assembly  became  the  City  Council

Chamber where -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. Kandasamy</b> rose -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kandasamy:</b> I think the Member for Aljunied is

challenging my ruling.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I have the Member's point of

order, calmly and collectedly?



<br><br><!-- Mr Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kandasamy:</b> On a point of order, Sir. I pulled

up  the Member for Aljunied when he raised a  point

of   order,  but  it  was  in  fact  a   point   of

clarification.  And he has made  mention  just  now

that  while  you were absent there was a difference

in  ruling. I take it was a misinterpretation of my

own ruling.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Deputy Speaker is probably

referring  to  Standing Order 53,  which  is  quite

clear. The Deputy Speaker is quite correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Speaker in the Assembly -'



<br><br>"The  Speaker in the Assembly" includes the Deputy

Speaker -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`or the chairman in Committee shall be

responsible  for  the observance of  the  rules  of

order  in  the  Assembly and Committee respectively

and his decision on any point of order shall not be

open  to  appeal and shall not be reviewed  by  the

Assembly except upon a substantive motion moved for

that purpose.'



<br><br>So that if the hon. Member is dissatisfied with the

ruling of the Deputy Speaker, his remedy is to send

in a notice of motion to question the ruling of the

Deputy Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> The Assembly became the City Council

Chamber  where, instead of Tang Peng Yeu,  we  have

the  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for

Finance.  During  the past weeks,  and  during  the

debates  here, there were personal attacks on  Owen

and others which were untrue and prefabricated. For

instance, Owen.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think that I can allow the

word  "prefabricated". It is being  indicated  that

there  have  been some lies said in this  Assembly.

"Prefabricated", I think, must be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> I withdraw the word "prefabricated"

and  substitute the words "made up". For  instance,

Owen. The Minister for Labour and Law said that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



the  Mayor  gave Owen a job, and implied that  they

were  friends in Australia. Sir, they did not  know

each  other  until the Member for Hong  Lim  became

Mayor.  If  the Minister has studied geography,  he

should know that Australia is a continent, and that

the  distance between Adelaide, where Owen studied,

and  Melbourne,  where  the  Member  for  Hong  Lim

studied, is like that between Penang and Singapore.

The  second untruth is that `the Mayor gave Owen  a

job'.  Owen was employed by the City Council during

the time of the Member for Farrer Park.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The honourable Mr Owen is a

stooge of colonialism.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Another of his many false allegations

is  about  Batu  Pahatisation.  He  refers  to  the

engagement  of Mr Lui Boon Poh by the  ex-Minister

for  National  Development  as  Superintendent   of

Cleansing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I did not.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> When I was working in the Special

him, and he must assure me that he is not, in fact,

Federation.  He spent more time in Batu  Pahat  and

other  Federation  towns. But what  is  wrong  with

qualifications  as  the previous Superintendent  of

explanation  to  explain away any smear  there  may

have  been on a person who is not in this  Assembly

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have just awakened to the

fact   that   the   Member  for   Havelock   is   a

be  addressed as the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister for Finance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> On the question of qualification, let

me remind the Prime Minister of what he said on 5th

December,  1956, in Hansard, Vol.  2,  cols.  1083-1084:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the administrative service we congratulate

the  Government  for  having created  an  executive

service  so  that  no man shall  be  debarred  from

holding  the highest of administrative  posts  just

because  he did not go to a university to  take  an

Honours degree and so join the elite. We live in an

egalitarian  age. A man is judged for  what  he  is

worth and what he can contribute to society, not by

the  hallmarks that he has acquired in his lifetime

in some venerable institution of learning.'



<br><br>Sir, we need an engineer to run electricity, but we

do  not need a University qua1ification to organise

workers  on  how to sweep the roads and  clean  the

night-soil buckets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member has extensively

quoted me. Whilst I stand by every word that I have

said  about  dispensing with  the  hallmarks  of  a

formal  education, it does not mean  that  one  can

sell patent medicine one day and become director of

a  cleansing department the next day. I  mean  that

the two things are not ejusdem generis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> The Minister for Labour and Law

refers  in  his speech to the fact that the  people

had gone to the Badminton Hall to hear our stand on

the  question  of detainees and the de-registration

of  trade  unions. He said that these  people  went

away disappointed. This is far from the truth.  Why

then  should  the Prime Minister get worried  about

the  crowd which he tried to imply was the work  of

the Left-wing adventurers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore know our stand on these

two  issues.  But the Minister does  not  know  our

stand. Just to remind him on the unions, the Member

for  Hong  Lim  asked the Government to  waive  the

Official Secrets Act. He received no answer. If the

Minister forgets also what the Member for Hong  Lim

has  said in this Assembly on these two issues, let

me repeat them here again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Fight for the detainees in the Internal Security

Council and get them released without conditions. I

(meaning  the  Member for Hong Lim)  have  made  my

stand  clear at its first meeting. Since  the  last

meeting I was not allowed to speak. Re-register the

trade unions without conditions.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`These were two reasons given at different times

for  the de-registration, and these two reasons are

contradictory.  On  the  25th  May,  1960,  it  was

reported in the Press that the reason given by  the

Minister for Labour and Law for the de-registration

of  the Unions was "there should be no registration

of  trade  unions within any of the  categories  of

unions   set   out  under  the  new  Trade   Unions

Ordinance,  1960,  until the Ordinance  had  become

law."  Later  they found that this reason  was  not

good,  because  the Trade Unions Ordinance  had  to

become law sooner or later, and when it became law,

according to this reason,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



you  had to re-register the unions. A second reason

was  thus  given  days later - the Internal  Security

Council.  Any  trade union worker who  studies  the

reasons would know how contradictory they are. From

what  I know these reasons given were not the  true

reasons.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the detainees, this is what

the  Member  for  Hong Lim said  in  the  Assembly,

"Fight  for the detainees in the Internal  Security

Council  and get them released without conditions."

The Member for Hong Lim made his stand clear at his

first  meeting  of  the Internal Security  Council.

"Since the first meeting, I (meaning the Member for

Hong Lim) was not allowed to speak."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these are the people who hate

people reproducing their speeches from Hansard.  As

the Minister for Labour and Law has said, "It is no

use  to  hark  back  to 1954, 1955  and  1956.  The

purpose of the policy speech is to review what  the

Party has done last year." Yes, Mr Speaker, it  is

so  convenient to forget the pre-election aims  and

policies  of  the P.A.P. and what  the  masses  had

thought  we stood for. For one thing, these  people

knew  they  had  betrayed the P.A.P. and  are  now

retreating  to  their second line of  defence.  The

Committee  members  of  the  People's  Association,

announced  on  Sunday, will take the place  of  the

Central   Committee  of  the  P.A.P. before   the

elections  when  the branches and the  masses  melt

away.  The  community centres, where some Ministers

and Parliamentary Secretaries are now holding their

meet-the-people sessions (they held them in  P.A.P.

branches before the Special Party Conference), will

take the place of P.A.P. branches. Community centre

leaders are sent to attend American-sponsored World

Assembly  of  Youth Conferences.  We  remember  the

World   Assembly  of  Youth  Conference   held   in

Singapore  in  1955, organised  by  Eric  Wee,  and

opened   by  Malcolm  Mac-Donald.  Many  of   these

community  centres are built from funds donated  by

Shaw, and  we  can  see his  presence  in  a  seat

reserved  for a guest of honour at the  opening  of

community centres. The

U.S.A.  Asia  Foundation also donated equipment  to

the community centres. Is this so-called "centre" a

"third force"?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure hundreds of thousands of dollars must

have  been  spent  on  the  Work  Brigade,  but  no

important  construction work has been done.  During

the  opening of the second session of the Assembly,

about  200  of  them got a paid public  holiday  by

going to the Supreme Court Building to wave at  the

"leaders"  as  they passed by. They did  not  wave.

Neither  did  they  shout Merdeka.  I  suggest  the

Government  gazette  the  opening  session  of  the

Assembly as a public holiday, and direct all  civil

servants to wait at the Supreme Court Building  and

train  them, using the Political Study  Centre,  to

shout Merdeka. This would be more effective.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Do you not have new ideas to

put forward?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> After the Special Party Conference,

the  Community  Centres'  Workers  Training  Centre

conducted an examination. Those who passed would be

given jobs at the centres. Questions were asked - and

this  was  a  compulsory question, "How  would  you

explain  to  the  masses the recent  Ong  Eng  Guan

incident?" No wonder the Shaws and the U.S.A.  Asia

Foundation  spend so much money in financing  these

community centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am really ashamed of the $9

million surplus. That is hard-earned money from the

poor and the lower middle class; the petrol tax  on

the  taxi-drivers, lorry drivers, fishing boats and

white-collar  workers. They are from the  cigarette

tax   imposed   on  local  brands   of   cigarettes

manufactured  in  Singapore  and  smoked   by   the

workers,   hawkers,  taxi-drivers,   trisha-riders,

farmers and other poor people, and people like  the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance

when he was a City Councillor. But it is not so for

him  now.  Now  it  is "Lucky Strike".  The  recent

lotteries tax -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> The recent lotteries tax is also a

tax on the poor. In the Federation of Malaya, which

openly and honestly declares itself as a Right-wing

Government, all the revenue from the lotteries goes

to  the  Government. But in Singapore, which  calls

itself  a socialist Government, I believe  half  of

the income from the lotteries goes to the Singapore

Turf  Club which is dominated by European interests

and  the  compradores, and about half goes  to  the

Government.  Is not this financing the colonialists

and the compradores by collecting, in ten cents and

twenty  cents, from the sweat and the toil  of  the

hundreds of thousands of the labouring masses?

an  article  in  the Straits Times of  16th  April,

1959, which was during the general elections:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Lee Kuan Yew, secretary-general of the

People's Action Party, said today that P.A.P.

government may hold an inquiry into the cinema

industry.'

Building car park:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"It may be necessary for the Government to

intervene and free the cinema from all monopolistic

(strangeholds) and restriction-"'

Shaws and looks after their interests. I understand

the  Prime  Minister sent his Political  Secretary,

who is also Chairman of the Film Appeals Board,  to

Japan,  to so-called "represent" Shaw in the  Asian

Film  Festival  held in Tokyo recently.  After  his

return  we  saw  a spate of all types  of  Japanese

films  which cannot be described in clean language.

Sky  Cinema was specially converted to screen these

films.  After  our exposure at the  Badminton  Hall

Rally,  these  films were withdrawn. The  scapegoat

was  the staff in the Film Censor's Department.  On

the  3rd  of June, 1960, the Prime Minister  opened

the  National Economic Fair at Shaw's  Great  World

Amusement Park. One night of the admission receipts

goes to the National Theatre Fund, but the receipts

for  over 20 nights go to the coffers of the Shaws.

The  name  of  the Nation was used to sponsor  this

private  fair.  To  boost up  the  attendance,  the

Government   sent.  I  believe  on  two  occasions,

cultural  concerts into the Great World.  Were  the

expenses for these concerts paid by the Government?

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  this is a Government  for  the

Shaws  and the big compradores. This is not a  true

P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall now refer to the so-called integration of the City Council. The City

Council is far from being integrated. What has been

done is to assign the less important departments to

the   various   Ministers.   This   assignment   of

responsibility  is  only  in  theory,  because  the

ultimate  say on all City Council matters,  whether

the  departments have been assigned or  not,  still

rests  with  the  Prime Minister and  Mr  Meadows.

Finance  and staff and other administrative details

are   still  decided  by  the  Prime  Minister  and

Meadows.  Just  to quote an example.  Although  the

City Engineers' Department and the Transport Centre

have  been  assigned  to the Ministry  of  National

Development,  the  Prime  Minister,  at   his   own

discretion,  has sacked a driver at  the  Transport

Centre  without giving any reasons, and  following

the usual staff procedure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>



of  the  City Council.  What  has  actually

happened in the City Council is not integration but

Meadowisation. The "Supremo" of the  City  Council,

Meadows,  has  been organising the  departments  in

such a way that he can put all his followers in key

positions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to quote some instances. Lim Chuan Kim, who

had  worked  under  Meadows  when  the  latter  was

Chairman  of the Rural Board, and who had resigned,

has been re-engaged and is now in the City Council.

Another  was the Chairman of the District  Council.

He  is  now  the Chairman of the Rural  Board,  the

Chairman   of   the   Urban  and   Rural   Services

Coordinating Committee, and holds a key position in

the  Planning Committee. The Health Department, the

Hawkers  Department,  and the Cleansing  Department

have   now  been  put  under  the  charge  of   Mr

Kanagaratnam, another follower of Meadows.  Dr  Ng

See  Yook,  City Health Officer, who is  higher  in

status than a Permanent Secretary, now has to  take

instructions   from   relatively   junior   medical

officers. Lui Boon Poh has been kicked out from the

post of Superintendent of City Cleansing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Deputy Administrator!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> It is understood that the position of

Loh  Puay Kay, at present Acting Superintendent  of

Hawkers, is also shaky. It is believed the post  of

Superintendent  has  now been advertised,  and  the

qualifications have been so specified that Loh Puay

Kay  will  be left out. The Acting City  Treasurer.

Mr  Owen, a local accountant, was forced to resign

his position; and Mr Scales, an expatriate who had

taken  his  Malayanisation compensation, was  taken

back.  Before  the return of Scales, an  expatriate

geography  graduate,  who  does  not  know  how  to

multiply figures by 6, was asked -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am just wondering whether

that is not bordering on tedious repetition. "A man

who  cannot multiply figures by 6." Anyway,  it  is

now the moment of interruption. Before the Assembly

adjourns, I would like to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



remind the Member for Aljunied that if he is going

to  quote  from  newspapers tomorrow,  he  has  to

produce  those newspapers; and if he is  going  to

quote from Hansard, he has to produce the Hansard.

Further consideration tomorrow?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Tomorrow, Sir.
