<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir at the moment of interruption

yesterday, I intended to give an answer to the hon.

Member  for  Changi in regard to  the  question  of

salary  scales  of  teachers, but  as  it  was  not

possible   then,   I   will  therefore   take   the

opportunity  this morning. It is  not  possible  to

explain  in  detail  the salary  structure  in  the

public  service  as  against the qualifications  of

Chinese  school teachers, because the  hon.  Member

for  Changi, who is absent today, will not be  able

to  understand  it.  It is not because  the  salary

structure   is   complicated,   but   because   the

qualifications of Chinese school teachers are  more

complicated  than  is  the  salary  structure;  the

reason  being  that for a long time, while  Chinese

schools were outside the control



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>





of  my Ministry, the teachers were recruited by the

school committees of management without any uniform

requirements  at  all  as to their  qualifications.

Therefore,  it is no wonder that the assessment  of



Chinese   qualifications   has   caused   so   much

difficulty.  If there is any teacher who  does  not

know  how  his salary is arrived at by my Ministry,

the  proper course open to him is to make enquiries

from my Staff Officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of University degrees and their

recognition, I must remind the hon. Member that  it

is  the Public Service Commission which advises the

Government  on the value of certain qualifications;

and  as  to who advises the Commission, I am afraid

the  hon.  Member must direct his question  to  the

Public  Service Commission, and not to me; I cannot

answer  on behalf of the Public Service Commission.

I  also want the hon. Member to understand that, as

Minister  for  Education, I am not  an  adviser  on

qualifications  or  on  the  public  service.   The

recognition of certain qualifications has  a  wider

implication  than for the purpose of teaching  when

you consider the public service as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know if I may be ruled out of order

if I should touch on Tamil education?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Has the point been raised?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> No. Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 46 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 53 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have in Singapore the Council for Adult

Education which is run under the direction  of  the

Minister  for  Education.  The function  of this

Council is to educate the adults who could not  and

did not attend either primary or secondary schools.

The  Council  are  now conducting about  630  night



classes  teaching in almost all languages,  in  the

Adult  Education Association. Sir, when the  Rendel

Constitution comes to an end, elections to the next

Assembly will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1531</b></font><br><br>





ready and the voters in Singapore will have to play

a  more  important  part than  they  were  hitherto

doing.  Double  the number of Assemblymen  will  he

elected from more than double the number of voters.

Therefore, it is as important to educate the adults



as  to educate the children, not only as voters but

also as parents. If the adults of today are steeped

in  prejudice or superstition or some sort  of  bad

behaviour  of  one kind or another,  naturally  the

children will inherit these habits in spite of  all

the  textbook  knowledge pumped into them,  and  we

would not be able to get independence in Singapore.

So,  Sir, it is important, as I have told  you, to

educate the adults.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen in this Estimate, for the Council for

Adult  Education,  that only $500,000  is  allowed.

Sir,  we  have  in Singapore, 252,000  children  in



primary schools, 42,000 in secondary schools, 3,000

in  universities,  and 2,000 in technical  schools.

Therefore, out of a total of 300,000 children after



completing  primary  education,  we  have   roughly

45,000   children   attending  secondary   schools,

universities  and  technical  schools.  Sir,   what

happens to the other 255,000 children? They are not

getting  any  further education. At  least  in  the

interest  of  these children, apart  from  so  many

adults  who  wish  to  educate  themselves,   adult

education is important.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to convince the Members of this Assembly, I

am  quoting from the Annual Report of the Singapore

Council for Adult Education presented to the Annual

Conference on 6th December, 1958, page 1:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Though we hope for a greater expansion in our

activities this year, because of the economy  drive

of  the Government of Singapore, we have had to  be

satisfied  with  consolidating what  we  have  done

rather than to increase our classes. Originally  we

had  planned $613,317 estimate for the year  to  be

received  from  Government grant. This  had  to  be

reduced to $522,387 estimate. Hence, there has been

little  expansion, and out of the request  for  204

more  new classes in basic education, only 51 could

be approved. We had to be satisfied again with only

a token grant of $10 for cultural education.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be pointed out that though, from

Government,  we  have received $522,387  the  total

expenses of the Council have been in the region  of

$700,000,  the  balance  being  met  from  our  own

General Fund. In our opinion, in the present  stage

of  rapid  development in Singapore  and  with  its

large  body  of new citizens, to curtail  our  work

would  be disastrous to the community and it should

be  strongly urged that it is the responsibility of

the  Government to help us to expand our  work.  To

reduce one adult class means one policeman less."



<br><br>I will just quote one more sentence from page 6:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Basic Education Committee met on 15th

October,  1958,  and  considered  various  possible

measures. It finally decided to ask our Association

running  classes  to close their  classes  on  23rd

November,  1958,  about 3 weeks  earlier  than  the

scheduled time, so that there would be a saving  of

expenditure sufficient to meet the deficit."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is necessary for me to explain

further than what I have read from the Report,  and

in  view  of the above I hope the Hon, the Minister

for  Education will consider giving a bigger  grant

to the Adult Education Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, hon. Members

will  notice  in the Estimates that the  grant  for

next  year  in respect of the Council for Education

is  the  same  as the grant for this year.  At  the

outset, I think I must explain that the Council for

Adult  Education was formed on one  principle,  and

that  is to provide literacy classes for the  adult

population.  It is not supposed to run classes  for

the  Ministry,  and  therefore there  must  not  be

duplication  of classes such as providing  lectures

on   Cambridge  examination  subjects,   commercial

subjects and further education. These are being run

by  my Ministry in many spheres, such as commercial

schools  running in several centres. We  have  also

secondary   commercial  schools.   Therefore,   the

Council  should  not duplicate the work  and  incur

unnecessary expenditure. The Council should confine

itself to providing literacy classes for adults for

which  it  is  formed and not embark  on  providing

classes  on  further  education,  instituting   law

lectures and such like subjects.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I admit that the Council's constitution does give

it very wide powers and room for discretion, but as

I am entrusted with public funds I cannot allow the

Council   to  go  on  merrily  spending  money   on

duplicated  work without a check. I will,  however,

if  I  am reasonably satisfied that the expenditure

asked for is justified, come to this Assembly for a

supplementary  vote, as I have done  sometime  this

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I heard the hon. Member for Farrer Park rightly,

he  mentioned  something about cultural  education.

May I remind him that we have a cultural section in



my  Ministry for which we have asked for a vote  of

some $50,000?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> I am glad, Sir, that the Hon, the

Minister  for Education admits that there  is  need

for  adult education. But to answer his point  that

the Council is spending too much money not only  on

adult  education  but also on further  education - by

which he means cultural and other activities - I want

to assure the Minister that the Council has already

stopped  these  activities and to convince  him,  I

will  just  read one paragraph on  page  9  of  the

Report:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It may not be out of place to point out in this

context that the Council recognize that, as far  as

possible,  they should avoid duplication  with  the

Ministry  of  Education or the Polytechnic  or  the

universities.   It  is  because   this   year   the

Polytechnic  and  the Ministry of Education  itself

have  started  offering  facilities  for  secondary

level  classes  in  the evening  that  the  Further

Education Committee decided to start economising by

cutting down secondary level classes."



<br><br>10.15 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think this clears the Minister's anxiety

that the Council are spending more money on further

education.  I shall quote some figures to  convince

the  Minister.  Sir,  the  total  amount  of  money

allowed  by  the  Ministry to the  Adult  Education

Council is $500,000. Sir, the Minister admits  that

basic  education is necessary. For teachers' salary

and   basic   education  alone,  they  have   spent

$364,954.   For   teachers'  salary   and   further

education  (that  is  what the  Hon, the  Minister

complains  about) - only $36,990 was spent.  But  the

fees collected from students on basic education is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>



$129,050;  and  the  students'  fees  for   further

education, which the Minister complains  about,  is

$27,596.90 cents. Sir, this figure shows that, from

the grant which this Council have received from the

Ministry, they have not wasted anything. They  have

conducted  classes for basic education;  they  have

almost  maintained themselves. They have  collected

fees  from  students for further  education,  which

were  sufficient to maintain their classes. I think

the  Hon, the  Minister need not be anxious  about

their  wasting money. Actually they are  not.  They

have more or less stopped all these classes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Does the hon. Member realise

that  they  stopped further education  only  at  my

intervention,  when  I found  out  that  they  were

embarking  on  such duplicate subjects  as  I  have

pointed out just now?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



"That the sum of $63,539,180 for Head 46 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  want just a few points of clarification from the

Minister  for Education on the running  of  evening

classes. Do I understand that there will be  places

in the evening classes for all the students who are

not  able to gain entry into normal schools?  Do  I

understand again that the evening classes  will  be

run  on  more or less the same footing as  the  day

schools,  enabling the students who  join  them  to

come  up  to  the  level of Senior  Middle  III  in

Chinese   schools   and   the   Cambridge    School

Certificate  in the English stream? If  it  is  the

case, then I think the people of Singapore will not

have  any  grouse at all. It assists them  a  great

deal. Of course, when I am talking about this, I do

not for one moment forget about students who may be

at  school  all  the  time and yet  are  unable  to

benefit by it. I am aware that there may be a great

number  of  students  whose parents  want  them  to

become  great men - doctors, lawyers and all that - and

they cannot even pass Standard V or VI. Now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1535</b></font><br><br>



some  useful outlet must be found for such  people,

and  I wonder if the Minister has in mind plans  to

assist  them,  to help them with  some  sort  of  a

vocation  so  that  at that age,  when  they  leave

school  and are not able to go for further studies,

and too young to get a job, they are able to absorb

some  useful  learning of some sort at institutions

which  will  train them for a job. I am aware  that

the Minister has had that plan in mind for quite  a

long  time, but it has not been put into  practice - for reasons which I do not know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also remind the Minister that there are

welfare organizations which are prepared to  assist

Government in that direction. In fact, last year  I

made  an  offer to the Minister that the Federation

of  Boys'  Clubs  has  been  thinking  of  starting

classes - in  fact, they have started  classes  which

teach  motor repairing, wood-work, and  such  other

crafts - and  that they would be prepared  to  assist

the Ministry in helping these young people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Sir, which I would like to ask the

Minister   is  the  policy  in  respect  of   youth

movements  in  Singapore. We have had the  Ministry

sending  over to us representatives to sit  on  our

Management Committee, to learn and assist the youth

movement, the Federation of Boys' Clubs. Previously

they  had  an officer sent to us. This officer,  of

course, had notices of meetings sent to him all the

time,  but he never attended meetings! However,  we

are  grateful  to  the  Ministry  for  sending  the

present  officer, Mr Peter Lim, to  represent  the

Ministry   on   our  Committee,   because   he   is

particularly  interested in the youth movement  and

has   been   very  helpful - suggesting  a   lot   of

improvements  and  ways  of co-operating  with  the

Ministries  for  the  betterment  of  youth.  I  am

talking about this co-operation in connection  with

the  limited  playing fields we have in  Singapore.

All this time the Ministry has assured us that they



will  help  us out over this matter at the  highest

level;  but  when it comes to actual  practice,  we

find the red tape is such that it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>



almost  impossible  to make use of  school  playing

fields!  We  have  put forward  our  views  to  the

Ministry  that schools are meant for the youths  of

Singapore, and whether they are within school hours

or outside school hours, they should be made use of

instead  of being left idle. We have not  had  much

success at that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to know that the

education of our young people must not be  confined

only  to  classrooms, and to within  the  hours  of

teaching in schools, but that it should be an  all-round affair, and we should take care of our youths

inside the schools as well as outside them. If  the

youth movements are prepared to help Government  on

that  basis,  to look after the young  people  when

they  are  out  of school and see  that  they  have

something useful to do, instead of ganging up  with

the  wrong  type of people, then Government  should

help  them. I am certain that if the Minister  will

assure  us  in this House that he will do  so,  and

that  he  will give a directive to all his officers

concerned  to  give  the youth movements  full  and

tangible co-operation in helping the young  people,

it will be appreciated by all.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Sir, I would like to raise the

question of Tamil education and I would invite  the

Minister  to  speak on his plans on  further  Tamil

education in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  have  said on the Second Reading of  the  Budget

that  I  was  very  perturbed  to  note  that   the

Government,  instead  of  building  more  secondary

schools  to absorb those pupils who pass  out  from

the primary schools, have provided only 9 secondary

schools  to  59 primary schools. Sir, we  all  know

education   is  very  important  in   this   world.

Education is a human problem and also a human need,



like  health  and housing. We must  pay  particular

attention  to  education,  particularly   for   the

younger set. The Government say they are unable  to

build  more secondary schools on the flimsy  excuse

that   they   are  unable  to  recruit   able   and

experienced teachers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1537</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must have teachers. We do not care

whether  they are able to recruit or not.  We  must

have  them at any cost! [Laughter.] You may  laugh,

Sir. What I know is that the Ministry of Education -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I must point out that I did

not laugh at all!



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Sir, what I meant was that there

was giggling in the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know the Government is always very smart, I

mean  in the way they cook up something - "We  cannot

get  teachers;  we are unable to get teachers",  or

"We  have  no money." They are very fond of  saying

the  same  thing again and again, in spite  of  the

fact  that they say they want to provide six years'

free education for all the children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at subhead 11, "Free Text Books" - page 256.

Under this item $300,000 was provided for Free Text



Books for the previous year.



<br><br>10.30 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have this grant for Free Text Books under

three subheads: subhead 11 on page 256; subhead  28

on  page  257,  and subhead 34 on page  257.  These

three totals of grant for Free Text Books amount to

$151,000  for 1959 as against the $300,000 provided

for  this  year. Why has this amount been  reduced?

Sir,  we know very well that free textbooks  should

be provided for the children of those who are poor.

They  cannot even pay the school fees. They  cannot



pay for the textbooks. So Government has provided a

grant  for  free textbooks. But now Government  has

the  effrontery to reduce this amount. Why?  I  can

tell  you  the reason. It is because many of  these

students  have  been kicked out of  school  because

they  have  failed in their examinations.  We  know

very  well  that  the population  of  Singapore  is

increasing. Year in and year out we have  more  and

more  children  attending school. I am  quite  sure

many people will be affected by this reduced grant.

What is the Ministry of Education doing?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another aspect of Government which I

have already condemned, and that is, they only know

how  to  look  after their own interest.  They  use

sugar-coated  words  when they  say  they  want  to

provide  education for all. I have  been  patiently

sitting  on this side of the House for nearly  four

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that if the Government had been doing

its   job  properly,  the  recent  leakage  in  the

examinations would not have happened. Do  you  know

how  much  worry,  anxiety and trouble  the  school

children went through to prepare themselves for the

examinations?   After   having    sat    for    the

examinations,  we can imagine their  disappointment

when  they  came back home and the news  broke  out

that  the  examination papers could be  bought  for

$30.  Sir, you know of this situation. The  leakage

happened  not only in the English schools but  also

in the Chinese schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for so many years under the Colonial

Government - I  was  educated in a Government  school

for nearly ten years - we never heard of such a silly

thing  as a leakage of examination papers. We never

heard  that examination papers could be bought  for

$30.  If  there are any excuses which the  Minister

for  Education  could give, I would  still  not  be

satisfied,  because as Minister for  Education,  he

must  be  responsible for his Ministry. It  is  his

duty to see that his Ministry is properly run,  and

he  should not blame the Printing Office or anybody

else.  He may cry to heaven and earth! He may  cook

up excuses! I am not interested.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The expression "cook up", of

course,  is  very  unparliamentary.  I  think   the

honourable Member must be careful in his choice  of

words. Will he please withdraw the expression?



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> I withdraw it, Sir,I wish to

know   the  policy  adopted  by  the  Ministry   of

Education in regard to the registration of children

in  all the schools in Singapore. Does the Minister

know  that when a parent has four or five children,

he  would  naturally prefer them to go to the  same

school  or  to  schools nearest his home?  Instead,

they have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1539</b></font><br><br>



adopted a nonsensical policy in the Department.  Do

you  know  what has happened? I will refer  to  the

case  of  a  parent living in my area. One  of  his

children  was studying in Tiong Bahru  School.  The

next  child  was  posted to Trafalgar  School.  The

third  child,  who was registered  at  Tiong  Bahru

School,  was  given the excuse that there  were  no

more  places. They said they were sorry, and  could

not  find him a place in Tiong Bahru School. He was

posted instead to Kim Seng Road (West) School.  The

fourth  child was transferred to Trafalgar  School.

Imagine a parent having his four children going  to



three different schools! In addition to the members

of his family whom he has to support, he has to pay

rent. He has to pay everything on a salary of, say,

$150 or $200. With all these commitments, he has to

send   four   children  to  different  schools   in

different parts of the island. Has he enough  time,

or  can  he  take  the trouble to send  his  little

children to Trafalgar School, Kim Seng Road  (West)

School,  and  Tiong  Bahru  School - three  different

places, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, for one, Sir, send my children every morning

to school - to three different schools. I do not mind

that  much,  Sir, because I can get in my  car  and

send  them  off. But can an ordinary  working-class

parent,  who has four children, do the  same?  Some

wives  may have lost their husbands, or a housewife

may  have  a tiny tot nestling in her arms.  Do  we

expect this woman to send her children to different

schools,  when their ages may be just around  seven

to  nine years? Is it fair to this poor woman? When

you  ask  the principal of a school to put all  the

children  in the same school, he will  say:  "I  am

sorry,  I cannot do anything. We are instructed  by

the  Ministry of Education." Who controls them? The

Ministry  of  Education. The  principal  cannot  do

much.  He  realises the plight of the  family.  The

excuse is every time given that it is the Almighty,

the  Minister  for Education, or  the  Ministry  of

Education,   who  controls  the  destiny   of   our

children.   The  Minister  may  be   God   in   his

Department, but I have the liberty to speak in this

House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1540</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister then talked about secondary schools.

He  said  that  many  children,  on  passing  their

primary school examination, would go to a trade  or

a technical school. May I ask the Minister how many

children   who   fail  in  their   primary   school

examination  manage to get a place in  a  trade  or

technical  school? For example, we  notice  in  the

papers   that   15,000  students  sat   for   their

examinations, and only 7,000 were accepted, leaving

8,000  students stranded. Do not forget  that  they

are  the citizens of tomorrow. These 8,000 students

will  be our people. Yet he is talking about  trade

schools and technical schools. He likes them to  go

there. Sir, may I also remind the Minister that  it

is  the  parents' wish to decide what education  is

good  for their children? The Minister has no right

to  dictate to me and ask me to send my children to

a  trade  school. In my case, I will not listen  to

his  advice.  I will choose to send my children  to

any  school  I like, whether to a trade  school,  a

secondary  or a carpentry school, or any  school  I

like.  He  gives  the  excuse that  we  have  trade

schools to absorb the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, look at the students roaming in the streets.

In   my  area  in  Tiong  Bahru  alone,  there  are



thousands  of  them,  not  hundreds.  What  is  the

reason?  It  is  because they are over-age.  It  is

because  they  have  failed  in  their  Primary  VI

examination. It is also because the Government want

to  save money, as in the case of the reduction  in

the grant of free textbooks, under cover that it is

necessary  to economise in order to give  education

for all. Cook up excuses!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the hon. Member is not

careful with his language and his tone of voice, he

will  be  prevented from speaking further  at  this

sitting. He has used the expression "cook up" once.

He  has  withdrawn it. He has now used it again.  I



ask him to withdraw it again and to be careful with

his language.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> I withdraw that, Sir. I will use

the word "invent".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1541</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. That word "invent" also is

unparliamentary.   The   honourable   Member   must

withdraw that.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> I withdraw that word. You cannot

blame me for being angry, Sir, because I have  seen

parents  coming to my house or my office,  weeping,

particularly those poor women who have no husbands,

or  whose  husbands were jobless, saying that  they

have to send their children to various schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

is  a strange thing that since Mr Opposition,  the

champion   for  the  poor,  has  decided   not   to

participate  in  this debate, this House  seems  to

have   been  monopolised  by  the  two  ex-Democrat

Assemblymen.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have permitted

"wisecracks" - I   do  not  know  whether   that   is

unparliamentary  or not - but I do ask  hon.  Members

not  to  make any personal references to honourable

Members,  but  to get on with the  debate.  We  are

debating Government policy, and, therefore, whether

an honourable Member is an ex-Democrat or not makes

no  difference.  We  are  now  debating  Government

policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Yes, Sir. I beg to withdraw,

but  actually it is relevant to what I am going  to

debate. I wonder whether the Minister for Education

can  recollect  what  he  said  yesterday  when  he

answered  my first question. What is the policy  of

the  Government  right  now  in  building  so  many

schools  and  granting  so  much  money - even  those

schools which we call vernacular schools under  the

item of Grants-in-Aid - spending so much money -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We have completed the debate

on  Grants-in-Aid  on the honourable  Member's  own

amendment.  He was not here this morning  when  the

Minister  replied  to  his amendment.  A  vote  was

taken, and therefore this topic of Grants-in-Aid is

now closed.



<br><br>10.45 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I am fully aware of my

position.  The Minister gave me an answer yesterday

that he is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1542</b></font><br><br>



not  the Minister for Employment. Therefore, it  is

not  his duty to answer my query as to what  is  in

his mind or in his Government's mind in respect  of

Singapore's  education policy - whether he  has  made

any  move to co-ordinate our education policy on  a

Pan-Malayan  basis.  That is,  of  course,  what  I

intended to mean. So I can quote, to show my  point

on  what I already said yesterday on this question,

from  the  Sin  Chew  Jit Poh of yesterday's  date.

There is a feature article written by a student  by



the name of Tsu-hua, a new graduate from the Senior

Middle High School.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;December 17th.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>"MY ACCUSATION

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name-Tsu-hua

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confession of a newly senior graduated student".</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to save time I will just quote two

sentences. It says:



<div align="center"><h4>"GRADUATION MEANS UNEMPLOYMENT"</h4></div>



Why  I purposely wish to quote this feature article

is  that  I want to emphasise the line along  which

our education policy is taking in this country. The

education policy cannot be separated from  language

and  culture. One curious thing about this  country

is  that, as I have already explained once or twice

before, on the eve of the Rendel Constitution there

was a controversy on multilingualism. It was argued

that multilingualism should be introduced into this

Assembly,  with equal treatment for all  languages;

for  example,  by  adopting a bilingual  system  of

education in this country. Now, on the eve  of  the

Lennox-Boyd  Constitution, we have a  most  serious

question on language being raised. It is that Malay

should be the lingua franca of this country. Sir, I

wonder  why all political leaders who champion  the

cause  of  making  the  Malay language  the  lingua

franca are not interested in this debate so that we

may   be   given   a  more  detailed   explanation,

especially  from  someone  who  has  sat   on   the

Education Committee. This Committee has decided and

formulated  our  education  policy - a  policy  which

gives  equal  treatment to all  schools;  in  other

words, English schools, Malay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1543</b></font><br><br>



schools,  Chinese  schools and Tamil  schools.  Now

suddenly on the eve of the elections, we have  this

serious question of language being raised, that is,

Malay  must be made the lingua franca of Singapore.

Therefore, I wish to take this opportunity  to  ask



the   Minister  for  Education  whether  it  is   a

political   move  or  whether  it  is  actually   a

necessity  for  this  country, especially  when  we

consider  the Budget lying in front of us.  We  can

see  how  much money is going to be spent on  Malay

education and how much money is going to  be  spent

on English, Chinese and Tamil schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish also the Minister for Education to answer

this  question.  What improvement  is  expected  in

introducing various languages in English  schools'?

We  learn  that Chinese is being taught in  English

schools, Malay in English schools, Tamil in English

schools. What progress has been made? I do not know

whether he has at hand any figures of any survey to

show  the  extent of the cultural  stream  of  this

country, and the various cultural influences  which

have  an  important bearing on our  life.  Has  the

Government  failed  to  tell  the  people  and  the

leaders  (of  course,  not  much  blame  should  be

attached  to  the  Education Ministry  alone)  that

multilingual education has already been accepted in

this  country as our education policy?  Why  is  it

that  on the eve of the elections the question  has

been raised to make Malay the lingua franca in this

country?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have figures supplied by my friend, Mr

George   Thomson,  about  the  various   newspapers

circulating in Malaya and Singapore. A large figure

of  about 400,000 copies a day is given as being in

circulation.  But, Sir, you will be surprised  that

among these 400,000 copies of various newspapers of

various  languages,  the  Chinese  newspapers  have

210,000  copies,  excluding  magazines,  and  those

which  we  call "mosquito" papers. We  are  judging

only  from the Chinese language newspapers. Of  the

English language papers, the figure given is  about

130,000 to 140,000 copies a day. Malay is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1544</b></font><br><br>



about 30,000 to 40,000 copies a day. Tamil is about

7  per  cent of the total. Therefore, judging  from

the   papers,   we  can  know  which  language   is

influential and which language is popular  in  this

country.  Yet, Sir, at this juncture  when  we  are

just  coming towards self-government, we have  this

language  question being raised again.  I  want  to

know why. If I am not wrong, even in the Federation

of  Malaya, the Chinese Schools Conference on Malay

have forced the M.C.A. to have a big conference  in

Ipoh  not long ago to fight for the Chinese to make

Chinese  an official language in the Federation  of

Malaya. On the contrary, Sir, in Singapore  we  see

some  ambitious, selfish and shortsighted political

leaders  who  want to confuse the  issue  again  by

bringing  up  this  controversy,  since  they  have

already  said  that the Progressives were  strongly

against   multilingualism.  Now   where   are   the

Progressives?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This language problem arises again on the eve of

the  Lennox-Boyd Constitution. I wish the  Minister

for Education can give us a clear-cut analysis,  so

that  we can recollect what we have agreed  in  the

All-Party Committee on Education, and whether  this

Government  is now prepared to persuade the  people

of  Singapore  to make Malay the lingua  franca  of

this  country,  and deny the Chinese language,  the

English language, the Tamil language, the status of

official languages. What we have agreed to have  in

Singapore is multi-lingualism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you may be surprised at what connection all

this  has with our education policy. I have  quoted

from  a newspaper which says that "graduation means

unemployment". A student, either from  the  primary

school  or from Nanyang University, does  not  know

what  to do or where to go after graduation.  After

he  has  spent, say, 17 years of his  education  in

Chinese,  he  is  told suddenly to  take  up  Malay

because  this country has not accepted the  Chinese

language as the official language. That would  mean

more unemployment. There would be no chance to find

employment. Therefore, to me the education  policy,

especially one that has a Pan-Malayan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1545</b></font><br><br>



outlook,  is  of vital importance to this  country.

Every  language in this multi-racial country should



be respected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a very poor linguist, and I know very little

of  languages. Yet I do not care. Language is  only

just  an  instrument  of expression.  The  language

itself  is,  I  should  say,  a  dead  or  lifeless

instrument.  It is only our feelings  and  thoughts

that  make  the language lively and beautiful.  Why

must  we  deny the Chinese language and the English

language  their  proper place in our  culture?  Why

should  we  elect, on the eve of the elections,  to

hail  the  Malay language, and make it  the  lingua

franca of Singapore? We do not have the courage  to

tell  our  people  here  that  language  itself  is

nothing; that it is lifeless. It is the person (his

thoughts,  his mind and his feelings) who  controls

and  exercises  it,  and who  uses  it  to  express

himself, that counts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many Englishmen in this world today can

challenge  the beautiful English, either in  speech

or in writing, of Mr Nehru? How many English poets

dare  to  deny that the Indian poet Tagore  is  not

great?  Who can say that, because Tagore and  Nehru

are  so  expert in the use of the English language,

therefore  they  are traitors? That  they  are  not

genuine nationalists? Nobody dares to deny that. In

this  country, I think none of us has made so  much

sacrifices as Mr Nehru had when he fought for  his

country's  independence.  It  is  a  shame  to  the

national  leaders in this country who have achieved

high  positions.  I  am  not  excluding  myself.  I

include  myself! It is a real shame!  We  have  not

been  imprisoned for one day. We have  not  shed  a

single  drop  of  blood. Yet  we  say  we  are  the

champions  of  nationalism!  We  must  abolish  the

English   language!  We  must  deny   the   Chinese

language! Instead, we must hail the Malay language!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have full confidence in and great respect for

Tunku Abdul Rahman's wisdom, sincerity and honesty.

I bet you, Sir, the U.M.N.O. leaders never fool the



Malay  ra'ayat. The Malay ra'ayat have  never  been

fooled  by  opportunists who say that  if  we  hail

Malay as the lingua



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1546</b></font><br><br>



franca,  there  will  be  a  merger  and  all  the

trouble in this country can be resolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to go a bit deeper into this

subject.  We  have read from the Press  that  there

were riots in Ceylon, Bombay and Calcutta - three big

cities.  Over  what,  Sir? Over  the  language  and

cultural   issues.  After  that,   racial   clashes

followed.  So  this is a serious warning  for  this

country. I hope the Minister for Education can give

us  an assurance that he will not make Singapore  a

second   Ceylon  and  have  language  and  cultural

conflicts just over the question of language.



<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the students in all schools have a full

assurance  that what they learn in school  will  be

useful to the country in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In concluding my speech on the general aspect of

language, I have two questions to ask the Minister.

Has he decided to open all available classrooms  in



all  schools?  From information  I  have  gathered,

there  are  vacant classrooms in Chung  Cheng  High

School and Chung Hwa Girls' School.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, what is he going to do about the large

numbers of over-age students, especially those from

the  rural areas? The Minister assured us that they

were  going to secondary evening schools.  But  the

rural  residents have to attend evening schools  in

town.  I  think it is quite difficult for  them  to

attend  evening schools in town. Therefore, I  wish

the  Minister will find a solution for those  over-age  students who attend schools in the rural areas

and  who  are denied the right to attend  secondary

schools here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indeed

surprised  to  see that the hon. Member  for  Tiong

Bahru is absent.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have requested honourable

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1547</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Hon. Minister

knows  that Members of Parliament do not sit  right

through  Budget  debates. I  think  the  honourable

Member  for Tiong Bahru will have ample opportunity

to read the Hansard.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> As you please, Sir, I am bound

by  your ruling. Sir, the hon. Member for Serangoon

has  asked me several questions. I will answer them

one by one. Evening classes are meant for all those

who  have, either for one reason or another, failed

to  get into the secondary section because they are

over-age  or because they have failed the  entrance

examination to the secondary schools. There will be

places  for all these people. There are, of course,

exceptions.  I  will not make places available  for

those  who  are  already attending day  schools  or

private  schools  and  wanting  to  attend  evening

classes  just  to brush up on their studies.  These

evening  classes are the same as the  day  schools.

The  pupils  in these classes will be given,  as  I



have  stated  in this House many a time,  education

leading  up  to the Senior Middle III  examination,

the   Royal   Society  of  Arts,  and  the   Senior

Cambridge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also referred to the youth

movement  and  playing field facilities  not  being

made  use  of. I wish to inform him that  there  is

already  a  section  called  the  Youth  Recreation

Section in the Ministry of Labour and Welfare under

a  Director  who has been seconded from the  United

States  of America. He is working in close  liaison

with my Ministry to see that all the playing fields

are  being made use of and not being left idle; and

he  is to co-ordinate all youth activities in  this

Colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Tamil education, I take this

opportunity to inform the House that Government has

taken over two Tamil schools as Government schools.

One  is the St. George's Road Tamil School and  the



other  is  another Tamil school near  the  Hospital

quarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of giving better salaries to Tamil

teachers with the requisite qualifications is  also

being pursued vigorously,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1548</b></font><br><br>



and I think the Tamil teachers will  have

no qualms about their salary scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of further Tamil education will be

the  subject of discussion by the Education Council

which is being set up under the new education law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Tiong Bahru insisted that we

must  have teachers at any cost. I hope he can,  by

magic, produce them out of a hat! Teachers must  be

trained  and it takes time to train them. To  staff

the   secondary  schools,  we  must  have  graduate

teachers  and  it is difficult to get them  because

there  are other professions which they would  like

to  join. The Ministry has been trying to make  the

teaching  profession as attractive as possible  for

University  graduates, in  order  to  get  them  to

become teachers or Education Officers. We have  not

been very successful. Therefore, we just cannot say

the word and the teachers will be there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also deplored the provision for

free textbooks. He accused me of reducing the grant

for  free  textbooks  from $300,000  this  year  to

$151,000 for 1959. I wish he had made some  efforts

at  getting the facts. It is true in 1958  we  have

provided  a  sum of $300,000 but up  to  this  very

day - in  fact, up to the end of the year - only  about

$131,000 has been expended under that item. I think

hon. Members of this House will appreciate that  we

must  have a realistic estimate. We cannot come  to

this  House  and ask for $500,000 just to  make  it

impressive when the expenditure will only be  about

$100,000. Based on the experience of providing free

textbooks  for  1958, we have put  that  figure  at

$151,000, which is more realistic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also mentioned that pupils are

being  thrown  out of classrooms  or  schools  just

because  of free textbooks. I wish he could produce

facts  and  give  me evidence of  students  leaving

school just because they have no textbooks.  In  my

three  years  and  nine months' experience  in  the

Ministry of Education, I have never come across one

single case.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1549</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also mentioned something about

the leakage of examination papers and that I should

be  responsible. I gave a statement to  this  House

not  so  long  ago  regarding the  leakage  in  the

English entrance examination. We know the source of

the leakage. I cannot certainly be held responsible

just  because a man became dishonest. I  cannot  be

responsible  for  the  workings  of  the  minds  of

people, much less the workings of the mind  of  the

Member for Tiong Bahru!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also deplored the fact that children had been

posted to schools far away from their homes.  Well,

this  system  of  placing children close  to  their

homes  was  instituted by me in 1955 or  1956.  The

Ministry has been working under great pressure, and

it  is  almost inevitable that there must  be  some

children who will have to travel a bit further from

their homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself, when I went to school, had to walk six

miles  through an estate road to go  to  school.  I

never  complained; neither did my parents complain.

I think the public should not be pampered too much.



They  want  schools right at their door-step!  They



must  make an effort to go to school. For a  person

living in Tiong Bahru to go to Kim Seng Road,  less

than  half a mile away, I think that is a very lame

excuse indeed to make in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also mentioned that out of the

15,000   children   who  sat   for   the   entrance

examination, about 7,000 would be able to get  into

the secondary section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I made a public statement through the

Press that anyone who passed that examination would

be given a place in the secondary section and those

who  failed  would be given a place in the  evening

classes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that leads me to the question of secondary

education, a subject on which the Member for  Tiong

Bahru  laboured for a long time. I  think  in  this

country  we  are putting secondary education  on  a

basis  which  far exceeds that of other  countries.

Even in very advanced countries like the United



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>



Kingdom, the percentage is only about 25 to 27  per

cent  of  the  primary  section  going  up  to  the

secondary  section.  Now in  this  country  we  are

promoting about 46 to 50 per cent of them. The crux

of  the  matter  is - can  we  afford  it?  When  the

Government raise taxes, people shout at us. We have

criticisms  from the Opposition. Now what  is  that

money  for?  The money is for providing  education.

Yet, in view of the financial stringency, we cannot



afford  to  give  everyone  a  secondary  education

merely  because  he needs it, he wants  it,  or  he

demands  it.  The Education Ministry is responsible

for  seeing that those who can benefit by  it  will

get it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Changi touched on the question

of  a Pan-Malayan education policy, Malay being the

lingua  franca.  I cannot voice my policy  here  in

that  regard.  I have been faithfully carrying  out

the recommendations made by the All-Party Committee

on  Education  of which I was the Chairman  and  of

which the hon. Member for Changi was a member. If I

had  not faithfully carried them out, I would  have

heard murmurs of protest. But not one murmur have I

heard from any member of that Committee saying that

I  had  failed  in  my duty in carrying  out  those

recommendations.  Everyone of  the  recommendations

has been implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of Malay being the lingua

franca,  I  think that is a political matter  which

must  be  decided by the political parties  in  the

coming  elections. I am not competent to  formulate

my own policy on that matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the vernacular classes being carried on



in  the English schools, the hon. Member for Changi

asked whether there was any progress. I told him, I

think, in this House and in private, that there  is

progress.  The teaching of vernacular languages  in

English  schools is made compulsory, and the  marks

obtained  in this examination count in the  record,

and  every  child  has been made to  take  his  own

vernacular language.



<br><br>11.15 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the vacant places in Chung Cheng and

Chung Hwa Schools, about which the hon. Member  for

Changi is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>



anxious, I will say this: I will not allow them  to

be  opened  merely because of over-age pupils.  No.

Over-age pupils can get, as I say, into the evening



classes  for which they are meant, and I  will  not

open  them merely because there may be a few  over-age  pupils who want to study in those schools. The

over-age  pupils can get into the evening  classes,

including those over-age pupils in the rural  areas

to  which  the hon. Member referred.  If  the  need

arises,  I  will open evening classes in the  rural

areas  to  suit  the convenience of those  over-age

pupils. I think those are the points that I have to

answer, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous:</b> Just a clarification from the

Minister, Sir. The Hon. Minister has just said that

in  the  United States only 26 per cent  are  able,

after passing the primary school examination, to go

to secondary schools, if I heard him correctly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> The United Kingdom!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Then in Singapore almost 50 per cent

of  the primary school students are able to  go  to

secondary  schools. When I quoted my  figures,  the

Minister did not contradict them. My figures are - in

English  schools  we  have  145,000  children;   in

Chinese  schools 135,000 children; in Malay schools

15,000   children  and  in  Indian  schools   2,000

children.  There are approximately 300,000  school-going  children.  Out of this number,  we  have  in

primary  schools 250,000 children, taking it  as  a

whole,   and  in  secondary  schools  only   42,000

children. That is the 1957 record. In the technical

schools  there are only 2,000 children and  in  the

universities  there  are 3,000 children.  So,  from

among  the 250,000 children in the primary schools,

only   42,000  children  are  going  to   secondary

schools.  How  does  the  Minister  reconcile   his

statement  that  50 per cent of  the  children  are

being given facilities to go to secondary schools?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> The hon. Member for Farrer

Park  must not confuse himself with those  figures.

The 300,000 children now in school - they have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1552</b></font><br><br>



there since the last six years and the increase  in

the   intake  in  the  last  few  years  has   been

phenomenal.  Each  year we  take  in  about  20,000

children. The children take six years to reach  the

Primary  VI stage where they will have to take  the

entrance examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said that 46 to 50 per cent of the children

who  gain  admission to the secondary  section  are

those  who have sat for the examination. That means

not all the 300,000 sit for the examination surely,

but  those  who  sit  for the examination  are  the

Primary  VI  classes.  The  hon.  Member  must  not

confuse  this with the total figure of  300,000  in

the schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I just want to ask about the

progress  of the reorganisation in the Ministry  of

Education  since  the  appointment  of   the   able

Permanent  Secretary to the Ministry. I  understand

that  the Chinese Section of the Ministry has  been

abolished   entirely   and   absorbed   into    the

administration. As a result, there have  been  many

complaints   of   inconvenience   raised   in   the

editorials of the daily newspapers and also in  the

column   "Man-in-the-Street".  I  wonder   if   the

Minister  can enlighten us on the progress  of  the

reorganisation in the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese school principals who receive notices,

although they are now being written in Chinese,  do

not  know which officer to go to. Letters have been

missed  and  some  files have  been  mislaid.  They

cannot directly go to the officer who controls  the

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Education will take this

opportunity  to enlighten us on the complaints  and

the inconveniences caused.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad to

have  been  given this opportunity  to  answer  the

question  as  regards  the  reorganisation  in   my

Ministry.  It is not the result of the  appointment

of  the present Permanent Secretary. That idea  was

mooted   just   before  he  became  the   Permanent

Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> It was not.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1553</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Thanks to reorganisation, we

have been able to streamline the administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously, the Chinese section only knew the

Chinese Inspectorate. Only the Chinese Section knew

everything  about the Chinese section, and  matters

never  went further than that section. Now,  it  is

being  streamlined  and administrative  duties  are

being  separated from professional duties. I  think

the  accusation that Chinese school  principals  do

not  know where to go to get advice in the Ministry

is utter nonsense.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> It is not nonsense.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> It is utter nonsense because

they have been told where to go to. We have Chinese

officers  who speak Mandarin and other dialects  in

the  various Sections. For instance, in  the  Staff

Section,  we  have a Chinese Inspector  of  Chinese

schools helping the Staff Officer to interview  all

the Chinese school principals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Professional Section, there are also

officers who know the Chinese language dealing with

professional  matters. So the  complaint  that  the

Chinese school principals do not know where  to  go

to  is  sheer  utter nonsense, uttered without  any

responsibility at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The irregularity of files missing is another bit

of sheer nonsense. Because of the previous practice

of  having one Section dealing only with a  special

section  of  the public, there was no co-ordination

at  all  between  the  professional  side  and  the

administrative  side. That is why  the  files  were

missing.  It is not because of reorganisation,  but

it is because of the pre-reorganisation practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $34,362,690 for Head 49 stand part

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I want to make a few

remarks for the benefit of the incoming Government.

This  is the Department of Health - there is one  run



by  the  Government and another  run  by  the  City

Council. If this can be made into one, either under

the  City  Council  or  under the  Government,  the

taxpayer  will be saved the cost of administration.

Further, there will be co-ordination. This has been



clarified  by  my  colleague, the hon.  Member  for

Tanglin.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1555</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to emphasise that the incoming Government

should  do  its  very  best so that  administration

costs  come down, but with co-ordination remaining,

of course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $34,362,690 for Head 49 ordered to

stand part of the Schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 50-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $782,560 for Head 50 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, this is a department which

exists  not  only in Singapore but  in  many  other

countries  as a result of what happened during  the

war  and  after the war - that is the misery  brought

about  by  war - and it has become a  very  essential

department, costing the taxpayers a lot  of  money.

We do not object to that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to suggest is this: that, as far as

Singapore is concerned, unemployment has grown to a

very,  very large extent. I would suggest that  the

incoming Government should formulate a policy  that

at  least  one member of a family should have  some

sort  of  employment. If that is done, the cost  of

giving  support from the revenue to the  unemployed

will be greatly reduced. At the same time, the head

of  the family, or the bread-winner, will be  proud

that  he is not living on the dole or at the  mercy

of  charity. That is all I have to say under  this,

Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head D 22 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is very regrettable that the amount for

the  building  of houses for the public  should  be

reduced  next  year under this Head to  $7  million

when  we have spent $21 million for building  these

houses this year. Only one-third of the amount will

be  spent  on providing houses for the public  next

year,  and  it is all the more regrettable  because

there are 15,000 people on the waiting list. It  is

very  sad for me, Sir, to have to inform those  who

come to seek my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>



aid  to get a Singapore Improvement Trust house for

them,  that unless they were registered a few years

ago their hope of ever getting one for the next ten

years is exactly nil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this situation is aggravated by the private

housing  estates  having come to a  grinding  halt:

firstly,  because  they are now  unable  to  obtain

loans   from  building  societies;  and,  secondly,

because  the City Council has suddenly changed  its

policy  by  demanding payment for  electricity  and

water mains leading to the estate. These charges up

to  a  few months ago were paid by the City Council

based  on  a consumption rate of a period  of  five

years.  Now, developers are asked to pay for public

mains  leading from the last section  on  the  main

road  to the estate - and it may be half a mile.  To

do  this for an estate of just over 100 houses  may

cost  $150,000, and this money must be paid to  the

City Council before the water and electricity mains

are  laid  and taken up to the boundaries  of  that

estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, housing, next to employment, is the most

important  need in Singapore today  and  we  cannot

possibly sit tight and do nothing about it.  To  my

mind,  there  is one solution to that problem,  and

that is by studying the growth and position of  the

illegal houses that have sprung up during the  past

three years. These houses are built with plank  and

zinc  out of the poorest material - in many cases  of

waste timber, and the zinc is of the thinnest gauge

and  will rust and leak within two to three  years.

It  is  no use closing our eyes to the defiance  of



the law by people who have just gone right ahead to

build  these  houses, and exploit  the  unfortunate

people who are short of housing, without submitting

plans,  without trying to subdivide  the  land  and

provide proper drainage or roads. They just  go  on

to  the  land and build. There are now today  about

9,000  to  10,000  of  such  houses  and  they  are

inhabited  by people who have paid from  $3,000  to

$8,000  per  house,  the price depending  upon  the

distance  from the main road. In addition  to  this

cash payment, they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1558</b></font><br><br>



have  to sign leases of 20 to 30 years, under which

they have to pay to the owner of the land or to the

lessee (the developer) $10 or $15 per month, and at

the  end of the period they will have to vacate the

land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have studied the position carefully because

many  people  have come to ask me to  try  and  get

these  houses approved by the City Council  or  the

Rural  Board.  I  have spent much  time  going  and

seeing these houses and interviewing the people who

have  bought  them.  From my own investigations,  I

have found that the illegal speculator has made  at

least $2,000 per house, and taking an average, say,

of  $2,000 per house on 10,000 houses, these people

have  cleared a fortune of $20 million. No  wonder,

Sir,  this racket is now spreading like wild  fire,

and  hundreds  of such houses are  going  up  every

week. No one can be so blind as not to notice  them

on  the roadside in the course of construction, row

after row and street after street. If you will only

take  the trouble to look behind these houses,  you

will  see  rows  and  rows  going  right  into  the

hinterland. What better business can you have  than

this one? It is better than running a gambling farm

or even smuggling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the dreadful part of it is this. When these

operators run out of land, which they have obtained

with  the consent of the owners, they simply go  on

to any vacant land and build without the permission

of the owners. We know two or three cases where the

owners  protested; they took action, and  a  murder

was  attempted. These operators protect  themselves

by  making purchasers sign receipts that the houses

have been built by the purchaser at his request. To

my  astonishment,  there are many  people  who  are

willing to pay for such flimsy houses which require

constant  repair,  without  light  or  water,   and

sometimes  no drainage, and they are liable  to  be

pulled down over their ears.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine the legal aspect as I see it. The

owner of the land and the speculator have committed

three offences under the law. First, by subdividing

the  land  without  the approval of  the  Competent

Authority; secondly, by granting a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1559</b></font><br><br>



lease  of more than seven years without subdividing

the  land; and thirdly, by building houses  without

approved  plans.  For each of these  offences,  the

builder  is  liable to a fine of $1,000,  and/or  a

fine  of  $50 a day for a continuing offence  until

the  houses are demolished. Sir, this is  indeed  a

severe  punishment and I understand some owners  of

the  land  and  some speculators have already  been

before  the  Courts, but this is  not  all.  In  my

humble opinion, there is no legal liability for any

of  the occupiers or tenants of such illegal houses

to  pay the $10 or $15 rent under the lease, for it

is  a fundamental principle of law that anyone  who

comes  to Court for justice must have clean  hands,

and  I cannot see any Court granting judgment or  a

writ  of distress to people on contracts which  are

based  on  such  breaches of  the  law.  The  legal

position is that if such tenants, who have  already

been  extorted  to  the tune of $2,000  to  $5,000,

refuse to pay any further for the right to stay  in

their houses, they cannot be brought to Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must now face the situation squarely. Are

we  to  punish  those people who have  parted  with

their savings because they were so desperate for  a

house that they have had to pay for something which

they  knew  to be of no value, taking the  risk  of

being  prosecuted in Court and having their  houses

demolished? Are we not in part to blame for it?  If

the Singapore Improvement Trust had not broken down

in  its  programme in 1955 and 1956, many of  these

people would have got a roof over their heads. What

have  we done to discourage the unscrupulous people

from  flouting the law? Clearly, Sir, no government

in  power and none of us in this House can have the

heart  to  see  10,000  families  thrown  into  the

streets. It is a situation which we must accept but

which   must   not   be   aggravated   under    any

circumstances.  The situation is like  a  reservoir

that  has  burst  its  darn. There  is  no  way  of

stopping  the  raging torrent. We can only  control

its  course or contain it by letting the flood  run

into proper sites.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore make the following suggestions. First,

accept  illegal  houses which were constructed  and

inhabited prior to the 31st of December, 1958.  All

such houses, except those which have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>



built  against the wishes of the owner of the land,

should   be   given  temporary  permits.  Secondly,

encourage  and  approve  with  all  possible  speed

schemes   of  private  building  estates  for   the

construction  of  low-cost houses  for  sale  under

$6,000. Thirdly, use all the land that is earmarked

for  satellite  towns  in the areas  of  Woodlands,

Sembawang  and  Jurong for subdivision  into  small

lots,  and sell it to the people who will  then  be

able  to  build  their  own  houses  according   to

approved  plans.  Fourthly, take drastic  steps  to

prevent  any  further attemps to build  after  this

year by imposing maximum fines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, punishment is not enough. Such illegal

development must be contained, and it can  be  done

if   the  Government  acquire  land  around   these

settlements  and then proceed to cut up  this  land

into  small  lots  after providing  drains,  roads,

light and water. These lots can then be sold to the

people  who will have houses to live in.  By  doing

this,  you will have stopped the extension of these

illegal  houses and will have saved private  owners

from  the  headache  of putting watchmen  on  their

land.



<br><br>11.45 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reaction to my proposal will be that it

infringes upon the Master Plan, but this is not so.

It  is  provided for under the Report of  the  Land



Clearance and Resettlement Working Party issued  as

Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 27 of 1956. At page 13,  I

read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is emphasised that considerable reliance is

placed in the Master Plan on the continued erection

of  temporary dwellings on `tolerated' sites in the

Urban  Area and on rural resettlement in the  Rural

Area.  They make a significant contribution to  the

overall   housing   problem,  and   the   estimated

requirement of 10,000 permanent houses a year to be

built to solve the housing problem over the next 20

years,  which  is a basic assumption of  the  Plan,

would have to be revised if this contribution  were

not made."



<br><br>There  is  under this paragraph a table giving  the

names  of  16 kampongs where such houses  could  be

built  together  with  areas  and  the  numbers  of

families  which can be housed. I do not propose  to

read the figures, but I would like hon. Members  to

hear  the  names of the Kampongs: 1-Heap Guan  San;

2-Radin



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1561</b></font><br><br>



Mas;  3-Geylang Serai (Malay Farm); 4-Bukit  Arang;

5-Bartley   Road;  6-Chantek;  7-Bukit   Theresa;

8-Woodleigh; 9-Kallang Pudding; 10-Bedok;  11-Paya

Lebar;  12-Tampenis; 13-Serangoon; 14-Jalan Eunos;

15-MacPherson  Road  South; and  16-Wak  Tanjong,

covering an area of just over 2,000 acres  where  a

population  of  nearly 100,000  already  live,  and

where  there is a site capacity for a future  9,000

families  which  is  about the number  of  families

already  settled  there  by  this  illegal  housing

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be noticed then that most of these

houses  have  been built in the "tolerated"  sites,

and if the developers had chosen to bide their time

and  submit plans to the Competent Authority, these

houses   would  have  been  approved;   but   being

unscrupulous businessmen they could not  afford  to

wait  for the time. It has taken me, in some cases,

nearly  two  years to have plans approved  for  100

houses, and at that rate, for 10,000 houses it will

take an eternity. Therefore, who can blame them for

building before the plans are approved?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why should we then not decide to accept the

houses  already built, but from now to decide  that

anyone who chooses to try and build houses for  the

public must conform with the law and provide houses

at  a  reasonable price and not at an  extortionate

price?  The  time  is now ripe because  I  consider

illegal  houses  have reached a  saturation  point.

Some  builders are finding difficulty in  disposing



of hastily built houses. Buyers are more selective.

Now  is the time to move in and build a dam so that



the  torrent which has now subsided should  not  be

allowed  to run wild again. Let us give  notice  to

intending breakers of the law that after the end of

this  year we shall no longer tolerate any  further

action  to build without plans being approved.  Are

we  so  blind that we cannot make use of the  clear

indication given by these 10,000 houses? They  show

that people will help themselves if Government will

not,  that they do not have to be pampered and live

in ten-storey flats with modern facilities; that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1562</b></font><br><br>



the Government do not have to spend $60 million  on

Singapore  Improvement  Trust  houses,  and   after

having spent $60 million, to have to subsidise half

the  rent again, thereby running into many millions

more. They show that the people are prepared to pay

thousands  of  dollars for a  shack,  maintain  and

repair  it,  and live for years without  light  and

water   and  even  drainage.  All  they   want   is

Government  to  provide the land,  subdividing  and

selling it to them in small lots, and they will  do

the  rest. By using a revolving fund of $1 million,

Government will not have to spend a single cent  to

enable  another 10,000 houses to be built by people

who  are  only  too  anxious and  waiting  to  help

themselves.  Sir,  this $1 million  can  easily  be

raised by selling some of the Singapore Improvement

Trust flats to the people who live in them and  who

can  well afford to pay. I believe there is a block

built  for the particular purpose of being sold  to

tenants. I think it was at Dawson Road. Surely that

block should be sold to provide the money for  this

scheme.  This  is not the first time  that  I  have

brought  to the attention of this House  this  very

difficult  position. It has caused me  considerable

worry.  I have spent much time and trouble studying

the  whole position and I think I have presented  a

case  to  this House which is reasonable and  which

can be accepted by all Members.

him  to  continue,  as I take it  that  housing  is

remotely   connected  with  this  grant   for   the

elected a representative of the people in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1563</b></font><br><br>



1950  to this very day, the main work that  I  have

got  to  do for the people of Singapore, especially

in  my  ward,  is to get housing accommodation  for

them.  I  have  been  a constant  nuisance  to  the

Singapore   Improvement   Trust,   visiting    them

practically every week and trying to find  out  for

those  who have applied for accommodation  for  the

last  three or four years, whether they  could  get

it,  and the answer that I receive week in and week

out  is practically the same, "Be patient, and  you

might  hear  some favourable results  in  the  near

future."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Singapore Improvement Trust has not

been successful in tackling the housing problem. As

has  been said by the Member for Paya Lebar, we now

see  a  lot of illegal houses being built, in spite

of  the fact that the people who buy them and  live

in  them know very well that there is no likelihood

of  staying  in them permanently. This  shows  very

clearly  that there is a pressing need for housing.

I am just wondering why, apart from the suggestions



put  up  by the Member for Paya Lebar - that  is,  to

legalise  these  illegal  buildings;  to  encourage

private enterprise to build low-cost housing of not

more  than  $6,000; and to sell some of the  S.I.T.

houses - Government  has not also considered  raising



loans from the public. Is it because Government  is

afraid  that if a loan were to be raised, it  would

receive  the  same  response as  the  City  Council

received   some  time  back,  Sir?  Personally,   I

maintain  that in spite of the criticisms  made  by

Members   of  the  Opposition,  this  is   a   good

Government  and  it has got the confidence  of  the

people. I believe that if a loan were to be raised,

it   would  be  fully  subscribed,  if  not   over-subscribed.  The  people of  Singapore,  especially

those  in responsible positions, have a high  sense

of duty and any stable Government's project to help

the  lower income group in a big way will have  the

support of these people because, if they have made

their money in Singapore, I am quite sure they will

consider  it  their  duty to  help  the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Sir, that the Government, which is asking

for  $7 million, will not stop at that but that  it

will find ways



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1564</b></font><br><br>



and  means of providing more houses for the  people

of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

looking  at  Head D22, I am surprised  at  the  low

figure that is earmarked for housing for next year.

According to the Estimates, the amount approved for



the three schemes totals over $91 million. In 1957,

$30 million was paid out; this year, $21 million is

to  be paid out; but for next year the amount to be

paid  out is only estimated at $7 million. I cannot

see  why  this  figure should be reduced  from  $30

million  in 1957 to $21 million this year and  then

to  $7 million for next year. It appears to me that

the  S.I.T. is not pushing ahead with its  housing

schemes  and  that it is rather backward  with  its

housing schemes. To combat this, I am glad that the

Minister  has  made  an  announcement  in   today's

Singapore  Standard that the Government will  build

low-cost  houses.  I quote from  today's  Singapore

Standard:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Singapore Government will early next year sell

100  low-cost houses to Malays whose monthly income

is below $400."



<br><br>12.00 noon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very good news indeed because this will

help quite a number of people, who have applied for

S.I.T. houses,  to be housed under  this  low-cost

housing scheme. But I am disappointed that this low-cost housing is only for the benefit of the Malays.

I  would prefer that the Government, in introducing



this  scheme,  looks  after the  interests  of  all

communities rather than only one community, because

the  Government  is responsible  to  the  whole  of

Singapore and not to just one particular community.

As  I say, if this scheme is open for allotment  to



everybody  then  everybody will have  a  chance  to

apply for these houses at low cost. At the moment I

am  told  that  there are more than 14,000  on  the

waiting list for houses. How is the S.I.T. going to

house  all  these 14,000, when only $7  million  is

earmarked for next year? This is really too slow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S.I.T. has been attacked on many occasions for

its  allocation  system. A  special  committee  was

recently  set up to call for suggestions  from  the

public, Assemblymen and City Councillors, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1565</b></font><br><br>



all  other organizations and political Parties.  It

is  very disappointing to note that only 21 sent in

suggestions for allocation of houses. If there  are

criticisms  against the S.I.T., it is the  duty  of

the    critics   to   send   in   suggestions   for

consideration. I cannot understand why  the  public

or  political  organisations are not interested  in

making any suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only hope that, with the introduction of

this new scheme, it will beat the racket of illegal

houses, as quoted by the Member for Paya Lebar.  It

is  a known fact that illegal houses have sprung up

everywhere - in the Amber Road area, in  the  Bartley

Road  area, and many other places. Cases have  gone

to  Court,  as  quoted in the papers recently,  and

certainly  I agree with the Member for  Paya  Lebar

that it is not the occupants who break the law, but

the racketeers. Unfortunately, the law is such that

although  the  buildings  of  the  racketeers   are

considered  to be illegal, the landowner,  ignorant

of  the  law,  is  also brought to Court.  This  is

really   unfair.   When  the   City   Council   was

considering  the question of housing in  the  attap

areas, which was reported in the newspapers, a  few

racketeers  get  themselves together  and  started

building  houses either on their  own  land  or  on

other  people's land. As quoted by the  Member  for

Paya  Lebar,  these  unscrupulous  racketeers  take

advantage by selling these illegally erected houses

to  people who are looking for houses and  who  are

prepared  to move in, not knowing that  the  houses

are  illegal.  And when these people apply  to  the

Council   for   assessment  after  a  few   months'

occupation,  they  realise that  these  houses  are

illegal, and the poor tenants are thus victimised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot see why the Government should not stamp

it  out  now.  As the Member for Paya  Lebar  said,

"This  is now the time to step in and stop  further

illegal   houses."   He  has  put   forward   three

suggestions one of which is: accept illegal  houses

which were constructed and inhabited prior to  31st

December, 1958. All such houses, except those which

have been built against the wishes of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1566</b></font><br><br>



the  owner  of the land, are to be given  temporary

permits.  I fully agree with him, but not with  the

date, because there are about 12 to 13 days between

now  and  31st December, and when this debate  gets

into  the papers after today's sitting, and if  the

Government really considers this scheme acceptable,

I am afraid the operators will again start building

illegal  houses within this short period.  We  have

known that such houses can be built within a day or

two or overnight, as in the case of Amber Road.  So

within  these  12 days if about 100 houses  can  be

built  overnight, we will find another few thousand

houses  springing up within this short  period.  We

should  take  action against those who build  after

today, and that is quite fair. We have relaxed  the

law so much that such operations have been going on

and  on, and I think the Government should stop  it

as from today. Only then are we able to protect the

occupants  of  such  illegal houses.  They  had  to

borrow money to buy them and, after having borrowed

money  to  pay for them, they find that the  houses

and  the  land do not belong to them, nor can  they

stay  in  the houses. If the Government  is  really

accepting  this scheme, I hope it will not  be  the

31st  of December, 1958, but it will be from today,

and  drastic  action should be taken against  those

who build houses as from today onwards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar said that a fine is not

sufficient. I agree. What is the use of imposing  a

fine  on  a  man who puts up a house illegally  and

benefited  by  it by a few thousand dollars?  Apart

from  the  fine,  the house should  be  demolished.

Concrete action should be taken, not on paper only,



or  mere words. If a demolition order is issued  by

the Court, action should immediately follow and the

house  pulled down. But for those who have  already

received demolition orders, as quoted by the Member

for  Paya Lebar, I hope the Government will try  to

introduce  something so that  the  Court  could  be

given  the  powers  to  withdraw  those  demolition

orders and that they be given assessment, or  given

the authority to stay. This requires



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1567</b></font><br><br>



some  amendment  to  the law, and  I  do  hope  the

Government will consider taking quick action to  do

so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Housing made a statement to the Singapore Standard, which I now quote from that

paper of today's date:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said that as far as the Malays were concerned,

Singapore Improvement Trust houses are a failure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of them, he said, could not afford to

pay the rent for S.I.T. houses."



<br><br>But  where I am concerned, I think the S.I.T. is  a

complete  and a total failure. It is not only  the

Malays  who consider the S.I.T. a failure, but  all

the   communities  in  Singapore - the  Chinese,  the

Malays,  the  Indians,  everyone  who  requires   a

house - consider the S.I.T. is a complete failure. So

the  sooner the Housing Authority comes into being,

the better it is for all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang (Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Mr Tan Theng Chiang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  have listened to the hon. Member for  Paya

Lebar's views with great interest, because they are

of considerable merit and because my Ministry is in

fact  already working along lines similar to  those

he  has  outlined. As my Ministry is in  charge  of

housing,  Sir, I am still convinced that  the  best

policy  for Government in the long run will  be  to

provide  permanent housing, as the  saving  in  the

cost  of  repairs  and maintenance will  eventually

offset the additional expense of erecting permanent

buildings  and  as in "land-short"  Singapore,  the

maximum ultilization of land is desirable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in view of the present economic

situation, limiting the number of permanent  houses

which  can be built, and on the other hand,  taking

into  account  the alarming number of  unauthorised

temporary houses that have sprung up, it has become

clear  that a fresh approach to the problem has  to

be  made. Our main problem, therefore, is  how  the

present  monies  allocated  for  housing  can  most

profitably be used for permanent housing needs,  as

well as take account of this emergency situation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1568</b></font><br><br>



The  present policies my Ministry is following  and

the  new  approaches being explored to  solve  this

problem are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squatters on land required for permanent

development    are   either   offered    S.I.T. accommodation  or,  alternatively,   they   are

offered  a plot of land and a temporary  house.

One  of  the  hon.  Member's  solutions  is  an

extension   of  this  alternative   scheme   of

resettlement;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is now working on a small pilot

scheme,  whereby  Government will  provide  the

main  services  including road  access,  layout

into building lots and will invite applications

from the public;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion of facilitating the private

development  of  low-cost  housing  is  already

being   studied.   This   involves   two   main

proposals:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) S.I.T. planning approval in respect of densities, layout, sub-division, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) local authority approval in respect of building requirements laid down in the

building by-laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member may be aware of a prototype scheme

which  is already under consideration, having  been

carefully    examined   by   both   the   Singapore

Improvement Trust and the Rural Board. We shall  be

better able to judge the merits of this scheme once

it has been completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member will appreciate that temporary

solutions  often give rise to greater  problems  in

the  long  run. Minimum standards of density,  open

space, community requirements would also have to be

agreed  in  each case. There are also fire,  health

and  social hazards to be considered. Access roads,

layouts  and building standards are also important.

It  is  essential that the greatest  care  must  be



taken unless we want to add to our problems instead

of solving them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my foregoing remarks, I hope that the hon.

Member for Paya Lebar can feel assured that housing

in   all  its  aspects  is  receiving  the  closest

attention by my Ministry and that his views will be

followed up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in reply to criticisms about the delays in

respect  of applications for approval of  plans,  I

wish  to  tell hon. Members in this House that  all

applications received up to 19th March,  1958,  are

being  dealt  with  on  6th May,  1958,  and  those

received on 1st April are being dealt with by  20th

May. The latest lot that the S.I.T. received on 8th

October are being dealt with on 4th November.  Sir,

from  these,  hon.  Members will  know  that  plans

received by the S.I.T. are now dealt with with  the

minimum delay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the hon. Member for Queenstown, I have

to  tell  him that the $7 million estimated  to  be

paid  in  1959 is a standstill figure, and we  have

got  $2 million more in addition to this $7 million

estimated  for  1959, and it  is  up  to  the  next

Government to plan for any additional expenditure.

less  than the previous year for housing.  Although

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the

interval  I was reminded by a Member of this  House

that  I  should have read the Budget and the Budget

speech.  I  have  read the Budget  and  the  Budget

speech.   I   realise  the  difficulties   of   the

Government,  the difficulty of geting more  revenue

and  the  difficulty of meeting more urgent  needs,

such  as  education, medical and other necessities.

If we cannot allot more money to housing, that does



not  mean that we can just forget about it. We must

start  finding some remedy to improve the situation

where  practicable.  When we mention  housing,  the

people  of  Singapore automatically  think  of  the

Singapore    Improvement   Trust.   The   Singapore

Improvement Trust has two duties to perform - one  is

housing and the other is planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen the Singapore Standard this morning,

where the Minister for Local Government, Lands  and

Housing  was  quoted  as saying  that,  as  far  as

housing  for the Malays is concerned, the Singapore

Improvement Trust is a failure. I would like to  go

further  than that. As far as housing in  Singapore

is concerned, the Singapore Improvement Trust is a,

failure.  When I say that, Sir, I do not mean  that

the houses being put up are bad. What they have put

up is, I think, as good as is expected of them. But

the  Singapore Improvement Trust is  not  the  only

body  which  can  carry out housing development  in

Singapore.  Other countries which do  not  have  an

organisation  like the Singapore Improvement  Trust

manage  to solve their housing problem. The private

individuals  of  Singapore  have  also  contributed

towards  solving the housing problem. If I remember

correctly, Sir, I think the number of buildings put

up  by private individuals is more or less what the

Singapore Improvement Trust has built in all  these

years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1571</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach of the Singapore Improvement Trust

to the housing problem is entirely wrong. It thinks

of  ideals. If we can, we all like to have  ideals.

But  if we cannot, let us be practical. Housing  is



one  of the three primary necessities of life.  The

other two are, of course, clothing and food.  If  a

person cannot find a nice flat in which to stay, he

ought  to  be satisfied with a room. If  he  cannot

even  get a room, then he should be satisfied with,

say,  a shack or a portion of a shack. If he cannot

get even that, then he should be prepared to accept

even a shed, whether there is any enclosure or not.

On that question, I think the Singapore Improvement



Trust's policy as regards housing is a failure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this island, Sir, there are hundreds and

thousands  of  attap  huts. I do  not  think  these

people  would like to stay in them. On the question

of attap houses, Singapore is not the only example.

All  over  Malaya, in fact, most countries  of  the



world  have  this  problem.  I  do  not  think  any

country, however fortunate it may be, can say there

are  enough houses for its people. I have mentioned

the  example of housing in Hongkong some months ago

in  this House. I was told by the Minister that  is

not  good for Singapore. I have personally examined

those  buildings,  and I have also  examined  those

shacks  built by them before they vacated to  these

apartments,  with  some of  the  Ministers  of  the

Federation. I do agree that living in one room in a

block  of  flats with five or six storeys  with  no

elevators,  is  not  ideal  for  anyone,   and   if

possible,  we should never do it. But necessity  is

really  important  in this matter.  If  you  cannot

afford  to  let  them have bigger flats,  with  one

bedroom,  one  sitting  room,  or  even  when   the

bathroom and W.C. are attached, then they should at

least have a room where they can be protected  from

the  weather.  That is the reason why the  Hongkong

Government  put up those flats. That is the  reason

why the housing officers in Hongkong told me to  do

the same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, there are 15,000 people on the waiting list

for  houses,  and there is no chance  in  the  near

future that they all could be satisfied. So,  as  I

said, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1572</b></font><br><br>





must  try to find some other solution that can ease

this  housing  shortage. I think I can  safely  say

that  I have been studying the housing problem  for

the last twenty years. Whenever I visit any foreign

countries,  whether  in the East  or  the  West  or

anywhere  else, my primary concern has always  been

housing.  Although I am an architect, I  take  more

interest in trying to solve the problem of the poor

man,  by trying to find out how we can provide  him

with  the maximum shelter which he can afford, than

the problem of how to make the millionaires' houses

more beautiful. The millionaire's house may be less

beautiful  but he will not suffer as  much  as  the

poor man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in this respect, the question of housing the

poor   is  always  close  to  my  heart.  From   my

experience for the last twenty years, it  seems  to

me  that  the officers of the Singapore Improvement

Trust  who  are responsible for planning  are  more

concerned  with  how  to make the  gardens  of  the

millionaires beautiful, rather than how to meet the

necessities  of  the poor man. They possibly  think

that  the  sweat of the poor man could  contaminate

the air which the millionaire breathes, and as they

are  there to protect the millionaires and not  the

people  of Singapore, they must turn down  whatever

reasonable  schemes are submitted  by  the  people.

They  are not the officers of the people. They  are



there  to protect vested interests! They are  there

to  protect  the  millionaires' gardens!  They  are

there  to protect the investors! Even today, having

a  small house or a semi-detached house next  to  a

bungalow is considered a disgrace to them. It would

automatically   bring  down  the  value   of   that

district. Such is the type of officers we  have  in

the Singapore Improvement Trust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can say, Sir, that personally they have done me

no wrong. But I am not here to speak for myself.  I

am  here to speak for the people, and as far as the

people  are concerned, all these officers  can  go.

When carrying out their duties, they may think,  "I



have  created a few ideal towns. I have a few ideal

planning schemes." They might even get some  medals

from the Town Planning



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1573</b></font><br><br>



Institute. But I can assure the officers  concerned

that  these medals which they may have are  stained

with  the  blood of the people of Singapore.  Their

children  would be only too pleased to get  rid  of

them  as a reminder of their forefathers' crime  to

the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you ask the S.I.T. officers concerned, "What

is wrong with my plan? Why do you not approve it?",

they  will reply, "It is not we who do not approve

it. It is the Committee appointed by the Governor."

I  do not know under what qualifications these  so-called committees have been appointed. But to me  I

can  only conclude that they are appointed  because

they know nothing about housing so that they can be

fooled by the officers of the Singapore Improvement

Trust. I am not exaggerating when I say this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, I wish to quote a case which

occurred  only two weeks ago. I attended a  meeting

to  consider  some of the plans. They  concerned  a

semi-detached house in Holland Road.  The  officers

objected to it. Naturally I asked them what was the

objection.  They  said  that  the  area  had   nice

residences,  and  the bungalow was a  semi-detached

house.  I  asked what was wrong with it. They  said

that  it  did not conform to the amenities  of  the

area.  I  asked  them  what  amenities  they   were

referring  to, since opposite there was a graveyard

and  there  were a few bungalows. Then I asked  the

planning  officer at the meeting whether he  agreed

that  the  plan  conformed to the  density  in  the

Master  Plan. He replied that he agreed,  but  said

that  it still did not conform to the amenities  of

the area concerned. So I asked him what he meant by

amenities  and  whether  he  could  explain  to  me

clearly.  He said it was very easy. Since my  house

was   a  semi-detached  one  and  the  others  were

detached  houses,  I  was  not  conforming  to  the

amenities. For example, if a house was a two-storey

building and the other a one-storey building,  that

was  not conforming to the amenities. This was  the

reply  I  received from one of the officers.  So  I

turned round and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>



asked him to consider the whole lot of bungalows at

Meyer  Road  and the six-storey hotel,  whether  he

considered  the six-storey hotel conformed  to  the

amenities  as reflected by the bungalows  in  Meyer

Road. He said no. I was on the point of telling him

that maybe it was because he had been so influenced

by  string-pulling  that  the  word  "amenity"  had

already changed its meaning. But I thought that  it

was no use talking to this type of people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They do not listen to your arguments. As I have

said  before, they have already made up their minds

before you go in. So what is the use of talking?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another case, Sir, I went with the hon. Member

for  Tanjong Pagar. After long consideration,  they

said:  "Well,  I have no objection  now,  but  what

about  the  future? You may change."  That  is  the

attitude you get from the Trust. About the  future,

Sir,  who can foretell? Who can foretell what  will

be  in  10  years' time? Could we have thought,  10

years  ago,  that  we  could  have  such  political

advancement in 1958? We never thought of it. We may

plan, but really there is no way of foretelling the

future.   Such   is  the  type  of   argument   and

obstruction  put  up  by the Singapore  Improvement

Trust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every time I go to Hongkong, I am

stunned - there is so vast a change that I  sometimes

think whether I have gone to the right place.  They

have  apartment houses or flats, as you call  here,

10 and 20 storeys high on the main road. But if you

ever  try  to  put  up  such  sort  of  scheme   in

Singapore, they will ask you first, "Where is  your

car  park?" Even if you tell them, "Oh,  these  are

poor  people; they do not have cars.  They  do  not

need  car  parks", the reply, Sir,  will  be,  "Oh,

these  people will be rich one day. They will  then

have  cars.  Where is your solution?" I told  them,

Sir,  and  we  also  discussed this  fully  in  the

Building  By-laws Revision Committee  in  the  City

Council some years ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of a car park is not the

responsibility of the individual. It is almost  the

universal   practice  all  over   the   world   for

Governments to solve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>



the  question  of car parks. If you  consider  that

there  should be no parking in the streets or  side

streets, then you should prohibit parking.  If  you

are  thinking  of a way to prevent people  parking,

then the only thing to do is to impose a fee on it.

You  find  it  all over America. I  think  you  can



probably find it even in Hawaii.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, money alone is not sufficient to solve the

housing  problem.  We must have  an  atmosphere  in

which  sympathetic consideration is  given  by  the

Government officers concerned. It is then  that  we

can attract not only foreign capital but also a lot

of other capital which is now either in the bank or

somewhere else.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point about the S.I.T. policy. The Member

for  Paya  Lebar  has suggested that  S.I.T. flats

could  be sold to the people staying there and  the

money could be utilised to build more flats.  I  am

strongly in support of that proposal, Sir,If  the

flats  in  town could be sold, why should  not  the

fiats built by the S.I.T. be sold too?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another suggestion I would like to make is this.

Governments  all  over  the world,  especially  the



United  States, are subsidising housing in  another

form.  They have made available to the people loans

at a nominal interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that respect, Sir, we do not only solve the

housing problem of that particular person, but also

it   can   be  used  as  the  best  weapon  against

Communism.  If  a  person  owns  a  house  or  owns

property  here,  I am sure he is more  attached  to

this  country.  He will also have less  hatred  and

enmity towards those who have property and houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know very well, Sir, that we collect a lot of

money  in  the Employees' Provident Fund  from  the

public.  Instead of investing this money  somewhere

else - I do not know whether they have or not, but  I

do  know that a lot of money in Singapore has  been

invested  somewhere else - I would suggest that  this

money  be made available to housing estates towards

solving one of the problems.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1576</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question, Sir, concerns squatters. We

are  very  sympathetic towards them.  Whether  they

have  the  right legally or illegally to the  land,

they  are  there. Although there are some squatters

who  occupy  the land and build houses for  profit,

most of them, however, stay there, not because they

like  to  stay there but because that is  the  only

place  available for them to stay.  The  Government

had  recommended certain scales of compensation for

these  squatters, but every time it approached  the

squatters  with this scheme, it was  always  turned

down in the hope of getting something else. I think

it  is  high time the Government should step in  to

solve  the  squatter problem. Without solving  this

problem, housing estates could not be built. If  it

is   considered  by  the  Government   that   those

developers  should contribute towards the  cost  of

solving such a problem, I am all for it. This is  a

problem that is facing not only the developers  but

the  Government as well. So I think the  Government

should  formulate a policy and try  to  assist  the

developers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Sir, the question of private housing

seemed  to the Government to be a matter not  worth

considering. They would insist on what they wanted,

although  it  could  easily be  relaxed  under  the

circumstances.  So,  in this respect,  I  hope  the

Government will consider all these points,  not  as

points  of  attack but as points of  suggestion.  I

hope the next Government will take heed.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Sir, since

my  hon, friend  has brought  up  Hongkong  as  an

example -  I  was  not  quite sure  whether  he  was

advocating  that Singapore should  adopt  the  same

policies  for  relieving the housing  situation  or

not - but,  since  he has brought it  up,  perhaps  I

might  advise the House of the size of the  problem

in  Hongkong,  with which the Hongkong  authorities

were confronted in comparison with the size of  the

problem here, because I think it is necessary  that

this matter should be put into perspective.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1577</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hongkong, they were faced with an influx of

population  in 1949, 1950 and 1951, of round  about

three-quarters of a million people and they set  up

their  attap  huts and structures, little  leantos,

wherever  they could find a space on the hillsides,

in  the  open areas, on the pavements of the roads,

in the streets and on the rooftops.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 1953, a very severe fire broke out

which   rendered  something  like   50,000   people

homeless.  When  I say homeless, I mean  they  lost

just  the  attap shacks, the leantos in which  they

had been living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was at that stage that the Hongkong Government

decided that it was necessary to take the matter in

hand  in a big way, and in view of the size of  the

problem,  it could only be solved by speed  and  by

providing sub-standard housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squatter resettlement housing units to which

my   hon, friend  has  referred  are  seven-storey

blocks,  and  each floor has communal  bathing  and

latrine facilities, and the rooms are, to the  best

of  my  recollection, 10 ft. by 12 ft. in  which  a

family of five are permitted to live.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they pay a rent of HK$14 a month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this means of putting up substandard basic

subsistence housing, it has been possible  for  the

Hongkong  Government to house at the time  I  left,

about  a  year ago, between a quarter of a  million

and  300,000 people who have been accommodated  and

taken off the streets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the squatter problem still remaining

was  roughly the same number, about a quarter of  a

million  to 300,000, and of those, some  60,000  to

70,000  were squatting on rooftops and  there  were

still a certain number in the streets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do suggest that in considering what has

been  done  in  Hongkong and what is desirable  and

appropriate   for   the   people   of    Singapore,

particularly in regard to the standard of  housing,

it is necessary to remember and put into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1578</b></font><br><br>



perspective the respective problems confronting the

two Governments.

Malaya  monkeys swing from tree to tree with  their

long  prehensile tails. In this Assembly the debate

swings  on from day to day with the long prehensile

tongues of our Assemblymen.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We had some reference to a

monkey  god, I recollect, and now I think the  hon.

Member is drawing a comparison between monkeys  and

Members  of this Assembly. I suggest that  that  is

unparliamentary. The Minister should withdraw  that

comparison.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I will certainly withdraw it, Sir, if

you  think  it is an uncomplimentary comparison  to

make. I was really applauding the vigour with which

this  Assembly pursues the debate and the flood  of

oratory which has been poured forth!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I come to the point I wish to make. I do

not  agree with the attacks made on the S.I.T.  The

matter has been discussed very frequently before. I

would  just  remark  in passing  that,  by  quoting

particular cases, or a selection of cases, you  can

make  anything appear good or anything appear  bad.

You must have a much more thorough examination than



that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what I want to point out are two dangers which

appear  to me to follow possibly from the  sort  of

speeches we have had made about the S.I.T.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if all the faults alleged against the S.I.T.

were  true faults, then we would still need to have



the  services  and  the controls which  the  S.I.T.

provides.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Not these men!



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> It may well be that in any public

service  there  are defects. They are  operated  by

human  beings, and human beings have  defects;  but

you  must  not  sacrifice  the  services  for  that

reason,  particularly in this matter.  The  housing

and development matters of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1579</b></font><br><br>



Singapore are absolutely vital for the poor  people

of  Singapore - for the workers. And they must not be

sacrified  to  ruthless  exploitation  by   private

property and private profit-making interests.  That

is  the thing we have to guard against. That is why

we  have to have controls of all sorts, because the

pressure  of  population on the  land  and  housing

resources   is   so  great  and   the   chance   of

exploitation  is so great that you  must  have  the

best   system  of  controls  you  can.   Inevitably

whenever you have controls, you have people who  do

not  like  them  and there will be hard  cases  and

there  might  even be injustices. This  has  to  be

accepted.  But you cannot do without them  all  the

same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I wish to make is that you must

have public services in Singapore. We have heard  a

great  deal, as democracy has become more  powerful

here, of violent attacks on public servants.  I  am

not   referring  to  expatriates - whether  they  are

European  expatriates,  or Indian  expatriates,  or

Japanese  expatriates or whoever they may  be - I  am

referring  to local boys and girls, educated  here,

born  here, brought up here and serving  here,  and

these  are the people who are now already beginning

to say, "Perhaps I had better move to another place

because this is an intolerable town to work in." If

you  are a public servant, your mouth is shut,  you

cannot  reply and you have got to listen to endless

public  noisy attacks on you. If those  who  attack

our public servants succeed in driving them out  of

the  territory, they will have nothing  to  replace

them with. You cannot replace, at short notice, the

experience  and  skill acquired over  a  period  of

years.  I  do see the most serious danger  that  if

these  attacks go on for the next few years,  there

will   be   a   serious  rundown  in  the   already

hardpressed local officers who have got to carry on

the public services of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I hope that I will  be  allowed  to

clarify   one  point  which  has  been  raised   in

connection with the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been criticised for making only $7 million

available  for  housing this year. I thought,  Sir,

that I had explained the situation when I presented

the   Budget.   There   are  three   reasons.   The

Development   Estimates  provide   only   for   the

completion  of  work in hand. These  reasons  were,

firstly,  the  amount  which we  could  still  make

available from reserves was limited. In the  second

instance, development in the future would  have  to

be  financed mainly from loans, and we did not know

how successful we would be in this respect in 1959.

Lastly,  we  did not wish to tie the hands  of  the



next  government  by  commencing  too  many  costly

public works. These are the reasons why no more was

provided for housing. We merely provided enough  to

allow the S.I.T. to complete the contracts in hand.

It  is not that Government does not appreciate  the



importance of housing. I think the expenditure over

the   past  four  years  indicates  just  how  much

importance Government does attach to housing.  Over

25  per  cent  of  all development expenditure  was

spent   on  housing.  I  am  sure  that  the   next

government will feel much the same way about it  as

the  present  Government. It is  a  most  important

matter.  I  should imagine that one  of  the  first

things that the new Government will do will  be  to

consider    housing   in   connection   with    the

Supplementary Development Estimates which  will  be

put  forward  once they have decided when  and  how

much they will obtain from a loan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I must again draw attention to a

point  which I made before, and that is that,  with

the  best will in the world, it is doubtful if  any

future  government will be able  to  make  as  much

available for housing as we have been able to do in

the  past.  The money will just not  be  there.  It

would therefore be necessary to make what we obtain

for housing go as far as possible, and to think out

alternative and complementary schemes to  meet  the

demand  for  it.  It  is  for  these  reasons  that

Government welcomes all the suggestions which  have

been  made  today. I can assure hon. Member's  that

all  the  suggestions which have been made will  be

examined with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>



great  care. Some of them, of course, have  already

been  examined,  or  are in the  process  of  being

examined  by Government. I have much sympathy  with

some  of the suggestions. I have felt for some time

that we should explore the one-room flatlet concept

more  thoroughly  than we have done.  At  the  same

time, I must point out that our examination of  the

problem to date has indicted that it is not as easy

as  some  hon. Members would suppose. In  point  of

fact,  Sir,  the cost of a one-room  flatlet  which

would  be acceptable to the people of Singapore  is

not very much different from the cost of a two-room

flatlet.  But I think we should examine the  matter

yet  again and again, because I feel there is  some

solution  which will enable us to meet the  housing

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the suggestion from the Member for

Paya  Lebar that we should create a revolving fund,

I  would  like  to be certain that the  fund  would

revolve and that the people who would benefit  from

it  would  be  able  to repay the  sum  which  they

borrowed  from the fund. Even if we could  have  an

assurance on that point, there would still  remain,

at  this  particular point in time, the trouble  of

finding money for the fund. But then again, Sir, if

this  scheme were to offer a part solution  to  the

housing problem, I am sure the Government will go a

very long way to try and provide facilities for the

scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hon. Member did mention that he saw no trouble

in  floating  a loan for housing. With  respect,  I

doubt  whether  that is the case. I think  we  will

find  it extremely hard to float a loan for housing

specifically  and, in any event, Sir, the  proceeds

of  any  loans which we have to float in the future

for development will have to be divided amongst all

the projects to which Government attaches priority;

one of which, of course, is housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another hon. Member, Sir, said that the money

subscribed to the Central Provident Fund should  be

used for housing. I think he also said that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>



money  in the Provident Fund should be invested  in

this  territory. On that latter point, Sir, I  have

every sympathy and I would say that I hope that the

Board of the Provident Fund will in the future  see

their  way to invest rather more locally than  they

have done in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point Sir, I would say that we will

have  to rely to a very great extent on the support

of  the Provident Fund for any future loan which is

floated  in  Singapore and, as I  said,  we  cannot

devote  all  the subscriptions from  that  fund  to

housing.  It  would have to be apportioned  amongst

the  other  projects  to which Government  attaches

importance.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I understand that  the  Member  for

Pasir Panjang has brought up two points. One is the

question of money and the other is the question  of

building standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the allocation of money, I think

the  Hon, the Financial Secretary has  replied  to

that.  With regard to the lowering of standards,  I

think  this  morning  the  Assistant  Minister  has

already  spoken on this point in his reply  to  the

Member  for  Paya  Lebar. The prototype  scheme  is

being  studied  and when it has been completed,  we

shall  be able to come to our conclusions. For  the

purpose  of  this scheme, the standards  are  being

reduced  in many ways. Maximum densities are  being

allowed, and certain local government building  by-laws with regard to room space, height of ceilings,

foundations, roads, drains and sewerage  are  being

waived to agreed standards. However, this scheme is

only  in respect of low-cost housing, that is,  for

houses  which can be sold for not more than $5,000.

This does not mean, of course, that the standard of



all types of houses should be lowered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this morning again, Sir, I think the

Member  for Queenstown did ask why there should  be

preferential  allotment of money  for  housing  the

Malays. Sir, Members are aware of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>



poverty of the members of my community. If we  were

to  look  at  the social strata of  the  people  of

Singapore,  we will find that in the  case  of  the

Chinese community we have the capitalist class, the

professional  class, the upper  middle  class,  the

lower   middle   class   and   the   workers.   The

distribution is the same with regard to the  Indian

community.   But  when  it  comes  to   the   Malay

community, we have no Malay capitalists,  no  Malay

professional  class, no Malay upper  middle  class,

very few in the lower middle class; the majority of

them  are  workers.  In fact, I  can  say  that  in

Singapore 99 per cent of my community come  from  a

class  drawing  a salary of not more  than  $120  a

month. It is for this reason, Sir, that we on  this

side  of the House feel that the time has come  for

Government  to  come  forward and  help  the  Malay

community with regard to housing. Of course, I know

that  there  are also members of other  communities

faced  with the same difficulties, as poverty knows

no  communal  barriers, but  to  them  the  housing

provided  by the Singapore Improvement Trust  built

on  long-term loans, at lower than normal rates  of

interest,  provides  some  relief.  Generally   the

Malays  find the Singapore Improvement Trust houses

unsuited to their requirements, as is evidenced  by

their  very sparse representation in the  Singapore

Improvement  Trust  rentals  and  on  the   housing

register. The Trust tenant is not asked to  provide

any  capital contribution towards his own  housing,

and  it  is  considered equitable  that  the  Malay

settler should be assisted in the provision of such

housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not forget, Sir, with regard to housing in

Singapore,  that  for years now the  Government  of

Singapore   has  spent  millions  of   dollars   on

resettlement  and  compensation; but  there  again,

unfortunately,   the  Malay   community   has   not

benefited at all and I think, Sir, it is  the  duty

of  this  Government, or of any government  in  the

future,  if it wants to be honest and fair to  all,

to  see that every citizen of Singapore gets a fair

share of the country's wealth.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid

that  the  Minister has misunderstood what  I  said

this  morning. As a matter of fact, I congratulated

the  Government for introducing such a  scheme  for

the  Malay community. What I said this morning  was

that  I  would be far happier if the same  type  of

scheme  could  be offered to all other  communities

instead   of   introducing  it  for  a   particular

community.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Financial Secretary gave reasons

that  the Government did not want to tie the  hands

of  the  next  government when  budgeting  only  $7

million   for  housing  next  year.  By   such   an

explanation,  do  I  take it that  whilst  this  $7

million  was  provided for in the Budget,  he  took

into  consideration  the life  of  this  Government

which  may be up to next April or the life  of  the

S.I.T. which  may  be a matter  of  two  or  three

months, or is it budgeted for a whole year?  If  it

is  for  a  whole  year, then that  $7  million  is

inadequate.  I  would also like to  know  how  many

housing  units  will  this $7  million  provide  in

Scheme No. 6. Scheme No. 7 and Scheme No. 8.

<br><br>3.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Singapore Improvement Trust have been tackling  the

problem  of  housing and planning. They have  asked

the  public  to  come forward, as  the  Member  for

Queenstown said, to help them in the allocation  of

houses. I have received such an invitation,  but  I

have declined to appear. The reason is very simple.

With   so   very  few  houses  and  with  so   many



applicants, it is just impossible to allocate  them

to  all  the applicants. No matter how  much  of  a

genius  you  are,  you cannot  solve  that  problem

satisfactorily if you do not have enough houses. It

is  like in a state of famine - you have two bags  of

rice to feed a population of 10,000 people, and you

are invited to distribute the rice as best you can.

No  matter  how  it goes, there will  be  a  larger



number  of people going hungry, and only a few  are

satisfied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I view the problem of housing in a general way. If

the  S.I.T. were  efficient  in  its  housing  and

planning,  the  housing problem  would  not  be  so

acute.  If  it  cannot build enough  houses,  I  am

certain  that  private enterprise could  have  been

encouraged  by  the  Trust  to  help  build  enough

houses. The failure of the Trust can be seen by the

fact that more than 10,000 unauthorised houses have

sprung up. There are a few reasons given for  this.

One  is  that  anybody who wants to build  a  house



finds  it very irksome to go to the S.I.T. to  ask

for  their  plans to be approved. In fact,  in  the

minds  of  the people of Singapore, or anybody  who

wants  to  build a house, the building and planning

authorities  of the S.I.T. are more an  obstruction

to them than a help! In fact, many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>



of  them, when told, "If you want to build a little

house,  you  must first go to this  department  and

then to the S.I.T., and then come back again to the

other  department," feel, "Well, this is  too  much

for  us.  We will rather put up a house in any  old

way  possible.  We  will face the consequences.  We

will  appear  in Court after receiving the  summons

and  we will happily pay our fines and live in  our

houses."  Now  such has been the  attitude  of  the

people  and,  in many instances, I  regret  to  say

personal experience has borne out that fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Planning Department and the Housing

Authority had been sympathetic with the public (one

of  the  officers in the Planning Section  is  very

helpful   to  the  public)  the  public  would   be

encouraged. Now I will say what is the attitude  of

this  particular officer that the  people  want  to

praise him for? You go to him with a problem and he

tells  you what the situation is. He goes  further,

and  advises you as to the many ways in  which  you

can  utilize  your land or alter your  building  or

whatever  it  is to dovetail with the Master  Plan.

Now,  that  officer has the support of  the  people



generally.  Sir, not all officers in Government  or

in  the Trust are condemned by the people. No, Sir.

Many  are  praised. We have heard in this  Assembly



praises  going  out  to so many of  the  Government

officers.  Of  course, if there are praises,  there

must  be grouses too. I would say that if a  grouse

comes from one or two individuals about one or  two

civil  servants,  we will say that  their  view  is

probably  biased;  they probably  have  an  axe  to

grind.  But  if  it is the general opinion  of  the

people of Singapore, whether supported by facts  or

not,  there  must be something wrong! I  am  not  a

builder or a developer. I have not put up houses of

my own, except public institutions, and yet I speak

in  this trend not for anything else but merely  to

point  out to Government that if there is a grouse,

that   grouse   must   be  investigated.   In   all

probability,  it  might be justified,  and  if  the

people  are  satisfied with Government departments,

work  can be done more smoothly. I am certain  that

with more people like the Planning Officer I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>



mentioned just now, Singapore can build houses much

more rapidly than we can imagine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that sometimes it is very difficult for us

to  say  whether  the Planning  Department  is  the

authority for education, or the Education  Ministry

is  the  authority! I have had a case of  a  school

which  has  to  go  through that  department.  This

happened to be in the rural area - the burial  ground

at  Tan Tock Seng Hospital. According to the Master

Plan,  if  you have one acre of land, you can  only

have five classrooms and no more. I happened to  be

a  Member  of the Select Committee on the Education

Bill,  and  I remember the Minister said,  "We  are

very  short of playing fields and when this  matter

comes   up,  we  will  consider  every  case   most

sympathetically." I remember this clearly,  because

I had his assurance before I withdrew my amendment.

Then we have cases where the Government agree,  and



even the S.I.T. agree. I know that it stares us  in

the  face - the school at Coleman Street with  little

playground  is  allowed  to  carry  on   with   its

building.  We know that there is another school  in

Telok  Ayer  Street that is allowed  to  run,  with

practically  no  playground  at  all.   These   are

Government-aided  schools. Yet I  know  of  another

school,  a  Government school, the Stamford  Girls'

School that is built on land with almost no playing

field. And yet when any plan goes to the S.I.T. for

a  school building, they insist on large tracts  of

land as playground for a school, either in town  or

in  the rural areas. I fail to see eye to eye  with

them,  and I fail to see where the co-operation  is

between the Trust and the Ministry of Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now with so many unauthorised hr uses coming up in

the rural areas, Sir, I think there is also another

reason,  and that is because the public are  house-hungry. They are prepared to pay anything in  order

to  have  a  roof  over  them.  This  situation  is

created,  of  course,  as you  know,  by  the  slow

planning  and  slow  passing  of  plans,  and  this

situation is also exploited by many people. I  know

that landowners with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>



large  estates  will not stop at exploiting  people

who  want to build houses. I know that they  charge

something like $800 for permission to be  given  to

the  person wanting to build a house, say, 20  feet

by 40 feet; or they give that permission based on a

fee of a dollar per square foot. The builder has no

alternative. He has no money to pay for a big piece

of  land, because land is always sold in big  lots.

And   he  has  to  build.  Again  he  comes  across



difficulties  with  the authorities.  He  dare  not

build his house. Therefore, the racketeers come  in

to  cash  in on such difficulties. That problem  is

created  by difficulties experienced by the  people

wanting  to  build their own houses. The racketeers

come  in, build the houses and tell them that  they

have   been   passed  by  the  proper  authorities,

otherwise  they would not be there.  Money  changes

hands  and  the  person living in the  unauthorised

house, of course, will receive a summons. He  faces

the consequences, not the builder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have advocated in this House many times the

allocation  of  land for people  wanting  to  build

their  own  houses. I remember on many occasions  I

have  related what the squatters did -  they  banded

themselves together to pay the land, as in the case

of  the  Union  Housing Estate in Upper  Serangoon,

where  they got together and bought the  land  from

the  landowner. They subdivided the land into  lots

amongst  themselves and built their own  houses  or

improved  the  houses  that were  existing  on  the

estate.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support, Sir, the move made by the Member for

Paya  Lebar  to  get  the  Government  to  have   a

revolving  fund to buy land for attap dwellers.  If

an  attap dweller or anybody wants to pay a  dollar

per  square  foot for land on which  permission  is

given  to  him to build, then I see no  reason  why

anybody who wants to build cannot buy that piece of

land  from  Government at $1,000 or $2,000 - probably

not  at $1 per square foot, but at fifty cents  per

square foot. It will help when the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>



people  have the land, for then they will  dare  to

sink in their money. There will then be less grouse

about this housing shortage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always advocated that Government should

help  the  people to help them solve their  housing

problem.  If we have little plots of land laid  out

properly,  plans  put  up simply  and  easily,  and

passed  quickly by the authorities, it  will  go  a

very  long  way  towards  helping  the  people   of

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think all

hon.  Members will agree with me that we are deeply

impressed  by  the  Minister for Local  Government,

Lands  and  Housing for his emotional  and  sincere

reply   about  providing  houses  for   the   Malay

community. If I am not mistaken, this Government is

unfortunately only responsible to the Assembly, and

the  Assembly  does not have direct  administrative

control  over the planning and housing problems  of

the   S.I.T.   Therefore,  the  responsibility   is

unfortunately  in  the hands of the  energetic  and

sympathetic  Minister for Local  Government,  Lands

and  Housing,  who  is close to  the  mass  of  the

people.   If  I  may  use  an  English  proverb - the

tackling of the housing problem up to the last  few

years  has  been just like putting the cart  before

the  horse. Everything was done to provide for  the

middle class. The middle class, in the mind of  the

City planner, is a very important group; they are a

stabilising  factor in our country;  and  therefore

all housing projects (although the taxpayers' money

has  been  expended  for this  purpose)  have  been

concentrated  on building houses and providing  for

the convenience of the middle class. Sir, I hate to

term  this  the old colonial policy, but  it  looks

exactly  like  a  colonial policy. It  is  entirely

removed  from the poor masses, who cry  out  for  a

little  security and to be able to  live  in  attap

houses. But they do not get the chance despite  the

efforts   of   the   hard-working   Department   of

Information  Services  Officers  who  have   issued

pamphlets  and  pictures to  publicise  the  Master

Plan.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1591</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am telling the truth. The kampong folks,

whether they are Malays or Chinese, are farmers  or

fishermen. They just could not care less for the so-called  Master Plan. What do multi-storey buildings

mean to them? Nothing! They know they cannot afford

to  pay  the rent to live in them. I wonder whether

the  Minister  has any figures at  hand  so  as  to

inform this House of the number of eviction notices

that have been served by the S.I.T. authorities  on

those  tenants who have failed to pay  their  rent.

How  many  summonses have they served? Why?  It  is



just because these tenants cannot afford to pay the

rent.   The  Minister  will  say  that  there   are

thousands of people who are on the waiting list for

houses, and if the tenants cannot pay the rent they

must  quit.  The Government do not care where  they

go.  The  S.I.T. authorities  serve  the  eviction

notices,  and if the tenants fail to pay the  rent,

their furniture is seized and auctioned. The S.I.T.

could not care much about the consequences. As long



as  the  tenants are unable to pay the  rent,  they

have  to  quit. It is not easy to find a  piece  of

land. I mentioned yesterday that the landlord knows

that  if he wants to make a piece of land valuable,

he  must  not allow squatters to settle on  it.  If

there  are any squatters, the price will be reduced

to nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the problem. That is the main reason why

the   Minister  for  Local  Government,  Lands  and

Housing  has  moved  to build  a  Malay  settlement

scheme.  Naturally,  Sir,  he  deserves  the   full

support of this House. I hope that it will be  only

the first step. Any government and any Ministry  in

charge of housing should bear this problem in mind.

Do  not  make the silly mistake of supporting  only



the  middle class who can well afford to pay a rent

of  $20 or $30 a month. But do the Government  know

that  many  of the poor ra'ayat - whether  Malays  or

Chinese - cannot earn as much as $20 or $30 a  month?

I  know too well that many farmers in my kampong at

Siglap  receive  public assistance allowances  from

the Department of Social Welfare.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of encouraging people to buy their

own houses, I have advocated several times that the

Government  should  ask the S.I.T. to  sell  their

flats to those tenants who are willing to buy them.

With  the money obtained from this sale, Government



could build more houses for the lower income group.

Of  course,  the Minister will reply that  in  some



places,  low-cost houses have been put up and  that

there are a lot of houses at Paterson Road for  the

lower   income  group.  But  they  are  still   not

sufficient. What I would like to advocate is  this:

stop building multi-storey flats, which are usually

rented  to tenants who own cars, estates  and  have

houses  of  their  own.  I  have  already  made   a

statement  that the tenants of S.I.T. flats  often

have  two or three wives. Sir, this is, of  course,

very  true. These tenants are able to pay the  rent

charged  for S.I.T. flats whatever the amount.  The

Government  should find ways and means  of  raising

money from these wealthy tenants of S.I.T. flats by

compelling them to buy their flats. If the  tenants

fail  to do so, they must quit the flats. The money

obtained  from this sale could be spent on building

more low-cost houses for the lower income group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is to urge the Government to survey

the  future.  Is  it possible for the  planners  of

housing projects to make a thorough survey  of  the

capital  income  of  the population  in  Singapore,

before any planning of housing projects is started?

If the Government are sure that the majority of the

population belong to the middle class, or that  the

majority of the wage-earners will be able to pay  a

rent of, say, $20 per month, then Government should

build more houses at a rental of $20 per month. But

at  present the majority are not able to  pay  even

this  rent.  So it is common for these  tenants  of

S.I.T. flats  to be served eviction  notices  when

they fail to pay their rents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These eviction notices are also served on those

who  share  their flats with one or more  families.

The   authorities  could  not  understand  why  the



tenants   share  their  flats.  Why  cannot   these

families live in one flat? This is an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>



economic problem. It is because the tenants  cannot

pay  the high rent charged that they are forced  to

share their flats with some other families. The sub-tenants need not be their friends. Any stranger who

can  help them pay the rent will be accepted  as  a

sub-tenant. This is a fact, and yet the S.I.T. have

no  mercy on them. As long as they find that  there

are  unauthorised tenants in the flat,  they  force

them  to  quit. I cannot understand why.  Everybody

likes a comfortable home; everybody likes to occupy

a  whole flat if he can afford it. But if he cannot

pay  or is unemployed, there is no harm in his sub-letting his flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came across a case two weeks ago of an

unemployed tenant who had been in receipt of public

relief  assistance  for nine months,  and  who  was

sharing  his flat with two bachelors - one a  teacher

and the other a clerk. But unfortunately, these two

occupants  were  told  to  quit  when  the   S.I.T.

authorities discovered the sub-letting. This tenant



was  forced  to  sub-let  his  flat  to  two  other

families, one a newly-married couple and the  other

a  family of three - husband, wife and a son. But the

S.I.T. officers also discovered this and the tenant

was  told  either to quit the flat or to evict  the

unauthorised  sub-tenants. The tenant was  prepared

to  quit,  provided I could find him  accommodation

that  is  within his means. This tenant,  and  many

like him, cannot afford to pay even the rent of  an

S.I.T. flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The examples that I have quoted will be

sufficiently  clear  to show to  the  Minister  for

Local  Government, Lands and Housing that the  past

housing policy was wrong. The policy was framed not

to  help  the  lower  income group,  that  is,  the

ra'ayat,  but to benefit the middle class. Actually

the  middle  class can, with a little subsidy  from

Government, buy their own houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I wish to extend my hearty

support of the move made by the Minister for  Local

Government,   Lands  and  Housing  to   provide   a

settlement for the Malays. I only wish that he will

erect such a settlement not only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>



for the Malays, but also for the attap dwellers  of

other races.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree

entirely  with  the  remarks of  the  Minister  for

Communications and Works that good and  experienced

officers  are difficult to find, and that  we  must

not  do  anything to discourage them and make  them

leave  this  place, especially when we are  on  the

verge of self-government. But I am very shocked  at

his  contempt  for  this  House  by  comparing  the

Members here to the inmates of the forests  in  the

Federation!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I thought I did pull the

Minister up for being unparliamentary. Once I  have

done  that, I do not think any other Member  should

comment on it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Yes, Sir. As regards the one-room flats which I mentioned, there are many such

examples put up by the Government as well as by the

S.I.T. in Singapore. Take, for instance, the  flats

in  Cross Street, Mosque Street, North Bridge Road,

Kreta Ayer Road and, I think, in Banda Street  too.

All these are one-room flats. They share a communal



bathroom and a communal kitchen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in the building by-laws, it has been

provided,  in  the  case of shop-houses  especially

which  were  originally built for  renting  out  to

different  families, that for every three  cubicles

you  have  to  provide a bathroom,  a  W.C. and  a

kitchen.  These are for cubicle flats of  not  less

than  100 square feet, and in case it exceeds  that

size,   the  facilities  should  be  increased   in

proportion. You will agree, Sir, that this  is  not

the  ideal way to house the people. But as  I  have

said,  Sir, these people have not enough money,  so

the best way is to spread out to as many people  as

possible.  Even  if they have the money,  then  the

question   of   rent  arises  again,  because   the

Government is expected to receive rent at least  at

the  normal interest rate, even if, as is said, the

flats are subsidised.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Secretary has just mentioned that

the  cost of these one-room flats is not very  much

lower  than  the  two-room flats or the  three-room

flats.  I think he misunderstood me. What he  means

by  a one-room flat is - it has a room, a kitchen,  a

bathroom, a W.C., all self-contained. What I  mean,

and what Hongkong provides, is this: you have a one-bedroom, a common sitting room; the approach is  by

a  corridor  and a communal bathroom and  W.C. are

shared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government are fortunate later and can

provide  better  accommodation for  the  people  of

Singapore,  there  is  no  difficulty  at  all   in

converting,  at only little expense, a  one-bedroom

flat  into  a two-bedroom flat or a flat  with  two

bedrooms  cum  sitting  room.  But  we  must   face

realities  now. What are we going to  do  with  the

people  of  Singapore  now?  What  is  the  use  of

talking, "Yes, you keep quiet now. We will  try  to

solve  your  problem  in 20  years'  time.  In  the

meantime,  you  may  die;  but  never  mind,   your

children will benefit by it."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What good will that kind of talk serve? Also, are

we  sure that the housing problem will be solved in

20  years' time? I do not see how it is possible to

provide   accommodation   as   outlined   by    the

Improvement  Trust  and  other  organisations.   My

personal  opinion is that you give those  who  want

houses  whatever is possible and then, if  you  are

fortunate  enough later, you can provide them  with

better  accommodation. By this means, not only  can

you  provide more housing for more people, but also

you can in a way charge them at the rate which they

can afford.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, this question of land. There is no

reason  why  the Government cannot buy  some  land,

although I know the Government have not much  land.

Buy  it  and  have it laid out. Have  drains  made;



provide  approaches,  not  necessarily  first-class

ones,  and  sell or let out to the people  who,  in

turn, can build houses. Or provide them with some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>



standard  plans which they can get from  the  Rural

Board, say, for a dollar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know by saying this the architects will be angry

with me, but this is the way to help the people, so

that  they  can  build  with  whatever  money  they

have - $3,000 or $5,000 - and build to a type which  is

more suitable to their needs. We have an example of

this,  Sir. In pre-war days, we had to evict a  lot

of squatters from the Bukit Berlayer River Basin in

the  Harbour Board area. The attap huts there  were

all  built  hastily. We consulted these people  and

offered them flats which were built further inland,

but  they  were all of the opinion that they  would

like  to  have huts. So what we did was to get  the

land levelled, drained and had the lots marked out.

We said, "Now we give you a lot; you go and build."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same conditions exist now in Aljunied Road. I

think it is the Government which have provided  the

land  there, have it laid out and properly drained.

I think they must have let it out to the people who



were  dehoused  somewhere else. They  have  put  up

quite  decent  houses there. I am sure  anyone  who

goes  and  see  these  houses  put  up  under  such

circumstances will agree with me that they are  not

so bad, for they too provide accommodation like the

S.I.T.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very

grateful  to  those Members of the House  who  have

spoken in support of the proposal that I have  made

this   morning.   Even  the  Minister   for   Local

Government,  Lands and Housing, and  the  Financial

Secretary   have  also  given  my  proposal   their

blessing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only doubt that has so far been raised has

been  the Hon, the Financial Secretary. He says  he

is  not certain whether the $1 million which I have

suggested  should  be created as a  revolving  fund

would  indeed  be a revolving fund.  Sir,  from  my

experience,  I  can  give him  that  assurance.  If

10,000  people have already paid $20 million profit

for  these  houses,  is  it not  possible  now  for

another 10,000 families to find $500 to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>



$1,000  each to pay for a plot of land after  which

they  do  not  have to pay $10 or $15  a  month  as

rental?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Pasir Panjang has drawn my

attention  to the Aljunied Housing Estate.  Indeed,

Sir, that is within my area and I can say that when

it  was  decided  to resettle the people  in  Upper

Aljunied Estate, the original suggestion, I  think,

was  made  by  the Hon. the Assistant Minister  for

Labour  and  Welfare,  that  the  land  should   be

parcelled out to the settlers in small plots  after

water had been laid on and road paths made. Half of

the  lots  were issued in that respect. The  people

were  allowed  to  build any type  of  houses  they

liked. Unfortunately, we had a very prim and proper

Governor - His   Excellency  Sir  John   Nicoll.   He

happened  to pass that way; he saw what was  taking

place,  and he suddenly called a halt to everything

and said: "Good heavens! They are now making a slum

of  that  area  again by having these ugly  houses.

They are very comfortable and livable, but they are



not pretty, and there is no standard design." So he

stopped the scheme half-way and asked the Singapore

Improvement  Trust to put up blocks of  flats,  all

one-storey houses, costing $3,000 each.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say, Sir, on the whole, these $3,000 flats

have  not been satisfactory. They are very low  and

everyday  I receive complaints of leaks  and  heat,

and there is a tremendous amount of maintenance  to

be done. Whereas on the other side, where a man was

allowed  to  put  up his own house,  the  Singapore

Improvement Trust did not have to pay a single cent

on maintenance. The settler there undoubtedly takes

in  a  few  more tenants to help him  pay  for  his

service  charges,  but they are all  happy  and  no

further demands are made on the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite sure that if the Financial Secretary

will  seriously study the position, he  will  agree

with me and his doubts will fade away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Hon. the Minister for Local

Government,  Lands and Housing  has  on  the  whole

accepted my proposal and says that he will take the

matter up, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

subject.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Thank you very much, Mr

Speaker, Sir, because I am trying to comment on the

fact  that  no  provision is  being  made  for  the

establishment  of a sports stadium.  Personally,  I

feel, Sir, that this is a very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1599</b></font><br><br>



important  issue, because in Singapore  we  do  not

have a proper stadium of international standard for

the  holding of the Olympic Games. As I have  said,

this  question was raised by me last  year,  but  I

have  not  pressed  the matter  further  this  year

because I expected the Government would initiate  a

move to arouse public interest. But during all this

period  the Government has not initiated this  move

and  I have now take in the opportunity during this

debate  on the Appropriation Bill to speak  on  the

issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully realise, Sir, that the Government have no

money  at all to provide a sports stadium,  because

year  in and year out we find a big deficit in  the

Budget. There is no money even to build schools.  A

stadium  may  be  considered  a  secondary   matter

compared  to  schools. What I  want,  Sir,  is  for

Government  to initiate a move as a test  case,  to

find  out whether the public are interested or  not

in  the  establishment of a sports stadium. Frankly

speaking,  I do not want the Government to  provide

money   for  the  time  being.  What  I  want   the

Government  to do is to find out if  there  is  any

response  because the Hon. the Financial  Secretary

and the Hon. the Chief Minister last year said that

there  was  no  response from the public  and  that

there  was no necessity to build a sports  stadium.

So  what I want now, Sir, is that Government should



initiate  a  move  first  and  then  wait  for  the

response.  The Singapore Standard started  a  Cheer

Fund  and money came in. Many kinds of relief funds

were  started to collect money for this  and  that,

and  money  came in. So why not we start a  Stadium

Fund and see whether we get any public response? If

the   public   are  not  interested   at   all   in

contributing money towards this fund, then  let  us

scrap  the  whole  issue. But  if  the  public  are

interested, after Government has initiated  a  move

to  start  this  fund, then I think the  Government

should  take a keen interest in it and  assure  the

public  that they will provide a dollar for  dollar

contribution  for  the establishment  of  a  sports

stadium.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not like to compare Singapore with the

Federation, because the Federation has already  got

a  sports stadium. In fact, it was Singapore  which

first  started  the move to have a sports  stadium,

but  today the Federation Government can boast that

they have a sports stadium first. When the move for

a  fund is initiated, Sir, I will ask Government to

set  up  a  Board to administer this fund. Sporting

personalities such as those who are involved in the

Olympic  Games,  football or other  games,  can  be

nominated  to be trustees of this fund.  When  this

fund  develops to such an extent that the money  is

sufficient  to  start looking for a  stadium,  then

only  let us look for a site. In the meantime,  let

us  forget about where the site should be,  or  how

the  stadium should be built. What we want  is  let

the money come in first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government will take this into

consideration  and  start  a  fund  as  quickly  as

possible.

First  and foremost, we are known today as a modern



city  and practically all the requirements that  we

need  for a modern city are here, except a stadium.

Quite rightly too, as the Member for Queenstown has



mentioned, Government started a move first  on  the

question of having a stadium, but unfortunately  up

to  this  day nothing has happened at all.  In  the

Federation, there are now three stadiums: one,  the

Merdeka Stadium, one in Penang and one in Malacca.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been accused in the Press that the

standard  of  sports  has generally  gone  down  in

Singapore,  because we have not got the  facilities

for international teams or sports organisations  to

come  here  and take part in the games.  Without  a

stadium   the   standard  cannot  improve.   Sports

organisations  in Singapore have  done  their  bit.

Money  was  lacking, but through the enthusiasm  of



their  members,  they have managed to  do  whatever

they  could  to provide sports for the Colony.  But

Government has not given the least encouragement at

all.  The  only encouragement Government has  shown

was  that,  when our teams were going to  the  last

Asian   Games  and  the  last  Olympic  Games,   it

contributed the meagre sum of $25,000. It is  lucky

for the Federation of Malaya that they have a Prime

Minister  who  is  a  great sportsman  and  Cabinet

Members  who  are  sports-minded.  They  have   now

approved  a  vote  of $100,000 to be  utilised  for

sports activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am still very worried about it. You will

realise  that, on the one hand, we are  spending  a

lot of money to fight subversive elements, but,  on

the  other  hand, we are not trying  to  stop  them

because we allow the youth of Singapore to go  into

dance-halls,  cinemas and coffee-shops  instead  of

spending  their time on the playing  fields.  As  I

have said over and over again the question is this.

Are  the people really interested in sport and  can



the sports stadium be filled? I can say, and I have

said  so  before, that there are at  least  300,000

people   in   Singapore  directly   or   indirectly

interested  in  sport; and  if  we  have  a  sports

stadium here and we invite international teams  and

sports organisations to come here and take part  in

sports, it will act as an incentive to our athletes

to  better their standard. As it is now,  they  can

only  compete among themselves and the standard  is

not  high.  If we have a sports stadium,  Sir,  the

athletes  of Singapore will say, "We will  have  to

improve our standard and put up a good show against

visiting teams."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, Sir, I really beg the incoming

Government   to  consider  this  matter  seriously,

because  it  is  a  good thing  for  the  youth  of

Singapore to be of sound mind and to have a healthy

body.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, eleven years have passed since this

stadium business first saw the light of day, and my

recollection of all the details may not be strictly

accurate, but I think the basis of what I  now  say

is accurate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were interested parties, I think probably

about  eight years ago, who thought it would  be  a

very  good  thing to have a stadium  in  Singapore.

Government  thought that it would  assist  them  to



form  a stadium if they could show that they had  a

large  measure of public support. An  Ordinance  in

connection  with  the creation  of  a  stadium  was

promulgated.  A Stadium Board was set  up.  It  was

then  left to the Board to work out plans  for  the

establishment of a stadium. Many years elapsed, but

the  Board  was  not able to do  more  despite  the

promise of land from Government for a site for  the

stadium. The Stadium Board was able to put up  many

proposals  for  the stadium, but no proposals  were

put  up whatsoever for financing the stadium, other

than  that Government should put up the money. When

the  matter  was  last  discussed  at  considerable

length in this Chamber, it was made clear to  those

people  who were responsible for the idea  that  if

they could show that there was financial support in

Singapore for a stadium, Government would  be  only

too  prepared to assist. So far, no indication  has

been  given of any desire on the part of the people

in  Singapore to contribute financially towards the

cost  of a stadium - and there the matter lies. There

is  no  need  for Government to start a  fund.  The

Member  for Queenstown can start a fund. Or he  can

start  the necessary propaganda to start a fund  to

show to the Government that the people of Singapore

are prepared to support financially a stadium.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the need for a stadium, we have an

excellent stadium at Jalan Besar which, even on its

best days, is probably a quarter full. What we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>



now being asked to do is to put the money to create

a  vast  stadium which will be nothing more than  a

white  elephant.  Perhaps on one occasion  in  four

years it may be half full. For the rest of the time

it will merely be a liability which Government will

have to meet from its own resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the statement that there are no

stadiums  in  Singapore  for  sport,  we  have   an

excellent  track  at Farrer Park We  have  numerous

swimming  pools where people can learn to swim  and

even  attain  Olympic standards. We  have  numerous

playing  fields where the various football  leagues

can play their games.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the suggestion that a stadium would be

a sound measure to counter subversion, it is merely

a  means  of  encouraging people not to play  games

themselves  but  to  attend games - rather  like  the

crowd  who  attended  a display  of  gladiators  in

ancient  Rome - and  to  offer  them  facilities  for

betting on the outcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if this money were available for a stadium,

Sir,  I  would  much prefer to use  it  to  provide

facilities for people to play games rather than  to

watch 11, 22 or 30 people playing games.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospect of getting any international events

to  be held in Singapore could not take place  more

than once in four years at the outside, and only on

these occasions would the stadium be full.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, the hon. Members who raised this and

who  are so interested in the matter might be  well

advised to devote their attention to other matters,

and  to let this drop. But as I have said, Sir,  if

they  can  show beyond a shadow of doubt that  they

can  raise  a  substantial  proportion  of  the  $2

million  or  more  required to  create  a  stadium,

Government will be prepared to consider the  matter

again.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if

Government will make a statement that they will  be

willing to provide the land and will be prepared to

contribute  a  dollar for a dollar  of  the  public

subcription, and to allow the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>



public to have a voice in the administration of the

stadium  and share in its profits, I am quite  sure

it  is  not  mere wishful thinking on my part  that

there will be big support for a stadium. I can tell

the  House, Sir, that if Government can  give  that

assurance,  within  one  week  a  hundred  thousand

dollars will be raised. The question of it being  a

white  elephant  will  not arise  at  all,  because

holding games there will help to pay for its upkeep

to  a very great extent; of that I am very definite

and  certain. To say that the stadium will only  be

filled  once  a  year  or once  in  four  years  is

incorrect.  It is not that only one kind  of  sport

will be held there but also other sports too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have today in Singapore, Sir, are only

playing  fields.  We have plenty of  them,  but  no

stadium.  I think the Hon, the Financial  Secretary

does   not   realise  that,  to  invite  teams   of

international  repute to come here, there  must  be

some  way. But what is that way? I think next  year

eight  international  soccer teams  are  coming  to

Singapore  to  compete. Now, what have  we  got  to

offer  them? A big city of Singapore with a stadium

no  better  than Malacca's! I am not talking  about

the  Federation capital in Kuala Lumpur, or Penang,

but  Malacca.  The Malacca stadium is  much  better

than  the playing fields that we have here. Is this

not true? I have said we have no real sportsmen  on

these  Benches.  The incoming Government,  if  they

have  some  Members who are going to be Members  of

the  Cabinet and who are sports-minded, will, I  am

sure,  be  a  great help not only to  sportsmen  in

Singapore  but  to  the City of Singapore,  because

then  we will have a place where healthy and clean-living  people can gather together instead of  what

we now have - a mixed assortment of clubs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I just want to point out, Sir, that to

suggest  that  the Government gives  the  money  is

perhaps  short-circuiting the argument. It  is  the

people's  money,  paid for by  taxes  paid  by  the

people.  If  money is provided for a stadium,  then

either less money will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>



provided for something else - for example, we cut out

housing  for a few hundred families; or we cut  out

outpatient clinics; or we cut out the grant to  the

Nanyang  University - some cut  has  to  be  made  on

something   for   which  money  is   provided:   or

alternatively,  we must increase  taxation,  and  I

think  the hon. Member should now rise to  tell  us

either  precisely  what  he  proposes  to  cut,  or

precisely what new taxes he proposes to put on, and

to  assure  us that be is not speaking for  himself

but  for  the people of Singapore who would welcome

the cut he proposes or who would gladly pay the tax

that he wishes to impose.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the attitude

of  the  colonial officer clearly shows how adamant

he  is  on  this  issue. To attack or  criticise  a

member of the Stadium Board is really uncalled  for

and  unwarranted. I was a member of that Board  and

it put up several suggestions to the Government. At

no   time   did  the  Government  ever   think   of

considering   any   suggestions.   The    Financial

Secretary was also a member of that Board,  and  he

was  very  adamant  in  his  attitude  towards  the

suggestions  put up. To come here  now  and  attack

members of the Board is nonsense and uncalled  for.

This  Board  did put forward suggestions,  but  the



Government was not in the least interested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question of funds, Sir, I am not

asking  the Government to provide funds right  now.

What  I am asking them to do is to start a fund-put



it  to  a  test case, to find out whether there  is

public response or not. It may take three years  to

get  that money; or it may take five years. By that

time  a new government will have come in, and there

may be an excess of income over expenditure. We may

have  a surplus rather than a deficit, and by  that

time  the  Government could well provide money  for

the Stadium. Why talk about cutting this or cutting

that?  If  I  am  insisting that Government  should

provide  the  money now, then I will  have  to  put

forward  suggestions to cut down  the  building  of

schools or universities, or to increase taxes. I do

not  want  from  the Government any money  at  this

juncture.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1606</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Secretary boasts of the Jalan

Besar Stadium and Farrer Park running track.  I  do

not  want to repeat what I have said last year. The

Jalan  Besar  Stadium and the Farrer  Park  running

track   belong  to  the  City  Council,   and   the

Government, which is responsible for the running of

this  country, cannot even provide a decent stadium

of international standard. Are we proud of that? At

least the City Council, which is a local government

authority, is proud to say that they have  a  Jalan

Besar  Stadium and a running track at Farrer  Park.

Can  we  boast of anything? To say that the stadium



may be half-full is out of the question. If you  do

not  have  a  stadium, how can you attract  foreign

athletes to come here? If the Olympic Games  should

be  held here, would other countries be prepared to

come  here if we could not have a stadium  to  hold

the  Games? Why say that the stadium may  be  half-full,  or quarter-full, or that it may be  a  white

elephant? There is no question of it being a  white

elephant. During certain times of the year, it  can

be  opened to schools, organisations, sports clubs,

and  so  forth. These are the facilities that  will

attract  them here. We talk of tourism; we talk  of

attracting tourists to come here. Cannot we attract

sportsmen  to come here if we have a decent  sports

stadium?  As  the Member for Cairnhill has  rightly

said,   if  international  soccer  teams  come   to

Singapore,  what  can we provide them  with?  Jalan

Besar Stadium belonging to the City Council! Not  a

Government Stadium!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has also said, "If the

Government can assure us now that they are prepared

to  give  a  dollar for a dollar, he is quite  sure

that money will be forthcoming." Why not give it  a

try?  No money is required now. What we want  is  a

Stadium   Board   Fund  and  appoint   members   to

administer  that  Fund. It is  not  a  question  of

money.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I shall be very brief. I am afraid the

hon.  Member for Queenstown has quite misunderstood

me. I was not suggesting that there was a temporary

shortage  of  money. The Member suggested  that  in

five years'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>



time  the Government might be called on to  provide

the  money.  In  five  years' time  there  will  be

another 300,000 or 400,000 children in the families

in Singapore and the Government would then be faced

with  the problems of education costs, for example.

My   colleague  the  Minister  for  Education   has



outlined how these costs are going to increase  all

the  time.  The need for money will be  more  acute

year  by  year and, I am afraid, will not  be  less

acute for a very long time to come.



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the

Federation Government can provide $3 million for  a

stadium  and  $100,000 for sports  facilities  this

year,  I cannot see why the Government cannot begin

building  a  stadium  here.  I  do  not  think  the

Government needs more than $1� million, because the

other  $1� million must come from the public before

such a project can be carried out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, I thought I made it clear that the

Stadium  Board of which I was a member was prolific

of  ideas  but not of the idea where the money  was

going to come from.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of Government support, I

would  refer hon. Members, who have spoken,  to  an

exchange of correspondence which passed between the

Government and the Stadium Board and in  which  the

terms of Government assistance were laid down.  The

last  case that I had of assistance to the  Stadium

was  for  over $2 million. If it is going  to  take

five  years  for the public of Singapore  to  reach

their  share of the $2 million, I think that,  Sir,

is indicative of a lack of interest in the Stadium.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, another

disappointment  that I find in this  Head  is  that

there is no provision for the building of community

halls.  With the creation of a new department,  the

Community Recreation Division in the Social Welfare

Department, I think the Government should  try  and

build  more  community halls for community  centres

rather than omit this item in the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community centres play a very important part in

helping  the  Government  on  many  matters.  These

community  centres  provide  out  of  their   funds

amenities for their own members and they also  help

the  Government in many respects, like  health  and

citizenship registration. A case of such assistance

is  seen  in  the recent polio epidemic  where  the

community centres volunteered their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1609</b></font><br><br>



services  to  register children for  polio  vaccine

vaccination.  Another case is  the  time  when  the

Government   introduced  citizenship  registration.

Most  of the community centres also offered to help



the   Government  in  the  registration  of   alien

citizens   for  Singapore  citizenship.  This   has

relieved  the Government appreciably. Some  centres

also have their own volunteer police to guard their

areas or estates. This also helps the Police. There

are   many  other  kinds  of  work  done  by  these

community centres which help the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at the moment, I understand, three types

of  community  centres. One  is  sponsored  by  the

Government,  and  assisted by  the  Social  Welfare

Department.   The  second  is  sponsored   by   the

residents in S.I.T. estates and is provided by  the

S.I.T. with  a  clubhouse at a nominal  rent.  The

third type is organized by the residents living  in

kampongs  or  villages. Now for the first  type  of

community centre, Government provide money to build

its  own community hall, and provide furniture  and

other necessities of the centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second type, the management

committee   has  to  raise  funds  to  upkeep   its

amenities.  In  most cases, some of  these  centres

cannot be self-sufficient and have to depend on the

running  of open-air cinemas at 10 cents per  head.

With this little income these community centres can



manage to exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third type of community centre is in kampongs

or  villages and it does not have any facilities at

all.  Some of these centres, I understand,  do  not

even  have a clubhouse. Such a centre can be  found

in West Coast Road. They have to function within  a

Chinese temple. This is not right, Sir, because  it

is   the   responsibility  and  the  duty  of   the

four   years   since  I  asked  the  Minister   for

Communications   and  Works  to   look   into   the

communication  system in Serangoon  Garden  Estate.

Questions  had been put to him; requests  had  been



made;  and  promises had been made by him.  He  had

promised to widen Yio Chu Kang Road. A new road had

been  promised to be made from Serangoon Garden  to

join  up  with Braddell Heights. That  was  two  or

three  years  ago. Today, I think,  with  his  more

intimate knowledge - because he is now living on  the

fringe  of  that  estate - he should  experience  the

difficulty  himself. I am interested to  know  what

the  Minister  is now thinking about,  whether  his

promises  can come to fruition. How long more  will

the people in that estate, who pay a great

deal of taxes, continue to have their amenities not

looked  after? Will Yio Chu Kang Road  be  widened?

they should be moved?

relieve the difficulties of rural people and  bring

them  better amenities in the form of new roads  to

be  made up or bad roads repaired - at least repaired

to  the extent whereby it is possible to move along

them.

of  Public Works building. Public Works building is

known to be the highest in Singapore, if not in the

whole of Malaya. Much as I want to find out what is

the  reason behind such high costs, I am unable  to

do  so. Of late, I have had the privilege of examin

ing  some of the schemes put up by the Public Works

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Public Works building is known

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> As I understand it, the Financial

Secretary  has pointed out that the whole  question

of  building  Costs is now being discussed  in  the

Estimates  Committee. If that is  so,  then  it  is

wrong  to debate the question of building costs  in

the  Assembly  until the Report  of  the  Estimates

Committee reaches the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Yes, Sir, I will try to avoid

what has been discussed, or what is expected to  be

discussed, in the Estimates Committee. I have  seen

the  Report of the Estimates Committee for the year

1957.  In it the then Director of Public Works  was

asked  for  his opinion about the houses  built  by

Ideal  Homes in Whitley Road. His reply, Sir,  was,

"If  I had $30,000 I would rather throw it into the

Singapore  River  than buy one  of  those  houses."

These  were exactly his words. I did not  fabricate

them  myself. Such was the attitude of  the  Public

Works Department officers, and I believe it is  the

opinion  of the public officers now. If  these  are

the type of people who really have no intention  of

trying  to cut down expenditure for the Government,

then  how can we expect them to reduce the cost?  A

lot of building schemes have been put up in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>



Estimates  which are very much more expensive  than

those put up by the public. Sir, there are so  many

reasons. The Estimates could be very high,  or  the

cost  also  could have been very high. One  reason,

Sir, is the corruption of the officers concerned. I

am  not accusing anybody because I have no evidence

to  show that the officers are corrupted. Secondly,

it  is  that they put up too luxurious  a  type  of

building  to suit circumstances and needs. Thirdly,

they  specify  a  lot of expensive materials  which

should  never be there. When I criticised the  cost

of the Polytechnic last year, I was asked by one of

the members of the Board of Governors to go and see

the  opening  of  the tenders.  I  refused  to  go,

because  by looking at the opening of the  tenders,

it  would only satisfy me that the tenders were not

made up specially for the occasion. What I mean  is

that  the  tenders were properly sent  in  and  not

substituted later. But I had never any intention of

seeing  it,  and  it  was  never  my  intention  to

criticise  the  Polytechnic  costs  on  account  of

underhand  methods of tendering. As  I  have  said,

Sir,  there are many reasons that could put up  the

cost of a building: for instance, like putting a $3 - finish  to  a  block of flats at Leonie  Hill;  the

suggestion  of  putting brass hinges  in  servants'

quarters,  because I have examined a  copy  of  the

specification  of one of the jobs. I have  designed

many buildings of millionaires, and I have not even

on  one  occasion  put  brass hinges  in  servants'

quarters.  The cost of brass hinges  is  about  ten

times  that  of steel hinges. If the  brass  hinges

last  twenty years, and the steel hinges last  only

two  years, then I would say the cost is justified.

I  know  very  well, Sir, that a  door  with  steel



hinges  will definitely last as long as  that  with

brass  hinges.  So why push up the cost  ten  times

higher? Is there any justification for it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time we criticise the Public Works

Department for the high cost of building, they  say

it  is because their buildings are much better than

those  built  by people outside. But  have  we  any

evidence  to substantiate such statements  made  by

the  Ministry?  If  people can  build  a  flat  for

$15,000 and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>



Government's flat costs $45,000, there is something

wrong  with  the Government. But have  they,  after

having inspected the flats and schools built by the

public at one-third the cost, come back and made  a

report  on  how  much difference there  is  in  the

costs?



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, they can do no wrong. The white men can do

no  wrong.  The  devils are only  the  Asians.  The

devils are the Members who come and complain in the

House. That is the kind of attitude adopted by  the

Minister   and  his  colleagues - when  I   say   his

colleagues,  I mean his subordinates.  So  how  can

they expect to cut down the cost of buildings?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the cost of P.W.D. building is 20 per cent or

30 per cent higher, for instance, we can understand

that;  but  if  it is 200 per cent  higher  and  no

explanation  is  given whatsoever  except  to  say,

"Our's   is   the  best!" - are  the   Public   Works

Department  buildings the best? Even  if  they  are

slightly  better  than  others,  are  their   costs

cheaper than others? Definitely not!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said about the Polytechnic, the

squandering  of  public funds must stop,  and  stop

now.  If  the Minister thinks that he is unable  to

set  up  an  inquiry, or bring  down  the  cost  of

buildings, then I think he should not stay  in  the

House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It seems something has got

appropriately  be said in the Estimates  Committee.

It  is  a  question  of detail  which  perhaps  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Thank you, Sir. I am very much

up  to  investigate the prices of P.W.D. buildings,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1615</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, point of order. The question of

Public  Works building costs is under consideration

by  the  Estimates Committee at the  present  time.

Under these circumstances, I cannot understand  why



a  Member of the Estimates Committee should suggest

that there should be a public commission to go into

the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the

Estimates  Committee,  it  is  up  to  us  only  to

consider the matter, but I think it is necessary to

convince  the public that either a committee  or  a

commission be set up to make such an inquiry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> There are quite a number of matters

which  were referred to me, Sir, in the  course  of

the  last  speech or two and I would like to  clear

them up before I forget what they were all about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the high cost of public works, I am sure

my  colleagues are feeling surprised that the  hon.

Member  for  Pasir Panjang feels  it  necessary  to

suggest another committee or commission when he has

already got the Estimates Committee with democratic

representatives  of  the people  sitting  on  it - he

himself is there. I do not think he intends to have

that Committee to toe my ministerial line! No, that

would not serve him in the least.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Minister please address

the Chair?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir,I cannot see

the necessity for any more investigation than that.

I would like to warn him about turning the question



of  public building costs into a communal issue  by

crying  that the white man can do no wrong, because

he  will  very shortly be treading on local  corns,

since  the  number  of white men remaining  in  the

Ministry  is  rapidly decreasing and very  soon  he

will  have  to  justify  his  attacks  on  his  own

Singaporean  fellow citizens and see  whether  they

are  inclined  to  accept his criticisms  which  he

expresses with great vigour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad at least that he has not accused us of

corruption  in the P.W.D. That is something  to  be

thankful for.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had, Sir, one or two remarks about unemployment

relief  works. The selection of unemployment relief

recruitment  is done by the Labour Ministry,  which

has  the  appropriate facilities, and I  would  not

wish to attempt to outline the methods there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand there has been some difficulty in

filling  some of the projects initially  when  they

were  seeking to recruit in the rural  areas  where

the  works are to be carried out. The tendency  has

been  to give more employment to people in the town

and move them out to the rural areas where work has

to   be  done.  The  works  in  hand  so  far   are

improvement of rural roads and tracks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Serangoon will be happy to

note that some work is starting on the Yio Chu Kang

Road improvements. It is not the sector in which he

is  interested. There will be some very large-scale

work  in connection with the runway at the Airport.

I  think  I  better not prejudice  other  works  by



referring  to them ahead of the time at which  they

go  into operation, since the developments  are  to

some  extent conditioned by the experience obtained

as the work goes forward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Serangoon referred to the need

for   improvements  of  Yio  Chu  Kang   Road   or,

alternatively, for some other roads to be  made  up

to  get  the  quite heavy traffic out of  Serangoon

Garden  Estate for those who want to get  into  the

City.  I  have  been living just  beyond  Serangoon

Garden Estate now for about eight months and I have

had the opportunity of experiencing traffic on this

road.  It  is certainly a very inadequate road  for

the  load  of traffic it has to carry, particularly

remembering the children, pedestrians, and bicycles

in addition to the motor-car traffic and the buses.

But  I must remind the hon. Member that this  is  a



matter  for  the local authorities.  The  money  is

provided  to  the Rural Board from the  Government,

but  the  decision and the action  rests  with  the

local  authorities.  It  is  up  to  them  to  give

instructions to the executive engineer to carry out

the works. It is not for me to take upon myself  to

instruct  the local authorities as to what decision

they should take.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can perhaps cheer his anxious heart by telling

him that in the months after I had moved into that

area,  I  did take the trouble to time my  journey

from  my house to my office. I filled up one  page

of  my notebook - 16 journeys. From the door of  the

house  to  just beyond the traffic lights  at  the

Paya  Lebar police station is one mile,  and  that

mile took me the following times:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 minutes 15 seconds; 3� minutes; 2 minutes 50

seconds;  2  minutes  45  seconds;  3  minutes  20

seconds;  3  minutes  50  seconds;  3  minutes  30

seconds;  3  minutes  20  seconds;  3  minutes  25  seconds;  4  minutes   5

seconds;  3  minutes  45  seconds;  3  minutes   5

seconds; 2 minutes 20 seconds; and 7 minutes and 5

seconds-that was when part of the road was up  and

there was a considerable block.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forget precisely what the average speed comes

to, but it is obviously between 15 and 20 miles an

hour  over a one-mile stretch, and there  are  two

traffic  lights to be negotiated. So the  road  is

not an excessively slow-moving road on an average.

If  the unhappy motorist finds himself behind  two



or  three buses, all of them stopping at  all  the

bus  stops, he will have a very exasperating  time

indeed.  But,  nevertheless,  the  average  of  my

figures is not a too discreditable average.  I  am

more  concerned  personally about  the  danger  to

human  life,  or the difficulty to the  public  in

getting  across the road without excessive danger.

The  children, the hawkers and the people  who  do



not own motor cars come much nearer to my heart in

this  matter than the motor-car owner  who  loses,

perhaps, two minutes of his life in traversing one

mile. It will not do him very serious harm.

as   the  exact  amount  paid  in  1957  had   been

I mean when I say "below-the-line Advance Account",

it  merely means that the money has been paid  from

Government   funds  but  not  from  a  vote.   This

particular   money  is  paid  by  law   under   the

Compensation Ordinance. We have legal authority  to

pay,   and   it   was  considered   desirable   and

appropriate,  in  this  particular  case,  that  we

should  pay from an Advance Account until  we  knew

precisely  how  much  was  required  in  1957   and

thereafter to take a vote.

requiring   additional  funds  to  the  extent   of



$891,100. The great majority of applications  refer

to  votes  for recurrent expenditure  which,  as  a

result  of the increase in cost in the services  of

the Government, have been or are in danger of being

overspent. Some of the applications of this  nature

are  substantial, for example, items 206, 221, 224,

238 and 247. It will also be noted that $500,000 is

sought   for  the  Constitution  Exposition.   Each

application  is described very fully,  Sir,  but  I

shall  be happy to augment the explanation  in  any

particular case.

<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what I am

concerned about is item 237 - Losses of Public  Money

and  Stores.  This involves a case  where  a  steel

locker   was   stolen  from  the  office   of   the

Commandant,  Special Constabulary, over  the  weekend,  29th-31st October, 1955. I am at  a  loss  to

understand how this locker with guards at the front

gate  in  the  "In"  and "Out" entrances  and  with

policemen  around  was stolen.  Can  the  Hon, the

Financial  Secretary explain why this steel  locker

was stolen from the police station?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I think the reason why it was stolen

was  because the people who stole it wanted to  get

at  the  contents! I appreciate the  hon.  Member's

difficulty  in  understanding how  a  steel  locker

could  be  stolen  from this  particular  place.  I

confess  that that particular problem  has  baffled

everybody who has investigated it! We have not been

able  to  obtain clarification. It is one of  those

insoluble mysteries which we will never be able  to

solve.  The officer responsible has been surcharged

to  a considerable extent and has been relieved  of

his  post. As I said, I do not think that  we  will

ever discover how the locker came to be removed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1622</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been to

the  Commandant's  Office  at  the  Central  Police

Station.  Besides the two guards at  the  "In"  and

"Out" entrances, there are two more constables; one

sitting  in  front of the office of the Commandant,

and  the  other one in the corridor;  and  yet  the

steel   locker - I  suppose  it  was  kept  in   that

office - was  stolen from the office with four  armed

guards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> It is now some time since this took

place  and  I read the file very carefully  at  the

time. I think it is not the Central Police Station -



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> The Central Police Station.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> - it is a fairly big building. The theft

took  place at night and there were guards  at  the

main  entrance,  but - subject to  correction - it  did

appear to me at the time when I read the file  that

it  was  possible to move this locker  out  of  the

Commandant's room without ever going near the  main

entrance.  As  I  said, Sir, it  is  one  of  those

insoluble mysteries how the locker ever got out  of

the police station! I do not think we will ever  be

able  to obtain a satisfactory solution. I am sorry

that  I  cannot give more information to  the  hon.
