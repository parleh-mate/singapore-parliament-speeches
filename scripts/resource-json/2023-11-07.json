Go ahead.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Zaqy Mohamad</strong>:&nbsp;I would like to assure Mr Saktiandi that the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) closely tracks the number of resident workers across finer gross income bands, with special attention given to the progress of our lower-wage workers. But let me first talk more broadly about the wage outcomes before I come back to the income growth of lower-wage workers.</p><p>From 2017 to 2022, income growth has outpaced inflation, with the real median income growing by about 9.4% or 1.8% per annum. This income growth was commensurate with productivity growth, measured by real value-added per worker, of 2% per annum over the same period. However, due to the elevated inflation and weaker economic outlook, based on preliminary estimates, while nominal median income grew by 0.9%, real median income declined by 4.5% on a year-on-year basis in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022. While the economic outlook remains uncertain, we expect inflation to moderate for the rest of the year.</p><p>The Government recognises the impact of inflation on wages and has recently announced a $1.1 billion Cost of Living Support Package in September, which provides additional relief for all Singaporean households, with more support for lower- to middle-income families. In its recent announcement on 31 October, the National Wages Council (NWC) has called on employers to consider giving a one-off special lump sum payment to workers in recognition of the impact of high prices. The NWC Guidelines recommend that employers reward workers fairly based on their contributions and overall business performance, and adopt the Flexible Wage System in order to stay nimble and responsive amidst economic uncertainty.</p><p>To Mr Chia\u2019s question, our strategy to sustain real income growth is to continue to raise productivity. This is why we have embarked on the 23 Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) to transform businesses and upskill workers for jobs of the future across the economy.</p><p>&nbsp;The NWC has also reiterated its call to employers to press on with transformation and upskilling to ensure that income growth is sustainable, and the Government will support such efforts. Employers can make use of the 16 Jobs Transformation Maps which provide actionable roadmaps to redesign jobs and upskill workers. Employers can also tap on programmes such as Workforce Singapore\u2019s Career Conversion Programmes, which provide up to 90% salary and course subsidies, to reskill their existing workers to take on enhanced job roles or train mid-career new hires to take on new roles.&nbsp;As indicated in the Forward Singapore report, we will launch new career health initiatives to improve job matching and help Singaporeans better plan for their long-term careers, through access to better data and information about jobs and skills. This will enhance employers\u2019 access to talent and ensure better labour market outcomes.</p><p>I would like to assure Members that we pay special attention to our lower-wage workers. Mr Saktiandi and Mr Chia would be pleased to know that lower-wage workers have experienced good real income growth over the last five years. From 2017 to 2022, real income at the 20th percentile has risen 15.4%, or 2.9% per annum, faster than 1.8% per annum at the median. This means that as costs of living rose, the incomes of lower-wage workers rose even more, thereby narrowing the income gap between lower-wage workers and the median worker.</p><p>We have recently expanded the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) to cover more lower-wage workers, and this will boost their incomes even further over the next few years \u2013 workers covered by PWM can expect cumulative wage increases of up to 80% by 2028. Amid a tight labour market, lower-wage workers who are not directly covered by PWM should also see meaningful wage increases, as employers will have to respond to market forces to attract and retain workers. To reduce the impact on employers, the Government co-funds up to 75% of wage increases given by employers to eligible lower-wage workers from 2022 to 2026, through the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme (PWCS). PWCS will soften the cost impact on employers in the near term, and give employers time to invest in upskilling workers and improving firm-level productivity so that the wage increases are sustainable.</p><p>The Government also enhanced the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme in January 2023 to further boost the income of lower-wage workers. We will be further enhancing Workfare as shared by Prime Minister Lee at the National Day Rally 2023 and details will be shared at next year\u2019s Budget.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Edward Chia.</p><p><strong>\tMr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State three supplementary questions. First, can he highlight sectors or jobs that are most at risk of wage stagnation or even worse, further deterioration in their wages? Second, what are the reasons for the elevated risks in these jobs or sectors? And third, what further support will the Government put in place to support employers in these sectors?</p><p><strong>\tMr Zaqy Mohamad</strong>: I thank the Member for his questions. Nominal wage growth for resident workers is expected to ease next year as labour demand cools and tightness in the labour market is alleviated. However, as overall wage growth is projected to moderate, it could remain elevated in several sectors.</p><p>The Member asked about the sectors. Wage increments are expected to stay firm in travel-related sectors where demand continues to recover, as well as more labour intensive services sectors where manpower shortages could be more persistent. So, we can roughly see the trends.</p><p>If we think about it, the decline in real income in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022 was due to elevated inflation, rather than just wage decline. We have to look at real income in that context.</p><p>Overall, what we see is that the decline in real income was broad-based and not so much specific to certain sectors.</p><p>And in terms of the nominal income change, you would also see that across various sectors, the changes did not outpace inflation, and therefore, you see the decline in real incomes.</p><p>For the strategy to help businesses, we do need to support efforts to raise productivity. It goes beyond just increasing wages because there is impact on business costs. If productivity is not raised, you will find that businesses cannot sustain the wage increases. We have to look at that and balance both the impact of inflation and also look to see how we can improve productivity. At the same time, the Government does provide various measures to support business, for example, through the PWCS to reduce the impact of wage increases of lower-wage workers and other efforts such as productivity schemes. This is where we can work together in the next couple of years to improve wage outcomes, as a whole.</p><p>Do support us, do work with the Government in areas such as the Career Conversion Programmes for workers, Support for Job Redesign under Productivity Solutions Grant and the SkillsFuture credits. These are among the schemes that businesses can tap on.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Saktiandi Supaat.</p><p><strong>\tMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>: I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State two supplementary questions. First, the Senior Minister of State shared briefly about the median income growth outlook over the next year. Can he share a bit of it in the near term, for example, over the next five years, for example?</p><p>Second, given concerns of higher inflation over a longer time, if it does happen, can the Senior Minister of State share a bit more about the strategies for middle-income, lower middle-income and slightly upper middle-income workers? My question mentioned vulnerable groups of Singaporeans. And lower middle- and middle-income Singaporeans will eventually become vulnerable groups if they lose their job or fall sick. So, can the Senior Minister of State share a bit more on that, please?</p><p><strong>\tMr Zaqy Mohamad</strong>: I thank the Member for his questions. My crystal ball does not go that far. As I shared earlier, if we look at the trend for the rest of the year and if inflation moderates, that means the situation with the declines in real income will potentially moderate.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, let us not forget that in the last five years, we have seen good improvements with regard to real income. We have seen strong growth. As I shared, we had about 9.4% real income increase in the last five years, before the current decline and pressures of inflation. Therefore, we have to take some of these things into account.</p><p>Overall, in terms of how we can help our middle-income and lower middle-income workers improve, it is really through improvements in productivity, helping them benefit from the economic growth that we have, with new jobs, new growth sectors, as well as upskilling and reskilling in some of these new jobs where we can see higher productivity and better wage growth outcomes. The same goes for our lower-wage workers too today, where although they have the PWM, it is really about helping companies transform and redesign jobs so that we can sustain the wage increases. Otherwise, wage increases without corresponding productivity growth will be challenging, not just for the businesses but our economy as well.</p><p>There are multiple layers. Economic restructuring has to continue. Firm-level productivity improvements have to continue as well. At the same time, at the worker level, you need skills and productivity improvements as well. I will take it at all three levels for us to sustain the wage growth in coming years.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Decision on Appropriate Strategy for Urban Wildlife Management", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>4 <strong>Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin</strong> asked the Minister for National Development in light of the decision by NParks to put down the saltwater crocodile found near Marina East Drive (a) what is the framework in place to decide on the appropriate strategy for urban wildlife management; and (b) what factors determine the relevant approach for different species of wildlife.</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Tan Kiat How) (for the Minister for National Development)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, as we transform Singapore into a City in Nature and bring people closer to nature, we will need to manage human-wildlife encounters carefully. This includes cultivating public awareness and appreciation, and weaving thoughtful biophilic designs into our urban spaces. At the same time, because we are a densely populated city-state, we will also need to ensure public health and safety.</p><p>To do so, the National Parks Board (NParks) takes a science- and community-based approach to wildlife management. NParks studies the population trends and distribution of various wildlife species across Singapore. The findings of these studies guide the development of NParks\u2019 wildlife management strategies. NParks also consults local as well as wildlife experts to ensure that its strategies are in line with international practices and standards.</p><p>In managing different wildlife species, such as pest birds, long-tailed macaques, wild boars and crocodiles, NParks considers factors such as the species\u2019 ecology and behaviour, threats to public health and safety, animal welfare, as well as impact on native biodiversity, habitats and the community.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on an assessment of these factors, a range of measures may be adopted. These include public education, enforcement against illegal wildlife feeding, habitat modification to reduce food sources and translocation of the animals away from urban areas. NParks may also need to take steps to safeguard public safety. For instance, it may put up signage to advise the public on how to respond to wildlife sightings. NParks may also install exclusion measures such as fencing, or carry out direct population control where necessary, such as in the case of wild boars.</p><p>In the case of estuarine crocodiles, like the one found near Marina East Drive, public safety is a major consideration as they are apex predators and stealthy, opportunistic feeders. They have attacked and killed children and adults in other countries. For example, on 23 October 2023, The Straits Times reported three suspected crocodile attacks in Sabah in the preceding month. To protect the public, the Sabah authorities had to cull five large crocodiles.</p><p>When there are sightings of crocodiles in Singapore, NParks will first assess if there is an immediate threat to public safety. For example, if the sighting is at a recreational destination, NParks will trap the crocodile and try to relocate or rehome it. In doing so, NParks takes into account the strong homing instinct of estuarine crocodiles to return to the location of capture. If there are no suitable options for relocation and rehoming, the crocodile will be humanely put down.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p>This approach is aligned with that taken in many other jurisdictions that have crocodiles or alligators, such as the city of Darwin in Australia's Northern Territory, where crocodiles are actively removed from areas of high human activity to reduce the likelihood of crocodile attacks. These crocodiles are either rehomed or put down.</p><p>&nbsp;The crocodile that the Member has mentioned was a large adult, measuring around three metres long. That is almost one and a half storeys high.&nbsp;It was sighted around two kilometres away from East Coast Park, which is about a 10-minute swim for a crocodile moving at stealth in the waters. As East Coast Park is a popular destination that receives 7.5 million visits a year, the assessment was that the crocodile posed a significant risk to public safety.</p><p>&nbsp;NParks first explored the option of relocating the crocodile to the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, but given the reserve\u2019s large existing crocodile population of around 20 individuals, it no longer has the capacity for more crocodiles. In any case, moving the crocodile away from the Marina East beach would have risked it returning to the site, venturing to East Coast Park, or even straying into another area with high human activity along our coastline. If so, it would pose a substantial threat to public safety, given its large size and predatory nature.</p><p>&nbsp;NParks also reached out to the Mandai Wildlife Group (MWG). However, as MWG shared with The Straits Times, multiple factors are considered in zoo population management and planning. These include whether the outcome of a move would favour the animal in terms of quality of life and welfare, and possible negative effects on the zoo\u2019s institutional population planning and conservation commitments. In this case, MWG determined that it would not be able to rehome the crocodile in a way that met these criteria.</p><p>&nbsp;As there was no feasible option for relocation or rehoming, NParks had to euthanise the crocodile in the interest of public safety. The decision was not taken lightly. The euthanasia was done by a veterinarian, in accordance with international standards.</p><p>&nbsp;NParks has also put in place other measures to mitigate the risks to public safety from Singapore\u2019s wild crocodile population. For example, at the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, NParks has installed fences to prevent crocodiles from getting onto footpaths. NParks has also installed signs to alert visitors to the presence of crocodiles and to advise them to remain calm and back away if they encounter a crocodile. In addition, NParks conducts regular population surveys of the reserve\u2019s crocodiles and is exploring the use of technology to track their movements.</p><p>NParks agrees with Dr Shawn Lum, Senior Lecturer from the Nanyang Technological University and former President of the Nature Society (Singapore), who wrote an opinion piece in The Straits Times on 27 October 2023, and I quote him: \"We need both a system and a culture for dealing with the joys and risks that come with having beautiful and majestic wild neighbours.\"</p><p>&nbsp;To this end, NParks will continue to monitor and carefully manage the populations of local wildlife species to safeguard public health and safety. NParks will also deepen its collaborations with partners such as the nature community and youth leaders from the Youth Stewards for Nature programme, to promote safe and responsible human-wildlife encounters in our City in Nature.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Ms Nadia Samdin.</p><p><strong>\tMs Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>: Thank you, Speaker, and I thank the Senior Minister of State.&nbsp;I have three follow-up supplementary questions, bearing in mind the more long-term protection and solution to this. Really, the intention is to understand the structured approach.</p><p>First, experts mentioned that there are very few studies to understand the behaviour of crocodiles, especially locally. Is that something that we are looking more into doing?&nbsp;</p><p>Second, thank you for sharing the steps which NParks took. Were other stakeholders consulted during this process? For example, animal welfare groups (AWGs) and things like that.</p><p>The third question is, are groups such as Our Wild Neighbours looking to do more to bring more awareness about such animals so beyond, for example, otters and macaques? Are we also looking into doing more for crocodiles as well as tapirs which we had recently seen in September as well?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Tan Kiat How</strong>: Sir, to the Member's first question, NParks conducts regular ecological studies on the behaviour, habitats and trends of the local flora and fauna population. So, it is not just specific to crocodiles or specific animals \u2013 we do it on a large scale.</p><p>Importantly, we also regularly consult experts from overseas. I mentioned the Northern Territory of Australia. We consult them regularly as part of our effort in Singapore, because they have much more experience dealing with crocodiles in their part of the world. We adopt best practices from jurisdictions like the Northern Territory as well as other parts of the world. And we do consult AWGs regularly.</p><p>In the case of this crocodile, we had to move rather quickly. Once it was sighted, we had to quickly trap it to make sure that the area was safe for the public. But we actively reached out and explored various options to rehome or relocate the crocodile. So, we will continue to engage our stakeholder groups in Singapore.</p><p>And to the Member\u2019s last question, on public education. Yes, we will continue to do more.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Louis Ng.</p><p><strong>\tMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>: Thank you, Sir. I thank Senior Minister of State for the reply. I understand that we had to move quickly in terms of public safety, but could I ask whether the framework that the Senior Minister of State has just shared in this House can be put through a consultation with all the animal welfare groups and nature groups, the youth leaders that he talked about, so that there can be consensus in how we move forward in future cases where there are human-wildlife conflict again?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Tan Kiat How</strong>: Sir, we regularly engage stakeholder groups, animal welfare groups and experts, and share our considerations. So, the framework is not something that is new or unfamiliar to many of our stakeholder groups. It is based on community inputs and, importantly, based on science. We assess what needs to be done based on internationally informed scientific evidence and how to customise it to our context.</p><p>&nbsp;So, we will continue to engage. And we welcome inputs from stakeholders on how we should deal with wildlife encounters along the way.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Singapore's Approach towards Housing of Transgender Persons in Prison Settings", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>5 <strong>Mr Murali Pillai</strong> asked the Minister for Home Affairs what is the Ministry\u2019s approach towards the housing of transgender persons in prison settings in Singapore, having regard to the recent situation in Scotland where a transgender person, convicted of double rape of women, was initially housed in segregation in an all-female jail.</p><p><strong> The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, the case that Mr Murali refers to involved a Scottish male sex offender called Isla Bryson. Isla Bryson was undergoing hormonal treatment at the time of his conviction to transition to a female.</p><p>&nbsp;In January of this year, 2023, Bryson was convicted of raping two women. At the time of conviction, Bryson\u2019s self-identified gender was female. However, his registered sex was male and he still had male genitalia. Bryson was remanded in a women\u2019s prison while awaiting his sentence. That was done based on the Scottish Prison Services' policy, which determines housing arrangements based on an inmate's \"new gender\".</p><p>&nbsp;The prospect of a convicted male rapist serving a sentence in a women's prison sparked public debate and concerns about the safety of the other prisoners. In response, Bryson was moved to a male prison facility.</p><p>&nbsp;In Singapore, our primary consideration is the safety of the inmates.</p><p>As a rule, inmates are housed in a male or female institution based on their registered sex, and not their self-identified gender. There may be situations, however, where it may be better not to house an inmate with other inmates of their registered sex for consideration of safety, either for the safety of the inmate or the safety of the other inmates. </p><p>For example, for a male inmate who is transitioning and who has developed female features, such as breasts, it may not be completely safe for this inmate to be housed together with other male inmates. On the other hand, inmates in a female institution may not feel comfortable if we house with them, a former male who has just completed transitioning to be a female, especially if, like in the case of Bryson, the person had previously committed sexual offences. So, in such cases, we may house them alone in individual cells within the institution of their registered sex, or in a shared cell with other inmates who are in the same situation.</p><p>&nbsp;There may also be situations where inmates, during medical examination upon admission, are found to have external genitalia different from their registered sex. In such cases, Prisons may first house them alone in individual cells in the institution of their registered sex. Prisons will then facilitate an examination by a medical specialist to assess if they have had a complete physical change in genitalia, and if so, will assist the inmate to update their registered sex with the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA). This follows ICA\u2019s requirements that a person\u2019s sex change must first be verified by a local relevant medical specialist before ICA updates the registered sex of the person in its database.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Murali Pillai.</p><p><strong>\tMr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad to note the nuanced approach in dealing with the transgender prisoners. I have two supplementary questions.</p><p>First, may I ask the hon Minister for Home Affairs whether there have been any instances of transgender persons being assaulted, particularly sexually assaulted in our Singapore Prisons and what steps have been taken to deal with that?</p><p>And secondly, I wonder whether there is a regime put in place by the Singapore Prisons Service where transgender persons are regularly interviewed to see how they are faring so that we can make sure that they are safe in the prison environment?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr K Shanmugam</strong>: I thank the Member for the supplementary questions.&nbsp;On the first, if he wants specific data, he can file a question and we can answer. In general, the level of violence in our Prisons is very low, both because of pre-emptive measures and the discipline in the Prisons \u2013 fairly tight control is exercised. So, I would be surprised if there were many such instances. But if he wants specific data, he can file it. It is certainly not something that has come up in a serious way as an issue for a policy decision. And Members can see how we take an approach which is slightly different from the approach, for example, in the Isla Bryson's case.&nbsp;I would say ours is a very practical approach.</p><p>On the second question, if you can remind me.</p><p><strong>\tMr Murali Pillai</strong>: Sir, it is about whether the Prisons have a institutional practice of reaching out to transgender&nbsp;\u2014</p><p><strong>\tMr K Shanmugam</strong>: Yes, okay.&nbsp;Not just for transgender persons but all inmates \u2013 there is an approach as part of the rehabilitation process \u2013 where counsellors are available, and prisoners are interviewed regularly and spoken with, and where inmates are able to raise the issues they have and they will be considered. Of course, not&nbsp;all requests and concerns would be considered as legitimate. Legitimate issues would be dealt with.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Pillai, next question.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Cases Undertaken by Public Defender's Office", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>6 <strong>Mr Murali Pillai</strong> asked the Minister for Law (a) whether an update can be provided on the cases undertaken by the Public Defender\u2019s Office (PDO) since it commenced operations on 1 December 2022; and (b) how does the PDO deal with cases involving alleged crimes that may be viewed by the public as being morally repugnant in assessing whether to provide legal aid.</p><p><strong> The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam)</strong>:\tMr Speaker, Sir, my reply will also address written Question No 10 in the Order Paper for today\u2019s Sitting.</p><p>&nbsp;The Public Defender\u2019s Office (PDO) was set up in December of 2022. So, we are now about 12 months into it. It is to provide criminal defence aid to persons facing non-capital charges and who cannot afford a lawyer. As of September 2023, the PDO has taken up 303 cases from applicants and has taken these to Court.</p><p>Eligible applicants receive representation from either the PDO or the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS). With this co-delivery model, CLAS\u2019 annual case load in 2023 is expected to be lower than in 2022. Nonetheless, this has only been nine to 10 months, and we have to continue to monitor the situation.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p>Some of the applicants for criminal defence aid face charges for minor offences, like shop theft, mischief and so on. But some others face more serious, non-capital charges \u2013 unlicensed moneylending, drug trafficking or sexual assault against vulnerable victims and so on.</p><p>We have to ensure that aid is rendered to those who are deserving and each application for criminal defence aid is subjected to means and merits tests. The means test, in terms of economic means; and the merits test, in terms of having some basis for defence.</p><p>The precise framework is set out. I am not seeking to set that out; I am using short-hand terms here.&nbsp;</p><p>These assessments are not based on the nature of the alleged offences or the moral reprehensibility of the applicant. The means test, as I said earlier, is to ensure that aid is given to those who are unable to afford legal fees. The merits test assesses whether the applicant will benefit from legal representation or has reasonable grounds to defend or appeal his case in Court.</p><p>&nbsp;Sometimes, the PDO comes across cases, which many would consider to be highly represensible. It can relate to sexual assault, child abuse or family violence. The nature of the crime can cause public&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">outrage</span>&nbsp;or <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">concern</span>. But the PDO cannot refuse to handle these cases. That is not the test. The test is not one of moral reprehensibility. The test is whether the person qualifies under the means test and the merits test. It has to handle the cases, as long as they are assessed to have some legal merit.</p><p>One example is a recent Court of Appeal matter involving an accused person who pleaded guilty to sexually penetrating his&nbsp;own younger sister. I think almost all right-thinking members of society would say that it is completely unacceptable, reprehensible. He had committed the offences when he was between the age of 15 and 17 years. He was initially sentenced to 18 years in prison and 16 strokes of the cane. He applied to PDO for aid to appeal against his sentence. Aid was granted as he had fulfilled the means test criteria and PDO assessed that there was merit to the appeal on the ground that the sentence given by the lower Court was excessive. The Court of Appeal agreed and his sentence was reduced by two years.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This scenario sometimes arises in other jurisdictions as well. You have the case of Police Constable Andrew Harper in the United Kingdom. A uniformed officer gave chase to a group of teenagers who were trying to escape after stealing a bike. He was dragged by the car which was driven by one of the teenagers and he died. There was widespread public sympathy for him and outrage over the fact that he died. The three teenagers received legal aid. The Court found them guilty of manslaughter instead of murder.</p><p>&nbsp;In another case in New Zealand, a family of five was mass murdered, and David Bain, who was the only survivor, was accused of the murder. There were mixed views over his innocence. This case has been described as, and I quote, \"the most widely discussed and divisive in New Zealand's criminal history\". After 13 years, he was acquitted of all charges. Without legal aid, he might have remained behind bars until today.</p><p>&nbsp;As I explained in my Ministerial Statement in April last year, the provision of legal aid cannot depend on public outrage against the alleged offender or sympathy for the victim. With the PDO, we will assess each case based on its own merit, and those who have a meritorious case but cannot afford a lawyer will be provided access to legal advice and representation to defend their case in court. This is how we can try to ensure that access to justice is available to more.</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Murali Pillai.</p><p><strong>\tMr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;I am glad to note from the hon Minister for Law's response that PDO has employed a principled stance in defending accused who have been accused of committing morally reprehensible offences. This is actually in line with the ethos of lawyers in the Criminal Bar.&nbsp;I recall the words of the late Mr Subhas Anandan, known as one of the doyens in the Criminal Bar, and he said that everybody deserves a fair trial, including those who have been accused of committing heinous crimes.</p><p>Sir, my question is in relation to the dealings of the PDO officers with such persons. Sometimes, PDO officers may deal with requests on the part of such accused person to put certain lines of questions to vulnerable victims. And PDO officers, based on their assessment, they may not want to take up such lines. For example, cross-examining a vulnerable victim in relation to the person's sexual background and so on.</p><p>How do we protect PDO officers in these circumstances? Because what we do not want also, is to have an allegation made against such a PDO officer and he has to deal with it in the disciplinary setting.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>\tMr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Sir. I would say the framework of the law is clear. What you can ask, what you cannot ask in cross-examination, lawyers will know. The PDO is led by a very senior lawyer who will give guidance to the more junior lawyers. And ultimately in Court, there is the prosecution and there is the Court, which controls proceedings.</p><p>I think the line to be crossed in terms of misconduct, is quite far; there are a number of safeguards. I do not believe that our PDO officers feel that they have to pull back from proper questioning, or be particularly concerned that questions they ask will be considered beyond the pale, in terms of correct and proper discharge of a lawyer's duties in court.</p><p>But, in any event, I will pass on the Member's feedback to the Chief Public Defender.</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Pillai.</p><p><strong>\tMr Murali Pillai</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just clarify, my concern was less in relation to the PDO officer being able to discharge his duties in cross-examination, more in relation to him refraining from taking the instructions from the accused in putting certain positions during cross-examination and that may lend him in an invidious position, when after the fact, the accused who may then be convicted, saying that he has not been given a fair defence. That is the point I was trying to raise.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>\tMr K Shanmugam</strong>: I think the answer to that is: it is a situation faced by all lawyers who practise. What do you think is the right defence or the right case to put forward? What is relevant? What is not relevant? These are assessments and it depends on training and skill.&nbsp;By and large, the Legal Service gets very good officers who apply to join. PDO gets very committed officers and it depends on training.</p><p>I think the whole approach for PDO officers and AGC officers, the&nbsp;prosecution: you do your duty without fear or favour.&nbsp;</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms He Ting Ru.</p><p><strong>\tMs He Ting Ru (Sengkang)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker, and thank you to the Minister for Law on the response to my written question about the effect on CLAS. We look forward to receiving more detailed data about the actual effect on it.&nbsp;I note earlier that the Minister said that the amount that CLAS handles this year is expected to be lower, because of the coming on stream of the PDO.</p><p>Moving on to the means and merit test, I think we are in broad alignment of the principles used to decide whether or not the PDO will take on the cases. I have two supplementary questions for the Minister. The first being, whether the Minister can share a little bit of data about the capacity of the PDO, whether what levels of capacity it is operating at, given that this is a new office? And secondly, whether the Minister can give a breakdown about the cases that the PDO has rejected to take on because they did not satisfy the means test or the merits test, based on the number of applications received?</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>\tMr K Shanmugam</strong>: On the capacity, it is chicken and egg. I mean, it depends on how many cases come up. At present, there is a certain pathway where PDO is intended to build up from last year, based on our assessment of the number of cases that are likely to come up, bearing in mind that we really do not want to go in to territory where lawyers are providing services.</p><p>We want to meet the demand, where the clients today, either by themselves or through their family, are unable to pay for lawyers to represent them. Because this is taxpayers' money and it has got to be used judiciously. I have made that point before several times. There are a number of countries which have gone down this route and then find that they are unable to afford it. If people can afford it, they should go and pay for it.</p><p>Precisely how many cases we will take up, it is subject to how many cases apply. Today, we are not beyond our capacity and we will build up a little bit more as the case load increases. It is a balance between the well-known manpower shortage all across Singapore, including in the legal industry.&nbsp;The fact is that, as a result of our new approach taken a few years ago to drugs, where we no longer prosecute a drug abuser as a criminal, but send such a person to rehabilitation, that has removed a lot of cases from the criminal justice system. Because these people are now in rehabilitation and then, they are released. Even if they come back for the third time or a fourth time, as long as they only abuse drugs and they have not committed any other offence, they are no longer charged. So, the number of criminal cases have come down quite substantially.</p><p>We are a low-crime society. Crimes like these have been redefined as we take a rehabilitation approach.</p><p>With all that, we will look at it. If the number of cases go up, we will employ more people. Or if we cannot, we will explain that this is our capacity and this is what we are prepared to spend. Then, it is up to Parliament to say, \"We think you ought to spend more of taxpayers' money.\" We will come and discuss that, as necessary.</p><p>In terms of the data on the types of cases which have been rejected, what I can say to the Member is that, they have been rejected not because of capacity but because they do not meet our means or merits test. If the Member wants more data on that, she can file a question and we will look it up and answer it. But no case has been turned away because we said we do not have the capacity.</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms He.</p><p><strong>\tMs He Ting Ru</strong>:&nbsp;Sorry, just a quick clarification. I was not suggesting that it was because of capacity. There were actually two separate issues. Given that this is a new office, I am just curious about whether we have had overcapacity? And what are the anticipated cases, what we budgeted for and also what eventually came to pass over the last 11 to 12 months?</p><p>The second point was about the two means and merits testing, the two broad categories that the Minister mentioned earlier. I just wanted to know, as a separate issue, how many cases were actually rejected because of it? Just to clarify this point.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr K Shanmugam</strong>: I can look it up. If the Member files a question, I can look it up and say how many cases did not qualify under the means or merits test.&nbsp;If I am not wrong, I think I have given the numbers that we will build up to. This year, we have about&nbsp;25 officers or so, plus minus, and we can build up as necessary.&nbsp;We have budgeted for building up.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Streamlining of MediFund Application Process to Allow Approval to be Accepted Across Healthcare Institutions", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>7 <strong>Dr Tan Wu Meng</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Health (a) since 2021, how many Singaporeans have successfully applied for MediFund at one healthcare institution and have at least an annual appointment at another healthcare institution (i) within the same cluster and (ii) in a different cluster respectively; (b) how many of such patients have successfully applied for MediFund across all healthcare clusters they have been to; and (c) whether the MediFund application process can be streamlined to support needy Singaporeans who cannot afford their healthcare bills across different healthcare institutions.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung)</strong>: Sir, around 30% of the MediFund beneficiaries received MediFund assistance from more than one institution within the same public healthcare cluster, and around 40% received MediFund assistance from more than one institution across public healthcare clusters. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has devolved MediFund approvals to the MediFund Committees of individual healthcare institutions. This is to enable the Committees to exercise greater discretion in assessing MediFund applications and, thereby, improving their accessibility to these funds. However, this also inevitably leads to multiple assessments for the same patients across institutions: you transfer from acute hospital to community hospital, you go through one more round of assessment, and that adds to their inconvenience.</p><p>&nbsp;We need to strike a balance between these two objectives of flexibility and convenience. In line with that, MOH has reviewed the MediFund application process to make it more seamless with limited impact on the flexibility and discretion of the MediFund Committees. And we will be implementing the following changes by March 2024.</p><p>&nbsp;First, a mutual recognition arrangement between acute hospital and step-down care. This means that when a patient benefiting from MediFund is transferred from an acute hospital to step-down care, he or she will continue to benefit from MediFund without having to re-apply again. As the medical bills, social and financial circumstances of patients may vary over time as they transfer from one institution to another, this automatic extension of MediFund will be for three months or until the receiving institution reassesses the patient\u2019s eligibility for continued MediFund assistance.</p><p>&nbsp;The second change is a mutual recognition arrangement within the same healthcare cluster for outpatient treatment. For example, if a patient is receiving MediFund at an outpatient institution, say, a polyclinic, and he goes to another MediFund institution within the same healthcare cluster, say, a specialist at a Specialised Outpatient Clinic, he will automatically receive support from MediFund and does not need to re-apply for his outpatient bills another time. This automatic support will be valid for a year from the time MediFund is first extended to him at the outpatient setting.</p><p>&nbsp;Last, more support for ComCare graduates. Today, MediFund assistance is automatically extended to needy patients who are under ComCare assistance. MediFund assistance is withdrawn when the patients graduate from the ComCare scheme. So, there is a bit of a cliff effect. So, to strengthen support for these ComCare graduates on their journey to self-reliance, MediFund support will continue for three months after graduation from ComCare.</p><p>&nbsp;I should clarify that under the law, MediFund Committees of each healthcare institution continue to have full discretion over the application outcome and extent of support, to prioritise support towards those who need it the most. Notwithstanding, MOH has been engaging them to agree to support the changes that I just mentioned. MOH will be issuing these guidelines to the MediFund Committees. These enhancements should help smoothen the experience for MediFund beneficiaries as they transfer or seek care in different healthcare settings, and we expect them to come into force by March 2024.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Dr Tan Wu Meng.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Minister for his answer. I declare that I am a medical doctor at a public healthcare institution.</p><p>Eleven years ago, a number of young healthcare workers, including myself and others, had advocated for such improvements within the same healthcare institution campus. In 2016, seven years ago, I had asked a Parliamentary Question on how we could smoothen that journey across different hospitals across Singapore.&nbsp;These are welcome developments, and I would like to ask the Minister two supplementary questions.</p><p>Firstly, we have some elderly residents who are less mobile and who are worried about having to make additional appointments to see a medical social worker, whether it is for review or renewal of their support.&nbsp;A less-mobile resident who needs a caregiver to accompany, this has implications for the caregiver, too.&nbsp;Can I ask the Minister, are there ways we can better resource our medical social worker (MSW) departments so that more patients can have the assessment and review with an MSW on the same day that they come to the clinic or for treatment at the hospital?</p><p>Secondly, can I also ask the Minister, given there are some patients who have great difficulty getting out of the home, would MOH consider working with either the SSOs or the local family service centres to help engage local teams who might be able to visit a <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">less-mobile</span> patient at home, so that the patient does not have to go and make an additional trip purely for the purpose of means testing?</p><p><strong> Mr Ong Ye Kung</strong>: I thank the Member for asking all these questions on behalf of your Clementi residents. [<em>Laughter</em>]. It is, right? He did not say that? Okay. But I thank the Member for the persistence and I know Dr Tan Wu Meng has been knocking on this door for a long time.&nbsp;</p><p>Like all policies, it takes time for us to look at it and find ways to implement it in a way that everyone can accept. So, I think persistence does pay off and I know Dr Tan has also been equally persistent in asking for the elderly who are immobile, in terms of the portability of their subsidy as well of their MediFund eligibility.</p><p>These are valid suggestions. We will have to look at them. One way is to go digital and make things easier, but that also introduces its own impediments. But it will be a useful channel for the immobile or home-bound patients to also apply for medical and financial assistance.</p><p>The other is that we have now implemented Healthier SG and also Age Well SG with a whole network of <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">active ageing centres (</span>AACs) throughout our communities. We want to double the number, expand the network, deepen the kind of help they can extend to our aged residents. So, they can also be a channel from which I would not rule out that, in time to come, they can also be a channel for us to guide our aged and seniors to apply for assistance there.</p><p>So, these are all the possibilities. We will take them in. Persistence does help. So, keep on putting forward such suggestions to us.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Impact of Thailand\u2019s Proposed Land Bridge Project on Singapore\u2019s Competitiveness as Global Seaport", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>8 <strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Transport (a) what is the projected impact on Singapore\u2019s seaports of Thailand\u2019s project to build two deep seaports with a rail and road system to link access between the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand; and (b) how can the competitiveness of Singapore\u2019s seaports be further boosted to maintain their contribution to Singapore\u2019s economy.&nbsp;</p><p>9 <strong>Mr Liang Eng Hwa</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Transport what is the likely impact of Thailand\u2019s proposed land bridge project on Singapore\u2019s status and competitiveness as a global seaport.</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Transport)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to answer Question Nos 8 and 9 on today's Order Paper?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Please proceed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Thank you.

The exact time saving will depend on many factors, such as the time needed to unload the cargo from the vessel, then transport it across the land bridge and load onto the vessel at the other end. These would likely incur additional expenses for shipping companies. So, they need to consider the overall costs versus the benefits, compared to sailing through the Straits of Malacca and Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;Singapore will continue to focus on enhancing our port's connectivity, productivity and competitiveness.

In terms of relationships between countries, for example, between Thailand and the neighbouring countries within ASEAN, has this sort of deliberation been discussed and, in terms of ASEAN transport-to-transport ministries, whether such deliberations have actually emerged and discussions started on this issue?</p><p>Second, with regard to the worst-case scenario, if this does go ahead in the southern part of Thailand and into the Andaman Sea and the rail-and-road like what the Minister mentioned, the ramifications on Singapore's hub status as a seaport does get affected. In the worst-case scenario, will it be a total 100%, the feel from the MOT perspective, and what is the impact as well? I think the Minister mentioned just now, but what would be the worst-case scenario?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Mr Speaker, I think we recognise that when it comes to port operations, this is a&nbsp;global industry and, therefore, he nature of the competition is also global. We cannot prevent others from enhancing their port facilities, their infrastructure, whether it is the land bridge that I addressed in my reply to the questions or some other type of infrastructure enhancements as well as building new capabilities. So, therefore, the key for us is really to focus on how we, the Port of Singapore, can stay competitive and relevant.</p><p>And there are a few elements here. First, of course, is productivity. So, we are investing heavily in technology to raise the productivity of our port operations, working very closely with the port operators, and also with our unions and workers.</p><p>Second, is to look at how we can coordinate better with our shipping lines so that they arrive without waiting too long in our ports, and that when they arrive in our ports, they are able to get good services from a whole suite of services that they will require \u2013 bunkering, supplies&nbsp;\u2013 not just to load and offload cargo.</p><p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, if we look at port operations, it is a network effect that we have to protect. So, the connectivity of our port is the most crucial. And there is a network effect because the more people call at a particular hub, the more value there is to others in a network.</p><p>So, therefore, we must always safeguard our competitiveness, connectivity and productivity.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Ensuring Government's Shared Responsibility Framework for Equitable Sharing of Losses in Bank Scams Offers Adequate Protection", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>10 <strong>Ms Sylvia Lim</strong> asked&nbsp;the Prime Minister regarding the Shared Responsibility Framework that was jointly proposed by MAS and IMDA on 25 October 2023, how does the \"waterfall approach\" on losses arising from phishing scams adequately safeguard consumers' interests.</p><p>11 <strong>Dr Tan Wu Meng</strong> asked&nbsp;the Prime Minister whether the proposed framework for equitable sharing of losses between scam victims and financial institutions will consider (i) the better protection of some elderly scam victims through the use of physical hardware tokens for two-factor authentication rather than digital tokens and (ii) the number of elderly banking customers who have limited digital literacy and are placed in a potentially invidious position when their bank phased out the use of physical hardware tokens.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Prime Minister)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 10 and 11 in today's Order Paper, as well as Written Question Nos and 5 in today's Order Paper, filed by Ms Sylvia Lim, together, as they relate to the proposed Shared Responsibility Framework (SRF)?</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Please proceed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Alvin Tan</strong>: The SRF prescribes a set of anti-scam duties for financial institutions (FIs) and telecommunication companies (telcos) and provides for payouts to victims of phishing scams when these duties are breached. Under SRF, the FI stands at the top of this waterfall. If the FI does not fulfil any of its four anti-scam duties, it will compensate the scam victim fully for the loss suffered, regardless of whether the telco has discharged its duties or the victim has taken the necessary precautions. Likewise, if the FI has fulfilled its duties but the telco has not, then the telco is expected to bear full responsibility for the loss. Only if both the FI and telco have discharged their duties fully, will the customer, who stands at the bottom of the waterfall, have to bear the loss.</p><p>&nbsp;This approach recognises the key roles of FIs and telcos in preventing scams, and also reflects the SRF\u2019s policy intent of strengthening their direct accountability to consumers. It incentivises FIs and telcos to strictly uphold the desired standards of anti-scam controls.</p><p>The duties defined for FIs in the SRF are built on a broader suite of measures that major retail banks are implementing to strengthen the security of digital banking in Singapore.&nbsp;Based on data collected by the Police, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) estimates there were about 15,000 phishing scam cases from 2021 to mid-2023, with an average loss per case of about S$3,900. We do not have data on the number of phishing scams that involve potential breaches of duties by FIs, but such data will be tracked under the SRF going forward.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides assigning accountability for scam losses, the important point is that full implementation by FIs and telcos of their respective safeguards should materially reduce the risk of phishing scams in this first instance. As it stands today, the number of phishing scams has continued to rise in the first half of this year compared to the previous period, but has declined as a proportion of total scam cases from 17% to 13%. The average loss per phishing scam has also declined by 20% over the same period. The Government will continue to monitor this closely. We are all committed to stem this rising tide of scams and losses.</p><p>Dr Tan Wu Meng had asked if the SRF would consider seniors with limited digital literacy when their bank phased out the use of physical hardware tokens. The retail banks already offer physical tokens for customers who request for them. Separate from the SRF, MAS has asked the banks to assess and implement customer authentication mechanisms that are more resistant to both phishing and malware attacks. When these measures are well developed, we can consider them for inclusion into the SRF.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, we should see the SRF as part of broader suite of measures that the Government, the banks and other ecosystem players have progressively implemented to tackle the scourge of scams in Singapore. I covered these measures extensively in my response to the Adjournment Motion filed by Ms Lim in September. The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) released a media statement on 24 October 2023 outlining banks' efforts to protect consumers against scams, including through anti-scam measures and also raising consumer awareness.</p><p>But SRF is not the only means through which scam victims can seek assistance. As ABS announced, banks have discretionary goodwill payment frameworks for their scam victims beyond the SRF. Depending on the circumstances of each scam case, the sophistication of the scam typology and the consumer's financial situation, banks have covered part or all of the losses incurred by scam victims.</p><p>MAS has leaned on the banks to be even more accommodative in applying their goodwill payment frameworks. These goodwill frameworks complement the SRF, which is intended to strengthen the accountability of FIs and telcos to consumers when they have breached their defined duties.</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms Sylvia Lim.</p><p><strong>\tMs Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>: Thank you, Speaker. I have three supplementary questions for the Minister of State. The waterfall approach that is described in the paper, of course, MAS acknowledges that it is actually quite drastically different from the approach being taken in the United Kingdom (UK), where there is going to be a default requirement for banks to compensate customers, unless the customer was fraudulent or grossly negligent.</p><p>I wonder if he will agree with me that the waterfall approach can actually be seen as giving the banks a free pass, if they are able to tick the four boxes. That means to say, if they fulfil the four prescribed duties that are in the paper, they will not have to bear any losses, and based on the case studies in the paper, it appears to be so. So, I wonder whether he will agree with me that, in effect, this is what the waterfall approach will end up achieving for the banks.</p><p>The second question is: he mentioned that the four obligations set out in the paper are already being implemented by the banks. I do not know whether fully or progressively. So, how different is it really from the current status of the banks fulfilling these duties, and is the Government concerned that many scam victims will remain uncompensated under the SRF framework?</p><p>Thirdly, on the question of physical tokens, I have a Parliamentary Question No 44 on this topic, but I do not know why it was not grouped together. He mentioned that customers can request for physical tokens from the banks. I have received many emails from the public to say that this is not offered by their banks, they were told that it has been phased out.</p><p>And I myself went to a local bank to request a hardware token. It was not easy. I was first told that it is not going to be issued. And then, I had to insist and special approval was then obtained from the branch manager to issue the token to me. I was also warned that it might be phased out in due course and they cannot assure me that this service would be available. So, I wonder whether the Minister of State is aware of this as well.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Alvin Tan</strong>: I thank Ms Sylvia Lim. In fact, I want to thank Ms Sylvia Lim and Dr Tan Wu Meng for constantly working on this, together with MAS as well as the Government. I think it is an issue which we are incredibly concerned about and we are taking action.</p><p>If the Member might indulge me, I will first answer the third question. Thank you for that feedback. What we can do and what we will ask the banks to do in terms of the request for tokens, is to make it easier.&nbsp;So, we take that feedback and we will put it back through MAS as well as the banks to ensure that customers who require physical tokens and are going to the banks to request for physical tokens, that process is made easier, particularly if they are not as adept or they do not yet have that confidence with digital tokens. I think that is a very important point, so, thank you for making that point. We will look into it and we will ask the banks to smoothen this process out.</p><p>The Member then also had two questions, with regard to the waterfall approach, as well as whether the banks are already fulfilling duties. Given that the Member had talked about the approach by the UK, maybe I can draw a distinction between what the UK is doing and what we are doing.&nbsp;There are, of course, variations between the UK's approach, as well as our approach, and let me go into detail why we have taken this approach.</p><p>First, the recent moves by the UK and Australia are not the norm globally; and, in fact, these approaches will evolve over time. Singapore, like many jurisdictions, has adopted a slightly different approach on scams that are involving authorised transactions. Authorised transactions are scams, such as love, investment and job scams, for which the customer has authorised the transactions.&nbsp;If you think about the pre-digital banking days, the victims of such scams would have effectively just handed over cash, or written a cheque to these scammers promising a job or an investment return. Now, they are making these transactions through digital means.</p><p>It is challenging for a bank or telco if the SRF were to cover such scams&nbsp;\u2013 it would have to extend to all manner of deceptions, where victims are tricked into willingly handing over their money. That is why for scams involving authorised transactions, in this case, the best approach \u2013 and, in fact, we are raising this awareness&nbsp;\u2013 is for customers to exercise utmost vigilance and take personal responsibility.&nbsp;Therefore, we also stepping up public education efforts, including constant public advisories.</p><p>But as we had discussed in the Adjournment Motion, we also want to guard against the moral hazard risk, in terms of consumers letting their guard down and potentially also working in cahoots with scammers to defraud the banks.</p><p>Both the Member and I have heard feedback, even from the general public, that it would not be fair for the FIs, telcos and, ultimately, the wider group of customers who have exercised care, to have to bear the cost of compensating the scam losses from authorised transactions.</p><p>Scams involving unauthorised transactions are, of course, fundamentally different. The transfer takes place primarily without the victim's knowledge or consent. That is why we place responsibility on the FIs at the top of the waterfall and the telcos at the second layer, to safeguard the consumer.</p><p>Therefore, the SRF is for phishing scams where the customer is tricked into disclosing his bank credentials and scammers are looking at unauthorised withdrawals.</p><p>I will also share a couple of things that are quite important.&nbsp;This framework has to be seen in a broader scheme of things. What the banks have been doing&nbsp;\u2013 and in fact, MAS has been working very closely with them, together with the Cyber Security Agency (CSA), as well as the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA)&nbsp;\u2013 are, and I think the Member would have seen them, some of the changes and developments since the Adjournment Motion.</p><p>First, MAS works very closely with the banks to implement and strengthen anti-scam controls. Since we have discussed in our Adjournment Motion, four major retail banks have rolled out anti-malware controls. These restrict customers' access to their apps, if potentially malicious risky apps not uploaded from official stores or portals, are detected on the customers phones.</p><p>I wanted to update the Member also on how banks are exploring \"money lock\",&nbsp;which allows customers to set aside an amount in their bank accounts which cannot be digitally transferred out without strict authentication measures.&nbsp;For now, DBS, OCBC and UOB will be implementing their versions of \"money lock\" this month.</p><p>I also talked earlier on about the goodwill payment frameworks. MAS is leaning on the banks to be even more accommodative in applying these goodwill payment frameworks, taking into account the sophistication of scam typology, as well as consumers' financial situations, amongst others. So, in concert, these are different measures.</p><p>With regards to the consultation paper, it is ongoing right now. It is from 25 October to 20 December. We are asking six questions, including the questions the Member had asked about the waterfall approach, and about evolving scam typologies and the approaches to this. So, we will take all of the feedback, which have been given to us, and we will review that at the end of it.</p><p>We intend to operationalise the SRF by early next year. So, I encourage the Member to submit, and she can also directly send to me, her comments as well as reviews. There are 15 case studies. I have studied the case studies. These are different duties that either the FIs or telcos have to fulfil.</p><p>But the scenarios are not exhaustive.&nbsp;So, if there are different scenarios that the SRF would benefit from referencing, I think these will be very helpful, as we roll out and operationalise the SRF.</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>: Dr Tan Wu Meng.</p><p><strong>\tDr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I thank the Minister of State for his answer. I can also confirm that my Clementi residents have great difficulty when they approach a bank trying to get a physical token. I, myself, approached a bank as well and was told that the physical token had been phased out and it was not an option.&nbsp;So, it seems quite clear that there are a number of banks across Singapore who are making it very hard for customers to get a physical token&nbsp;\u2013 making it hard without fear or favour, possibly.</p><p>I have three supplementary questions to the Minister. Firstly, I have Clementi residents who were scammed out of their life savings. The preliminary findings suggest these were phishing or malware scams. These residents did not ask to be transitioned to the OTP SMS or a digital token. They did not ask to have all their risks concentrated in a single device&nbsp;\u2013 their handphone.</p><p>When MAS looks at existing cases, given the new framework, will the goodwill consideration by the banks take into account these new norms?</p><p>The second question is, we know that some smartphones already allow malware downloads much more easily than other smartphone operating systems. What is being done to ensure the smartphone manufacturers are awakened to this responsibility and do the right thing by customers?</p><p>Thirdly, Mr Speaker, if I can suggest a consumer protection perspective. If today, there was a consumer home appliance and a reasonable lay person could be tricked into using it the wrong way, causing injury or damage that will cost their life savings, we know what the consumer protection approach would be. Will MAS consider this as well, especially given the clear and present concern that so many Clementi residents face?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong> Mr Alvin Tan</strong>: Sir, I take both Ms Sylvia Lim and Dr Tan Wu Meng's point about the physical tokens. As I mentioned earlier on, we will work with the banks to ensure that for the physical tokens, there is less friction in consumers requesting for and receiving their physical tokens. So, I thank them for that.</p><p>With regard to the goodwill payment as well as malware and also the consumer facing, please allow me to take a step back and share a few different perspectives.</p><p>The first is that if we think about this, the SRF, in its nature and if you compare what we are doing with what other jurisdictions are doing, we would be the first to look at it from an ecosystem perspective. That means, not just the FIs but now the telcos are involved in this waterfall approach, with the consumers being at the bottom of the waterfall but the FIs at the top of the waterfall. That is important.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, you will ask what happens then to other ecosystem players, such as the tech players?</p><p>The SRF consultation will look at both the wider ecosystem players eventually, because this is a live document and scam topologies will change over time; the approach towards addressing these will also change over time. But for now, we are looking at FIs as well as telcos. In fact, we are the first jurisdiction in the world to include telcos in this reimbursement framework. So, it is a good start and it is a start that we will constantly review and refresh.</p><p>With regard to these other ecosystem players, when we look at it, CSA and SPF have been working, in fact, with key tech players. In fact, Google has been working with IMDA, MAS and FIs to strengthen Android security to better detect malicious apps, for example. The banks, as I mentioned earlier on, have money lock, they have prevented site loading as well, providing these friction measures. So, let us look at it in concert.</p><p>With regard to malware, we understand that malware is a rising concern. I know that people have asked questions about why are malware scams excluded from this version of SRF.&nbsp;The authorities are aware. We are concerned. In fact, not just the Member's Clementi residents but I think many other residents have also experienced malware scams, including many family members as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, malware scams are particularly worrying.&nbsp;For now, the duties that are identified for this version of the SRF work well to address phishing scams. But they are not yet suited to address malware scams because of the evolving and developing nature of malware scams.</p><p>But I want to assure both Members and, in fact, Members of this House, that we will review this new scam variant, such as malware, as part of subsequent updates of SRF. In fact, the consultation paper also provides for that as one of the six questions. And I hope that both Members and other Members as well as members of the public will give us your full support and your full ideas so that we can refine and expand if necessary.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Ms Sylvia Lim.</p><p><strong>\tMs Sylvia Lim</strong>: Speaker, two further questions for the Minister of State.&nbsp;Earlier, the Minister of State mentioned that SRF, as proposed by MAS, covers only unauthorised transactions.&nbsp;Does he agree with me that even accepting that premise, so long as the banks fulfil the four obligations defined in the paper, even if the bank was negligent in some other way, the bank can actually push the liability down the waterfall? That is my first clarification.</p><p>Secondly, I wonder whether he is prepared to clarify on this point: assuming the customers are not satisfied under the SRF framework and they have no choice but to go to the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre (FIDReC), can the banks rely on the four obligations in the framework to say that, \"Well, under the framework, we have done these four tasks and the paper says that 100% liability goes to you, so, we would not offer you any settlement payments at all.\" Can they do this at FIDRec?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Alvin Tan</strong>: To the second question, it depends on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;So, for now, if it is unauthorised transactions and if it goes through the waterfall approach, for example, if the FIs have fulfilled their duties, the telcos have fulfilled their duties and, in this case, the customers themselves have fulfilled their duties, then it is up to the banks also to see whether they can implement. And, in fact, they will and have implemented a goodwill payment framework. Importantly, it is that, for it to be fair to the FIs, the telcos as well as consumers, we have to strike a fair balance between responsibility of the FIs and telcos as well as consumers.</p><p>So, the goodwill payment framework has already been operationalised by the banks. MAS will lean in on the banks to tilt the balance towards the banks offering more of these goodwill payment frameworks. But there has to be due consideration.</p><p>For example, if the consumer himself has faced a particular financial hardship, then the banks will take all of these into account when deciding whether to issue a goodwill payment to the consumer.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Dr Tan Wu Meng, last supplementary question from you, please.</p><p><strong>\tDr Tan Wu Meng</strong>: I thank the Minister of State for his answer.&nbsp;Can I ask one more supplementary question?</p><p>I have raised previously in this House the idea of forced vs unforced errors, especially given the emergence of new scams, such as deep fakes, where a bank can be masqueraded in a way that seems very authentic.</p><p>Can I ask the Minister of State, in this framework, if someone has been tricked by a deep fake scam or a scam that seems so authentic that a reasonable person would be at significant risk of being tricked, would that be an authorised transaction and would it be subject to support and compensation under the waterfall system?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Alvin Tan</strong>: Sir,&nbsp;as I mentioned to the Member, there is a distinction that we need to draw between authorised transaction and unauthorised transaction.</p><p>If it is an unauthorised transaction and it is a phishing scam, then, depending on how the particular case falls under and goes through the waterfall framework, if there is a liability, if it is found that the FI has to bear, they will bear. If it is found that the telco has to bear, the telco will bear. And then, finally, again, as I mentioned in my reply to Ms Sylvia Lim, if it appears that the consumer has also fulfilled his responsibility, then the banks themselves will look into the specific circumstances to issue these goodwill payments.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Training for Corporate Partners in Family100 Programme", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>12 <strong>Assoc Prof Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Social and Family Development with reference to the Families100 Programme by OCBC, whether the training provided by the Ministry for volunteers from the bank includes identifying and responding to issues relating to mental health, substance misuse, domestic violence and sexual, physical or emotional abuse or neglect.</p><p>13 <strong>Assoc Prof Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Social and Family Development with reference to the Families100 Programme by OCBC (a) how will the programme be evaluated; and (b) if the evaluation is positive, whether the Ministry will consider expanding the programme to include other population groups and other corporate partners.</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Eric Chua) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, can I have your permission to take Question Nos 12 and 13 in today's Order Paper together, please?</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Go ahead.</p><p><strong>\tMr Eric Chua</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, the Families100 Programme is a corporate contribution by OCBC for its staff to volunteer as ComLink befrienders and be paired with an MSF Family Coach, to journey with our ComLink families. The objective is to help the ComLink family achieve the three \"S\" outcomes of Stability, Self-reliance and Social Mobility.</p><p>Volunteers are introduced to issues and challenges faced by ComLink families. These include mental health issues, substance misuse and domestic violence or abuse. However, the volunteer befrienders are not expected to provide intervention. Such cases should rightfully be managed by social service or healthcare professionals to whom the families would be referred as needed.</p><p>&nbsp;The progress of all 14,000 families with young children in rental housing, including those under the Family100 Programme, will be tracked under ComLink. Hence, there is no need for separate evaluations. We welcome more corporate partners and community groups to volunteer and join us as ComLink befrienders.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Razwana.</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I appreciate the responses from the Ministry and I am glad that we have put in place some sort of framework to train the staff that are handling such matters.&nbsp;I would like to clarify if there is any standard procedure, in terms of how the referral is done by these volunteers to the social service agencies.</p><p><strong>\tMr Eric Chua</strong>: I thank the Member for her supplementary question.&nbsp;When going out and talking to these ComLink families, what we need to remember is that the volunteer befrienders are always paired with a Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) Family Coach, who is a professional in this case.</p><p>So, they always go out in pairs, work with these families, talk through their strengths as well as their weaknesses and then, at the end of each session, there will be a debrief and they can look at what are the services, packages, schemes or grants that the families are probably suited and qualify for.</p><p>So, it is a considered and paired approach that we are taking. So, the befriender is not one who is left to his or her own devices and he is always benefiting from the help of the MSF Family Coach.

I would encourage them to file a question on that so that we could have a discussion.</p><p>Let me try and address his first two questions.</p><p>I would say though that I would push back a little and disagree with his characterisations that we are either going to outsource or we are going to develop capabilities locally. And, in truth, you have to do both and even large continent-sized countries are doing both. We do recognise the potential of FMs to significantly enhance productivity to enable new services.&nbsp;And most use cases in the world leverage on existing FMs, either off-the-shelf, customise via methods, such as retrieval augmentation of finetuning.</p><p>We do have groups that are experimenting and building FMs on such issues, such as to better translate regional languages, improving our understanding on how to govern FMs.</p><p>But we do so in a prudent and phased manner. We are starting with smaller size models. We have received industry interest to collaborate.

(proc text)]</h6><h6>12.03 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"</p><p>The Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) (Amendment) Bill amends the Act to provide for tax incentive changes which were introduced in Budget 2022 and Budget 2023.&nbsp;There are a total of six sets of legislative changes contained in the Bill. Let me first elaborate on the changes announced at Budget 2022.</p><p>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) had announced at Budget 2022 the discontinuance of the Integrated Investment Allowance (IIA) scheme after 31 December 2022. This IIA scheme, which was introduced in 2012, was intended to incentivise manufacturers to adopt twin models of their operations between Singapore and Iskandar Malaysia in Johor, or the islands of Batam, Bintan and Karimun in Indonesia. However, administrative complexities of tax computation in different jurisdictions made it challenging to operationalise the scheme.</p><p>As the IIA scheme was allowed to lapse after 31 December 2022, clause 16 deletes Part 9 of the Act to remove references to the IIA scheme while clause 19 provides for consequential amendments to the Income Tax Act 1947.</p><p>The second tax incentive scheme to be amended pertains to the Approved Foreign Loan (AFL) scheme.</p><p>First, clause 7 will extend the AFL scheme to 31 December 2028. Second, new section 35(2) and (4) are inserted by clause 8 to enhance the powers of the Minister for Trade and Industry and the Minister for Finance.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, an AFL incentive recipient incurs a debt payable to the Government if the recipient contravenes a condition of approval or section 34 by selling, transferring or disposing of equipment that was purchased and financed from an approved foreign loan without the Minister for Trade and Industry's permission.&nbsp;This debt arises even when the company has already delivered its economic commitments as part of the AFL support or when the contraventions were unintentional or when any decision to sell, transfer or dispose of the equipment was reasonable and not of wilful intent.</p><p>With the new amendments, the Minister for Trade and Industry may decide whether to revoke the approval for the loan where any relevant contravention has taken place. If the approval is revoked, a debt to the Government arises.&nbsp;But the Minister for Finance may waive the debt in whole or in part if the Minister for Finance is satisfied that the recipient did not knowingly or intentionally contravene the condition or section 34.</p><p>This legislative change allows debt liabilities to be imposed in a more targeted manner.&nbsp;</p><p>The third tax incentive scheme is the Approved Royalties Incentive (ARI) scheme.&nbsp;The legislative amendments in clauses 2, 10 and 12 will extend the scheme by five years to 31 December 2028 and enhance the administration of the ARI scheme by shifting from an agreement-based approach to an activity-based approach from 1 April 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the agreement-based approach that was in place before 1 April 2023, companies were required to obtain the Economic Development Board (EDB)'s approval for every addition of an agreement or variation of an agreement in the ARI certificate. However, as the use of intangible assets and intellectual property has become more pervasive, we need a more flexible approach to respond to companies' investment interests.</p><p>Under the activity-based approach, the scope of the approved activity is specified in the certificate. Companies will enjoy tax exemptions or concessionary withholding tax rates for royalties, fees or contributions payable under all agreements entered into for the purpose of the approved activity. Companies will not need to undergo the onerous administrative process of seeking new approvals each time a new agreement is reached or an existing agreement is varied.</p><p>To be clear, this is not a relaxation of the scheme. We will still clearly define the activities which are supportable under the ARI incentive and companies that make claims under agreements which are not covered by a supportable activity will still have their claims rejected and must pay the full prevailing withholding tax.</p><p>Sir, please allow me to elaborate next on the tax incentive changes announced at Budget 2023.</p><p>The Pioneer Certificate (PC) scheme and the Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI) scheme will be extended by five years to 31 December 2028.&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 5 will effect the extension of the PC scheme while clause 6 will effect that of the DEI scheme. Both schemes remain relevant and effective in anchoring desired investments in Singapore.</p><p>The fifth set of legislative amendments applies to the Investment Allowance (IA) scheme.</p><p>The amendments to the IA scheme include (a) the extension of the IA scheme by five years for certain qualifying activities by clause 14(d) and 14(e); and (b) the removal of the qualifying activity of aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul services, given it has been assessed to be no longer relevant and the power to approve such projects lapsed in 2015. Clauses 13, 14(a), 14(b) and 14(c) remove references to this qualifying activity.</p><p>The last legislative amendment in clause 18 inserts a new section 61A to provide the Minister for Trade and Industry with retrospective revocation powers across all incentives under the Act in two scenarios. The first scenario is the removal of any activity, agreement, arrangement, product or other matter from a certificate or letter. The second scenario is the revocation of any approval, certificate or letter.&nbsp;</p><p>This amendment is aligned with the Income Tax Act 1947 and will allow the Government to respond proportionately when dealing with incentive breaches. There is no impact on tax incentive recipients who meet their conditions and commitments.&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6>12.10 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Mark Lee (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;I declare my interest as a board member and a shareholder of Crystal International Group Limited, whose group turnover is in excess of <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">\u20ac</span>750 million and whose related entities have received or are in the process of applying for tax incentives.&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20231107/vernacular-Mark Lee EEI 7Nov2023-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;Singapore is home to a vibrant and diversified corporate ecosystem. There are close to 40,000 international companies in Singapore, contributing about 30% of employment and 56% to value added over the past few years. Foreign direct investment inflow into Singapore reached $195 billion in 2022, reflecting robust growth year-on-year. MNCs are an important part of a healthy economy, driving growth sectors and working in partnership with SMEs in their value chain to deliver value to the economy.</p><p>The business community supports the Economic Expansion Incentives Scheme as this is an important aspect of our national strategy to attract and anchor MNCs in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): The latest amendment to the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Bill seeks to enhance the existing incentives scheme by introducing a new Approved Activities scheme in place of the ARI scheme.&nbsp;This change includes transitional provisions to facilitate a smooth transition to support the shift to the new scheme.</p><p>This amendment is a response to the evolving complexity of business structures, which necessitates a more dynamic and robust framework for managing tax incentives. The new scheme simplifies the process for businesses to manage shared costs amongst various agreements and streamlines the administration of tax incentives by considering the operations of large companies that are engaged in multiple contracts for a fixed activity.</p><p>Nevertheless, with the shift from an approval-centric system to an activity-centric system, it becomes essential to define what constitutes an approved activity more clearly. Given the diverse and concurrent projects businesses often undertake, the Government could offer clear guidelines and examples of eligible activities. Providing this clarity will facilitate the application process, reduce duplications and lessen the need for handling exceptions.</p><p>Shifting focus to a wider perspective, Singapore's dedication to fostering a favourable tax landscape for businesses remains steadfast. This dedication is exemplified by the latest revision.</p><p>In the previous year, this Bill was amended to support companies undertaking emission reduction initiatives, encompassing investment in technology and equipment that contributes to quantifiable reductions in greenhouse gases.</p><p>This proactive change, spurred by feedback from the industry, underscores the significance of continual regulatory reviews. It ensures that our tax incentives stay in step with both national goals and the changing landscapes of business and investments.</p><p>However, it is crucial to be cognisant of broader international trends, like the forthcoming Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) 2.0 guidelines, which pose a challenge to the effectiveness of Singapore's tax incentives, particularly for multinational enterprises with a global turnover of at least \u20ac750 million. In response to these changes, the Singapore Government has pledged to bolster non-tax benefits to preserve and enhance Singapore\u2019s competitive appeal in a landscape that is rapidly evolving due to the new BEPS 2.0 norms.</p><p>From a competitive vantage point, these incentives remain particularly crucial especially for certain mobile activities such as finance and research and development. Such activities are pivotal and economically significant to Singapore. The stark reality is that some multinational enterprises may hesitate at the prospect of meeting the conditions of these incentives, like substantial investment thresholds and local employment quotas, if the tax benefits do not translate into significant global savings.&nbsp;</p><p>With this in mind, it is imperative for the Government to explore how our incentives might evolve to align with the Pillar 2 regulations of the BEPS framework. Tax professionals have identified a variety of \"BEPS-protected\" incentives that comply with the Pillar 2 Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules. Therefore, studying these models could provide us with a pathway to adapt and preserve the efficacy of Singapore's tax incentives.&nbsp;</p><p>One viable path forward could be the introduction of Qualified Refundable Tax Credits (QRTCs). These credits would be refundable, translating into cash or cash equivalents over a four-year period. QRTCs could be strategically directed towards fostering innovation, acting as an enhancement to the current research and development (R&amp;D) tax incentives.</p><p>Another possible solution might be the Market Transferable Tax Credit (MTTC), which could function as an investment tax credit. This credit would bolster sustainability and innovation-driven investments. Comparable tax credits are in operation in countries like the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States, where they are treated as income rather than mere tax deductions for GLoBE purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>Another way to manage the impact of BEPS 2.0 on businesses and investments is to offer more expenditure-related incentives. For example, Singapore does not offer building allowances unless they meet the conditions for Land Intensification Allowance. However, not all business activities are suited to intensify land use and certain investments do not even qualify for such allowances in the first place, such as clean rooms and even R&amp;D facilities.</p><p>These types of investments are significant and a multi-faceted strategy is crucial to navigate the intricacies introduced by Pillar 2. Such a strategy ensures Singapore remains a top-tier destination for innovation among multinational enterprises.</p><p>In conclusion, the Government's continuous refinement of our tax incentive strategies represents and reflects our strong dedication to evolving alongside the global business and taxation landscape, reinforcing Singapore\u2019s allure as a prime location for multinational companies (MNCs).&nbsp;These reforms not only appeal to MNCs but also generate a ripple effect that benefits small and medium-sized enterprises by enhancing their international ties, increasing business opportunities and fostering technological partnerships.&nbsp;</p><p>For a small, open economy like ours, these initiatives are critical by preserving our competitive edge and ensuring a favourable climate for sustainable economic development and the success of businesses of all scales.&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.&nbsp;</p><h6>12.20 pm</h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I had previously spoken on multiple occasions about the importance of Government policy to further orientate our economy toward knowledge-intensive industries.</p><p>A few months back, I did so in the context of the National Productivity Fund, where I stressed how funding for R&amp;D should be clearly directed toward onshore investments and technology adoption. And in response to Deputy Prime Minister Wong's Budget speech this year, I also specifically touched on how R&amp;D credits being explicitly exempted from the OECD's BEPS 2.0 framework may be exploited as a potential loophole by multinationals.</p><p>Today, I hope to begin by revisiting the earlier issue of R&amp;D credit loopholes in light of the provisions of this Bill.&nbsp;I will then move on to the broader topic of how we plan to continue providing incentives for corporations to locate in Singapore in the wake of a full roll-out of BEPS.</p><p>Clauses 10 through 12 make amendments to sections 37 and 39 of the original Act and also introduce a new section 40.&nbsp;These all deal with a new approved royalty initiative or ARI scheme which spells out tax benefits for royalties as well as technical assistance fees or contributions to R&amp;D costs. These amendments set out specific protection associated with intellectual property (IP). To be clear, IP has value and should be appropriately remunerated, a point that I had also made previously on two occasions in this House.</p><p>But in those speeches, I also suggested that there is a tendency for producers of IP to seek protection that would allow them to secure intellectual monopolies and that not every class of IP is deserving of equal protection.</p><p>In the context of this Bill, then my first concern whether the granting of tax concessions for royalties may be justified.&nbsp;In my mind, providing such relief for royalties received by small, independent producers of IP is entirely reasonable, since the amounts involved are typically modest and are likely to constitute a very paltry supplementary income for artists involved in creative work for which we would like very much to encourage in Singapore.</p><p>At this point, I should declare that for many years, my family received royalties associated with several musical compositions by my father, although we have since allowed these to lapse.</p><p>However, it is less clear that tax relief for royalties received at the corporate level, especially in large multinationals, are as easily justifiable. True. We wish to encourage creativity and innovation and tax exemptions are indeed one way to do so. However, tax incentives offered at the pre-production stage are also an important way to encourage taking on activities such as R&amp;D that carry uncertain payoffs.</p><p>But royalties received by large corporations occur after the fact and, moreover, are likely to already be subject to corporate taxation in other jurisdictions in which the MNC operates. While it is true that corporations consider the full expected returns from their investments even before embarking on any innovative effort, it is unclear why Singapore should be the jurisdiction that offers such an ex-post write-off, if others do not.</p><p>A second concern has to do with how the new ARI scheme differs from our existing programmes. What was the take-up rate of the old ARI and how does the Ministry believe that the new scheme improves on the old?&nbsp;Relatedly, how does the new ARI differ from the pioneer industry, pioneer service and development and expansion incentives that also appear to fall under the Economic Expansion Incentives Act.</p><p>And, finally, my third and perhaps greatest concern has to do with the risk that the expanded scope of the new ARI seems to now offer tax exemptions to non-resident persons, as opposed to being limited to the current treatment where royalties qualify for tax concessions only if they are earned in Singapore by either residents or permanent establishments here.</p><p>Section 40(b), for instance, states that and, I quote, \"relevant royalties, fees or contributions are payable to a non-resident person during the period of approval for that activity.\"&nbsp;If this is true, I am concerned that the provision may inadvertently become a means for international companies to use the R&amp;D tax credits as a means of skirting their BEPS 2.0 minimum tax obligations, with very little direct benefits to Singapore.</p><p>The mechanism would entail MNC's booking royalties in Singapore for the purposes of qualifying for the tax write-off even when such IP are unrelated to income earned or derived in Singapore, as was previously the case. If so, then we would merely have facilitated a continued race to the bottom in tax competition, where governments no longer compete to set the lowest tax rate but grant the most lavish R&amp;D tax credits.</p><p>To get a foretaste of what this could imply it is instructive to look to Ireland.&nbsp;Due to the overwhelming presence of multinationals booking IP activity and income, often classified as intangibles in Ireland, there has been an increasing divergence in Irish gross domestic product, which measures all activity recorded within the country's borders, and Irish gross national income, which nets out foreign income, including profits sent abroad.&nbsp;Further, accounting for depreciation of IP reviews, by one calculation, gross national income (GNI) is only a little more than half of official gross domestic product (GDP) in Ireland.&nbsp;</p><p>These distortions provide an inaccurate picture of genuine economic progress in that country and, perhaps more critically, provide few jobs or income to Irish citizens.&nbsp;The artificial, almost comical nature of the phenomenon has even been dubbed leprechaun economics by Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman.</p><p>Sir, my hope is that nobody will start to question whether Singapore's hard-won economic progress is actually \"pontianak\" or \"hantu\" economics and by the same token, I trust that the treatment of royalties in the new ARI scheme will not inadvertently give rise to the same pathology.</p><p>Allow me to now move on to the broader context of the Bill, which has to do with our nation's preparedness for the roll-out of BEPS 2.0.&nbsp;As this House is well aware, the agreement continues to grind inexorably forward, most recently making significant progress on negotiation pertaining to amounts A and B of Pillar 1 and subject to tax rule of Pillar 2.&nbsp;The onus is thus on us as a nation to prepare our economy, companies and workers to thrive beyond 2024 when agreement comes into fully effect.</p><p>Will the Ministry, therefore, share with this House whether it has made progress in projections of the potential revenue impact should the agreement proceed as planned?&nbsp;MOF had previously explained, and I quote, that \"Pillar 1 will result in a loss of revenue\".</p><p>While the minimum effective tax rate top-up could result in higher tax revenue, if there is limited flight in existing economic activity,&nbsp;I appreciate that it is of course impossible to fully predict with much precision what the net revenue outcome is going to be. But surely the Ministry has at least outlined revenue implications based on several possible scenarios. If so, would the MOF share their homework with this House?</p><p>More generally, it would be useful to understand the Government's strategy for and plans to attract and retain foreign investments going forward.&nbsp;The Ministry has indicated that Singapore will need to strengthen non-tax factors to stay competitive in a post-BEPS world.</p><p>What does the Government have in mind in terms of these non-tax factors beyond the usual arguments that we offer a skilled workforce, cutting-edge infrastructure and secure investment protections?&nbsp;After all, these elements have been unchanging value propositions for quite a while now. And if there are changes at the margin that diminish our attractiveness, we must surely offset this by improving something that we have hitherto not yet been able to offer.</p><p>Mr Speaker, the&nbsp;stipulations in this Bill are another small step forward for preparing our economy for a post-BEPS world and for that reason it has my support.&nbsp;It is important, however, that in doing so we do not compromise the purpose of BEPS and inadvertently become a tool for multinational tax evasion but instead focus on the real intangibles, we can offer as a nation to be an attractive destination for domestic and foreign investment, both into 2024 as well as beyond.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Minister of State Tan.</p><h6>12.30 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Alvin Tan</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Members Mark Lee as well as Assoc Prof Jamus Lim for their support of the Bill and also for giving me the opportunity to make some clarifications.</p><p>Let me start. There were a lot going on in both their speeches, so, allow me to take them one by one.</p><p>Mr Mark Lee asked for greater clarity on the activities supportable under the ARI scheme and highlighted the importance of refreshing our slate of incentives to align with BEPS 2.0 rules. These are quite similar to what Assoc Prof Lim had also mentioned.</p><p>Allow me to first clarify on the ARI.&nbsp;There is no change in the scope and intent in terms of what the Government seeks to support under ARI with this enhancement of the approval approach from an agreement-based approach, as I mentioned earlier on, an activities-based approach.</p><p>I agree with the Member on the need for clarity over the scope of an approved activity and I wish to assure Members that this new approach will be no different from the approach that we already take for other tax incentives, such as the Development and Expansion Incentive, as I mentioned earlier on.</p><p>Given that we aim to attract investments of different profiles and across sectors, the approved activity could vary from project to project. EDB will indeed work with companies to define what approved activity would mean in the context of a particular investment. And it is in the interest of both the company as well as the Government for this to be very clearly articulated.</p><p>Mr Mark Lee also correctly noted that the implementation of Pillar 2 of BEPS 2.0 could reduce the effectiveness of certain tax incentives since multinational enterprises with consolidated annual revenues of at least \u20ac750 million would have to bear a minimum effective tax rate (METR) of 15%, wherever they operate.&nbsp;Assoc Prof Jamus Lim mentioned this as well. It means that we must work even harder to secure Singapore's competitiveness as an investment location.</p><p>I would like to emphasise that tax incentives still do remain an important tool for us for two reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>First, multinationals under the revenue threshold of \u20ac750 million are not in the scope of Pillar 2, as Members known, and will thus continue to benefit from concessionary tax rate incentives.</p><p>Second, the METR of 15% under Pillar 2 does not apply to withholding taxes, which the AFL and ARI schemes seek to reduce.&nbsp;I would like to assure Members that the Government maintains a high bar in terms of the commitments expected from recipients of these incentives. We will hold incentive recipients accountable for their commitments and will not hesitate to amend or withdraw the incentives in the event of breaches, especially if these beaches are wilful ones.</p><p>I would also like to thank Members for their suggestions on the different types of incentives that may comply with Pillar 2 of GloBE rules. The Government reviews and refreshes our incentive toolkit on an ongoing basis even as we strengthen our non-incentive advantages, such as the ones that Assoc Prof Jamus Lim had mentioned \u2013 our talent pool, our infrastructure, our connectivity. We will take the Members' suggestions into account during these reviews.</p><p>Companies take the total cost of the business into account. They do not look at withholding taxes just in isolation. We consider providing concessionary withholding tax only if it is a necessary to anchor the investment here in Singapore, for the benefit of Singaporeans.</p><p>To Assoc Prof Jamus Lim's question, there is actually no change in the intent of the ARI.&nbsp;The aim is and has always been to anchor economic benefits in Singapore.&nbsp;We are just making it easier to administer it for companies and that helps to spur investments into Singapore. I hope that clarifies.</p><p>We consider tax incentives notional in nature. If not for these incentives, there is actually a very real potential that these investments may not be here&nbsp;\u2013 in which case, then, there is just no tax to collect in the first place.</p><p>So, I fully agree on a need to strengthen our non-tax propositions and we are working hard on all of the natural advantages that Singapore has, that I think this House had mentioned and Assoc Prof Jamus Lim in the past had also mentioned.&nbsp;I thank both Members for their reviews.</p><p>Again, let me reiterate in closing that our tax incentives are really useful tools which our economic agencies like Enterprise Singapore, EDB and the rest, are able to use to attract new investment commitments into Singapore. We know for this that will provide intangible economic benefits in the form of value added, in the form of business expenditure. Ultimately, what we want in this House is good jobs for Singaporeans.</p><p>Among the variety of tools available, tax incentives have been one of the most economically efficient as the tax benefit is premised on the company being profitable. We have good success in securing substantive business investments and also generating positive economic outcomes.</p><p>Regardless of their country of origin or size, firms can stand to benefit from tax incentives as long as their investments are able to generate substantive economic outcomes \u2013 the ones that I had just mentioned.&nbsp;I hope that we can continue to anchor more firms and new capabilities in Singapore as the economy grows and as developments, including in METR, as well as BEPS evolve over time.</p><p>Through the use of these incentives, there will also be benefits generated to the local ecosystem through the transfer of tech capabilities and skillsets to SMEs, as Mr Mark Lee had mentioned and re-emphasised.</p><p>Mr Speaker, I would like to emphasise and assure Members of this House that the Government is committed to maintaining a business-friendly environment here in Singapore. We will continue to take in Members' reviews, requests and comments, and review the effectiveness our incentives regularly in order to better influence investors' investment decisions and, ultimately, help Singaporeans and Singapore businesses capture economic value generated through these investments.</p><p>We look forward to the continued support of this House in our endeavours.</p><h6>12.37 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Any questions for the Minister of State?

Such a lawyer (NP) may be admitted as an A&amp;S and will have the rights and obligations of one after the completion of the prescribed practice training period.</p><p>This enhancement to the admission framework recognises that a legal education can lead to different legal career pathways.&nbsp;</p><p>MinLaw remains focused on developing a strong core of practising lawyers to serve Singapore's society and to provide high quality legal services to enhance our business environment.&nbsp;However, our reality is one of a fast-changing operating environment and we need legal talent to support all aspects of our economy and society.</p><p>Law graduates can join in-house counsel teams, legal tech companies or enter academia.&nbsp;They can contribute to the legal services sector and in other sectors which may benefit from legal expertise in a variety of roles and functions.&nbsp;</p><p>For those who do not intend to practise, this change allows them to be admitted to the Singapore Bar earlier, since they do not need to complete practice training.&nbsp;This also frees up more practice training contracts for those who intend to practise law.</p><p>As highlighted in the Forward SG report, one of our shared visions is to embrace a wider variety of career pathways. We are committed to recognising that there are diverse pathways that are available for our lawyers to develop their full potential. Hence, this change will allow law graduates who do not wish to practise to embark on their chosen career pathways sooner.</p><p>A lawyer (NP)\u2019s rights and obligations will be similar to a non-practising A&amp;S who does not have in force a Practising Certificate (PC). For example, lawyers (NP) may work as in-house counsel and may provide pro bono or free legal advice.&nbsp;They will also be members of the Singapore Academy of Law and be members of the Law Society of Singapore. Lawyers (NP) will also be officers of the court, like A&amp;Ses today, and subject to the disciplinary oversight of the Courts.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, under Clause 16 of the Bill, a lawyer (NP) who is employed by a law practice, but is not a practice trainee and who does not have a provisional PC, may be registered as a regulated non-practitioner under section 36G of the Act. Such registration will be subject to the prevailing framework for regulated non-practitioners, including being entitled to be a director, partner or shareholder of a law firm or similar entity.&nbsp;</p><p>I will elaborate on provisional PCs later on.</p><p>Similarly, the Bill will also permit non-practising A&amp;Ses to be registered as regulated non-practitioners, subject to the prevailing requirements. This acknowledges that an individual who is admitted to the Singapore Bar, can contribute to a law practice even if he or she does not practise.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving on, I also wish to highlight that the Committee also recommended lengthening the practice training period, which is currently a minimum of six months, to one year. While this change will be given effect to via upcoming amendments to the subsidiary legislation, I would like to mention this briefly, so that Members have an overall picture of the changes.</p><p>This change is only one example of consistent efforts to holistically lift the standards of the legal industry. My Ministry is also involved in ongoing reviews in other aspects covering areas such as legal education, and ethics and professional standards of lawyers.</p><p>These reviews aim to enhance the quality of the legal workforce and complement the Committee\u2019s recommendations.</p><p>In an increasingly complex and competitive operating environment, there is a greater demand for legal professionals that provide high-quality advice and solutions to clients with multi-faceted problems.&nbsp;</p><p>One key objective is to produce law graduates who will be equipped with the necessary skill sets and be better prepared to enter into the legal workforce.</p><p>In conjunction with these efforts, the lengthened practice training period will: give practice trainees a longer period of direct mentorship to develop a strong foundation for a sustainable and fulfilling career in legal practice; better equip practice trainees for entry into private practice through greater exposure to a range of practice areas; and allow law practices to make a more holistic assessment of trainees\u2019 performance.</p><p>In other jurisdictions like France, Germany and Hong Kong, there is also emphasis on the practice training to complement formal education where solicitors are required to undergo two years of training.&nbsp;</p><p>The SILE has published a detailed Notice on New Admission Regime on their website. The Notice captures the proposals from the multi-stakeholder working groups. It outlines the new training requirements and options available to law graduates seeking to complete their practice training period.</p><p>MinLaw is aware of industry concerns surrounding the lengthened practice training period, including the additional strain this may place on both future practice trainees and law practices seeking to offer practice training contracts.&nbsp;</p><p>MinLaw is working closely with the SILE and the Law Society on these concerns. Areas that we are looking into include arrangements for leave days and medical leave, and renumeration for practice trainees commensurate with their contributions during their training period.&nbsp;</p><p>Another amendment relates to providing trainees the option to practise provisionally under supervision. Clause 12 introduces a framework for \u201cProvisional Practising Certificates\u201d, or provisional PC. A lawyer (NP) who is a practice trainee may apply for a provisional PC after completing at least six months of practice training.&nbsp;</p><p>This will replace the existing \u201cpart-call\u201d regime, which only permits practice trainees to have restricted rights of audience to appear and plead before the Courts.&nbsp;The provisional PC provides exposure to a broader variety of experiences that more closely reflect the realities and rigours of private practice.&nbsp;</p><p>A practice trainee who has a provisional PC will be able to undertake work that a practising A&amp;S may do \u2013 for example, appear and plead in Court, and render legal advice to clients&nbsp;\u2013 provided this is done under the supervision of his or her supervising solicitor.</p><p>This will contribute to building a stronger foundation for young lawyers who are starting their legal careers and can provide a smoother transition to independent practice.&nbsp;</p><p>Clause 12 also sets out the power of the Attorney-General, the Registrar of the Supreme Court, and the Council of the Law Society of Singapore in respect of the issue of provisional PCs and the imposition of any further conditions thereof. It also sets out when an application for a provisional PC may be refused, and when a provisional PC may be suspended or cancelled.&nbsp;</p><p>Provision is also made for appeals against the Registrar\u2019s decisions in provisional PC applications, and to introduce measures concerning a lawyer (NP)\u2019s fitness to practise provisionally and when a lawyer (NP) is disqualified from applying for a provisional PC.&nbsp;These are substantively similar to the corresponding provisions in the LPA concerning PCs and A&amp;Ses.&nbsp;</p><p>The next amendment in the Bill provides flexibility for practice trainees to complete up to three months of their practice training at approved in-house legal departments of approved non-law practice entities.&nbsp;This expands the training options for practice trainees and can add to their breadth of practical and commercial experience, so that they are better able to meet the needs of the businesses.</p><p>To ensure that these practice trainees receive proper supervision and training within the in-house legal department, an approved non-law practice entity must be of a minimum size and handle a reasonable amount of Singapore law-related work.&nbsp;The SILE, in consultation with the working group, is working through the applicable criteria.&nbsp;These criteria will be prescribed in the subsidiary legislation.</p><p>A further amendment relates to the moratorium for practice training contract applications. At present, the search for practice training contracts is highly competitive. MinLaw has received feedback that law students feel pressured to start competing with their peers for practice training contracts from as early as their first year in law school.&nbsp;</p><p>The Committee recommended a moratorium period, before which law students cannot apply for practice training contracts and&nbsp;law practices cannot offer them.&nbsp;This would alleviate the law students\u2019 anxieties in the practice training contract application process. Further details on the moratorium\u2019s implementation will be announced in due course. This includes when the moratorium will be introduced, its duration, the relevant criteria for compliance, and the consequences of any breach.&nbsp;The Bill amends the Act to provide flexibility to implement these details in the future.</p><p>The next set of amendments relate to interim disciplinary provisions. Clauses 25 provides that lawyers (NP) are officers of the Supreme Court. Just like A&amp;Ses, lawyers (NP) will be subject to the disciplinary proceedings framework in Part 7 of the Act.&nbsp;</p><p>In this regard, MinLaw is currently conducting a broader review of the Act\u2019s disciplinary proceedings framework as a whole, with a view towards further legislative amendments in the future.&nbsp;This review takes into account recent developments in the case law, as well as feedback from various stakeholders on the Act\u2019s existing provisions.&nbsp;In doing so, MinLaw aims to ensure that the law is clear, that disciplinary proceedings against lawyers are conducted expeditiously and fairly, and that the Act continues to engender public trust in the legal profession.</p><p>This review is complex. Members who are lawyers will appreciate how the Act\u2019s various discipline-related provisions are inter-connected. MinLaw will require more time to complete the review, including consulting relevant stakeholders.</p><p>In the meantime, clauses 26 to 31 of the Bill insert interim provisions for the discipline of lawyers (NP). These interim provisions are based on today\u2019s existing provisions for the discipline of non-practising A&amp;Ses, practice trainees and&nbsp;\u201cpart-called\u201d individuals, with adjustments where appropriate. The substance of these interim provisions are subject to change, pending the completion of the review.</p><p>The amendment at clause 48 of the Bill contains transitional arrangements to implement the changes. As announced by my Ministry earlier in February this year, the new admission framework will take effect from the 2024 session of the Part B Bar Examinations onwards.</p><p>Individuals who became qualified persons before 1 November 2023 may apply for admission to the Singapore Bar under the current admission framework, if they meet the current requirements and apply for admission as an A&amp;S before the 2024 session of the Part B Examinations.</p><p>We recognise, however, that some individuals may become qualified persons between 1 November 2023 and 31 January 2024, and are able to complete six months of practice training before the new admission framework is implemented in 2024.&nbsp;They will be able to apply for&nbsp;admission as an A&amp;S under the current admission framework if they pass the Part B examinations by a date prescribed in subsidiary legislation. This prescribed date will be in the second half of 2025.</p><p>This Bill also makes miscellaneous and technical amendments to the Act and clarifies certain provisions based on stakeholders\u2019 feedback.&nbsp;I will highlight two such amendments.</p><p>The first clarifies the Court\u2019s powers in an application to be admitted to the Singapore Bar,&nbsp;after the recent incidents of individuals cheating during the Part B examinations.&nbsp;The Court may, considering the applicant\u2019s conduct, character and other relevant circumstances:&nbsp;(a)\tadjourn the application for a specified period;&nbsp;(b)\tallow it to be withdrawn; or&nbsp;(c)\tmake any other appropriate order.</p><p>The second clarifies that a Court of 3 Supreme Court Judges constituted under the Act may conduct or hear a matter through electronic means, unless otherwise prescribed.&nbsp;Similar amendments pertaining to the Supreme Court, State Courts, and Family Justice Courts were made via the Courts (Civil and Criminal Justice) Reform Act 2021. This amendment is clarificatory in nature and does not introduce new powers.</p><p>Mr Speaker, in conclusion, the amendments that I have mentioned are part of our efforts to lift the overall standards of the professional training regime for lawyers to develop a future-ready legal workforce.</p><p>Our operating environment has become more complex and competitive. It remains a top priority to empower our law graduates to build themselves a sustainable and fulfilling career, by offering a breadth of opportunities to them in the legal services sector.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Murali Pillai.</p><h6>12.56 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, to properly understand the reasons for the proposed amendments to the Legal Profession Act 1966, or LPA, that we are considering today, it is important to appreciate the genesis of the process.</p><p>It began with the key idea of a reminder to all of us who live under the rule of law \u2013 that law is a profession, not an occupation, in that lawyers must strive to serve the public interest.</p><p>As was mentioned by the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary just now, in 2016, the honourable Chief Justice, established the Committee for the&nbsp;Professional Training of Lawyers (CPTL) headed by the honourable Justice Quentin Loh to \u201cconduct a root-and-branch review of the professional training regime for trainee lawyers\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the drivers for this review were: one, the fast-changing legal environment which required lawyers to work collaboratively over borders; two,&nbsp;the advent of Artificial Intelligence that have the potential to redefine the role of lawyers and the provision of legal services to clients; and three, the increasing savviness of clients; particularly corporate clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The focus was to identify, and I quote, \"measures to strengthen the entire professional training regime such that the quality of training remains robust\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>What is key is that training is not to be understood as merely the development of professional skills. The CPTL emphasised the need to teach trainees the deeper purpose associated with acquiring the skills.</p><p>&nbsp;If law is a profession and if lawyers have a duty to serve the public, then trainees must be imbued with important values such as compassion, courage and commitment to serve justice and integrity.&nbsp;</p><p>The honourable the Chief Justice put this point across poignantly in his speech in 2016 when he announced the set-up of CPTL. His Honour stated as follows, and I quote: \u201cLaw is not the only choice for those who have managed to secure a \"fistful of \"As\", as one interview put it to us\u2026If it is the lure of financial rewards that draws you, you should look at other options or be prepared for disappointment.\"</p><p>I wish to pick up one point that was left unsaid but, nonetheless, clear to everyone who is familiar with the developments then. The quality of our lawyers determines the quality of our Judiciary. Hence, ensuring the quality of our young lawyers, not just in terms of skills and knowledge but values, will have an impact, over time, on the quality of our Judiciary which, we all recognise, is an important and co-equal pillar in our Westminster-styled Government.</p><p>Maintaining the quality of the Judiciary is a national imperative. And I need only quote the hon Minister for Law who, in 2018, said in this House: \"When the quality of the Judiciary suffers, the rule of law suffers. When the rule of law suffers, the country suffers\".</p><p>It was in that context, that the CPTL made three key structural recommendations in 2018 which the Government subsequently accepted. They are: (a) lengthening the practice training period from six months to a year; (b) raising the standard and stringency of the bar exams known as \"Part B examinations\"; and (c) uncoupling the admission to the Bar from the completion of practice training contracts.&nbsp;</p><p>I support these recommendations but have a few queries on the recommendations which I will deal with in turn.</p><p>On the lengthening of the practice training period, the CPTL, in its report, identified two main reasons to recommend the doubling of the training period. In the new regime, each trainee would be required to rotate to contrasting practice areas to gain more exposure. In fact, they may even be seconded to a company as internal counsel for up to three months.</p><p>Also, it was felt that a six-month period was too short for a trainee to develop an aptitude to deal with the pressures of practice once he/she is called to the bar. This was, in fact, a point that was raised by junior lawyers in a focus group discussion that CPTL conducted.</p><p>The CPTL further noted that, from a comparative study, that the training period in Singapore is much shorter than that of barristers and solicitors in the United Kingdom (UK), Hong Kong, Australia and several other countries. Quite clearly though, the key outcome we are looking at is not just the length of the training, but the quality of the lawyer who emerges from it.</p><p>And this outcome depends largely on the supervising solicitors. This was a point that was specifically highlighted by the CPTL. I am aware that, already, there is a checklist that the trainees would have to tick off against, to ensure that they get the requisite exposure. I also note that the CPTL has made recommendations, such as \"training the trainer\" courses, designating a \"training partner\" in firms with six or more lawyers and so on.&nbsp;Furthermore, supervising solicitors' responsibilities are also spelt out under the Legal Profession (Admission) Rules 2011.</p><p>May I please ask the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary: what redress can we provide to trainees who are not getting the exposure, training and mentorship that they are supposed to get from their supervising solicitors?</p><p>Anecdotally, there are cases of trainees not getting the requisite exposure from their supervising solicitors. At the same time, they are naturally concerned about the possible impact on their own career should they raise issue about such matters to their firm. I would be grateful for the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary's response to this matter.</p><p>Next, Sir, the practice trainees who are subscribed to longer training periods, will naturally be concerned about their remuneration for this extended period. Instead of getting lawyers' salaries, they will continue to get allowances for an extended period. At the same time, law practices currently are not allowed to charge clients for the work done by their practice trainees, under the supervision of their supervising solicitors.</p><p>This will mean that law practices will have to incur higher costs, should they increase the allowances to be paid to practice trainees.</p><p>The CPTL encouraged a review of this position, so that law practices will be able to defray the costs associated with a longer practice training period. May I ask if the Government supports the CPTL's position in this regard, and if so, when will the requisite amendments to the subsidiary legislation to allow law practices to charge for their trainees' work, be in place?</p><p>This is not a matter of making profits for the firms, but really a point of fairness \u2013 if the trainees are doing work that add value to the client, the client should be willing to pay for it and the firm should be allowed to charge. The key is to create such a market with full transparency.</p><p>Next, on CPTL's recommendation that the standard and stringency of the Part B examinations be raised, I understand that this is an issue that is receiving the attention of the Singapore Institute of Legal Education, which is a Statutory Board set up under the LPA.</p><p>In its report, the CPTL highlighted that the pass rate for the Singapore bar exams between 2010 to 2016, which stands at 99%, compares very favourably with the pass rates in the Bar exam in England, which is about 70%, and the New York Bar, which is about 70% too.</p><p>I accept that the standards of the Bar exam must be sufficiently high to ensure that persons who pass, have an adequate standard of academic quality. On the other hand, we must guard against the tendency to make the Bar exam harder than necessary. Otherwise, our young talents will miss the chance of being developed into lawyers and, ultimately, Singapore will be the loser.</p><p>I have also noted some disquiet, expressed particularly in the social media amongst persons sitting for the Part B exam, who noted that the breadth of subjects being introduced for the Part B course are very wide and include specialist law areas.&nbsp;In addition, there is a concern that bell curve grading will be introduced for Part B exams.</p><p>I seek the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary's views on how it is proposed that a proper balance be struck in these circumstances.&nbsp;Here, we must be clear about the specific outcome that we want to achieve \u2013 it is not whether the 99% pass rate, on its own, is too high, or that 70% is too low. It is whether law graduates who pass the Part B examinations will be lawyers who can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with lawyers across the world and possess the competence to discharge their responsibilities well.</p><p>On CPTL's third structural recommendation of uncoupling the admission to bar from completion of practice training contracts, I have an observation to make. I note that it is proposed that a non-practicing lawyer, in addition to be being admitted to the Roll of Lawyers, be also members of the Law Society. Notwithstanding that they can be members of the Law Society, only practitioner members may be elected to the Council of the Law Society.</p><p>I am aware that there are other professional bodies which allow non-practising members to be elected into their respective councils. In my respectful view, given the unique duties of the Law Society as set out under the LPA, it is correct to continue to rely on practitioner members, with the requisite knowledge and experience, to be responsible for managing the affairs of the Law Society and ensuring that the Society discharges its statutory functions under the LPA properly.</p><p>Nonetheless, given that it is now to be statutorily provided that non-practicing lawyers may be Law Society members, there will be a need for the Law Society to cater to their interests too. In addition, there is an opportunity for the Law Society to harness the energies and abilities of these new members in discharging its responsibilities.&nbsp;I express the hope that the Law Society members from all categories will be able to work together for the collective good of the legal community and, of course, our country.</p><p>I now deal with the miscellaneous amendments proposed in the Bill on the process issues. First, I turn to the proposal to issue practice trainees with provisional practicing certificates, authorising him or her to practise provisionally after they have served six months of traineeship.</p><p>I support the proposal. I note that the intention is to allow the practice trainee to do anything that an advocate and solicitor can do, provided that they are under the supervision of a supervising solicitor. The period of coverage is not just during the practice training period, but also after the training period, but before he or she is admitted as an advocate and solicitor.</p><p>A significant difference between the proposal and the current regime involving part-called lawyers is that the period during which practice trainees can practise, with provisional practising certificates is proposed to be doubled.&nbsp;Currently, advocates and solicitors, before they can apply for a practising certificate, will have to take out a malpractice insurance under the Legal Profession (Professional Indemnity Insurance) Rules.</p><p>May I ask if there are similar requirements for practice trainees applying for provisional practising certificates to take out insurance? If not, what steps will be put in place to ensure that there is an indemnity insurance in place, covering civil liability arising from the acts or omissions of practice trainees with provisional practicing certificates?&nbsp;Also, would law practices be required to pay extra premiums as a result of this arrangement?</p><p>Next, and finally, I turn to professional training of Judicial Service or Legal Service Officers. Currently, different training periods apply to law graduates who seek admission to the Bar by working as an officer in judicial service, legal service or the Public Defender's Office.</p><p>For them, six months of working as a judicial service officer (JSO) or legal service officer (LSO) is equivalent to one month of supervised training by a practice trainee in private practice. In other words, it typically takes three years for a JSO or LSO to complete the equivalent of six months' traineeship by a practice trainee, before he or she may be called to the Bar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;If memory serves me correctly, I believe this requirement was first imposed in the early 1990s as part of a talent retention programme. I note from the CPTL report that it is proposed that the practice training period for law graduates who are serving as officers be equalised with practice trainees who serve their practice training period in Singapore law practices.</p><p>As a matter of principle, I support the parity, but may I please ask what is the Government's position on this matter, and if the Government accepts the CPTL's recommendation, may I ask how it proposes to deal with the original objective that led to the implementation of the different training periods for these officers in the first place?</p><p>Sir, the proposed amendments under the LPA help underline the important principle that lawyers must not only know the law, but \"why\" they are lawyers. How we train lawyers cannot be a mere technicality or a mere process of mastering the practice of law, but must be a careful and continuous appreciation of the solemn obligations placed on all lawyers, as officers of the Court, to uphold the rule of law and conduct themselves as members of an honourable profession. I support the Bill.</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Raj Joshua Thomas.</p><h6>1.11 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I declare my interest as a practising lawyer. The proposed amendments have the effect not only of changing certain aspects of new lawyers' training regime, but also restructures the legal profession by introducing a new category \"lawyer (non-practitioner)\", or lawyer (NP).&nbsp;I would like to seek a few clarifications on the amendments.</p><p>First, could the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary clarify what exactly a lawyer (NP), who is not pursuing a practice training, is qualified to do. For example, would the lawyer (NP) designation be the required minimum, in order for a person to be an in-house legal counsel in Singapore?</p><p>The lawyer (NP) designation may also confuse members of the public as to whether these persons are able to provide legal advice or to act legally for them, which remains the preserve of advocates and solicitors holding a practicing certificate. In this regard, I urge the Ministry to take steps to ensure public communications to equip members of the public to be able to tell the difference.</p><p>Second, I note that the Ministry intends to now allow, via subsidiary legislation, up to three months of a practice training contract to be completed at approved in-house legal departments of approved corporations. I support the spirit of this move, as it would give aspiring advocates and solicitors good exposure to the work in corporations that would contribute to a more well-rounded training experience.</p><p>However, could the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary provide some clarity on the approval process for these corporations and in-house legal departments? Furthermore, could the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary also clarify how lawyers (NP), and the law firms they are training with, would have access to these three-month attachments?</p><p>Would the approved corporations have the ability to choose which trainees to accept? And I hope that the system will ensure fair access to trainees from all firms: small, medium and large. We should avoid a system where trainees at larger firms have a higher chance of being involved in these attachments, just by virtue of being at these firms, and those from smaller firms are being prejudiced.</p><p>Third, I would like to ask if the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary could provide some clarity on how the moratorium for practice training contract applications, also to be given effect by subsidiary legislation, would operate.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, I am concerned about the impact that these changes may have on smaller law firms of 30 and less practitioners. The longer training period means that law firms that take on trainees will not be likely to charge for their trainees' work for a longer duration. Clients of smaller firms, with generally tighter budgets, may not be amendable to paying for trainees' time, costs or for their work, although their new designation of lawyer (NP) may be persuasive to some extent. So, could the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary give some clarity as to whether the time and cost of trainees could be charged to clients?</p><p>Furthermore, with a longer training period, trainees may expect higher allowances, because their higher full-time fee earner salaries will be pushed back now by six months. This may be difficult for smaller law firms to swallow.&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, the three-month attachments, as part of a training practice contract, could also end up being prejudicial to smaller law firms, if the corporations can and do pick primarily brand name law firms from which to accept trainees.</p><p>Based on a SingStat report in 2018, 97% of law practices in Singapore have 30 and less practitioners. Their value-added contribution, however, was only 38%, while the 3% of larger firms, contributed to 62% of value add.</p><p>This House has made several changes, including those before the House today, to the legal profession over the past few years, in order to position the industry for the future. These changes must not only benefit the 3% of large firms, but also help to unlock the latent value in the other 97% which would significantly increase the overall value add of the legal industry to the Singapore economy.&nbsp;</p><p>In this regard, I trust that the Ministry will continue to ensure that the benefits of the changes to the profession are equally accessible by lawyers in smaller firms as well as in large firms.&nbsp;Sir, notwithstanding my clarifications, I support the Bill.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Lim Biow Chuan.</p><h6>1.16 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I declare my interest as a practising lawyer.&nbsp;Sir, I understand that this Bill introduces amendments which were based on the recommendations of the CPTL. I too have a few queries on the amendment Bill for the Senior Parliamentary Secretary.</p><p>First is the length of time to qualify to be a practising lawyer.&nbsp;According to MinLaw's announcement made when the amendment Bill was read for the first time, the Legal Profession Act regulations would be amended to lengthen the practice training period from six months to one year.</p><p>This means that in future, any aspiring lawyer would now have to undergo four years of academic study to obtain a law degree, spend six months preparing for the Part B examination and then spend one year on a practice training period \u2013 a total of five-and-a-half years.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, I urge the Government to consider that not every law student comes from a wealthy background.&nbsp;For an aspiring lawyer who comes from a poor family, the additional six months on a practice training contract would impose additional financial constraint on the family. It may also deter those who have the right attitude, skillset or talent from taking up law as a career because of the length of time required.&nbsp;</p><p>For some students, a delay in six months may mean nothing. But for a law student from a poorer background, that delay of six months would mean an inability to contribute to the household expenses of the family. It will cause more hardship for the family. And if the student has to repay study loans, this would also mean a delay in the repayment of the study loan.</p><p>Thus, an additional six months' extension of the training period may have different implications on a law student depending on his or her family circumstances. Has MinLaw considered the fact that lengthening the practice training period by a further six months may cause financial hardship on law students? It may also create the impression that all aspiring lawyers must have deep financial means.</p><p>Next, Sir, I want to talk about quality of training.&nbsp;I recognise that the CPTL wanted to lengthen the training period so as to allow a longer period of mentorship to acquire basic legal skills. It also allows the mentor lawyer a longer period to assess the trainee lawyer.</p><p>Currently, there is no structure for the training contract. The SILE does provide guidelines but whether the trainee receives proper training very much depends on the law firm and the supervising lawyer. If a supervising lawyer behaves unethically, then the trainee maybe be learning the wrong behaviour about a lawyer's conduct.</p><p>Two years ago, there was a case about a lawyer who took on the role of being a supervising lawyer when he was not qualified to do so. And according to the judgment by Justice Choo Han Teck, the lawyer may have supervised another trainee who have since been admitted to the Bar. In other words, that person who had been admitted to the Bar had received training from a supervising lawyer who was not qualified to do so. Justice Choo had then said in the judgment that the Supervising Authorities should pursue the matter.</p><p>Thus, Sir, even if the training contract is for one year and not six months, whether the trainee receives adequate supervision and training during this training period depends very much on the experience and ability of the supervising solicitor. And even then, the supervising solicitor must have the time to teach or guide the trainee. Otherwise, the trainee may not benefit from a training contract, whether it is for six months or one year.</p><p>Third, Sir, I want to talk about admission of lawyers (NP).&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Amendment Bill provides for a new category of individuals to be admitted to the Singapore Bar as a lawyer (NP).&nbsp;</p><p>My query is on the use of the term \"lawyer (NP)\".&nbsp;Generally, the term \"lawyer\" is meant to apply to those whose profession is to conduct lawsuits on behalf of clients and to advise as to their legal rights and obligations.&nbsp;For the non-practising lawyers, they are generally known as legal counsel.</p><p>By adding a category of the term \"lawyer (NP)\", would members of the public be able to distinguish between a lawyer in active practice and a lawyer (NP) who, in the past would be called a legal counsel?</p><p>May I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary which other jurisdictions has a similar term as lawyer (NP)?&nbsp;Would members of the public then feel that lawyers (NP) would be in a position to advise the clients on legal practice matters when they are not really legal practitioners?</p><p>Sir, I do not, in any way, mean to suggest that legal counsels are less regarded as compared to lawyers. But it is important to distinguish the primary function of lawyers and that of legal counsel. They are separate as they advise different parties.</p><p>Further, if this law is passed, would all the existing legal counsels be able to apply to be admitted to the Bar as lawyers (NP)?</p><p>If so, would there be a large number of applicants because currently, there are many legal counsels who are working in corporate organisations advising their companies. What would the process be like in dealing with such applications?</p><p>Finally, Sir, let me address Part B of the course. From the Report by the CPTL, I understand that there is an intention to make Part B more vigorous. I have received a lot of feedback from existing students that the academic workload for Part B is worse than the law school examinations.&nbsp;</p><p>I took a look at the course content at the SILE website and I was surprised by the large number of subjects that are covered. It was as if SILE was trying to squeeze in a few years of legal content into a five- or six-month Part B course.</p><p>Sir, in the past, the Practice Law Course, which is the current Part B, was meant to ensure that law students have sufficient knowledge of the practical aspect of legal practice before they are allowed to practise as advocates and solicitors. And that learning journey is always ongoing, because it is impossible to know everything as a lawyer. The law school examination is meant to give the student academic knowledge of a particular areas of law and the Practice Law Course is to supplement that knowledge in terms of the legal practice.</p><p>Sir, I am of the view that we ought to maintain the intent of the Part B which is to impart practical skills to the aspiring lawyer and it is not meant to sieve out those who have no interest in the practice of law.&nbsp;If a student has passed his or her examinations and graduated with a law degree, MinLaw should accept that that student does have the requisite academic legal knowledge. Otherwise, that person should not have obtained the law degree.&nbsp;Making Part B more difficult would merely add on the stress of being a lawyer when the legal profession is currently suffering from a shortage of lawyers.</p><p>I hope that the Senior Parliamentary Secretary can clarify my queries.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Assoc Prof Razwana.</p><h6>1.23 pm</h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I stand in support of the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill.</p><p>Sir, the rule of law is fundamental to Singapore's prosperity. A robust and effective legal system provides a stable environment for our nation's governance and growth and is one of the futures that gives Singapore its ongoing international reputation as a safe, credible and trustworthy country.</p><p>Lawyers play a vital role in upholding the rule of law, defending rights of individuals and ensuring access to justice for all.</p><p>The proposal amendments in this Bill align with the recommendations of the CPTL.&nbsp;The Committee's underlying objectives are to ensure equitable access to professional training for trainee lawyers and to enhance the quality of their training.</p><p>This guarantees that future lawyers are not technically skilled but are also valued driven and embody compassion, continuous learning, excellence and a commitment to Public Service.</p><p>The suggested changes aim to foster a legal profession that is both effective and compassionate, with lawyers who carry out their duties guided by principles and accountability and are firmly grounded in ethical practice.</p><p>With that understanding, while I acknowledge the potential benefits of the changes, I do have some clarifications and suggestions.</p><p>Before I do so, however, I would like to declare my position as an educator with Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) and to note that many of the concerns raised in my speech are based on my engagement and discussion with students, university colleagues, legal practitioners and users of Legal Services.</p><p>Mr Speaker, my first set of comments related to the proposed amendments to Part B of the syllabus and the extension of the practice training period and how these changes will impact qualified persons seeking admission as advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court of Singapore.</p><p>I understand that Part B syllabus has been restructured, requiring candidates to complete more modules on different subjects.</p><p>The expansion in the number of subjects in Part B syllabus reflects a commitment to providing a comprehensive legal education to qualified persons aspiring to practise law.&nbsp;It also acknowledges that the law is a multi-faceted field, touching on various aspects of society, from business and technology, to constitutional rights and environmental concerns.&nbsp;By offering a broader range of subjects, candidates will gain a broader perspective of the law and its intersection with other disciplines.</p><p>However, this broad-based approach needs to be considered in tandem with the practicality of the teaching methodology and the opportunity to observe all this new information.&nbsp;Though most candidates appreciate the opportunity to learn and be exposed to a variety of subjects, we need to maintain our focus on the critical skills required for candidates to become competent lawyers and be cautious of knowledge overload.</p><p>In light of this, could be review the subjects offered in Part B and consider allowing candidates to select courses in areas of their interests. Doing so could assist to manage knowledge overload while still providing candidates with the opportunity to develop critical skills.</p><p>Mr Speaker, in the ever-evolving legal landscapes, lawyers must embrace continuous learning to stay abreast of the dynamic changes within the field.&nbsp;On that note and in the context of our national emphasis on lifelong learning, could candidates, once admitted, have the option to select certain broad-based courses as part of their ongoing professional development?</p><p>Related, I would like to share that several candidates completing Part B course have commented that they would welcome greater interaction and engagement with senior lawyers.&nbsp;Accordingly, could we explore the possibility of providing mentorship and guidance for candidates at an earlier stage of their Part B education, similar to the Law Society mentorship scheme and in that scheme, supports junior lawyers with less than five years of experience?</p><p>My next comment, regarding the impact of these amendments on candidates seeking for admission relate to the extension of the practice training period.&nbsp;Increasing the training period from six to 12 months offers some advantages. It ensures that junior lawyers begin their legal career with a robust foundation, practical experience and a comprehensive grasp of the law.&nbsp;Additionally, it benefits law firms by enabling a thorough assessment of their trainees.</p><p>Nonetheless, it is essential to contemplate the consequences for both trainees and the law firm that engage them, particularly in terms of associated costs.&nbsp;There are two direct consequences that trainee remain concerned about: low pay is extended to 12 months instead of six months and no paid or sick leave.</p><p>Mr Speaker, at this point, I would like to emphasise the challenges faced by several law students, especially adult learners at SUSS.&nbsp;I would like to relay the feedback from one of our adult learners who is enrolled in the law programme and he is also financially supporting two children attending university.&nbsp;He has indicated the longer duration of the practice training period makes it financially onerous for him to pursue a career as a practising lawyer.</p><p>Considering the financial constraints that may affect the decision to practise, is there possibility of utilising the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidies to financially support selected trainees during their practice training period?</p><p>In addressing the financial challenges and, at the same juncture, to qualify to be called to the Bar, would the Ministry consider offering legal executive positions in public organisations, like the Legal Aid Bureau, Community Law Centre and the Public Defender's Office?</p><p>It is reassuring that the practice training period can be carried out within pre-approved in-house legal departments or qualified organisations.&nbsp;This offers a chance for trainees to gain exposure to a variety of legal practices.&nbsp;On that note, may I check with the Ministry on the criteria established in defining the work done as part of the in-house legal departments and how do we assess if a trainee is given the opportunity to rotate within the different legal departments or qualified organisations?</p><p>I would now like to talk about the proposed introduction of the provisional practising certificates for trainees.</p><p>I applaud the Ministry for including this option for trainees. This will surely expand the scope of work for the trainees and strengthen their capabilities in becoming a confident lawyer.&nbsp;</p><p>While enhancing a trainee's practical application of legal knowledge, this proposal also means that firms can now get trainees to do associate work without the trainee receiving the same renumeration as an associate.&nbsp;I understand that a trainee may receive some allowance while doing similar, if not, the same tasks as an associate.&nbsp;I believe if the current amendment is not accompanied with adjustments to the trainees' allowance, practising as lawyers may become less appealing to new entrants.</p><p>On that note, may I check if the Ministry would consider advising law firms to provide a standard package for trainees, including benefits like medical and maternity leave, to ensure a fair and consistent experience for trainee lawyers.</p><p>I would also like to seek clarification on the process for suspension or revocation of provisional practising certificates, and if a trainee does have their professional certificate suspended, are there mandatory causes or relearning procedures for affected trainees?</p><p>Mr Speaker, as an advocate for experiential learning, I believe in the value of extending the practice training period. However, I would like to suggest that we provide options for trainees and take into account the unique needs of affected trainees. While law is frequently characterised as being clear-cut, it is essential to acknowledge the diverse characteristics of trainees who are planning to become practising lawyers. We must consider the nuances aspects of law, the various shades of grey when supporting these trainees, without compromising the necessary knowledge and skills to help them achieve their aspiration and goals as competent and responsible lawyers.</p><p>Mr Speaker, I would now like to move away from candidates and trainees and talk about the impact of the amendments on the law firms.</p><p>While extending the training programme from six to 12 months may allow additional time for law firms to assess and evaluate trainees and may enable continuity of services for the firms' clients, the longer duration may result in a reduced number of contracts being offered or being available to trainees. Considering the potential reduction in the number of contracts offered, will the Ministry encourage law firms to expand their offer of practice training contracts or provide incentives for them to do so?&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, the last group we must consider is the end user. The legal profession in Singapore plays a pivotal role in preserving peace and justice. Its function in upholding the rule of law, offering access to justice and resolving disputes are essential in guaranteeing the continued fairness and orderliness of the Singaporean society.</p><p>The amendment that proposes uncoupling admission to the bar from the completion of practice training offers a choice to law graduates and may assist retaining them in the legal field. However, it may also inadvertently lead to a decline in the number of graduates becoming practising lawyers. This may result in fewer lawyers taking on matters related to the needs of the community such as family or criminal law-related cases.</p><p>It is crucial for lawyers to comprehend the challenges their clients face. Lawyers should actively explore methods for mediation and conflict resolution, when necessary, rather than rushing to push the cases into the courtroom. This approach helps foster a legal system that is more accessible, empathetic and focused on finding just resolutions for the benefit of all involved.</p><p>On that note, is there any consideration for lawyers to receive education on more relational theory of justice such as restorative justice? If I may explain, according to the United Nation (UN) Office on Drugs and Crime, and I quote, \"restorative justice refers to a way of responding to crime or to the types of wrongdoing, injustice or conflict that focuses primarily on repairing the damage caused by the wrongful action and restoring as in so far as possible the well-being of those involved\". I believe such topics would enhance the ability of lawyers to provide quality advice aligned to the needs of their clients.</p><p>Sir, the proposed amendments in this Bill represent a constructive move towards establishing regulation that can foster the development of dependable and ethical lawyers, thus contributing to a more equitable, ethical and inclusive society that serves both the legal profession and the broader community. In conclusion, notwithstanding the clarifications and suggestions I have raised earlier, I stand in support of this amendment Bill.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Patrick Tay.&nbsp;</p><h6>1.34 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I declare my interest as Director, Legal, of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore, and Honorary Member and Board of Advisors to Singapore Corporate Counsel Association.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Bill before us today seeks to amend the Legal Profession Act, with the key objective of strengthening the professional training regime for lawyers in Singapore and to better equip law graduates with the relevant skills and competencies to meet the demands of our changing economy.</p><p>I would like to highlight two key changes: first, lengthening the practice training period (PTP) from six months to one year; and second, permitting up to three months of the practice training contract to be completed at approved in-house legal departments of approved corporations.&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of lengthening the PTP is to provide trainee lawyers with a longer runway to pick up, grasp and hone their skills to be better lawyers. While the intent is a noble one, this must be balanced against the adverse financial impacts borne by the trainee lawyers.&nbsp;</p><p>First, the financial impact of the prolonged PTP on trainees. Trainee lawyers typically work long hours, from an early start till late into the night and also on weekends.&nbsp;From the postings online and from the trainees I spoke to, they are paid monthly allowances or honorariums of between S$1,000 or S$2,500 each month during the PTP.&nbsp;Some firms offer training contracts with only a pittance as an allowance, which I opine can be seen as exploitative.&nbsp;This pales in comparison to their peers or fresh graduates in other industries, who draw between S$3,500 or S$5,000, depending on the industry, each month and work lesser hours than these trainees.&nbsp;</p><p>The trainees are neither less qualified nor less capable than any of their peers in other industries. Indeed, many have gone through rigorous curriculums in the law schools and learnt much in preparation for the law and bar exams. They have to push on against all odds as they need it to be called to the bar.&nbsp;And one can say that a new lawyer\u2019s pay goes up significantly upon their call, but the skills and abilities have not suddenly nor exponentially increased.</p><p>While I understand that trainee lawyers should not be driven solely by financial rewards, and that the quantum for the monthly honorarium or allowance is largely driven by market forces, it is nonetheless important for them to be paid fairly, in recognition of their skills and contributions to the firms. The trainees provide valuable contributions to the firm, in terms of research on novel points of the law and preparation of the initial drafts, which are used to advance the client\u2019s case. This also helps lighten the lawyers\u2019 loads.</p><p>To that end, is there more that can be done to ensure our trainees are paid reasonably, especially during the lengthened PTP? How can we encourage firms to pay more in terms of the monthly allowance? How can the bigger firms also pay more for those on training contracts, as they currently set the de facto upper limit? How can we help those from lower-income families, who may need the income to support their families? In the same vein, how can we ensure better retention in the legal industry?&nbsp;</p><p>Second, mandating certain benefits, including paid sick leave, to be provided under training contracts. In my recent interactions with trainees, many have expressed their concerns about the lack of paid sick leave and annual leave, especially with the prolonged PTP period. People do fall ill and are required to rest to be more productive.</p><p>Sir, the past three years, we battled multiple waves of COVID-19. Apart from COVID-19, there also other strains of flu circulating within our society. As with all other individuals, trainees also fall ill and may require medical attention from time to time.&nbsp;</p><p>Given that there are some similarities between trainees and employees, it is humbly submitted that paid sick leave should similarly accrue for trainees after three months of employment with a law firm.</p><p>Under the existing rules, breaks taken during the PTP will be excluded from the computation of the PTP period. There is value in such a rule to ensure that trainees complete the entire training period and reap the full benefits of it, and I recognise that.</p><p>In view of the above, I am therefore proposing that trainees be accorded paid sick leave when they are unwell, while requiring them to \u201cmake-up\u201d for the same number of days at the end of their PTP. In other words, those who fall ill during the PTP will have an extended PTP \u2013 reflecting the \u201cmake-up period\u201d \u2013 but will be paid a larger allowance or honorarium at the end of the PTP, to reflect the paid sick leave accorded.</p><p>Apart from providing trainees with paid sick leave, it may also be useful to let trainees have paid annual leave. There is a Chinese saying which says \" \u4f11\u606f\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u8d70\u66f4\u8fdc\u7684\u8def \". If translated, it means one can accomplish more with adequate rest and breaks along the way. I am really concerned about the overall mental well-being and health of our young trainee lawyers including lawyers in practice. Any positive move and step can better our workers\u2019 welfare and well-being overall.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, training contracts bear some semblance to employment contracts. Leaving aside the practical concerns that I had highlighted, I noted that there are significant similarities between training contracts and employment contracts, which justify providing certain basic employment benefits, such as paid sick leave, to trainees, which employees under the Employment Act currently enjoy.</p><p>First, the law firm exercises substantial control over the trainee\u2019s work. Apart from training the trainee, the supervising solicitors or other lawyers in the firm set timelines, guide, review and provide input to the trainee\u2019s work before the same is sent to the client for approval.</p><p>Second, the trainee is interviewed by and selected by the law firm, presumably based on the individual\u2019s skills, character and fit, with a view to retain him or her upon the conclusion of the PTP. This contrasts with a contract for services, whereby a particular vendor is engaged to provide general services.</p><p>Third, the trainee has access to and uses the firm's equipment and resources in the course of his or her work. This includes having access to the firm\u2019s laptop, legal research websites and existing precedents.</p><p>Fourth, the trainee is remunerated through regular allowance, rather by means of commissions or otherwise.</p><p>Fifth, some of the practice training contracts stipulate the trainee\u2019s working hours and duration, which contrasts with independent contractors who have flexibility over their schedules.</p><p>Sixth, the trainee is typically only allowed to work for one employer or law firm at any one point, and should the trainee wish to change firm, he or she must notify SILE beforehand. This is unlike independent contractors who may work for multiple service buyers at the same time.</p><p>Lastly, if a \"contract of service\" as defined under the Employment Act also includes \"an apprenticeship contract\", a fortiori, a training contract offered to graduates should likewise be classified as a \"contract of service\" with attendant benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>Given that there is some semblance between training contracts and employment contracts, it is humbly submitted that trainees should likewise be accorded basic employment benefits, such as paid sick leave and annual leave for a start, during the PTP, with other benefits to be considered at a later stage.</p><p>Finally, I applaud the proposed change of permitting up to three months of the practice training contract to be completed at in-house legal departments of approved corporations.&nbsp;As the \u201cin-house\u201d option is a popular alternative to private practice, having first-hand experience witnessing the operations and needs of a business would give trainees a flavour of the type of work to expect as an in-house legal counsel. Additionally, a short stint in companies would help them be more attuned to the business needs of an organisation and consider matters holistically, instead of looking at matters purely from a legal perspective.&nbsp;I submit that this definition of \"corporations\" extend&nbsp;to other organisations where they have an in-house team such as NTUC.&nbsp;With this, it is hoped that they would be more well-rounded lawyers.</p><p>Sir, notwithstanding my clarifications and suggestions, I stand in support of the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Louis Ng.&nbsp;</p><h6>1.42 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will strengthen the training of law graduates and better equip them to enter the legal profession.&nbsp;</p><p>Key amendments introduced include decoupling admission to the Singapore bar from practice training, increasing the practice training period, allowing limited rights to practise after six months\u2019 training and introducing a moratorium for practice training contract applications.&nbsp;</p><p>I have three clarifications to raise.</p><p>My first set of clarifications relate to the moratorium date on applications for training contracts.&nbsp;The Bill empowers the SILE to disregard any period in calculating the training period completed by a practice trainee. The explanatory statement clarifies that this may include any contravention of the moratorium date on applications for training contracts.&nbsp;</p><p>Can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary clarify how any breach of the moratorium date will be factored into calculating the training period completed? For instance, will SILE discount the training period completed by the same amount of time that the practice trainee and law firm breached the moratorium? Would SILE consider certain factors as aggravating or mitigating in this calculation? And are there other penalties that practice trainees would face, apart from the discounting of the training period?</p><p>Second, can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary share whether law firms may face any penalties if they offer practice training contracts in breach of a law student\u2019s moratorium? It does not appear that this Bill provides for such penalties. If that is the case, can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary explain the rationale behind such an omission?</p><p>The omission is odd because the Bill's explanatory statement says that a moratorium is meant to be two-prong: it bars law students from making applications and it bars law practices from making offers.&nbsp;It seems inconsistent and unfair to punish only the student if the law firm wittingly makes an offer in breach of the moratorium date.</p><p>Finally, can Senior Parliamentary Secretary share how the SILE detects breaches of the moratorium? The Committee for the Professional Training of Lawyers themselves noted in their recommendation that breaches would be hard to detect. Will there be audits or reporting obligations that enable more effective policing of the moratorium?</p><p>My second clarification is on the exposure of practice trainees to contrasting practice areas.&nbsp;One reason the Committee for the Professional Training of Lawyers (CPTL) recommended increasing the practice training period to one year was to allow practice trainees more meaningful exposures to contrasting practice areas.&nbsp;However, small law firms may not be able to provide such exposure, given that their firm's work may be more narrow.&nbsp;Can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary share what efforts will be made to ensure that even practice trainees in small law firms can have meaningful exposure to different practice areas?&nbsp;</p><p>My third and final clarification is on the salary of practice trainees that many Members have raised.&nbsp;Practice trainees usually receive salaries that are significantly lower than what they would earn as a fully qualified lawyer. For example, it is reported that the Big Four law firms in Singapore pay trainees an honorarium of around $2,000 to $2,500 while their first-year associates now get $7,500 to $7,900.&nbsp;The effect of increasing the practice training period to one year is that practice trainees will earn a lower salary for a longer period.</p><p>While the media has reported that some law firms are looking to increase practice trainee salaries, relying on individual law firms' review of practice trainees will likely lead to unequal and inequitable outcomes across the board.&nbsp;Can the Senior Minister of State share what steps will be taken across the board to review practice trainee salaries?&nbsp;Sir, notwithstanding these clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Ms Nadia Samdin.</p><h6>1.46 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.</p><p>Sir, a 2022 report from the International Bar Association revealed that out of 3,000 lawyers aged 40 and under surveyed around the world, 54% reported that they were somewhat likely or highly likely to move to a new workplace and 20% were thinking about leaving the profession entirely.&nbsp;In Singapore, one in seven junior lawyers stopped practising in 2021.</p><p>While unfortunately some prefer to carelessly put this down to zoomers being not as hungry as those in generations before or feeling less pressure to earn an income, to quote the late and great former Law Society president and unofficial King of Singapore according to LinkedIn, Mr Adrian Tan, \"It may be tougher to be a young lawyer now than at any time in history. They work at an intense pace and are on call night and day.\"</p><p>I remember once getting a request from a client to set up a virtual call quickly at about 1.00 am and, on another occasion, leaving the office around 3.00 am after waiting for a turn of documents from the other counsel, only to come back some three hours later to facilitate a deal signing during an auspicious early morning fengshui hour.</p><p>Yet, many still want to join the noble profession and numbers grow steadily. Between 2019 and 2021, Singapore saw an average of 394 university graduates obtaining a first degree in law. As of August 2023, the Law Society reports 6,512 practitioners.</p><p>The&nbsp;CPTL was convened in 2016, as shared by many hon Members earlier, to conduct a review of the professional training regime for trainee lawyers. The Committee outlined various challenges, including intense competition for practice training contracts, perceived unfair recruitment practices and a lack of consistency in training standards across firms.</p><p>Upon the completion of training contracts, the Committee also found the trend of attrition amongst young lawyers due to unsustainable work practices, unsuitability of the individual for legal work and the absence of alternative pathways.&nbsp;This trend was cast in the spotlight again in 2021.</p><p>I am heartened by the Government's concern and efforts to work together with industry and schools to improve retention and quality of training. To quote the International Bar Association (IBA) president, \"The young lawyers of today are the senior leaders of tomorrow.\"</p><p>I have four clarifications.</p><p>First, the extension of the practice training period from six to 12 months. This extension brings us closer to training contracts in some other jurisdictions, for example, 12 months of pupilage in the UK before one practises as a barrister, and 24 months of qualifying work experience in up to four firms for solicitors and 12 months in New South Wales.&nbsp;The extended timeframe, on one hand, gives trainees more time to oversee cases that cannot be completed in six months and grants firms more time to assess performance for a more informed retention decisions based on mutual fit.</p><p>However, in my dialogues and engagements with young law students, some have expressed concerns.&nbsp;Given the rising cost of living, coupled with potential debt after university degrees, and another $6,000-plus required for the Part B examinations, some are worried about the quantum of the allowance if the training is lengthened.&nbsp;Figures between $1,000 and $2,500 have been shared as a rough quantum of allowance during practice training.&nbsp;In particular, this can be challenging for adult learners or students facing financial challenges.</p><p>I, for one, could not have completed my law degree without support from&nbsp;MENDAKI and a Singapore Management University (SMU) scholarship in my first year. It was only after receiving my first pay cheque as a young lawyer after my training could I finally breathe and contribute to my family after all my parents' sacrifices.</p><p>Most law firms also do not charge clients for the work done by trainees.&nbsp;Should this practice and trend persist with the extension, the current allowance renumerated may not be tenable for trainees and law firms over a long period of time.</p><p>In comparison with other jurisdictions, the Law Society in the UK and Bar Standards Board recommend that trainees be paid approximately $2,800 to $3,600 in London.</p><p>Furthermore, trainees presently do not have annual or sick leave accounted for during their practice training. Guidelines under the SILE also necessitate trainees to make up for any leave taken.&nbsp;This may not be sustainable for the health and well-being of trainees in the long run.</p><p>Further, relying on a checklist and increasing the length of the training contract alone may not enrich the quality and rigour of the training experience.&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister if there will be specific guidance and support given to law firms to ensure that the training period is a meaningful one, both for the employers and students.</p><p>Finally, with a longer training period, firms will need to spend more money to hire trainees.&nbsp;Will there be support in place for smaller firms who are unable to cope with the increased costs?</p><p>Secondly, on the introduction of a&nbsp;moratorium, this is not the first time this is being considered.</p><p>During interactions with young law students, they shared the immense pressure and competition to secure a training contract way ahead of graduation.&nbsp;This practice not only creates additional stress but also questions on whether it is fair to only account for two years of school results in the process.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I would like to clarify on the specific implementation details of the moratorium.&nbsp;Will firms be restricted to only accepting applications in particular months or will students be bound by their year of study for application?&nbsp;How will the Ministry enforce this amongst firms upon implementation and what are the avenues for students and firms to voice out any unfair practices that they may observe?</p><p>Third, on the&nbsp;permission for trainees to complete up to three months of the practice training period at approved in-house legal departments of non-law practice entities.&nbsp;Given the broad range of opportunities there are, I can see how this would be an exciting option. For example, I was grateful for the chance previously to intern in ESPN, which married my interest in media and the law and helped me understand commercial needs.</p><p>Although this expands the opportunities for trainees and also provides a potential pipeline of support for these companies, I would like to ask if there are any criteria imposed to ensure that trainees can gain an enriching experience comparable to their peers who are practising with law firms. Is there an estimate number of how many of such departments will be available to cater to potential demand? What will the allowance guidelines be for trainees who choose to pursue this path?</p><p>Finally, the new section 22 empowers a judge on an application by the Attorney-General or the Council to order a lawyer (non-practitioner) to submit to a medical examination by a registered medical practitioner to determine whether the lawyer (non practitioner)'s fitness to practise provisionally has been impaired by a physical or mental condition. The Council will also be able to direct a lawyer (non-practitioner) to stop practising provisionally until he or she has submitted to a medical examination.</p><p>As we understand, mental health is a continuum. The Government is also generally very cautious about compulsion to submit to medical examinations and the seeking of treatment unless an individual is at risk of harm to themselves or to the public.</p><p>For greater clarity, could the Ministry describe what sort of circumstances will warrant such an examination and how will the Council or Attorney-General determine when one is not suitable to practise? What are some conditions that will be considered an impairment and how can an individual who has recovered come back to practise?</p><p>In conclusion, Sir, I am glad that the amendments facilitate a greater depth of exposure and experience and provide more career pathways for young lawyers. While the changes bring our system closer in alignment to other jurisdictions' standards and guidelines, greater clarity is necessary for aspiring and current law students. This is even more so as the recent changes to the Part B examinations have sparked distress among students. Previously, students studied seven compulsory subjects and two elective subjects. The latest revision sees students completing six modules across a wide breadth of 31 topics.</p><p>I also look forward to the future guidance notes, which I understand will be developed in a consultative manner. This approach is much appreciated. Beyond legal practitioners, industry, Government and organisations, I hope that we involve, hear out and co-create with the very people these amendments seek to serve as well \u2013 law students themselves. To do so would be very much in line with the Government's call under Forward SG.</p><p>In her speech, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary also described that many of these guidance notes and subsidiary legislation are in the works.&nbsp;My final question is whether there is an estimate when these will be ready.&nbsp;Notwithstanding the clarifications, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Yip Hon Weng.&nbsp;</p><h6>1.56 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill represents a significant&nbsp;step forward in our legal profession. The amendments are a positive&nbsp;development in addressing concerns about the availability of practice&nbsp;roles for our aspiring lawyers. However, I have several clarifications on&nbsp;the Bill.</p><p>First, Mr Speaker, Sir, there are practical concerns about how this&nbsp;Bill can truly enhance the quality of our legal professionals.</p><p>Has the&nbsp;Ministry gathered feedback on the breadth and depth of training received by trainees? Additionally, is the supply of training places able&nbsp;to meet the demand?&nbsp;What trainees do and learn should advance their&nbsp;aspirations and chosen career paths. However, due to a shortage of&nbsp;training positions, a trainee may have little choice but to train at a firm&nbsp;or with a lawyer whose practice areas are vastly different. An extended&nbsp;training period may be disadvantageous to them in such cases.&nbsp;What&nbsp;types of support are available to such trainees if they wish to transition&nbsp;to other practice areas?</p><p>Furthermore, if a trainee is unable to secure a training contract in&nbsp;one of the larger law firms, which may not have as many or as varied&nbsp;legal departments, will there still be an assurance of the same high-quality&nbsp;training? Will these trainees receive the breadth of experience&nbsp;required to enhance their knowledge and skillsets?</p><p>Can we implement a&nbsp;system, perhaps through logbooks or checklists, to ensure that trainees&nbsp;in smaller law firms, or all trainees, gain the relevant breadth of&nbsp;experience?&nbsp;This could be a record-keeping document or online system&nbsp;that trainees use to track their activities, experiences and tasks during&nbsp;their practice training period.&nbsp;Equally important, how do we ensure the&nbsp;accuracy of these logbooks?</p><p>Often, larger firms will select those who&nbsp;may have performed better in law school. How does the Law Society&nbsp;ensure that all trainees will continue to get equal exposure, regardless&nbsp;of their graduating results?</p><p>Moreover, we should consider avenues for trainees to provide&nbsp;anonymous feedback to the Law Society regarding the quality of their&nbsp;training. This could be an invaluable resource in maintaining and&nbsp;improving the standard of training across the profession in the long&nbsp;term.</p><p>Second, Mr Speaker, Sir, as we extend the practice training period,&nbsp;we must be vigilant in safeguarding against the potential exploitation&nbsp;of trainees and their wages. Some firms may take the work of trainees&nbsp;and charge clients as their own without giving due credit to the&nbsp;trainees.</p><p>How will the Law Society safeguard against such exploitation?&nbsp;In such cases, when clients are billed at the full rate, how is liability&nbsp;managed in the event of any issues arising from this arrangement?</p><p>Furthermore, will the Law Society consider mandating a minimum&nbsp;wage for trainees similar to what housemen are paid in the medical&nbsp;field? How will the Law Society protect those inexperienced trainees&nbsp;from law firms that might seek to take advantage of this extended&nbsp;practice period?&nbsp;As much as the extended practice period is important&nbsp;to an aspiring lawyer's development, they must also be treated fairly&nbsp;and remunerated equitably.</p><p>Addressing the possible exploitation of young lawyers,&nbsp;particularly in larger firms where they are often burdened with arduous&nbsp;tasks and long hours, is critical. This scenario could also happen in&nbsp;smaller firms where there are fewer resources and manpower. This&nbsp;unhealthy work environment, characterised by excessive demands and&nbsp;little support, has led to a concerning attrition rate within the&nbsp;profession. Many dedicated individuals have been driven to leave due&nbsp;to these toxic conditions.</p><p>What measures are being taken to rectify&nbsp;this issue and ensure a more sustainable and nurturing atmosphere for&nbsp;young legal professionals?&nbsp;I ask this because this House would recall that a lawyer of 20 years' standing was jailed, fined and disbarred for having abused his&nbsp;employees, among whom was a trainee.</p><p>As with all other occupations, the relationship and balance of power between a supervising solicitor and a trainee tilt in the balance of the former. Have any measures been put in place to minimise future recurrences?</p><p>Third, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is worth noting that this Bill was crafted during a time when there was an excess of lawyers. However, the situation may have evolved. Today, we are facing a shortage of legal professionals. Considering this, we must question whether the changes outlined in this Bill remain relevant in our current legal landscape.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the quality of our legal professionals is paramount. Providing them with more time and exposure to different aspects of the legal landscape is a valuable step in their career development. It aids them in deciding their career goals and which specific areas to pursue.</p><p>However, I am concerned that the longer practice period, while beneficial in many aspects, may exacerbate the existing shortage of legal professionals. This, in turn, places more pressure on lawyers, particularly the younger ones, potentially resulting in a vicious cycle as more may experience burnout and leave the profession. We must strike a balance between quality training and ensuring an adequate number of legal professionals to meet the growing demands of our society.</p><p>In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, in my younger years, I almost did pursue an education in law. But due to circumstances then, I eventually ended up pursuing Mathematics. However, in a strange twist of fate, I am now a legislator as a Member of Parliament, working alongside lawyers, legal professionals and Parliamentary Clerks, scrutinising Bills and legislation. Hence, I am speaking on the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill because I believe this marks a substantial stride forward in advancing our legal field, particularly in addressing concerns over ample practice opportunities for aspiring lawyers. Nevertheless, there are critical clarifications needed.</p><p>Firstly, we must address the practicality of ensuring top-notch training for all, especially in smaller law firms. Secondly, as we extend the practice training period, safeguards against potential exploitation of trainees must be in place. Lastly, we need to evaluate the Bill's relevance, considering the evolving legal landscape. While augmenting training time is beneficial, it is imperative to consider its potential impact on the shortage of legal professionals. Striking a balance between quality training and meeting the increasing demands of society is imperative to ensure a sustainable and thriving legal profession in Singapore. I support the Bill.</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>: Senior Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu.</p><h6>2.03 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Rahayu Mahzam</strong>: Sir, I thank Members who spoke in support of the Bill. Let me now address the questions that were raised.</p><p>First, Mr Yip Hon Weng has queried about the relevance of the Bill in our current legal landscape.&nbsp;While the Committee's recommendations were made in 2018, they were based on a longer-term, market-neutral perspective. Earlier, I referred to the recently released Forward SG Report, which stated that Singapore, as a society, wants to recognise and embrace multiple career pathways.</p><p>The Committee's report in 2018 recognised that the legal profession is a diverse and multi-faceted community with space for persons to contribute in many ways, and that it was important to cater to this.&nbsp;The Committee's recommendations also aimed to ensure overall standards for the professional training of lawyers were lifted. This continues to be relevant today.</p><p>The existing framework has served Singapore well, training generations of Singapore lawyers who have shaped Singapore's legal industry into the leading legal services hub it is today.&nbsp;But with the operating environment becoming more complex and competitive, it is even more pressing to adequately prepare our legal workforce for the multitude of roles that they may be expected to play in the future.</p><p>Our world is getting smaller yet increasingly polarised, and the lawyers of tomorrow will need to work collaboratively while embracing diversity, as they engage in more cross-border work. Technology has changed how lawyers work. Legal tech is increasingly used by law firms, in-house legal departments, the Courts and dispute resolution institutions.&nbsp;As consumers become more sophisticated, there is also growing demand for higher-value advice from lawyers.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, this Bill is part of overall efforts to uplift the quality of law students and better prepare a future-ready legal workforce. Whether lawyers practise in a big or small Singapore law practice, or SLP, or in an international firm, their employer, clients and the broader industry will benefit from them having a better-grounded foundation.&nbsp;The first batch of law graduates under the new admission framework will commence their practice training period, or PTP, in January 2025. Upon completing their PTP, they will be better equipped to hit the ground running.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, I will address questions from Mr Yip and Mr Patrick Tay on whether the recommendations will impact the supply of lawyers in Singapore, including whether there will be adequate practice training places and on retention of aspiring young lawyers in the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Uncoupling admission from practice training will allow those who do not intend to practise to pursue other legal roles without investing additional time to complete the PTP. This will, in turn, reduce the competition for practice training positions.&nbsp;The attrition of lawyers is not a new phenomenon. Lawyers have many different options, aside from private practice. These include becoming in-house counsel, joining the Government or legal tech companies or entering academia.</p><p>We should embrace this. Legal talent is required to support all aspects of Singapore's economy and society. Through this Bill, we hope to better equip future law graduates to seize the myriad of opportunities available.&nbsp;At the same time, for those who choose to, the changes will better prepare and sustain them through the rigours of legal practice.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked about the need for the new nomenclature of lawyer (NP) and their role in the legal landscape vis-\u00e0-vis other legal professionals. Both he and Mr Raj Joshua Thomas asked if, going forward, in-house legal counsel will need to, first, be admitted as lawyers (NP). The nomenclature of \"lawyer (non-practitioner)\" was determined after public consultation. It was not intended to replace the term \"legal counsel\", nor was it intended to introduce new qualification requirements for in-house counsel.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather, it is to distinguish lawyers (NP) from advocates and solicitors and&nbsp;other individuals, while still recognising them as crucial stakeholders in the legal industry.&nbsp;The nomenclature does not reflect any professional hierarchy; it differentiates who is able to practise in the public's and industry's minds.&nbsp;For existing in-house legal counsel who wish to be admitted as lawyers (NP), this would depend on whether they fall within the transitional arrangements in the Bill.</p><p>Next, several Members, including Mr Louis Ng and Ms Nadia Samdin raised questions relating to the content and quality of the practice training during the lengthened Practice Training Period, or PTP. On this, I earlier mentioned that the SILE has published a detailed notice on its website outlining the new training requirements. Some of these requirements are already found in subsidiary legislation. MinLaw is working with the multiple stakeholders to amend the subsidiary legislation to include further operational details before the new framework comes into force by July 2024.</p><p>This includes the Legal Profession (Admission) Rules 2011, or the Admission Rules, which already provide for the responsibilities of supervising solicitors and training SLPs under practice training contracts; how a practice trainee may serve his or her PTP, including in certain law offices in the Public Service, such as the Public Defender's Office; and flexibility for practice trainees to undertake their practice training with more than one SLP. This recognises that training SLPs may not have the expertise or resources to provide exposure to all the required practice areas.</p><p>The door is also open for trainees to provide feedback on their training.&nbsp;The Law Society has a dedicated email address and the Members' Assistance and Care Helpline through which it offers career counselling, mentorship, guidance and practical tips to members and law graduates who are seeking to practise law.&nbsp;</p><p>Several Members have raised the issue of honoraria and leave benefits for practice trainees during the lengthened PTP. Concerns include whether practice trainees are being treated as \"cheap\" labour; whether during the lengthened PTP, practice trainees from lower-income families or who have additional responsibilities, will face a disproportionate or undue financial burden; and whether practice trainees will \"burn out\" if they are not given leave benefits.</p><p>MinLaw understands these concerns. As part of the plan to implement the Committee's recommendations, we have been discussing measures to address them with the working groups. I will, first, cover the issue of honoraria.&nbsp;</p><p>Practice training is, at its core, an apprenticeship, where aspiring legal practitioners seek out mentors to guide them in the industry and provide opportunities for practical exposure. It is a symbiotic relationship, where both trainees and supervising solicitors come together to contribute to the continued development of Singapore's legal industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Through the mentorship and experience gained from being attached to a supervising solicitor, a practice trainee is better equipped to operate independently as a lawyer. On this basis, practice trainees today typically receive honoraria, but do not receive employee benefits, like paid leave or Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions.&nbsp;</p><p>Training SLPs are often a practice trainee's first taste of legal practice and its accompanying realities and rigours. As ambassadors of the legal industry, it is important for training SLPs and supervising solicitors to support trainees, through the transition from school to legal practice with understanding, patience and fairness. This also sets the tone for a potentially longer-term employment relationship in the foreseeable future.</p><p>We encourage training SLPs to provide fair and reasonable honoraria that recognises trainees' contributions and allows them to meet their financial obligations. Under the new framework, training SLPs could also choose to grant larger honoraria to trainees with provisional PCs, recognising that they undertake a broader scope of responsibilities.</p><p>At the same time, we recognise that this needs to be balanced against the potential increased costs to law practices, particularly the smaller SLPs.</p><p>At present, there is no legislation prohibiting training SLPs from charging out for trainees' work. The Law Society has released guidance on such charging, which could help defray some costs of a longer PTP. Charging out for trainees' work would also recognise&nbsp;trainees' contributions and engender a greater sense of belonging within the profession.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, training SLPs will have to be mindful that charging clients for work done by practice trainees may change the nature of their relationship with the trainee to that of an employment relationship, with attendant CPF and employment tax obligations.</p><p>Some Members have suggested mandating a minimum honorarium quantum.&nbsp;While MinLaw has considered this, such a measure is prescriptive, introduces rigidity and would need to be constantly reviewed to account for prevailing conditions. The quantum also risks being set above what some small SLPs can afford and may also have the inadvertent effect of reducing the number of training places offered. MinLaw and the Law Society will continue to monitor the industry trends. Further guidance will be released as needed.</p><p>Next, I will address the issue of leave benefits. MinLaw, SILE and the Law Society are already looking into granting practice trainees leave days and medical leave to support them through their PTP, as part of the overall implementation of the lengthened PTP. More details will be announced in due course.</p><p>Beyond pay and leave, we also recognise that there are other important factors in ensuring a trainee's mental well-being. The Law Society has led by example by establishing the Law Society Mentorship Scheme and the Young Lawyers Law Mentor Scheme.&nbsp;These schemes provide platforms for law graduates and young lawyers to discuss issues on mental well-being, career development and ethics in full confidentiality with more experienced mentors.</p><p>Next, Mr Murali Pillai sought clarification on the length of PTP that legal and judicial service officers, or LSOs and JSOs, will be required to complete under the new framework. Assoc Prof Razwana Begum had also asked about completing PTP within the Public Service.</p><p>Today, LSOs and JSOs who wish to be admitted to the Bar can do so after completing their PTP, which is currently 36 months.&nbsp;However, unlike their peers in private practice, LSOs and JSOs are not required to be admitted to the Bar to perform their job functions in the Public Service. Their progression is also not prejudiced or affected by admission to the Bar.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the new framework, the PTP will be 12 months for all trainees across the industry. Trainees may continue to complete their PTP by working as an LSO or a JSO, or under the supervision of a Qualifying Relevant Legal Officer in the public sector. A review was undertaken of the training programme for LSOs and JSOs. The Committee's report noted that there is little substantive difference in the content or quality of training provided in the public and private sectors. In both cases, the training covers legal skills, professional responsibilities and ethics, etiquette and conduct. This was a key rationale for the change in the PTP period for LSOs and JSOs.</p><p>Next, several Members raised questions and concerns about implementing the CPTL's recommendation to raise the standards and stringency of the Part B Bar exams. This topic falls outside the scope of the Bill. However, I will comment briefly.</p><p>This was one of the Committee's key structural recommendations. It was intended to ensure that the quality of the Singapore Bar remains consistently high and to better equip our law graduates. SILE has revamped the Part B Course to include topics that are gaining importance, focus on core principles and mirror the realities of practice.</p><p>The new Part B Course was introduced in the 2023 session. SILE has received constructive feedback from the industry and current candidates. Support has been offered to the current candidates, including more on-demand video lectures and contact hours, live Q&amp;A segments during Contact Sessions and recordings for candidates to review.&nbsp;MinLaw will continue working with SILE to engage current candidates to understand where the gaps are and what further refinements can be introduced.</p><p>Next, on allowing up to three months of PTP to be completed at the in-house legal departments of approved non-law practice entities. Members had asked for more details about the application process, the qualifying criteria for these entities and had proposed entities for consideration.</p><p>This is optional for practice trainees. Further details, including the formal application process and finalised criteria for qualifying entities, will be announced in due course.</p><p>To provide insight, MinLaw had, in 2019, publicly consulted on the qualifying criteria proposed by the working group. They included suggestions that the entity should: have a minimum of three lawyers doing legal work; have at least one Singapore-qualified lawyer with at least five years of legal experience, either in-house or in active practice, within the last seven years, who will act as supervising counsel to the trainee; and handle a sufficient amount of Singapore law-related work for the trainee to receive meaningful training in Singapore law.</p><p>The majority of the respondents supported the criteria proposed in the public consultation. The working group will refer to these proposed criteria and Members' suggestions when preparing the subsidiary legislation on the qualifying criteria.&nbsp;Non-law practice entities that wish to offer training opportunities may write to SILE and MinLaw to register their interest in being considered.</p><p>Some Members asked about how the new framework for provisional PCs will be operationalised, such as the professional indemnity insurance requirements, what happens if a provisional PC is suspended or revoked and how a lawyer (NP)'s fitness to hold a provisional PC will be determined.</p><p>I had mentioned in my opening speech that the framework for provisional PCs in the Bill is substantively similar to that concerning PCs for advocates and solicitors. It is, therefore, open to the relevant stakeholders to take guidance from existing practices and case law concerning PCs, such as a solicitor's fitness to hold a PC when applying the new provisional PC framework.&nbsp;Further operational details are being worked on by the multi-stakeholder working groups and will be released in due course.</p><p>Next, several Members have sought clarification on how the moratorium period will be implemented and operationalised, including how breaches will be detected and possible consequences.&nbsp;The multi-stakeholder working group has been discussing these details.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, this Bill amends the Act to provide flexibility for implementing such details in the future. Before introducing the measures to strictly enforce the moratorium period, the relevant agencies will engage law students and law practices to socialise the change.</p><p>Several Members have also raised issues not directly covered in the Bill. These touch on implementation and operational details of the Committee's recommendations.&nbsp;For example, the relationship between trainees and supervising solicitors, suggestions for Continuing Professional Development activities and the extension of the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidy to support trainees during the lengthened PTP.&nbsp;I thank Members for their comments and suggestions. MinLaw will work with the relevant stakeholders and working groups to review the feedback received.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, I believe that I have addressed all the questions posed by Members on the Bill. Sir, with that, I beg to move.</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>: Do Members have any clarifications for Senior Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu? No.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

(proc text)]</p><p>Mr Speaker, on the occasion of the New Year in 2022, the Workers' Party (WP) identified cost of living as a major pressure point for low- to middle-income families, which strikes most acutely the families with both young children and aged parents to care for.</p><p>In the same message, the WP committed to tracking how the Government upgrades its legacy schemes for, and I quote: \"the circumstances of today and tomorrow, not yesterday\".&nbsp;The reality of the pressures faced by low- and middle-income Singaporeans was repeated in the WP May Day message that same year.&nbsp;On May Day this year, the WP warned that Singaporeans were living through one of the most rapid cost-of-living rises in history, eroding the purchasing power of their wages.</p><p>And, finally, in our National Day message this year, celebrations which also saw a remake of Dick Lee's 1988 hit, \"Home\", the WP noted that just as the remake of \"Home\" comes at a time when Singapore and the world are at a different juncture from a quarter century ago, our national policies also need to be re-examined to make them relevant to today's Singapore.</p><p>On cost of living, the WP acknowledges the one-time reliefs extended to eligible households. Most recently, on the back of the announcement by the Public Utilities Board (PUB) in late September of an increase in water prices.</p><p>For the purposes of this Motion, the WP will look into possibilities of further reducing cost-of-living pressures by way of policy change. This House must leave no stone unturned because, for some Singaporeans, this has become a cost-of-living crisis.</p><p>My speech is in three parts. First, I will cover the situation facing Singaporeans on the ground, particularly for workers, seniors and their families. Second, I will cover some policy areas where the Government can explore the prospect of lowering costs for Singaporeans in different ways. Finally, I will outline specific areas which will be expanded upon by the WP Members of Parliament (MPs), where policies can be changed, enhanced, revisited or even overhauled, so as to lower cost-of-living pressures for Singaporeans and their families.</p><p>First, the cost-of-living reality facing Singaporeans. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)'s inflation outlook tells us that inflation has slowed across a broad range of goods and services and core inflation is projected to come down to between 2.5% and 3% by December, lower than its 5.5% peak in January.</p><p>However, from our ground outreach and from feedback received by the WP, cost of living worries for Singaporeans are clearly moving in the opposite direction. This is understandable, as there is a chasm between, on the one hand, headlines that say that inflation is stabilising, while on the other hand, price rises continue to hit Singaporeans hard.</p><p>The Parliamentary reply by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) this morning of a 4.5% fall in real median income in the first half of 2023 is consistent with this emotion.</p><p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures inflation, only covers household consumption expenditures and does not include non-consumption expenditures, such as loan repayments, the purchase of property, including Housing and Development (HDB) flats, monthly mortgage payments and credit card debt payments.</p><p>Interest rates are often accompanied by price increases and loan interest rates remain high. What was cash-in-hand not too long ago has, now and in the future, to be used for interest payments. This reality reinforces the view that prices are galloping away and that incomes are struggling to catch up.</p><p>It is important to also consider the compounding effect of price increases with costs passed down from enterprises to consumers. The breadth and depth of the rise in prices also vary considerably, since consumption patterns differ from each household. For example, a household with young children will be sensitive to rising tuition and enrichment class costs, in addition to other expenses that accompany raising a child.</p><p>Singaporeans who need a vehicle for their work are understandably more sensitive to Certificate of Entitlement (COE), diesel and petrol prices.</p><p>On the other hand, food prices account for a large proportion of income at the lowest strata of society. And so, when a plate of chicken rice or noodles goes up by $2 or $3 and coffee prices shoot up far more than increases in water prices, for example, the pinch for low- and even middle-income Singaporeans is real and painful.</p><p>When income growth cannot match this increase in prices, it is perfectly understandable why Singaporeans feel nervous and anxious. In some cases, this may even lead to the deterioration of their mental health.</p><p>Mr Speaker, a Forum Page letter in The Straits Times on 27 September 2023 was titled: \"Cost of Living: More help needed for lower-income families affected by rising prices\". The letter put into words the worries of many Singaporeans that the rising price of goods and services that began right after the COVID-19 crisis would trap Singapore in a vicious circle of unending price increases.</p><p>For example, and I quote: \"The transport fare and Goods and Services Tax (GST) increases are likely to trickle down into higher operating costs for all businesses, including hawkers and coffee shop operators, who will then be compelled to pass on the incremental cost by raising their prices to remain profitable and to survive\". It goes on: \"Life can become challenging and stressful in an inflationary environment with reduced real income and purchasing power. Some low-income families are prone to becoming dysfunctional, resulting in domestic conflict and disharmony.\"</p><p>The Government rolled out a S$1.1 billion support package in late September, around the same time the PUB announced a hike in water prices.&nbsp;One oft-quoted economist expressed surprise at the timing of the announcement of the support package and suggested that the Government was confident of funding it from better-than-expected revenue collected. This would explain why it was able to announce the measure halfway through the fiscal year. He said, \"From a political standpoint, it shows that the overall fiscal position of the Government is strong enough to be able to give some back before the Budget.\"</p><p>Sir, this off-Budget package and the Government's current fiscal position calls into question the necessity of a GST hike next year. The People's Action Party (PAP)'s argument is that a GST hike is necessary and that this is a political decision it has taken for reasons it has explained.</p><p>My co-sponsor for this Motion, Sengkang Group Representation Constituency (GRC) MP, Louis Chua will speak more about this. But given the inflationary environment and the substantial effects on the ground, the WP calls for a review of this decision, in light of the cost-of-living crisis.</p><p>Like the many other increases announced over the last month, there is a real concern that a 1% rise in GST will have yet another knock-on consequence on prices on the ground from January next year.</p><p>The contributions of the WP in this debate will move beyond one-time fiscal handouts and explore possible structural changes to existing policies to reduce cost-of-living expenses for ordinary Singaporeans who live in an elevated, inflationary and interest-rate environment and they will continue living in such a scenario for some time to come.</p><p>Individually, the WP MPs' suggestions will understandably be specific to a particular policy area. But taken as a whole, they point to the possibility of instituting significant structural adjustments to policies that account for the reality of today and tomorrow's cost of living environment, especially for low-income groups and those like the sandwich middle class.&nbsp;</p><p>I will now come on to the next part of my speech.</p><p>Mr Speaker, I believe we can better align domestic water tariff tiers to actual consumption by households with the view to reducing water bills for households that conserve water.</p><p>The last time domestic water tariff tiers were restructured, it took place over four years from 1997 to 2000. At the end of that exercise, water prices went up more than 120%. A major impetus for that price hike was the argument that Singapore would be short of water after the expiry of the 2011 Water Agreement with Malaysia.</p><p>A parallel objective of the exercise was to get Singaporeans to treat water as a precious and strategic resource and to make water conservation a way of life. Water borne fees were also raised to recover the cost of wastewater treatment.</p><p>Prior to the year 2000, the domestic water tariff had three tiers to correspond to different consumption levels.&nbsp;The three tiers of water prices for domestic use were as follows: households that used zero to 20 cubic metres of water a month followed by those that used 20 to 40 cubic metres and finally, those that used more than 40 cubic metres a month.</p><p>After the water pricing restructuring exercise from the year 2000, the Government did away with three tiers for domestic users and proceeded with only two tiers. A household today is charged differently only if it consumes more than 40 cubic metres a month. If you consume below 20 cubic metres of water a month, you will be charged at the rate between zero to 40 cubic metres since there is no specific tier between zero and 20 cubic metres of water anymore.</p><p>Arising from the changes in the year 2000, the Government decided that it was not going to continue charging households at the lowest rate tier because these households were not subject to a significant water conservation tax.</p><p>Based on publicly available information I have perused, there was no argument canvassed for specifically moving away from a three tier to a two-tiered water pricing regime for households beyond general statements of intent, and it was not explained why an increase in the water conservation tax could not be imposed for those consuming between zero and 20 cubic metres of water per month to cohere with treating each drop of water as a precious resource.&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">However, arising from the low amount of water conservation tax paid, it was advanced that these households in the lowest domestic tier had little to no incentive to save water.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Prior to the changes of the water pricing structure in 2000, about 56% of Singaporean households used less than 20 cubic metres of water and paid no water conservation tax.&nbsp;Thirty-four percent if households paid for water at the next tier which was between 20 and 40 cubic metres of water with a low water conservation tax.&nbsp;The 10% of households that consumed more than 40 cubic metres of water paid a smaller water conservation tax at 15%, than non-domestic consumers at 20%.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">&nbsp;The latter was deemed by the Government to be an unsatisfactory state of affairs as large non-domestic water users or businesses were assessed to often recycle a large proportion of the water they used and were not necessarily more wasteful than large domestic users.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">&nbsp;The Government argued that the existing pricing structure would jack up business costs and affect Singapore's business costs and competitiveness and will also fail to have a significant effect on smaller households paying lower domestic rates.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Compared to 56% of households in the past who consumed between zero and 20 cubic metres of water, today 96% of households are consuming between zero and 40 cubic metres of water, with HDB dwellers consuming 16.2 cubic metres of water per month in 2020. Evidently, these HDB households in particular are paying for water at the lower of the two tiers, But this supposedly lowered tier captures users within a very wide pricing band of zero to 40 cubic metres.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">I call on the Government to look into the prospect of restructuring water pricing tiers so as to more accurately reflect water usage, with a view to incentivise water conservation and lower costs for households.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">The current two-tier compared to the legacy three-tier structure for domestic users does not fairly reflect water consumption patterns. In fact, a case can be made that it puts a heavier water conservation tax burden for the majority of users whose overall consumption patterns are already located in the lower half of the current zero to 40 cubic metres end.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">To this end, Mr Speaker, I ask the Government to look into the introduction of a fairer and more acutely tiered tariff structure reflecting actual consumption of water from zero to 10, 10 to 20, 20 to 30, 30 to 40 and 40 and above cubic metres, with a view to encouraging greater efforts at water conservation. This should be coupled with a graduated water conservation tax regime starting at 30% for those consuming between zero and 10 cubic metres of water and hitting 60% for households that consume between 30 and 40 cubic metres of water per month so that households that consume more water cross subsidised those that consume less.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">A graduated water conservation tax across the various tiers would incentivise water conservation and continue to serve the policy purpose of ensuring that water is continually treated as a scarce commodity. With this more acutely tiered water pricing regime, the quantum of fiscal support provided through GST Vouchers </span>\u2013<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\"> U-Save can be right-sized proportionately.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">&nbsp;Under such a fairer tariff structure, the 96% of households consuming less than 40 cubic metres of water today would be charged a water conservation tax that more progressively reflects how much they actually consumed and these households ought to see a reduction in water charges.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in contrast to households, non-domestic users are charged a flat rate with a lower water conservation tax than the current uppermost tier for households or domestic users.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">&nbsp;The Government should look into the state of affairs from a fresh perspective and assess if tiers can be introduced for businesses for a fairer and better deployment of the water conservation tax with a view to better support small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that potentially can be incentivised to use less water where possible.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">&nbsp;As public information for the use of water by different types of businesses is not readily available, this would have to be explored further to determine how to make the water conservation tax promote behavioural change for different types of non-domestic users,</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Introducing tiers for non-domestic consumers would equalise the expectation of water conservation as a shared objective of households and businesses.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">&nbsp;To this end, it would be useful to recap where we were and where we are in our water journey.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Under our Green Plan 2030, Singapore's blueprint for a more sustainable future that sets out our green targets, Singapore aims to reduce household water consumption to 130 litres per person per day.&nbsp;In 2021, it was at 158 litres. As recently as 2017, PUB sought to reduce consumption to 140 litres per person per day by 2030, but the reality of climate change has necessitated the drawing up of new targets.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">I would advance that the lowering the water conservation tax for households that conserve more water under a more finely determined tariff structure would promote behavioural change that would also allow us to meet green targets while simultaneously lowering cost for end consumers.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Moving on to prices more generally, Mr Speaker, the cost of living crisis has not gone unnoticed by Singapore businesses.&nbsp;Some companies have announced inflation support payments as cost of living subsidies to junior staff.&nbsp;But there are companies that have done more than give one-time support.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">For example, Prudential Singapore was reported by The Business Times to have improved medical and outpatient benefits such as dental consultations and outpatient specialist treatments, including alternative treatments. These enhancements to existing schemes were in addition to wage adjustments to match inflation and market competitiveness to support employee groups most affected by rising costs.&nbsp;DBS Bank, for example, has enhanced the POSB HDB home loan package with an all-in interest rate of 2.6% per annum for borrowers with a monthly income of $2,500 and below.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Sir, if businesses can adjust their policies beyond one-time support, the Government certainly can do more too.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">In this light, as advanced by the WP, I reiterate the call in this Motion for the Government to review all its existing schemes, make them fit for purpose in this heightened inflationary environment so as to better support Singaporeans against the onslaught of prices, which is destined to continue unabated, particularly with the upcoming hike to the GST.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">&nbsp;Take for example the Workforce Income Supplement (WIS) which was extended to workers aged between 30 and 34 last year, including a $200 increase for workers earning a gross income of 2,500 and below.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Sir, WIS is currently split into 40% cash in 60% CPF contribution.&nbsp;If one is self-employed, the cash component of WIS is only 10% with a 90% MediSave contribution.</span></p><p>Sir, it would be useful to consider a shift in the weightage of the WIS for our low-income workers in this period of heightened inflation in favour of a greater cash payout. As wages traditional do not move was fast and as significant in quantum for Singaporeans at the lower decils, additional cash in hand will provide much needed relief for our workers,&nbsp;sensitive to the needs of the hour.&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">A few hundred dollars for seniors who continued to work and for whom WIS payments are pegged at the highest tiers can make a world of difference to their lives.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Finally, before the advent of COVID-19, I had asked the then Senior Minister of State of the Ministry of Health (MOH) to look into whether it was possible to raise the amount of MediSave monies older Singaporeans were able to utilise for outpatient treatments and possibly to peg the withdrawal limit to how much seniors have in their MediSave accounts.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">&nbsp;Arising from a Parliamentary Question (PQ) filed by Ms Hazel Poa in late 2020, we know that individuals aged 85 and above have on average about $6,300 left in their MediSave accounts upon their demise.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">&nbsp;A more acute set of data was presented by MOH arising from a PQ by Member Patrick Tay. This data revealed that for Singaporeans who passed away aged 85 or older, between 2017 and 2021, about 20% had $1,000 or less left in their MediSave accounts and 50% had between $1,000 and $10,000 left. Of greater interest is the fact that 10% had between $10,000 and $20,000 left and another 10% had between $20,000 and $30,000, and the last 10% had more than $30,000 left in their MediSave accounts.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Mr Speaker, these numbers indicate there is a scope to allow some seniors with healthy MediSave balances to deploy them for their own use beyond what is allowed today. In fact, the aforesaid approach is already taken for the use of MediSave monies with regard to long-term care.&nbsp;The challenge would be to find the optimum level that also takes into account the prospect of medical inflation and ensures that there is little to no premature emptying of MediSave accounts. This may be difficult for seniors who, for example, are between 60 and 70 years of age and have less than $10,000 in their MediSave accounts.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">&nbsp;However, even the limited amount of MOH data I have quoted shows that further loosening of MediSave rules is conceivable. This would help some senior Singaporeans who have to cope with cost of&nbsp;living concerns that can be aggravated especially if they are no longer working.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Mr Speaker, I move to conclude: the WP MPs will expand on other changes that can be implemented to lower the cost of living for Singaporeans.&nbsp;Sengkang GRC MP Louis Chua, He Ting Ru and Jamus Lim will focus on housing, healthcare and transport. Aljunied GRC MP Gerald Giam will cover public transport, while Sylvia Lim will speak about electricity prices.&nbsp;MP for Hougang Single Member Constituency (SMC) Dennis Tan will review certain aspects of means testing in our public healthcare system and help for families with adults with special needs or disabilities.&nbsp;For his part, Aljunied GRC MP Faisal Manap will make a case to introduce social protection steps and in the name of a refreshed social compact to adopt a more systematic approach towards tracking the effectiveness of our social assistance programmes.&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I beg to move.</span></p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Liang Eng Hwa.</p><h6>2.44 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, the rising cost of living across the globe has become a global concern.&nbsp;We have seen sharp price increases in Europe, the United States (US) and other continents; triggered of by a series of supply shocks that leads to sharp increases in energy, food and commodity prices as well as the demand arising from post-COVID recovery.</p><p>In the largest economy in the world, the US, its Federal Reserves or the Fed has raised its interest rates 11 times in just about one and a half years to tame the stubbornly high inflation, lifting rates from about 1% to near 5.5% today.&nbsp;So have the other central banks near and far, raising rates to manage and dampen demand.</p><p>Singapore is not spared from this global inflationary crisis. While inflation has come down from its peak, households are still having to cope with the impact of the various price increases.&nbsp;In addition, we are also faced with domestic cost pressures and, in particular, we are in this necessary transition to uplift the wages of fellow Singaporeans, especially the low-wage workers.</p><p>Sir, cost of the living is a topic that I have filed among the most PQs in recent years, so had many of the Members of Parliament from both sides of the aisles.&nbsp;We can feel firsthand the impact of the cost of living increases in our neighbourhood centres, at our workplaces and in our daily living experiences. Our low- to middle-income Singaporeans are particularly affected.</p><p>So, what is our counter to these series of rising costs?</p><p>In the case of Singapore, fortunately, we do have a suite of policy tools that help us mitigate the impact of rising cost pressures.&nbsp;</p><p>First, our strong Singapore dollar.&nbsp;Our strong Singapore dollar has been an effective broad-based tool to manage imported inflation as almost everything that we consume are imported. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has tightened our monetary policy five times since October 2021, in essence, strengthening the Singapore dollar against the currencies of our major trading partners.&nbsp;Without the strong Singapore dollar, our inflation and hence, cost of living situation would have been even more severe.</p><p>Here, I just want caution that a strong Singapore dollar is not always a given. It is not a drop from sky for us.&nbsp;We cannot just demand a strong Singapore dollar or decree as such. It depends on the markets, which, in turn, depends on whether we have the strong economic fundamentals to deserve this value of the Singapore dollar.&nbsp;If our fundamentals are weakened, you can rest assured the markets will find a new value for the Singapore dollar almost instantly.</p><p>Fundamentals such as economic dynamism, competent economic management, financial reserves, political stability, social harmony and importantly, prudent fiscal management. These factors have a bearing on our international ratings and the confidence in the Singapore dollar and hence, preserve our purchasing power.&nbsp;So, let us jealously safeguard this very important asset that we have and not undermine it.</p><p>Secondly, competitive business and enterprise ecosystem.&nbsp;Having a competitive business landscape at both the macro and retail level are important to keep prices in check and to prevent profiteering.&nbsp;Essentially, we want consumers to have choices and have the option to compare prices, whether it is to choose a new mobile phone plan or to buy groceries from among the supermarkets that we have.</p><p>In Chinese, we call this \"\u8d27\u6bd4\u4e09\u5bb6\" or \"<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">\u8d27\u6bd4</span>\u6216\u591a\u5bb6\", or to be able to compare prices across three or more shops.</p><p>Years ago, I was among the strong proponents for the Government to resume building hawker centres and was glad that the Government eventually reversed its policy in 2011 to start building hawker centres again.&nbsp;Hawker centres, besides keeping our hawker culture going, help to create a competitive environment in the eating house space, directly competing with coffee shops and other eateries. More importantly, it offers consumers choices and more value-for-money options.</p><p>We need to keep the business ecosystem competitive, including having diverse sources of supply, just in case we are being outpriced by some of these traditional sources of supply.</p><p>Thirdly, jobs and income growth.&nbsp;Having job and income growth helps an individual and their family cope with the cost of living.&nbsp;Growing the economy to create good jobs and better pay is critical, which is why we continually invest in skills upgrade to improve employability.</p><p>We need a business-friendly ecosystem and to continually attract investments so as to keep the economy strong and vibrant to create good jobs.&nbsp;Having a strong economy also helps generate the tax revenues needed to pay for our growing expenditures.&nbsp;This is another important component&nbsp;\u2013 jobs and income growth.</p><p>Fourthly, direct Government assistance.&nbsp;Beyond the multi-pronged macro strategies, direct Government assistance is the key source of support to help Singaporeans cope with rising costs, both the subsidies and support packages.&nbsp;</p><p>The Government do subsidise substantially in a range of areas&nbsp;\u2013 healthcare, housing, education, transport, childcare and a range of social programmes, amongst others.&nbsp;To help Singaporeans better cope with the current cost of living concerns and the new GST rates, the Government has provided direct support assistance through the Budget and off-Budget measures since last year.&nbsp;</p><p>We have the permanent GST Voucher scheme and the Assurance Package. Both have been enhanced.&nbsp;In September this year, the Government announced an additional $1.1 billion Cost of Living Package to provide relief to lower- to middle-income families.&nbsp;This includes a further $800 million enhancements to the Assurance Package as well as an additional subsidy of about $300 million to moderate the fare increase of public transport.</p><p>Because of the various enhancements to these packages and the payouts that are spread throughout the year, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) now publishes the calendar view of the monthly disbursements so that it is easier for Singaporeans to anticipate the payouts each month.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I must say that when I distributed this handout to my residents during a Kopi Talk, all of them welcomed this and kept this so that they can track whether they are receiving all these payouts. It is something that is helping our residents directly.</p><p>Sir, I believe in today's debate on the Motion on cost of living, we are not looking at either extreme, that is, on one extreme, we pass on the full impact of all the cost increases to consumers and, on the other extreme, the Government fully shields people from all impacts of cost increases.</p><p>I believe no government in the world would adopt either extreme approach. For that matter, no Town Councils will do that as well.</p><p>Rather, we are here debating what that balance is.&nbsp;How could we continue to pursue polices which, together, lower cost of living pressures on Singaporeans and their families, but without undermining our fiscal sustainability and being responsible to future generations?</p><p>Sir, I want to add a couple of points before I sum up.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, this global inflationary situation, while we hope that it will go away soon, may actually last longer that we thought.&nbsp;The unending war in Ukraine, potentially the escalation of conflicts in Middle East, superpowers' geopolitical tensions, the rivalry that is being played in the global supply chain, the adverse weather that we now see more often&nbsp;\u2013 all these could fuel further shocks to the energy, food and commodity markets. So, we must be prepared that the high-cost situation around the world could worsen or continue for a prolonged period of time.</p><p>In other words, we must be prepared to sustain the long haul.</p><p>Secondly, these additional costs whether it is from having to pay for higher energy costs, higher food costs, higher imported material costs and so on, are real costs or outflows to us as a country entity.&nbsp;For example, in the production of clean water, the higher energy costs to treat and recycle water is an outlay that will flow out of the country to the energy producing country.</p><p>My point here is that we need to be able to always have the means to pay for these costs, which is rising in our current situation.&nbsp;Just because we freeze prices or put a cap to price increases, the outflow required to pay for these external costs does not just disappear magically.</p><p>The only way to do it on a sustainable basis is to be able to generate inflows to be able to pay for these additional costs.</p><p>Hence, the need to grow our economy to build capabilities to generate revenue, the need for a foreign exchange to create jobs, better wages so that individual and households can have the means to cope with the cost of living.&nbsp;This is more so for a small island state like Singapore with no natural resources.&nbsp;We must be able to get our inflows so that we can pay for our outflows.</p><p>Sir, we must get our fundamentals right.&nbsp;This is the only sustainable and sound way forward as we continue to tackle expected and unexpected challenges and crises ahead in this volatile and uncertain world.</p><p>Sir, in this context and with your consent, I would like to propose amendments to the Motion.</p><h6>2.55 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Can I have a copy of your amendment? [<em>A copy of the amendment was handed to Mr Speaker.</em>]&nbsp;The amendment is in order. Are copies available for Members?</p><p><strong>Mr Liang Eng Hwa</strong>: Yes, Sir. [<em>Copies of the amendment were distributed to hon Members.</em>]</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: I will allow some time for the copies to be distributed and then ask the Member to move his amendment.<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;Mr Liang, you can please move your amendment now.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Liang Eng Hwa</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the following amendments:</p><p>First, \"In line 1, after the words 'That this House' to insert the words 'acknowledges that cost of living is a global concern, and'\".&nbsp;</p><p>Second, \"In line 1, to delete 'review its policies so as to' and insert 'continue pursuing policies that together'\".</p><p>And third, \"At the end of line 2, to add ', without undermining our fiscal sustainability and burdening future generations of Singaporeans'\".&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, I beg to move.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: There are three amendments proposed by Mr Liang Eng Hwa to the Motion. These are:</p><p>Amendment No 1, \"In line 1, after the words 'That this House' to insert the words 'acknowledges that cost of living is a global concern, and'\".&nbsp;</p><p>Amendment No 2, \"In line 1, to delete 'review its policies so as to' and insert 'continue pursuing policies that together'\".</p><p>Amendment No 3, \"At the end of line 2, to add ', without undermining our fiscal sustainability and burdening future generations of Singaporeans'\".&nbsp;</p><p>It may be convenient that the debate on the original Motion and on any other amendments moved by Members be proceeded with simultaneously as a debate on a single question.

Would the amendments not qualify as a very significant change to the original Motion?</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: I think it covers still. It is on the same topic. It elaborates on a few other things. So, I think it is still within the ambit of your original Motion.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put and agreed to. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Ms Sylvia Lim.</p><h6>2.59 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, electricity is a basic necessity of modern living. However, as a&nbsp;small nation with few natural resources, we are forced to rely on others for our&nbsp;energy needs.</p><p>According to the Energy Market Authority (EMA), 95% of our&nbsp;electricity is generated using imported natural gas. This leaves us vulnerable to&nbsp;global events, including rising gas prices, tensions in the Middle East and supply&nbsp;disruptions, which all may cause energy prices to spike unexpectedly. It is&nbsp;therefore in our national interest to conserve energy and diversify our energy&nbsp;sources.</p><p>While the electricity tariff has experienced some ups and downs in recent quarters,&nbsp;the SP Group recently announced that electricity tariffs for the fourth quarter of&nbsp;this year would go up by 3.7% per kilowatt-hour (kWh), due to higher&nbsp;fuel costs. This, in turn, will result in higher electricity bills for households and&nbsp;small businesses, adding to the high costs of living that Singaporeans are struggling&nbsp;to grapple with.</p><p>As far as electricity usage is concerned, our priorities should be encouraging&nbsp;energy conservation and managing costs for consumers.</p><p>To this end, I have noted&nbsp;recent Government announcements, such as the setting up of Gasco to centralise&nbsp;gas procurement by next year, which has the potential to bring down the cost of&nbsp;gas for power generation.&nbsp;There is also a pilot initiative next year to offer rebates&nbsp;to consumers who reduce usage during peak hours.</p><p>However, in my opinion,&nbsp;more can be done to one, encourage conservation of electricity; and two, lower costs&nbsp;for consumers.</p><p>First, on the pricing of household electricity.&nbsp;About 15 years ago, in 2008, this&nbsp;House debated public concerns about high electricity prices.&nbsp;At that time, I raised&nbsp;the possibility of adopting a tiered pricing model, which would enable households&nbsp;who consumed moderate amounts of electricity to pay for usage at a lower rate,&nbsp;if their consumption did not exceed a certain threshold. Households who&nbsp;consumed electricity in excess of the threshold would pay for the excess at a&nbsp;higher rate.</p><p>In rejecting my suggestion in 2008 and again in 2010, then Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) Senior Minister&nbsp;of State S Iswaran, argued that the Government intended to facilitate competition&nbsp;in household electricity pricing through opening the retail electricity market.</p><p>The&nbsp;Government touted more flexible choices and \"competitive pricing\" with the new&nbsp;open electricity market for consumers. Please allow me to quote what&nbsp;then Senior Minister of State Iswaran said: \"\u2026in the long term, EMA is working towards opening up the&nbsp;household electricity market for competition so that consumers will be&nbsp;able to purchase electricity direct from different suppliers through a&nbsp;range of retail packages that they offer. Ms Lim asked whether the&nbsp;Government will allow such retail electricity sellers to use a tiered&nbsp;system. Once such a market is established, then we should leave it to the&nbsp;market to work out what are the different ways they can meet customer&nbsp;needs... If we were to introduce a tiered system today, it means&nbsp;Government is deciding what is an acceptable level&nbsp;of electricity consumption and establish that as the threshold... This is&nbsp;quite a problematic process in terms of determining the key levels of&nbsp;thresholds. So, it would be far superior to allow the market to work, for us&nbsp;to give targeted subsidies to those who need it and when the market is&nbsp;fully liberalised, the players can then work out the schemes as we see in&nbsp;other sectors like telecoms.\"</p><p>Sir, it was thus a key plank of the Government's strategy to bank on the open electricity market to manage electricity prices for consumers.</p><p>Accordingly, the&nbsp;open electricity market for households was rolled out in 2018, to great fanfare. This did not&nbsp;last.&nbsp;As we are all acutely aware, six retailers have since exited the market. Many&nbsp;were under-hedged and were stuck with lower-priced fixed rate electricity&nbsp;contracts while energy prices rose unexpectedly. This drove them to a loss-making&nbsp;proposition, leaving them no choice but to exit the market.</p><p>Today, most&nbsp;of the remaining retailers are backed by power generation companies while two&nbsp;others offer plans with only \"marginal price differences from the regulated tariff\".</p><p>Sir, in the wake of the problems with the open electricity market, the EMA tightened its requirements&nbsp;for open electricity market retailers in July 2023. These tighter requirements include requiring a&nbsp;licensee to hedge at least 80% of their contracted retail demand, set up funds to&nbsp;pay for premature termination of contracts and so on.&nbsp;A CNA report from August this year observed that these additional requirements could&nbsp;result in higher prices for consumers.</p><p>The uptake of price plans from retailers has also been slow.&nbsp;As of 1 March 2023,&nbsp;only 40.6% of residential units have adopted the retail price&nbsp;plan.</p><p>According to a report by the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies, barriers to&nbsp;switching in the retail electricity market include complexity of the retail market&nbsp;and electricity tariffs, transaction costs, uncertainty of service quality and&nbsp;behavioural biases, among others. There is also the question of how viable it is&nbsp;to have many retailers competing for the relatively small domestic market in&nbsp;Singapore.</p><p>As matters stand now, much uncertainty remains over the revamped open electricity market&nbsp;model. It is unclear whether consumers will benefit from the liberalisation of the&nbsp;electricity market and if so, to what extent.</p><p>What, then, are the other options for managing household electricity bills?&nbsp;So far, a&nbsp;large part of the Government's answer has been to distribute U-Save vouchers,&nbsp;mainly to HDB households.</p><p>While U-Save vouchers are useful, they are&nbsp;effectively taxpayer subsidies for certain types of households.&nbsp;As a complement&nbsp;to these measures, the Government could review its electricity tariff structures.&nbsp;In&nbsp;particular, I would ask the Government again to consider implementing a tiered&nbsp;pricing structure for household consumers. Further or alternatively, the Government should consider a pricing structure that is based on time of use that&nbsp;discourages electricity consumption at peak hours. Both of these have the&nbsp;potential to lower electricity costs for consumers.</p><p>First, tiered pricing.&nbsp;Tiered pricing is known in some countries as increasing block tariffs&nbsp;(IBTs).&nbsp;Under such a system, households that consume electricity below a&nbsp;certain threshold would be charged at a lower rate, while those consuming higher&nbsp;amounts would pay higher rates for the excess consumption.</p><p>In Singapore's&nbsp;context, one could set the threshold amounts, looking at the consumption patterns&nbsp;tracked by the EMA.&nbsp;Thus, for example, in deciding where to set the threshold&nbsp;amounts, one could take reference from the average consumption per month for&nbsp;3-room HDB households, which is around 22 kWh.</p><p>In 2010, then Senior Minister of State Iswaran responded that tiered pricing would amount to the&nbsp;Government essentially deciding what an \"acceptable\" level of electricity&nbsp;consumption is.&nbsp;I do not agree with this characterisation.</p><p>What we would be&nbsp;doing is to encourage energy conservation by charging a lower rate for what is&nbsp;deemed a basic necessity.</p><p>Tiered pricing of household electricity is used in many countries.&nbsp;To understand&nbsp;more about it, we could look to the benefits in several other countries where it&nbsp;has been implemented.&nbsp;</p><p>One such example is China.&nbsp;In 2012, China rolled out a tiered electricity pricing&nbsp;system across 29 provinces, with three tiers. The specific levels differed,&nbsp;depending on the province, but generally, the lowest pricing tier aimed&nbsp;to capture about 80% of residential households. The second tier had 15% of households while the third highest tier covered the remaining 5%.</p><p>A report by the China Economic&nbsp;Quarterly International showed that in the years following the implementation of&nbsp;tiered pricing, there was a 6.1% reduction in electricity consumption.</p><p>Sir, while&nbsp;each jurisdiction will decide how to set their tiers, this example shows that tiered&nbsp;pricing can have a positive effect in reducing overall consumption.</p><p>Another example is Hong Kong.&nbsp;Hong Kong has two major suppliers of&nbsp;household electricity, namely HK Electric and China Light and Power.&nbsp;Both of&nbsp;them offer tiered pricing, with as many as seven tiers.&nbsp;Small users pay preferential&nbsp;rates.&nbsp;According to the Hong Kong Environment and Ecology Bureau, tiered&nbsp;pricing is deployed for residential consumers to \"promote energy efficiency and&nbsp;conservation\".</p><p>Tiered tariffs can also be found in a host of other jurisdictions, including the&nbsp;United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa.</p><p>In fact, a World Bank&nbsp;study of 60 developed and developing countries showed that 60% of countries&nbsp;surveyed made use of tiered pricing or volumetric IBTs.&nbsp;The study noted that&nbsp;the rationale for a tiered pricing structure was to provide a \"social safety net\"&nbsp;whereby all consumers could assess a basic subsistence volume of consumption&nbsp;at a very affordable tariff, while ensuring that the revenue shortfall was covered&nbsp;by surcharges on the largest consumers.&nbsp;The study found that volumetric IBTs&nbsp;had \"a material effect on affordability\".</p><p>Mr Speaker, I note that in a more recent Parliamentary answer to a question&nbsp;raised by Mr Don Wee last year, the Minister for Trade and Industry again rejected&nbsp;a tiered pricing approach.&nbsp;MTI stated that electricity should be priced at its \"full&nbsp;cost of production and delivery\" and warned of \"inadvertent implications\".&nbsp;The&nbsp;Minister gave an example of a multi-generational household paying more if they&nbsp;lived in a single home, than in two smaller homes.</p><p>While this may be true, this&nbsp;phenomenon already exists in many Government policies.&nbsp;The larger, multi-generational&nbsp;household is already receiving less Service and Conservancy Charges (S&amp;CC) and U-Save rebates, has&nbsp;less subsidies for long-term care, may be disqualified from the Silver Support Scheme&nbsp;and so on.</p><p>There is probably no policy with perfect outcomes. So, let us not let&nbsp;perfect be enemy of the good.</p><p>Sir, my second point is for the Government to look at helping households manage&nbsp;electricity consumption through discouraging use at peak hours. This could be&nbsp;done by charging lower rates at non-peak hours.</p><p>The EMA is already doing this for business consumers.&nbsp;Business consumers can&nbsp;make use of EMA's Demand Side Management (DSM) scheme to lower their&nbsp;electricity bills, by adjusting when and how much electricity they use.&nbsp;Businesses&nbsp;can participate in the Demand Response programme, where they can voluntarily&nbsp;reduce electricity usage when prices are high.&nbsp;Such behaviour also benefits the&nbsp;system, as it reduces the capacity required at peak periods.</p><p>It is well-known that&nbsp;a key driver of the costs of producing electricity is not the total load, but the peak&nbsp;hour load.&nbsp;Having a cheaper rate for off-peak consumption would benefit the&nbsp;system as a whole, as it will go towards ensuring that the peak demand can be&nbsp;more efficiently met by the existing transmission grid.&nbsp;</p><p>Can such differentiated peak and non-peak pricing be applied to households as&nbsp;well?&nbsp;Such time of use charging has been offered for decades around the world,&nbsp;in major cities including London, San Francisco and Sydney. What is its potential&nbsp;for Singapore households?</p><p>Just last month, the Government announced a pilot scheme called Residential&nbsp;Demand Response programme, to be launched by the second half of next year.&nbsp;Under&nbsp;this pilot programme, Singaporean households will be issued with smart meters&nbsp;and will receive alerts to actively reduce consumption during peak hours, in&nbsp;exchange for financial reward, such as rebates.&nbsp;This scheme is, in effect, a&nbsp;differential pricing scheme based on time of use.</p><p>The Government's planned financial incentives to reduce peak hour consumption&nbsp;could be further developed.&nbsp;We could work towards a system where the&nbsp;electricity tariff for off-peak consumption for households is lower than the tariff&nbsp;for peak hour consumption. This allows households to manage their electricity&nbsp;costs by adjusting their time of use.</p><p>Sir, in making these suggestions today, it is not my intention to over-simplify the&nbsp;issues associated with electricity pricing, which can be a rather technical&nbsp;matter.&nbsp;Nonetheless, with the concerns about global energy supply and costs&nbsp;looming in the horizon, this is an issue that deserves attention.</p><p>Sir, let me conclude. Recent global conflicts and tensions have made Singapore even more&nbsp;vulnerable to rises in the prices of oil and gas, on which we rely for our energy&nbsp;needs.&nbsp;With 95% of our electricity generated from natural gas, Singaporean&nbsp;households are at risk of higher electricity bills.&nbsp;At the same time, as the Government has recently highlighted, imported supply uncertainties make it&nbsp;imperative for Singaporeans to conserve electricity.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe household&nbsp;electricity costs can be managed through adjusting the electricity tariff structure,&nbsp;such as through tiered pricing and differential charging to encourage off-peak&nbsp;consumption. Such reforms would recognise that electricity is a basic good and&nbsp;yet, incentivise energy conservation.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Leong Mun Wai.</p><h6>3.14 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) supports the Motion moved by the hon Leader of the Opposition and Member Louis Chua, which calls on the Government to review its policies so as the lower cost of living pressures on Singaporeans and their families.</p><p>It is especially apt to describe the ongoing inflationary pressures faced by Singaporeans as a crisis.</p><p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic,&nbsp;when many Singaporeans are still struggling financially,&nbsp;the cost of almost everything in Singapore&nbsp;has gone up.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast,&nbsp;the Government does not seem to be too concerned&nbsp;about this crisis&nbsp;and continues to add oil to the fire.&nbsp;The GST hike confirmed in Budget 2022&nbsp;was one of the factors that accelerated the pace of inflation as businesses took the opportunity to raise prices far more than the GST and other cost increases.&nbsp;Food prices have surged because NTUC FairPrice stood by&nbsp;instead of doing more.</p><p>I still remember, in the early 1970s, I used to queue up at a community centre&nbsp;with my mother&nbsp;to buy heavily-discounted basic foodstuff and necessities supplied by NTUC.&nbsp;Today, NTUC FairPrice's&nbsp;prices are not even the lowest in the market.&nbsp;It is commonly known that lower prices can be found at the Sheng Siong supermarket instead. It appears that the role of NTUC&nbsp;and, by implication,&nbsp;that of the Government, has changed drastically over the last few decades.&nbsp;NTUC FairPrice no longer serves as the anchor of price stability.&nbsp;The Government, instead of being the independent referee and price stabiliser in the economy, has become a profit-seeker in direct competition with the private sector.</p><p>In many sectors, the Government is the market maker and has influenced the price levels in those sectors,&nbsp;the most obvious and problematic one being the property market.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, the current cost of living crisis faced by Singaporeans is not entirely due to the global supply chain disruption arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.&nbsp;The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the fact that Singaporeans have little savings to weather financial&nbsp;emergencies.&nbsp;The events after the pandemic have only exacerbated the situation that Singaporeans have been subject to&nbsp;by the Government over the recent decades.</p><p>Singaporeans have been worried about the cost of living for many years because they feel that their wages have not kept up with the cost of goods and services that they need to lead a meaningful life in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>CDC vouchers, GST vouchers,&nbsp;Service and Conservancy Charges (S&amp;CC) rebates and so on can be very helpful for Singaporeans in the short term, but these handouts do not solve the fundamental structural issues that are at the heart of the rising cost of living in Singapore today.</p><p>To help Singaporeans get out of this cost of living crisis, the PSP believes that we will need to nudge the Government to change its two favourite&nbsp;financial management approaches, namely,&nbsp;the \"pay and pay\" and \"the chicken wing&nbsp;for a whole chicken\" approaches.</p><p>The Government's approaches may have served us well in the early days&nbsp;of nation-building&nbsp;when public finances were tight&nbsp;and wages rising fast.&nbsp;However, they may not be appropriate in today's context when wages are not rising as fast as the cost of living.&nbsp;It is especially worrying if more and more middle-class Singaporeans cannot keep up with the current standard of living.</p><p>First, let us talk about \"pay and pay\".&nbsp;Many Singaporeans often jokingly refer to the People's Action Party (PAP) as a \"pay and pay\" party because it seems to run Singapore like a company and operates like a profit-seeker.</p><p>PSP has spoken many times in this House that this Government has ample fiscal resources and, yet, it has always tried to justify increasing taxes and fees for public services whenever possible. PSP has objected many times to the increase in the GST from 7% to 9%. It is unnecessary, untimely and uncompassionate.</p><p>While the working class will get GST vouchers, the middle class will have to pay an additional $1.2 billion in GST per year after the 2% GST hike and may have to pay even more taxes because of the GST vouchers.</p><p>The increase in GST is unnecessary because our fiscal position is strong as there is room to use more of the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) for current spending, instead of tucking the bulk of it in the long-term endowment and trust funds.</p><p>While we agree that public services like electricity, water, public transport and so on should be operated efficiently, the ultimate objective should be to maximise long-term social benefits and not short-term profits.</p><p>When Singaporeans are faced with intense inflationary pressures at the moment, the Government could have delayed the fee increases in the public services for three to five years, for example.&nbsp;This is especially so when the Government is expected to reap billions of windfall revenues from inflation,&nbsp;Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) and COEs in fiscal year (FY) 2023, apart from the fiscal buffer we have from NIRC.</p><p>The Government should price public services based on long-term considerations to provide stability to Singaporeans' livelihoods, which will increase long-term social benefits.</p><p>Our fiscal resources have been hoarded away in the Reserves,&nbsp;supposedly for the sake of the future generation. But this is to the detriment of the present generation who are facing the heavy and unnecessary burden of higher taxation and rising cost of living.</p><p>We urgently need to review how our fiscal resources, including our Reserves, are being used before we contemplate raising taxes on the people.&nbsp;The Reserves and Budget&nbsp;should serve Singaporeans and not the other way around.</p><p>More discerning Singaporeans have pointed out long ago&nbsp;that the PAP Government likes to give Singaporeans a chicken wing and then take back a whole chicken. Essentially,&nbsp;what it means is that the Government is a shrewd financial manager who gives out occasional short-term handouts&nbsp;but commits Singaporeans&nbsp;to long-term payment schemes that require them to pay out consistently over the long term.&nbsp;The total long-term payouts will be much larger than the short-term handouts.</p><p>Take public housing as an example.&nbsp;For every Build-To-Order (BTO) flat sold, the buyer will have to pay hundreds of thousands for the land cost and have to take up a housing loan to service it.&nbsp;If that loan is serviced for 25 years, the buyer's CPF balance could be reduced by as much as half a million dollars.&nbsp;In exchange, the Government will sweeten the deal by giving out CPF Housing Grants of $30,000 to $60,000 through HDB.&nbsp;</p><p>It begs the question why can the Government not waive the land cost so that Singaporeans can keep the half a million dollars in their CPF account&nbsp;for retirement instead?&nbsp;This is exactly what the PSP has proposed in the affordable home scheme, which waives land cost for owner occupiers of HDB flats.</p><p>It is obvious that, in this way, Singaporeans' financial position will be significantly improved and that will yield a lot of social benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>For MediShield and CareShield, the Government has also been accumulating large surpluses ahead of actual expenditures.&nbsp;If premiums can be reduced,&nbsp;Singaporeans will have more balances in their MediSave Accounts to earn more interest while they are young. PSP has proposed for the Government to pay for the MediShield and CareShield premiums all together and establish a universal health scheme for Singaporeans.</p><p>It is not an overstatement to say&nbsp;that \"a chicken wing for a whole chicken\" approach is the main cause of social anxiety for Singaporeans.</p><p>Mr Speaker,&nbsp;at the launch of the Forward Singapore Festival, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said&nbsp;that Singaporeans today no longer talk so much about the 5Cs.&nbsp;He said that Singaporeans still want a good material life, but the Singapore dream is also about finding fulfilment,&nbsp;meaning and purpose.&nbsp;PSP wholeheartedly agrees that there is more to life than material success and consumption.&nbsp;I have also spoken about self-fulfillment and ikigai, which is \"purpose\" in Japanese,&nbsp;in the public.</p><p>But we believe that Singaporeans are no longer talking so much about the 5Cs because the structural issues in our economy and the cost of living crisis have now made the 5Cs completely unattainable for many middle-class Singaporeans even if they are frugal and work hard.&nbsp;Today, condominiums and cars are unaffordable&nbsp;on a middle-class salary. Fewer and fewer households are owning cars.&nbsp;Yesterday, the Acting Minister for Transport confirmed&nbsp;that car ownership has dropped to 33% today&nbsp;from 40% in 2013. Even motorcycles feel out of reach for many Singaporeans.</p><p>It is well-known that country club membership fees have soared because of the influx of wealthy foreigners. Cash is tight because of inflationary pressures.&nbsp;Of the 5Cs,&nbsp;the credit card is the most attainable, but the credit card has fallen into a necessity to facilitate \"buy now, pay later\" when cash is tight.</p><p>Singaporeans are talking less about the 5Cs not because they do not want it anymore but because for many Singaporeans today, it really can only be a dream.</p><p>An urgent reset of our policies is needed to address the structural issues that our economy faces. Singaporeans must have more to look forward to than the rising cost of living.&nbsp;Economic growth must lead to rising real incomes and better lives for everyone and not just a select few.</p><p>We must help Singaporeans to improve their long-term financial well-being so that they will have the savings to withstand emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;The financial leeway will also allow Singaporeans to have the freedom to develop their potential, which will be beneficial to our economy in the long term.</p><p>Over the last three years, my primary focus in this House is to speak on policies to improve the financial well-being of Singaporeans.&nbsp;Today, I will put all these into an integrated cost of living relief package with the following five measures.</p><p>One, first and foremost, reduce GST to 7%&nbsp;to clearly demonstrate the Government's determination to dampen the inflationary psychology.</p><p>Two, increase the immediate relief package from the current $1.1 billion to $5 billion to include financial help for the middle class and small and medium enterprises (SMEs).&nbsp;This will also be a much-needed spending boost&nbsp;for the nascent post-COVID-19 recovery;</p><p>Three, introduce the affordable home scheme and Millennial Apartments scheme to make HDB flats more affordable, strengthen retirement adequacy and offer more choices to young Singaporeans.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Four, introduce a universal health scheme for Singaporeans, essentially based on the Government-paid MediShield and CareShield premiums for Singaporeans.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Fifth, introduce a minimum living wage to give Singaporean workers a minimum take-home pay of $1,800 per month.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Mr Speaker, the objective of the integrated cost of living relief package is to provide a robust and substantive response to relieve the financial stress of Singaporeans, both immediate and in the long term.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">PSP has also estimated that it is manageable with the fiscal resources we have currently. We hope the Government will make improving the financial well-being of Singaporeans the cornerstone of our new social compact. For country. For People.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Sitoh Yih Pin.</p><h6>3.31 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to state at the onset that I recognise that there is a cost of living issue. I recognise that Singaporeans are going through this, but we have to recognise that this is a global phenomenon and we have to tackle this together.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">But, Sir, I have been listening carefully and intently to the&nbsp;speeches made by the three Opposition Members of Parliament and my impression is that&nbsp;they are basically asking for&nbsp;an ultimate reduction in tariffs,&nbsp;some reduction in taxes, more top-ups, more handouts.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">This is not the first time.&nbsp;It did not surprise me that Mr Leong Mun Wai, again, talked about the GST.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Honestly, Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Opposition </span>Members of Parliament<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\"> have been milking the GST cow for a very long time and we have explained time and again over the last several years why the GST increase is necessary and why there are offset packages. So, maybe I just want to say if you really must milk something, go and milk another cow.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Mr Speaker, Sir, as a PAP backbencher, it is very clear in my mind that I am here to support the PAP Government's vision.&nbsp;I am not here to steer it.&nbsp;But at the back of my mind, I would like to ask the Opposition </span>Members of Parliament<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\"> if one day you are to steer this ship&nbsp;</span>\u2013<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\"> I hope not, but we cannot rule it out completely </span>\u2013<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">&nbsp;if you are to steer this ship, what is your overall underlying strategy?&nbsp;What is your philosophy?</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Because, so far, what I have heard is that you are basically dissecting the problem and you are talking about water, electricity, GST, so on and so forth. But at the end of the day, we need to balance the Budget and we need to balance the Budget for all Singaporeans.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Sir, as I listened to&nbsp;the speeches of the Opposition </span>Members of Parliament<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">,&nbsp;I cannot help but feel a sense of gloom and I am reminded of a Chinese war movie that I watched some time ago&nbsp;</span>\u2013<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\"> I remember this very clearly because it struck me </span>\u2013<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">&nbsp;it was a commander telling the troops in Mandarin, \"\u4f60\u77e5\u9053</span>\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u6bd4\u60b2\u54c0\u66f4\u60b2\u54c0\u5417? \u90a3\u5c31\u662f\u5df2\u7ecf\u7edd\u671b\u4e86, \u5df2\u7ecf\u6ca1\u6709\u673a\u4f1a\u4e86\". Do you know what is more sorrowful than feeling sorrowful and despair? It is when it becomes hopeless; it is when we no longer have a chance.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">But, clearly, this is not the situation we are in. So, I think it is important that all of us in this Chamber </span>\u2013 PAP Members of Parliament, Opposition Members of Parliament, WP Members of Parliament, PSP Members of Parliament, Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs) and Non-Constituency Members of Parliament<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">&nbsp;(NCMPs)&nbsp;</span>\u2013 co<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">me together and let us tackle this problem collectively. We have enough resources.&nbsp;We have overcome bigger problems.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">I noticed that the WP's Motion used the word \"crisis\", cost of living crisis. I shiver and shudder for a while when I saw the word \"crisis\" because crisis means, I think somebody is going to suggest a draw on Reserves.&nbsp;To me, this is a problem. It is a big problem.&nbsp;I would not classify it as a crisis.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\"> So, my point is, \u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u60b2\u54c0, \u6211\u4eec\u6ca1\u6709\u7edd\u671b, \u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u6709\u7684\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u591a\u7684\u673a\u4f1a. That is, we are not sorrowful. We have not lost hope because we have a lot of opportunities.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Discuss this issue of cost of living by asking three honest questions and, hopefully, by giving three honest answers also.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">The first question: is there pain amongst Singaporeans due to the rising cost of living due to inflation? And the answer is yes, there is pain. We have to acknowledge it and we have to admit this is going to be a rough and bumpy ride for all of us.&nbsp;It feels like a never-ending uphill battle.&nbsp;But, sometimes, as we overcome difficulties, there are also learning points and I am completely certain in my mind that we will overcome this. The worst may not have come yet, the worst may well come later. But never mind, we recognise there is pain and we will get over this together.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Sir, the second question I will ask is: having recognised that there is pain, is there pain relief?</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">And the answer is, absolutely, and that is why the Government has rolled out so many packages:&nbsp;Cost of Living Package; Assurance Package; CDC Vouchers; U-Save rebates; Public Transport Vouchers and so on. We know them. The Government has done its best to cushion the rough and bumpy ride. But I think what we have done particularly well, maybe compared to some other countries, is that we are targeting assistance to those who need it more and I will urge the Government to continue doing that. Let us help those who need the most help and not only help them the most but maybe help them for the longest time possible. It is an unequal policy, but I think it is the right policy to adopt.</span></p><p>Sir, the next question I will ask, having acknowledged that there is pain, having said that there is pain relief, the last question I want to ask is: so, in the process, are any Singaporeans being left behind? C<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">learly, the answer is no.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">\ufeffAs I have said, we will target assistance and help to those who need it more and hopefully for a longer period, and we will do the right thing. And doing the right thing is not about just&nbsp;policies or rules and regulations. We all know that doing the right thing is what is in your heart. And&nbsp;doing the right thing is </span>\u2013<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\"> I hope the Opposition </span>Members of Parliament<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\"> will agree me </span>\u2013&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">definitely not about straddling the middle ground to gain some votes.&nbsp;We will never do that and we do not want to start doing that.</span></p><p>So,&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">I say, let us all behave like a herd. We are the Singapore Herd because, united we are strong and divided we become weak.</span></p><p>And, Sir, here I would like to admit and also acknowledge that most of us, it is human nature, we like consistency and continuity. Many of us do not like change, especially when change involves an increase in the cost of living, it involves inflation. But I think it is something we have to accept collectively. It is a global phenomenon and we will overcome this.</p><p>Sir, I would like to next move on to Mr Liang Eng Hwa's amendment because towards the last part, he mentioned \"<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">without undermining our fiscal sustainability and burdening future generations of Singaporeans.\"&nbsp;This is very important because every generation must solve its own problems. Every generation has to solve their own problems and down the road.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">And just now, the hon Member Mr Leong Mun Wai talked about Reserves again.&nbsp;I just want to say this: actually, in reality,&nbsp;neither him nor me are qualified to talk about our Reserves. We are only the&nbsp;custodians, and you know what?&nbsp;The Reserves are not meant for you; and neither are they meant for me. They are meant for our children and our children's children and that is why it is so important that we safeguard them.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Like in COVID-19, if it was necessary to dip into our Reserves, we had. But I think if every time we come across a problem and a difficulty, we ask for the key to the safe and we start taking out, there is not going to be very much left in the safe, you know. I am always very marvelled by&nbsp;this mahjong table because on every mahjong table, there are four players and there is always a drawer there for each player. Every time I look at it </span>\u2013&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">and some people put their chips on the table and some put theirs inside the drawer&nbsp;</span>\u2013<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">&nbsp;my reading of it is that what is on the table are MAS and Temasek.&nbsp;What is in your drawer is GIC because I do not know how much you have inside the drawer.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">And it is very important that we keep our Reserves as strong as possible and maybe as mysterious as possible because when people do not know how much you have, they hesitate to mess around with you.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">My mind goes back to 1997 again. During the Asian Financial Crisis, we all know that the currencies around us were all hammered, beaten down. We got off relatively unscathed and do you really think that the hedge funds did not look at us? I am sure they did. But I think they probably say, \"You know, this little island, I do not know how much is inside that drawer, I better not mess with them because it is like throwing a boomerang. You throw a boomerang, hoping to hit the other guy, it comes back and it slit your throat.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">So, let us safeguard our Reserves and unless it is a real crisis like COVID-19, I think try not to touch it.</span></p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, please allow me to quote a famous Cantonese saying. Mr Leong Mun Wai will understand this because he is Cantonese. It goes something like \"\u725b\u4e0d\u559d\u6c34\uff0c\u6309\u4e0d\u5230\u725b\u5934\u5e95&nbsp;\". W<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">hen the cow goes to the river and drinks, if it does not want to drink, you cannot press its head down.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Mr Speaker, do not worry, I am not going to talk about meat prices. I mentioned this in the context of our debate today because in a free-market economy, the price is set by willing-buyer willing-seller and it is set by basic demand and supply forces and, honestly, in Singapore, we import most of our products and we have little control. We are, basically, a price-taker although the hon Member Mr Leong Mun Wai just now said the Government is a price-setter. I intend to disagree. It is a price taker.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">But, fortunately, for us, we have a strong Singapore dollar and the strong Singapore dollar makes it more economical for us to import our products.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">So, Mr Speaker, Sir, my point is that&nbsp;as long as we stay united, cohesive, we will overcome this. We have enough experience and enough resources.&nbsp;There will be sunshine after the rain.&nbsp;We must have the guts, the gumption and the resolve to do this correctly. And rather than seek out the heat, we should look for the light and I am very confident that we will overcome this. My mind again goes back to a radio broadcast that Mr Lee Kuan Yew did,</span> I think it&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">was in 1961 and he said, \"It is as inevitable as the rising and setting of the sun.\" So, it is as inevitable I think that we will overcome this if we stay cohesive, united and collected as a people.</span></p><p>Sir, I think the long-term solution to all these, after we have overcome this cost of living problem, is that we must keep growing our economy and not only keep it going but keep it growing. And we must also continuously bake a bigger a pie so that Singaporeans can all have a bigger slice. The more vulnerable, those who need help will get it more and get it longer.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, as we commemorate the 100<sup>th </sup>Anniversary of Mr Lee Kuan Yew's birth, I like to quote him. And basically, this quote shows how important it is that we stay united as one people. And I quote Mr Lee Kuan Yew, \"For the next thousand years, we will still be here, recognisable, identifiable.\" [<em>Applause</em>.]</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms Sylvia Lim.</p><h6>3.46 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>: Thank you, Speaker, I feel compelled to clarify what Member Sitoh Yih Pin has attributed to me and I will clarify my own.</p><p>My proposal actually for tiered electricity pricing is a revenue-neutral proposal. Most IBT systems are designed that way. So, it will be wrong of him to say that I am asking for more subsidies from the&nbsp;Government or raiding whatever fund to do that.&nbsp;</p><p>The second proposal which I suggested was about time of use pricing. And I also mentioned that MTI is already in the process of giving financial incentives to households who consume electricity at off-peak hours and they are also doing that with business consumers already. So, unless the Member is saying that conserving energy is not important for Singapore and MTI is wrong, then I think he better make himself clear.</p><p><strong>Mr Sitoh Yih Pin</strong>: Thank you for the clarification, Ms Sylvia Lim.&nbsp;The Member said something about tiered pricing. Yes, I heard&nbsp;her. But I think when the Government issues the U-Save rebates, they would have achieved the same objective.</p><p>As to the Member's second point about pricing relating to time of use, honestly, even though I did not say it just now, I think it is a good idea to consider.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Leong Mun Wai.</p><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Speaker. Can I, through you, confirm with Member Sitoh Yih Pin that I did not recommend a drawdown of the reserves?</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Sitoh Yih Pin.</p><p><strong>Mr Sitoh Yih Pin</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, if I misheard the hon Member Mr Leong Mun Wai, then I apologise to him. The Member did not specifically talk about a drawdown, but I think he did allude that our reserves are quite strong. And when I hear you say that, I began to shiver and shudder.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Dennis Tan.</p><h6>3.48 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang)</strong>: Mr Speaker, as Members of Parliament, feedback from residents about rising costs of living is not uncommon.&nbsp;However, in the last half a year, the frequency of such feedback has really increased tremendously.</p><p>I receive such feedback not merely from residents who are in the lower-income brackets. I also receive feedback from across the different income tiers. Recently, I attended a feedback session with some condominium residents in Hougang and concerns arising on rising costs of living were raised by many with whom I spoke to.</p><p>Mr Speaker, I believe I am not alone in receiving such concerns and feedback in the House. I therefore support the WP's Motion today calling on the Government to review its policy with a view to lower cost of living pressures on Singaporeans and their families.</p><p>There are different issues of rising costs of living which affects Singaporeans. My colleagues in the WP will be focusing on different aspects on the rising cost pressures. I will be speaking on the need to relook some aspects of our means testing criteria in public healthcare and for more help for adults with special needs or disabilities and their caregiving families.</p><p>Mr Speaker, with a growing ageing population, healthcare costs are the main concerns of many, including especially many of our seniors and those with no income and yet facing health issues, and find themselves struggling to afford essential healthcare.</p><p>The current means testing method based on a per capita household income (PCHI) presents some challenges to certain Singaporeans.&nbsp;The current economic indicators applied to the healthcare means testing criteria may have their limitations. They look at household income broadly. It overlooks or deprioritises two important issues.</p><p>One, the formula looks at the rigid household incomes and does not look at deferring or specific needs of specific members of each household when evaluating help which should be given.&nbsp;While it is true that both the young, such as children and the elderly, may not have earning power or contribute directly to the PCHI, the elderly are more likely to require nursing care due to the onset of various chronic illnesses associated with ageing.</p><p>According to the National Population Health Survey conducted in 2020, over 20% are respondents, aged 60 to 74 years, had diabetes. Approximately 75% of those aged 70 to 74 years had hypertension and 60% in the same age group had high cholesterol.&nbsp;These chronic illnesses often result in increased healthcare spending, including expenses related to complications.&nbsp;For example, diabetes and high cholesterol are commonly associated with cardiovascular diseases, like coronary heart diseases. In fact, in 2019, approximately 75% of heart attack patients were aged 60 and above.</p><p>Furthermore, most corporate medical insurance plans typically allow employees to include two family dependents, usually a spouse and offspring but do not permit the inclusion of elderly dependents.&nbsp;This exclusion is often reflected in corporate insurance plans, such as those by Raffles Medical Group, a major corporate insurance provider in Singapore.&nbsp;These plans specify that eligible dependents must be either a spouse or unmarried or unemployed children.</p><p>As a result, some households with elderly dependents may experience higher out-of-pocket medical expenses compared to households with children, even when their PCHI is the same.&nbsp;It is crucial that we consider such disparities in means testing.</p><p>One may argue that the seniors in Singapore already have access to a wide range of subsidy schemes aimed at addressing their needs, such as the Merdeka Generation Package (MGP) and the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP).</p><p>However, a closer examination of these subsidies offered by these packages reveals room for improvement.&nbsp;For instance, the subsidies entitlement for MG and PG cardholders cover chronic conditions and dental services, but not as extensive in coverage when compared with the coverage of critical illnesses in commonly available medical insurance policies and subsidies for chronic conditions are kept annually.</p><p>Two, it does not look at whether a family member actually do receive help from family members for their medical fees and expenses of a family member.&nbsp;The choice of residence for retired elderly individuals, whether they decide to stay with their working adult children or live independently, has little impact on the family's financial dynamics. Financial support from working adult children is a personal decision arrived independently of the elderly person's choice of living arrangement.&nbsp;As a result, a retired elderly may appear to have a high PCHI on paper, but they may not receive financial assistance from their children or adequate financial assistance from their children.</p><p>While the Government expects family members to pay for the living and medical expenses of family members, in reality, this may be easier said than done.</p><p>Many residents have told me that they do not wish to impose on their children and they try to make do with what they have. Many have tried unsuccessfully to get public financial assistance when they do not receive sufficient money from their children, as their children have told them they do not have enough to contribute to their parents, including those who live with their children in the same households.&nbsp;How can such people receive further subsidy or assistance if help is not forthcoming from family members, without having to request from family members?</p><p>I see the same problem with some of my residents seeking financial assistance but were not eligible because of a household income.&nbsp;An elderly male resident saw me a few times, crying with frustration, due to the lack of financial support as he is not eligible for more support, due to his son's and daughter-in-law's incomes and his son said that he is unable to provide more support.</p><p>Furthermore, for healthcare means testing, beyond cases of elderly parents living with working children, there may also be other categories of core occupiers in the same household who may not be currently sharing or co-funding medical expenses of other occupiers of the property.</p><p>By way of an example, Mr A is in his early 60s and working part-time due to his health condition. He lives with two other higher-earning siblings.&nbsp;They share common household expenses, but not individual medical expenses. The household income will be a key consideration for the amount of subsidy he is entitled under the current PCHI formula.&nbsp;In a case like this, does the Government expect Mr A to reach out to his siblings to ask them to share his medical expenses? Will Mr A get help, maybe applies to the authorities for further subsidy?</p><p>Mr Speaker, currently, when the per capita household income of a particular household's PCHI is zero, the Government will look at the annual value (AV) of the property that the household is living in.&nbsp;In July this year, the hon Member for Aljunied GRC Mr Gerald Giam, urged MOH to consider removing the AV component for household so with no income.</p><p>Senior Parliamentary Secretary Ms Rahayu Mahzam said in response and I quote, \"On the Member's point of considering to remove this, this is a broader point we are looking at.\"&nbsp;I hope the Government will consider removing this.</p><p>Mr Speaker, households with zero PCHI but higher AVs often comprised of retirees who are in their twilight years and may have a family member who is seriously unwell and seeking medical treatment.&nbsp;The Minister for Health himself has acknowledged in a written answer to a PQ in February this year that AV is an imperfect proxy for determining financial need, especially for those who are asset-rich but cash-poor.</p><p>There may be a variety of reasons why such individual owners are unable to monetise their property.&nbsp;As we age, we may grow more attached to our homes, the neighbourhoods we are familiar with and the communities we have built over the years and that this may not even be the reasons for some, amongst us, for not being able to move out to a lower priced property. For whatever reasons, monetising, right-sizing or downsizing may not always be feasible or desirable. In addition, we have been encouraged to age-in-place.</p><p>But owners living in their own properties are not the only people who are affected by the AV issue. There are also family members who are caught by the rule. Besides non-owner spouses, there are siblings, children, aunts, uncles and cousins who may be living in the same property who may be caught by this rule.&nbsp;Such family members may not be able to get their relatives in the same household to pay for their medical expenses. They may not be able to afford a place of their own just to qualify or more state subsidies.</p><p>There are also cases of family members being co-owners of a family property or co-inheriting such property after a parent has passed on.&nbsp;I know a few of such cases where residents inherited a family property together with fellow family members. They continue to live in their own property. Family properties is kept for use by other family members and this could be a residential or even commercial property. And there is no near-term prospect of the property being sold and proceeds to be distributed. These non-occupier owners are caught by the AV issue when it comes to medical subsidies and also for other packages and schemes from other Ministries.</p><p>Such people have to appeal every time against their non-access for subsidies or benefits and an outcome may not always be consistent.</p><p>Before I leave this point, I would also say that whether a person is an owner or non-owner, it would not be right to expect a person living in a property with higher AV battling a serious disease to have to make arrangements to move out of his or her home or to sell his or her home to raise funds for the very medical treatment he or she needs.</p><p>Next, Mr Speaker, I would like to discuss the needs of families who have family members with special needs or with mental health issues and requiring care for family members.&nbsp;The burden placed upon these families is immense and I hope that the state can extend more help.</p><p>While the numbers of such families may not be large, their plight is significant and warrants our attention.&nbsp;According to SG Enable, 3.5% of people aged between 18 and 49 in our country are disabled. These numbers are not negligible and we must recognise the challenges faced by these families.</p><p>Moreover, data from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) estimated that in 2022, there were approximately 32,000 persons with disabilities aged between 15 and 64, with about 1,000 of them unemployed and 22,000 outside the labour force.&nbsp;These figures underscore the urgency of addressing their needs.</p><p>Moreover, for families where such adults with special needs or mental issues require their ageing parents to continue to care for them, the burden of caregiving, both physically and financially, can be tremendous.</p><p>I have some suggestions to provide for better assistance to these families.</p><p>One, we should create a list of non-critical illnesses that necessitate long-term care and force individuals out of employment.&nbsp;This list would include conditions, such as early onset dementia, severe autism, Down Syndrome, schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.</p><p>Such conditions can be financially burdensome for families and access to social support for these individuals and their families is currently limited. For example, eligibility for claims on the CareShield Life remains limited to individuals who are unable to perform at least three activities of daily living (ADLs).</p><p>However, the abovementioned ailments, while detrimental enough to put one out of employment, do not always impact one's ability to perform the ADLs. Many insurance plans cover critical illnesses and the insurance products available on the market that cover non-critical illnesses remain limited. Besides, some of these non-critical illnesses are congenital, making afflicted individuals excluded from medical insurance scheme, which require that one must be free of pre-existing medical conditions before they are onboarded.</p><p>The eligibility criteria of CareShield Life can be expanded to include consideration of those who can still perform ADLs but are unable to earn a stable income due to non-critical illnesses. This aligns with the original intentions of CareShield Life, which is targeted at individuals with long-term care needs.</p><p>Two, for such individuals with non-critical illnesses, we should offer more subsidies with medical supplies, consultations, treatment, rehabilitation and daycare services. Medical expenses of such injuries are not limited to specialist outpatient care or inpatient care, but also included other essential areas like medical supplies and rehabilitation.</p><p>Three, increase subsidies for inpatient and outpatient specialist treatment for both individuals with non-critical illnesses and their caregivers should be made available. While there are existing subsidies for long-term residential care, daycare and rehabilitation, many families do not meet the eligibility criteria due to the ceiling limit set by the PCHI or even the annual value of their property. For example, the PCHI upper limit to qualify for daycare subsidies set at $2,800. This can make it challenging for working adults taking care of their disabled children as their income may exceed this limit.</p><p>Should a working adult take care of his or her disabled child because the child is not capable of independent living and let us say he or she earns about $7,000 per month, taking the median salary of someone in the 40 to 44 years old age group, and the spouse is a full-time caregiver without any income, this works out to a PCHI of about $2,333 per month. The family only marginally qualifies for 30% subsidies and entitlement for daycare services.</p><p>Furthermore, the Senior Mobility Fund is targeted as seniors aged 60 and above, leaving out younger persons with disabilities (PwDs) who also require nursing and rehabilitation support. The younger PwDs in spite of their nursing and rehabilitation needs will not be able to access the fund. And even if the age criteria is extended to include younger PwDs, they do not qualify if the PCHI is more than $2,000 and the annual value of their property is more than $13,000.</p><p>In short, I am concerned that those affected are not getting enough support. There are PwDs in the working age group with rehabilitation needs and I hope the Senior Mobility Fund is extended to include these. I also hope that PwDs in the working adult age groups qualify for subtleties in daycare and residential care. Beside the opportunity cost of loss income, they should not be penalised just because they live with a working family member out of necessity.</p><p>Four, more support should be given to caregivers of adults with special needs or disabilities. While we do have existing grants and concessions, such as the Caregivers Training Grant, Home Caregiving Grant and Migrant Domestic Levy Concession, some of these are limited to households where the care recipient is elderly and exclude families where elderly parents are caregivers to disabled children. This disparity can be addressed.</p><p>Can caregiving grants such as the Home Caregiving Grant and the Migrant Domestic Levy Concession for aged persons with disabilities be extended the household where the care recipients are not seniors and may have no ADL issues but are involuntarily unemployed because of their medical condition. After all, the conditions that threaten employment, for example, early onset dementia, severe autism, Down Syndrome, schizophrenia and so on, are neurological or psychiatric conditions that affect soft skills, like cognitive and communication skills, and may not always affect one's ability to perform ADLs. And so, to use ADLs as an indicator and an eligibility determination for the grant is not comprehensive.</p><p>Mr Speaker, more help can be given to support caregivers, especially caregivers where to give up their full-time jobs to care for their family members and do not have an income or may need more financial support. For a start, I hope the Home Caregiving Grant can be increased beyond the current $400 for deserving cases.</p><p>In closing, Mr Speaker, I hope the current means testing formula can be further improved upon to take into account the specifics of an individual's financial situation, particularly his or her cash flow and health condition, and make healthcare more affordable and accessible for all. More help should be extended to adults with special needs or other forms of disabilities who are in the working adult age group but are unable to work and requires part or full-time care from family members, especially families where the parents are getting on in age. Mr Speaker, I support the original Motion.</p><h6>4.05 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 4.25 pm.</p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>&nbsp;Sitting accordingly suspended</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>&nbsp;at 4.05 pm until 4.25 pm.</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\">&nbsp;<em>Sitting resumed at 4.25 pm.</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Deputy Speaker (Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo) in the Chair]</strong></p><h4 class=\"ql-align-center\">&nbsp;<strong>Cost of Living Crisis</strong></h4><p><br></p><p>[(proc text) Debate resumed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Hazel Poa.</p><h6>4.25 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, post-pandemic inflation in Singapore has been much higher than it used to be. Announcements of price increases in transport fares, water and utilities came one after another. COE prices rose to record highs and GST is going to be increased by another 1% next year. Property prices and rental continued climbing. All these are adding on to the anxieties of Singaporeans over the ever-rising cost of living that seems endless.</p><p>These anxieties cannot be alleviated by the various aid packages that the Government has rolled out, because while the packages are for a limited time, the cost increases are here to stay. The growing sense of insecurity, or even depression for some, over their declining ability to meet expenses or maintain previous lifestyles on their own income, can never be addressed with Government handouts.</p><p>The rising cost in Singapore is not only affecting the people, but businesses too. Whilst our low corporate tax was able to compensate for our high-cost space and attracting foreign investments, this tool would no longer be available with the implementation of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) 2.0, which sets a minimum corporate tax rate. This adds on to the urgency to find ways of containing costs in Singapore.</p><p>One of our major cost component is cost of property. For most of us, buying a home is the single largest expenditure of our lifetime. Hence, high residential property price has a huge impact on our cost of living. Yet, this cost is not captured in the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, because the CPI does not cover property purchases.</p><p>This is why the PSP has proposed a scheme to exclude land cost from the price of HDB flats to make them more affordable. In the retail sector, rental accounts for about 30% of the business cost. So, for each item that we buy from a shop, about 30% of their costs goes towards paying for the rental of the shop.</p><p>Prices has been rising in food outlets, like coffee shops and food courts. Hawkers spoke of alarming increases in rents imposed by the landlords. Record prices in the transaction of such properties are caused for concern. In 2022, following the announcement of the GST hike, the Committee Against Profiteering (CAP) was reconvened to investigate feedback on unjustified price increases of products and services.</p><p>I was invited by the Leader of the Opposition to be the representative of the Opposition on the Committee and having attended two meetings, I have learnt how limited the scope is for this Committee to act against profiteering.</p><p>The Committee acts on complaints received from members of the public. Such complaints are mostly against retailers, especially hawkers. At the retail level, there is much competition. So, I am not surprised that investigation usually reviewed that there are other reasons for the price increase.</p><p>For example, the increase in price might be due to higher rents. So, the hawker is not profiteering. But is the landlord profiteering? I raise this point at our last meeting and suggested the secretariat look further up the supply chain. I look forward to hearing from MTI on the progress at our next meeting.</p><p>Price Kaki, an app that compares retail prices from different sellers and seeks to prevent profiteering is also only able to check on vendors at the retail level. Places like Ireland, California, Canada, Scotland, Spain and China impose a cap on the rent increase each year. Austria and Germany are planning to do so as well.</p><p>Can I suggest the Fair Tenancy Industry Committee issue guidelines on the annual rent increase, similar to the way the National Wage Council issues guidelines on wage increase?&nbsp;The intention is not to depress prices to low levels, but to curb excesses.&nbsp;This can serve to stabilise the property market and pre-empt excessive rent increase.</p><p>In addition, real estate agents are commonly paid a commission based on the rent and, hence, higher rents work to their benefit.&nbsp;It would, therefore, benefit tenants to have an alternative source of information on what constitutes a reasonable rent increase.</p><p>Another important cost component is transport cost.&nbsp;Record COE prices for private and commercial vehicles, and even motorcycles, are causing pain for both families and businesses.</p><p>We understand the need to control the vehicle population in Singapore, because we are a small nation and road space is limited, but we must also recognise that mobility and the benefits that it provides are essential for all and should not be the sole province of the rich.</p><p>Skyrocketing COE prices contribute to the cost of living crisis in many ways. If the cost of a motorcycle doubles because the price of the COE has tripled, the Grab delivery rider is going to have to be paid more for his work. The cost of shipping and delivering goods, or a ride in a private-hire vehicle, will naturally also increase.</p><p>We urge the Government to consider the following suggestions: one, currently, passenger car and motorcycle COEs are under the zero growth policy, while COEs for commercial vehicles are allowed to grow at a rate of 0.25%.&nbsp;As motorcycles are increasingly used for delivery, we suggest that motorcycle COEs are also be allowed to grow at a rate of 0.25%, similar to commercial vehicles; two, adopt a points-based system, where apart from the bidding price, we also consider other factors, like nationality, and needs-based factors, like families with young children or persons with disability (PwDs); three, impose additional levies on multiple vehicle purchases, similar to the implementation of additional buyer stamp duties (ABSD) on those who buy multiple residential properties.</p><p>The Senior Minister of State for Transport said yesterday that this would not change things much as there are not many households with multiple cars.&nbsp;Can the Senior Minister of State show us the comparison of the number of households with multiple cars versus those with multiple properties, to explain the difference in approach?</p><p>In any case, imposing levies on second and subsequent cars would either dampen demand for multiple cars and tilt the balance in favour of those buying their first cars, or else raise additional revenue for Government.&nbsp;The most likely outcome is a combination of both.&nbsp;As both outcomes are desirable, I see no reason to reject this suggestion.</p><p>Another way to cope with rising cost of living is to have higher wages.&nbsp;Today, I will focus on the training and education for higher-paying jobs. The wage gap between graduates and non-graduates has been widening significantly, suggesting that there is demand for more graduates and we should provide more university places for our students.</p><p>Take the Medical Faculty, for example.&nbsp;The annual intake of the local medical schools is about 500.&nbsp;However, every year, on average, about 800 Singaporean applicants were rejected by the medical schools at the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University, even though they meet the admissions criteria.&nbsp;Why do we not increase medical intake more aggressively?&nbsp;Instead, our students end up going to overseas medical schools, incurring huge expenses and we risk unnecessary brain drain when they do not return.</p><p>The traditional argument about ensuring fair share of talents in various sectors is outdated when we import foreign talents so readily.&nbsp;The same applies to other faculties as well, where Singaporean students are keen to study and that would lead to good paying jobs.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, the issue of cost of living is a complex one but one of great importance to many Singaporeans.&nbsp;Many suggestions have been, and will be, made today to address this pressing issue and improve the lives of Singaporeans.&nbsp;I hope the Government can keep an open mind to all suggestions and consider them seriously.</p><p>Earlier, the hon Member Mr Sitoh Yih Pin commented that the Reserves is for our children and our children's children. I think that it is important for us now to recall that our total fertility rate (TFR) has fallen to 1.05, which is half the replacement rate of 2.1. The number of our children and our children's children is halving with every generation. I think this offers a good reason to review our approach towards our Reserves and how much more do we need to accumulate.&nbsp;If our TFR falls further from cost pressures, who are we accumulating the Reserves for?</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Mark Lee.</p><h6>4.36 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Mark Lee (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, our nation is undoubtedly feeling the ripples of global economic turbulence, and for many Singaporeans, the pressure on their household budgets is a source of concern. We must, and we should, take these concerns seriously, and it is our solemn duty to approach these concerns with the seriousness it deserves. It affects the daily lives of our people, the vitality of our markets and the health of our national economy.</p><p>As I hear the debates from some of the Members on the floor, like Mr Sitoh, it invokes in me images of insurmountable challenges and despair. The term \"crisis\" is a powerful one. We must, therefore, use this term judiciously, especially when the resolve of a nation like ours is called into question.</p><p>I stand today, not to minimise the concerns of our citizens regarding the cost of living, but to contextualise the narrative we choose to represent it. It is our collective responsibility to analyse and approach this issue with a clear-eyed perspective, and not through the lens of panic that the word \"crisis\" might imply.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, I do agree in addressing serious concerns on our cost of living, but to declare a crisis is to imply that our existing policies have faltered significantly. That our systems are in disarray and that our societal frameworks are on the brink of failure. This, I do not agree.</p><p>Singapore stands today as a global hub of commerce, a testament to sound economic principles and a beacon of stability. This did not happen by chance, but through the meticulous crafting of policies that are both robust and responsive.</p><p>Today, we stand united in our commitment to tackle a concern that lies at the core of every Singaporean's daily life \u2013 the escalating cost of living. But these are not just random fluctuations; they are the result of complex global economic trends, including widespread inflation that many countries are dealing with.</p><p>According to data published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), global inflation currently stands at 6.9%, having eased slightly from last year's high of 8.7%. MAS' core inflation measures stands as a testament to these challenges, with projections indicating a rate of around 4% for 2023. While we see a moderate level of inflation as a hallmark of a thriving economy, the excess erodes the economic well-being of both companies and consumers.</p><p>The businesses that drive our economy are feeling the effects of today's unpredictable economic climate first-hand. We have seen the cost of running a business go up due to higher prices for materials and goods, a consequence of the pandemic's lingering disruption to how we get products from one place to another.</p><p>As a council member of both Singapore Business Federation (SBF) and Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI), data from our recent SBF Manpower and Wages Survey conducted in July 2023, 45% of SMEs and large enterprises expect their revenues to fall in the next 12 months, and an overwhelming 85% of companies expect business costs to increase, between 10% and 50% in the next 12 months, with SMEs projecting a deeper rise in costs.</p><p>Even more unsettling is SCCCI's Annual Business Survey conducted between July to October this year, where 68% of SMEs expect to have lesser profits or losses this year, compared to last year.</p><p>Additionally, recent international tensions have caused prices for fuel and food to soar \u2013 expenses that not only affected companies, but also the daily budgets of every household. The price of rice, for example, a staple in every Singaporean home, has been subjected to fluctuations due to trade restrictions and weather-related production issues in exporting countries. These challenges are complex, but they have very real impacts on our community, from the corner store to the dinner table.</p><p>It is imperative to acknowledge that the weight of these escalating costs cannot be shouldered by the business community alone. With each incremental rise in operating expenses, there is a cascade of effects, impacting on employment, wages and the price of goods and services.</p><p>Mr Liang Eng Hwa has already mentioned that our Government has not been a passive observer to these trends. Through monetary policy, they have taken decisive steps, countering the cost of imports by allowing the Singapore dollar to appreciate in a controlled manner. This is a strategic move, managing the immediate needs with medium-term outcomes, and is but one prong of their approach.</p><p>On the fiscal front, the Government have been responsive. Consider the Assurance Package enhancements announced in Budget 2023, which introduced or expanded upon several initiatives; the Cost of Living Special Payment provides a direct relief to families, helping to mitigate the immediate impact of rising prices; U-Save rebates have been a buffer for households against the increasing utility bills as energy prices soared globally. These measures are carefully designed to ensure that the additional costs are not borne by those least able to shoulder them.</p><p>The Government efforts extend beyond immediate relief. The Enterprise Innovation Scheme (EIS) and the enhancements to the SME Co-Investment Fund exemplify the commitment to fostering a fertile environment for businesses to innovate and grow. A concrete manifestation of this commitment is seen in our investment in the tech industry, supporting the creation of high-value jobs and the development of cutting-edge products that not only serve local needs but have the potential to meet demands internationally.</p><p>As we continue to bolster our economic resilience, we must also fortify the social fabric that holds us together. This involves maintaining fiscal responsibility and optimising social support measures to effectively reach those hardest hit by cost of living adjustments. A clear example is the enhancements made to the Child Development Account (CDA), providing additional support to young families investing in their children's future.</p><p>Alongside these measures, the Government has been monitoring the business sector to safeguard against any instances of profiteering, which many consumers are concerned about. The Committee Against Profiteering (CAP) was reconvened on 16 March 2022, under the leadership of Minister of State Ms Low Yen Ling, and includes MPs, industry stakeholders and grassroots organisation representatives, actively investigating any feedback on unjustified price hikes of essential products and services.</p><p>Even as global inflationary measures are set to moderate going forward, Singapore must continue to navigate cost of living issues in a way that is responsible, effective and forward-looking. The business community urges all stakeholders in society \u2013 individuals, families, community leaders, businesses, investors and the Government, to work together in trusted partnership towards a sustainable and viable growth that all of us, as a national collective, will benefit meaningfully from.</p><p>As we look ahead, the business community call for four key shared commitments.&nbsp;Our first shared commitment is to understand the root causes of our cost of living challenges with clarity and precision.</p><p>We are not just facing local issues, nor can it be solely attributed to ineffective policy-making. We are dealing with the ripple effects of global market trends and geopolitical events that have affected many countries, including Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>We therefore need to dissect these complex dynamics thoroughly. By doing so, we can craft solutions that are right for our unique situation in Singapore while also fitting into the larger global puzzle.&nbsp;</p><p>A common pitfall for many nations has been the reliance on policy-making grounded in evidence or statistics that unfortunately are reflective of past conditions rather than the present reality. Such a lag can lead to suboptimal outcomes.&nbsp;Take, for instance, the Federal Reserve, which, having underestimated inflationary trends, found itself compelled to implement rapid interest rate hikes.&nbsp;</p><p>To refine our policy-making, a more dynamic approach is called for. This could be achieved through enhanced collaboration with trade associations, ensuring a continuous dialogue and close listening ear between their diverse membership and Government policy-makers.&nbsp;</p><p>Such a two-way exchange promises to bring real-time ground-level insights to the forefront, allowing for the crafting of more responsive and agile solutions to the economic challenges we face and allow policy-makers at times to consider slowing down the pace of implementation of certain policies that could unintentionally aggravate inflation woes.</p><p>Our second commitment is to uphold strict fiscal discipline to protect our economic future.&nbsp;It is essential that we sharpen the focus of our social support programmes, ensuring they deliver tangible outcomes to those most affected by rising costs.</p><p>We must continue to reward innovation and productivity across all sectors. By doing so, we are not just spending money more wisely but also strengthening the foundation of our economic system.</p><p>The third cornerstone of our approach is a commitment to thoughtful policy-making, avoiding quick fixes that cause more problems than they solve.&nbsp;Policies must be carefully calibrated to encourage growth and increase earnings without inadvertently sacrificing the future of our children,&nbsp;increasing the national debt or taxes in a way that could worsen living costs, driving talents and investments away.&nbsp;Our aim is to create a cycle of prosperity, spurring growth that leads to better wages and smoothing out inefficiencies that inflate costs.</p><p>Our fourth commitment is fortifying the bonds of our community.&nbsp;In a landscape where the cost of living is escalating, it is not only households that feel the strain. The repercussions extend deeply into the business community as well.&nbsp;Workers naturally seek higher wages from their employers to cope with their increasing expenses.</p><p>Acknowledging this dynamic, the National Wages Council has recently called for a built-in wage increase of 5.5% to 7.5% for low-income workers, raising also the minimum quantum in its 2023/24 wage guidelines. The Government has also proactively introduced the Progressive Wage Model, specifically designed to elevate the income of low-wage workers.&nbsp;These initiatives demonstrate a clear national resolve to uplift the standards of living for this vulnerable group.</p><p>From a business perspective, these measures might initially seem like an added strain on operational costs. Yet, the broader business community understands that these are the tenets of a new social compact that Singapore is striving to create.&nbsp;</p><p>In our journey to overcome and adjust to the evolving challenges of cost of living, it calls for unity and collective resolve, not division. We must resist the inclination to frame our challenges as conflicts between different segments of our society, be it local versus foreigner, business versus worker, or Government versus citizen.&nbsp;Instead, we must recognise that these economic hurdles are shared challenges that will be best overcome when we, as a united nation, pull together in the same direction.</p><p>Fostering this unity requires a commitment from all sectors of society to engage in open, constructive dialogue. We must break down the barriers that hinder collaboration and build bridges that allow us to share insights and develop holistic solutions. By standing in solidarity \u2013 citizens and Government, businesses and workers, locals and internationals \u2013 we can harness the full strength of our national character to address the cost of living issues in a manner that is not only effective but also equitable.</p><p>In conclusion, I thank the hon Leader of the Opposition,&nbsp;Mr Pritam Singh, for raising this critical and important issue that affects all Singaporeans. While we acknowledge the language of \"crisis\" may capture the immediacy of the issue, we must frame our dialogue in a manner that reflects not panic but preparedness, not reaction but readiness.&nbsp;</p><p>The business community is convinced that the key to managing living costs effectively lies in bolstering our economic base. We must channel our efforts into enhancing our competitiveness, encouraging innovation and sustainability in businesses and elevating workforce skills. Expanding our economy's capacity in this way is crucial for our ongoing success and for our ability to provide social support.&nbsp;</p><p>It is through these enduring strategies that we will build an economy robust enough to support its people through every challenge, ensuring that we are always ready to lend a hand to those who need it most.&nbsp;</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, our unity is our strength and it is together that we will craft a sustainable future where economic vitality is matched by social harmony and inclusiveness.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Ms He Ting Ru.</p><h6>4.52 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, over the last few years, one can barely open the headlines without&nbsp;catching a glimpse about various crises facing our planet, ranging from the&nbsp;cost of living crisis that is the subject of this motion and also the climate&nbsp;crisis, mental health crisis and crises relating to war and conflict.</p><p>But even&nbsp;when we may be faced with \"crisis fatigue\", what affects us viscerally is the&nbsp;surging prices of things that we need on a daily basis.&nbsp;Madam, in Mandarin.</p><p><em> </em>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20231107/vernacular-He Ting Ru COL 7Nov2023-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;In&nbsp;recent years, many things have troubled Singaporeans, especially the pressure of rising living&nbsp;costs. This also includes rising medical and nursing costs. Among these, mental health is also an aspect that may be easy to neglect in Singapore's medical and insurance systems as it is less&nbsp;visible. However, mental health can have a very direct impact on the lives of individuals and their&nbsp;families. We must remember that if we neglect our physical and mental health for a while, we&nbsp;may need more complex or even expensive treatment later on and the stress we need to endure&nbsp;in life will also increase.</p><p>For this reason, the Workers' Party calls for the relaxing of restrictions on using CPF savings and&nbsp;also to increase state subsidies for medium- and long-term care and also mental care. Some may point out that this is a waste of resources, that it will reduce personal savings that can be used for&nbsp;medical care in the future, and also creates dependence on the country and weakens the country's financial resources in the long run. The Workers' Party believes health cannot be&nbsp;understood through a cost lens alone. Health is a long-term investment in our people and the&nbsp;country. Preventive care or regular care today can effectively avoid future health and financial&nbsp;burdens. I will use my speech on the motion today to explore these issues in more depth, with the&nbsp;hope of improving medical services and reducing the challenges faced by Singaporeans.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;The adverse impact of the cost of living crisis is seen on both mental and&nbsp;physical health. While humans have an immense capacity for resilience&nbsp;to get through difficult times, there are measurable, long-term effects on&nbsp;health and overall wellbeing that result from long-term stress. The&nbsp;imbalance in the body's physiology due to long-term stress, such as the constant worries associated with increasing costs, can lead to increased&nbsp;rates of chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, lowered&nbsp;immunity, leading to greater susceptibility to infectious diseases, and also&nbsp;has an adverse impact on mental health.</p><p>I would therefore like to focus on the health and care related elements of&nbsp;the cost of living crisis facing us.</p><p>There is attention given to the direct link&nbsp;between worries over costs and the impact that it is having our ability to&nbsp;stay healthy and to be able to afford care, be it physical or mental health,&nbsp;long-term intermediate care or even preventive care.</p><p>A report released by Cigna in January 2023 about a global survey of 9,000 respondents also&nbsp;warned that cost of living pressures could trigger a global health crisis.&nbsp;The&nbsp;survey found that rising costs of living are top of mind for most people&nbsp;around the globe, with nearly half of respondents in Singapore saying that it&nbsp;was their biggest worry. Almost two thirds of the 1,100 respondents in Singapore also agreed that inflation is making it too expensive to stay&nbsp;healthy, whether it is through paying for care or taking measures to&nbsp;stay healthy.</p><p>A study at King's College London's Centre for Society and Mental Health&nbsp;also found that worries about increasing costs pose a major risk to mental&nbsp;health and those with pre-existing mental health issues are more at risk.&nbsp;The study also found that those who are using savings to meet everyday&nbsp;costs and borrowing money to cope were correlated to psychological&nbsp;distress.</p><p>In view of this, I believe the cost of health and other forms of care is one of&nbsp;the areas that warrants closer attention as we tackle the broader cost of&nbsp;living issues.&nbsp;</p><p>While Singapore, as a nation, has increased healthcare&nbsp;spending as a proportion of GDP in recent years, our current spending at&nbsp;4% of GDP is still less than half of the OECD average. The health&nbsp;outcomes we have achieved at this cost are rightly a point of pride for&nbsp;policy-makers. However, our country is a densely populated urban city&nbsp;where the cost of healthcare delivery is more easily managed compared&nbsp;with countries with larger and sparser geographies.&nbsp;Singapore's health&nbsp;system also benefits from a generally lower crime and drug abuse rate and&nbsp;road traffic fatality rate than other countries \u2013 achievements that are not to be&nbsp;diminished and these should definitely be maintained.</p><p>But I believe that our health outcomes could be improved, with&nbsp;Singaporeans living healthier, longer and safer lives.</p><p>As an example, my&nbsp;WP colleagues have pointed out that for many years now, even&nbsp;before and without COVID-19, our approach to hospital bed occupancy rates&nbsp;are a cause for concern, with Ng Teng Fong, Khoo Teck Puat and Tan&nbsp;Tock Seng Hospitals operating at near 100% occupancy just in the last&nbsp;week of October 2023, even though the Government has acknowledged&nbsp;that 85% is the academic consensus safe operating rate.</p><p>In terms of&nbsp;waiting times, medical manpower per capita, intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity in the public&nbsp;health system, there remains concerns about what the tensions in these&nbsp;areas mean for our health outcomes.</p><p>These areas should bear continuous scrutiny to maintain confidence in our&nbsp;public healthcare system.&nbsp;</p><p>Out of pocket costs and waiting times are the&nbsp;most direct interaction that most of us would have with the healthcare&nbsp;system. Around 70% of Singaporeans and PRs have Integrated Shield&nbsp;Plans (IPs) that cover private medical care and two in three have riders to pay at&nbsp;least a proportion of medical bills. This is indicative of residents being&nbsp;extremely cognisant about the potential costs associated with ill health and&nbsp;wanting to take action to guard against these costs.</p><p>A Straits Times article&nbsp;published in April 2022 titled \"Having an Integrated Shield Plan and rider&nbsp;may not always guarantee peace of mind\" warned that even buying IPs&nbsp;and riders may not always guarantee peace of mind and that&nbsp;residents might still face substantial bills should&nbsp;they require expensive treatment for preexisting conditions.</p><p>Recent commentary has also focused on private insurance coverage for&nbsp;those with mental health conditions and there is acknowledgement that&nbsp;current coverage is inadequate.&nbsp;</p><p>In a reply to a question that I filed in&nbsp;September this year, MOH also stated that insurers cannot indiscriminately&nbsp;reject an application solely on, amongst others, the basis of medical&nbsp;conditions, including mental health conditions. I was also happy to see an&nbsp;article in end October 2023 where private insurers stated that they are&nbsp;looking to include better coverage for those with mental healthcare and&nbsp;treatment needs.</p><p>However, the Government should ensure that this does not cause a surge&nbsp;in private sector insurance bills and regulators have to be ready to step in&nbsp;should private insurance discriminate on various medical grounds.&nbsp;This is&nbsp;especially as inflation in medical benefits is already expected to exceed&nbsp;inflation in healthcare post-subsidies.</p><p>Insurance broker, WTW, currently&nbsp;projects medical benefits inflation to be 9.8% this year, outpacing the&nbsp;broader inflation after subsidies in healthcare, which has generally risen in&nbsp;line with broader inflation over the last one-and-a-half decades.</p><p>Next, healthcare schemes and financing are currently extremely complex&nbsp;and are challenging for the person in the street to negotiate. This&nbsp;complexity imposes a bandwidth tax.&nbsp;For example, an individual in the&nbsp;sandwiched generation will have to understand the differences in schemes&nbsp;for both older and younger dependents. And if they buy IP riders, they will also&nbsp;need to understand the interaction between public and private healthcare&nbsp;for each dependent. In such situations, I hope that we can try and avoid&nbsp;situations where one ends up over-insuring their family in order to avoid the&nbsp;stress of being caught out unawares.</p><p>Apart from continuing to work on&nbsp;ensuring individuals feel secure about their ability to cope with the financial&nbsp;aspects associated with future healthcare costs, existing financial&nbsp;education efforts should target this specific point and address what families&nbsp;can do to avoid over-insuring, including demystifying complex insurance&nbsp;schemes which inevitably change from time to time due to developments in&nbsp;the macro environment.</p><p>I now turn to MediSave. For those with low MediSave balances, the&nbsp;Government should offer more MediSave top-ups to address healthcare&nbsp;inflation while continuing to leverage its design which reduces wastage&nbsp;while cutting out-of-pocket costs for consumers.&nbsp;</p><p>In this vein, we have to ensure that yearly MediSave withdrawal limits are&nbsp;updated yearly to reflect inflation, as medical costs can surge rapidly in a&nbsp;short period of time.&nbsp;The headline limit was increased to $500 from $400 in&nbsp;2018 and was updated in 2020 to allow patients with specified complex&nbsp;chronic conditions to withdraw up to $700 yearly.</p><p>At the time of the 2018&nbsp;update, the $500 limit was enough to cover the average annual bill of a&nbsp;patient with three or more chronic conditions.&nbsp;However, we have to look to&nbsp;increase withdrawal limits to match healthcare inflation rates and consider&nbsp;allowing greater flexibility to use our MediSave savings.</p><p>One way to do this&nbsp;would be to repeat the WP\u2019s proposal to remove the MediSave&nbsp;withdrawal limit for chronic disease management for those over 60, which&nbsp;is contained in our 2020 manifesto. And this was also raised by Aljunied MP&nbsp;Gerald Giam in October last year.</p><p>A third MediSave-related point is that our savings earmarked for healthcare&nbsp;expenditure could be used to better support mental health treatment.&nbsp;</p><p>Anecdotally, it appears that the wait times for access to counselling,&nbsp;therapy and other mental health care have driven some recipients to&nbsp;private services.&nbsp;Alongside ongoing moves to grow public mental health&nbsp;services, can the Government consider allowing users to tap their own&nbsp;MediSave account for a range of private mental health treatments which&nbsp;would include psychotherapy, counselling and other forms of therapy like&nbsp;speech and occupational therapy? This would mean bringing in practices&nbsp;run by therapists and other professionals to allow their treatment costs to&nbsp;also be covered by MediSave.</p><p>Mental health is no less important than physical health and poor mental&nbsp;health can lead to issues with physical health as well.</p><p>Since MediSave is&nbsp;already being approved for use for mental health services at places like Institute of Mental Health and polyclinics, I hope that we can consider expanding this to include&nbsp;the use of MediSave to access mental health services in other practice&nbsp;settings aside from purely psychiatric settings. This would be important to&nbsp;assist families from across the board, some of whom need to put in place&nbsp;early intervention strategies for their children's developmental issues, to&nbsp;support a multi-modal approach beyond psychiatric treatment to address&nbsp;neurodevelopmental, mental health conditions and symptoms.</p><p>Moving to intermediate and long-term care (ILTC) costs, while the issue deserves&nbsp;a longer intervention on its own, the move earlier this year to provide&nbsp;subsidies of at least 50% to all Singaporeans for palliative care earlier this&nbsp;year is welcome. Likewise, positive are plans to extend drug and vaccine&nbsp;subsidies of at least 50% to all patients of MOH-funded providers of long-term&nbsp;care services.</p><p>However, I note that nursing home care costs remain a&nbsp;significant area of concern, with those with per capita household income of&nbsp;over $2,800 a month not being able to get subsidies for nursing home care. These&nbsp;families would instead have to turn to private nursing homes, which can&nbsp;cost $5,000 or more a month.</p><p>The WP, in our 2020 manifesto, called for there to be more&nbsp;subsidies for ILTC costs to relieve the out-of-pocket&nbsp;financial burden of social care for families who need it.&nbsp;</p><p>With&nbsp;immediate cost of living pressures upon us, can the Ministry share details&nbsp;about the quantitative and qualitative impact the current cost of living crisis&nbsp;has had on the ability of households to pay for ILTC needs and what are the&nbsp;plans to ensure that they do not fall through the cracks and have to dial&nbsp;down on ILTC arrangements?</p><p>A next step in this revamp for subsidies would be to look again at related&nbsp;subsidies, for example, the Home Caregiving Grant that was brought up&nbsp;by Member for Hougang SMC Dennis Tan.&nbsp;While the grant was&nbsp;increased recently to now pay between $250 to $400 a month for those who&nbsp;satisfy the means testing criteria, the amount is hardly enough to cover&nbsp;care-related needs.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong> [Mr Speaker in the Chair]</strong></p><p>The means testing criteria is also strict and excludes&nbsp;many middle-income households.&nbsp;Additionally, it does not account for the&nbsp;loss of income or non-financial costs, such as the invisible workload&nbsp;associated with providing care at home for a family member.</p><p>Finally, I would like to touch on concerns about the cost of healthy eating in&nbsp;Singapore. After all, what we put in our bodies will form a strong foundation&nbsp;for good physical and mental health. And by eating well, I do not mean&nbsp;swapping our national diet for the most expensive proteins or organic&nbsp;foods.</p><p>Eating well is eating in a way that at least meets what nutritionists&nbsp;recommend as a bare minimum. This is already contained in the Health&nbsp;Promotion Board (HPB)'s My Healthy Plate guide: a quarter whole grains, a&nbsp;quarter good sources of proteins, half fruit and vegetables.&nbsp;This, as many&nbsp;of us know, can be challenging to do, given our carbohydrate-dominant&nbsp;everyday cuisine.&nbsp;This is made even harder for those who work or live&nbsp;further away from supermarkets or places where there is a range of food&nbsp;options to facilitate a healthy diet and can be tough on those of us who&nbsp;work shifts.&nbsp;It is also harder to address rising food costs when many do not&nbsp;have access to a microwave or fridge at work, which makes it more difficult&nbsp;to bring healthier meals from home.</p><p>The HPB has a Healthier Dining&nbsp;Programme encouraging availability and accessibility of healthier food and&nbsp;drink options across the island, but we can go further.&nbsp;For example, we can&nbsp;give more consideration and priority to stalls and restaurants that offer quantitatively healthier food under HDB's Price-Quality Method Tenders&nbsp;framework.</p><p>Sir, the continued cost of living crisis facing us has had an impact on our&nbsp;mental and physical health in the near-term and also has long-term&nbsp;impacts on our health and development as we grow and age.</p><p>We need to&nbsp;take steps now to help hard-working families already struggling to juggle&nbsp;their household balance sheets confidently deal with increases in the cost&nbsp;of care \u2013 health, preventative and social care \u2013 so that it does not become&nbsp;an insurmountable burden. With these in mind, I support the original Motion filed by the Leader of the Opposition.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Desmond Choo.</p><h6>5.08 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand in support of the amended Motion by the hon Member Mr Liang Eng Hwa.</p><p>Inflation and consequently elevated cost of living are very important issues.&nbsp;In the Labour Movement, this is a core concern that we have monitored closely over the years.&nbsp;The effects are felt by all&nbsp;\u2013 workers, consumers and businesses.&nbsp;Our older and lower wage workers would understandably be even more affected.</p><p>During our \"every worker matters\" conversation concluded recently, more than half the workers aged 50 and above and workers at 20<sup>th</sup> percentile of income, felt that they were most impacted by the price of cooked food, groceries and utilities.</p><p>This was exactly the items most susceptible to fall out from COVID, the Ukrainian-Russian war and other geopolitical events.</p><p>With so much of our inflation being imported and affected by major global events, workers and residents often wonder what can be done.&nbsp;Many of our workers and residents have already made lifestyle changes where possible by switching from eating out to cooking at home or by switching from private transport to public transport.&nbsp;</p><p>With our workers taking action to manage cost, national policies have also helped our workers.</p><p>The Singapore dollar, as Mr Liang Eng Hwa has pointed out, is much stronger than many other currencies now.&nbsp;It is a fact not lost amongst our workers and residents who travelled in the region and beyond.</p><p>The Government is providing targeted support to cushion the impact of inflation, particularly for middle- to lower-income and retiree households.&nbsp;Our workers welcome the $10 billion enhanced Assurance Package (AP), the Cost of Living (COL) support package and the new Majulah package. The latter itself will cover 1.4 million older residents.</p><p>Our workers' common feedback is that there is just too many packages to remember, not that there are too many, but too many to remember. But these packages will ultimately be judged by its outcomes.</p><p>MOF's 2022 studies suggested that the COL support measures fully covered the effects of rising prices for the bottom 40% of households and retiree households and half of the average expenditure increase for the middle 20% of households.</p><p>The Deputy Prime Minister also assured Parliament that the support measures combined will fully covered the increases in spending by the lower-income households this year, due to inflation and the GST rate increases and substantially cover the increases in spending by middle-income households.</p><p>For our lower-wage and senior workers, the Prime Minister has announced at this year's National Day Rally that there will be further enhancement to the Workfare Incentive Scheme (WIS), Silver Support and matched retirement savings schemes, with details to be announced in 2024.</p><p>These schemes, taken together, provide a good balance between cash and CPF MediSave savings, immediate and future needs.</p><p>We need to deal with this current period of high inflation, but not forget the long-term structure challenges, such as the healthcare needs of an older population.</p><p>The Labour Movement stands ready to support our workers.</p><p>Cost of living issues should not be tackled by the Government alone. Enterprises have their roles to play too.&nbsp;In NTUC, the FairPirce Group plays its time-honoured role to source and stockpile essential supplies for the nation. We can all remember how Singapore still had some goods on the shelves even in the deepest of COVID. It protects of people against price shocks experienced is so many other countries.&nbsp;FairPrice Group releases supplies on regular prices even if there are external global factors like logistics issues experienced during COVID that can cause huge upswings in prices. This can help to moderate domestic prices, especially during crisis.</p><p>The question is: what about the non-crisis time?&nbsp;NTUC is committed to helping Singaporeans meet this difficult inflation challenge. FairPrice, for example, has an extensive range of household brands too.&nbsp;In fact, 2000 items across 54 categories. They are priced at a minimum of 10% to 15% below comparable brands and quality.</p><p>FairPrice Group's Pioneer Generation, Merdeka Generation and CHAS blue discount schemes have brought about $65.5 million worth of savings since 2015.</p><p>I know the aunties and uncles in my constituency, Tampines-Changkat, are very discriminating when it comes to prices and quality. They know exactly which days to shop for the best deals and we will welcome more of them to do that.</p><p>But we will not rest on our laurels.&nbsp;In 2022, FairPrice started the \"stretch a dollar\" programme, giving a 5% discount on 100 essential items every Friday.&nbsp;At Kopitiam and FoodFare, prices of coffee and tea and the breakfast set were reduced or held constant throughout last year despite significant business cost increases.&nbsp;FairPrice and other social enterprises face the same cost pressures as any other commercial entities.&nbsp;So, those who use the FairPrice mobile app can also enjoy 10% off their meals at Kopitiam outlets island-wide.</p><p>We note keenly that lower-income workers require the most help.&nbsp;The Labour Movement charity and corporate philanthropy arms also provide support for low-income families and individuals.&nbsp;Our special assistance care fund launched in August 2022 has dispersed more than $2 million to 8,000 members to alleviate the cost of living. Across areas, such as eldercare, education, community service, our social enterprises collectively dispersed about $12 million in 2022.</p><p>NTUC certainly does not sit idly by but leans in to care for our workers and residents.</p><p>On another front, just over the recent two months, the five Community Development Councils (CDCs) have launched a total of $40 million worth of funds to help residents cope with rising costs of living. This is in addition to the $600 million CDC vouchers that were issued island-wide over the past three years to support residents and small businesses. The CDCs have put in place a wide range of assistance schemes to help low-income families with food, utilities education, transport, diapers, spectacles, mobility aides and more, with the new funds, for example.</p><p>I will go through all the five CDCs. There are some examples.&nbsp;</p><p>Residents living Central Singapore can look forward to school bus fare subsidies, a neighbourhood job scheme, assistance for families with children living in rental flats.&nbsp;</p><p>Southwest residents will get more help for education, food, transportation and daily expenses.&nbsp;</p><p>Southeast residents will have a new EduCare fund to give additional help to low-income families, to students in primary and secondary schools.&nbsp;</p><p>Northwest residents will have a new support grant. We will focus on uplifting the least privileged, providing upscaling skills, connecting partners live in community.&nbsp;</p><p>Residents in the Northeast CDC would all have new internship mentoring opportunities, comprehensive financial support for school-going children.</p><p>Many thanks to the donors, partners and volunteers working with us on these initiatives. And there will be more to come for our residents.</p><p>By coming together to work on programmes to uplift the less privilege and provide opportunities to the next generation, we not only help our families to combat inflation but also strengthen our social compact.</p><p>The examples of NTUC FairPrice Group and the CDC partnerships show that everyone can play a part in supporting one another to tide through difficult times.&nbsp;We can mitigate the impact of price increases and in doing so, strengthen our community.&nbsp;</p><p>Our overall Government policies will help to keep the increase in Singapore's food prices much lower than the increase in global food and commodity prices&nbsp;\u2013 below 4%, compared to 25% globally between March 2020 and May 2022.</p><p>There is still more work to be done, but we can do so together.</p><p>Beyond the broad and many-stakeholders approach in solving our cost of living issues, the most important work is to keep wages ahead of inflation&nbsp;\u2013 real wage increase.</p><p>No country can shield their citizens from cost issues in the longer term and do it sustainably. There are no quick workarounds with rising costs. Many countries have resorted to things like price caps but only to abandon them when the bill size gets too monstrous.&nbsp;</p><p>The crux is to make sure that our workers can have real wage growth. This is where we must invest our resources, time and effort. So, what can we do?</p><p>The key is a tight labour market and a productive workforce.</p><p>A tight labour market gives workers bargaining power to command pay increases. We can keep it tight by continuing to bring in good quality investments that create jobs for Singaporeans.&nbsp;Our policies have resulted in record levels of direct foreign investment commitments for the last three years&nbsp;\u2013 even more jobs for Singaporeans.</p><p>Today, we have nearly 88,000 job vacancies, or two vacancies for every unemployed person; more than one in five vacancies in growth sectors with higher-paying jobs.&nbsp;We must continue to help our workers to secure good jobs. With no jobs, it can be worse than any inflation or inflation issues. Jobs provide dignity.&nbsp;Together with Workforce Singapore and NTUC's&nbsp;e2i, we have strengthened our job placement. We have a&nbsp;Job Security Council to help our people get jobs, even in the deepest of COVID-19.</p><p>Recently, I visited a job fair organised by the Northeast CDC and e2i. There were 1,000 vacancies on offer, not as many jobseekers. I was secretly glad to hear from the employers that they found it difficult to hire locals and that they were improving their wages and workplace conditions to out-compete rivals.&nbsp;These are good signs for our local workers.</p><p>Our workforce must also be productive. A highly skilled workforce has been a cornerstone of Singapore's success and even more important in today's world, where skills are valued more than ever.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not easy work because it takes years to get the policies right and see results. The Industry Transformation Maps can provide that longer-term solution.</p><p>At NTUC, we are glad that the Government is providing us with support to form Company Training Committees (CTCs). These CTCs are now the backbone of many companies who are tranforming their businesses, with better wage outcomes for workers.</p><p>As shared by the Senior Minister of State for Manpower yesterday, over the last five years, between June 2017 and June 2022, real median income rose by 1.8% per annum. Real income growth at the 20th percentile saw even stronger growth at 2.9% per annum, narrowing the gap with the middle-income earner.</p><p>We acknowledge that sustaining such real wage growth is immensely difficult, year on year. While we might not succeed every year, we must keep our focus on longer-term growth, for longer-term well-being.&nbsp;</p><p>In providing real wage increases for our workers, we cannot do this alone. We work with our tripartite partners on the NWC to promote fair and sustainable wage increases.&nbsp;This year's NWC again demonstrates the resolve of tripartite partners to help workers cope with the cost-of-living increases. Amidst increases in business costs, the NWC recommended a one-off payment, a lumpsum payment for all workers to cope with cost of living, with higher amounts for lower- to middle-income workers.</p><p>What about our lower-wage workers&nbsp;\u2013 the ones who need more help?&nbsp;We have expanded the coverage of the Progressive Wage Model. The Government co-shares the cost of wage increases with employers through the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme. Today, up to nine out of 10 lower-wage workers are covered by the Progressive Wage measures.</p><p>This year, NWC recommended increasing the salaries of lower-wage workers by 5.5% to 7.5%, or at least $85 to $155 per month. This is higher than inflation. NWC has also recommended increases in the Progressive Wage requirements for administrators and drivers. The new requirements that will come into effect in 2024 will uplift 43,500 administrators and 8,400 drivers.&nbsp;So, more help is on the way.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, the world is faced with inflation in nearly every country. Some societies have been worse than others. We are glad that our policies as a whole are working. There is already light at the end of the tunnel. Based on MAS' latest projections, inflation is coming down.&nbsp;We are continuing to extend our different packages of support and by keeping our workflow productive, we can sustain real wages and our quality of life.&nbsp;With this, I support the amended Motion.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Mark Lee.</p><p><strong>Mr Mark Lee</strong>: Sorry, Mr Speaker, Sir, I realised that I did not state in my speech. I want to state for the record that I support the amended Motion.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Noted. Mr Gerald Giam.</p><h6>5.21 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Singapore faces an undeniable upward trend in cost of living, driven by factors such as global inflation, supply chain disruptions, escalating energy prices and labour shortages.</p><p>However, contrary to what the Member for Bukit Panjang seems to imply in his amendments to the Motion, domestic policy decisions like the hike in the GST, increases in water and electricity tariffs and rises in public transport fares, coupled with the skyrocketing cost of COEs, also contribute to the increase in the cost of living that Singaporeans are experiencing.</p><p>Blackbox Research's recent SensingSG survey found that 59% of Singapore residents highlighted cost of living among the two most important national and community issues.</p><p>Public transport costs are also a contributor to the cost of living in Singapore, making up 2.5% of MAS' core inflation basket.&nbsp;Over the last 10 years, the rate of increase in bus and train fares has been faster than that of core inflation.&nbsp;In the 2023 Fare Review Exercise, the Public Transport Council (PTC)'s fare adjustment formula produced a whopping 22.6% fare increase, although the PTC chose to cap it at 7%.&nbsp;</p><p>This decision, though, led to the Government providing an additional subsidy to public transport operators, to the tune of about $300 million in 2023&nbsp;\u2013 up from $200 million a year before.&nbsp;This subsidy still does not eliminate the remaining 15.6% of fare increase, which the PTC has deferred to future reviews.</p><p>In the meantime, public transport operators (PTOs) have continued to post eye watering profits. Between 2011 and 2022, SMRT and SBS Transit have together posted profits averaging $55 million a year, reaching $110 million in the last financial year.&nbsp;This is particularly jarring against the backdrop of increasing fares and Government subsidies.</p><p>The PTOs and our current public transport model face little competition with each other because they operate different transport routes across the island.&nbsp;Even duplications of the same routes for different transport modes are slowly being eliminated as bus services running parallel to new MRT lines are removed.</p><p>These prompt questions about the efficacy of the current fare adjustment formula and a broader discussion around the sustainability of Singapore's public transport model.</p><p>The current model consists of a mix of Government ownership of transport assets and operating contracts carved out among multiple profit-oriented PTOs.&nbsp;The model is inching more towards nationalisation than the Government would like to admit.</p><p>Starting in 2010, all real assets were transferred to the Government. The year 2012 saw the introduction of the $1.1 billion Bus Service Enhancement Plan.&nbsp;In 2013, the Bus Contracting Model saw bus services in certain areas tendered out to PTOs. This was completed in 2016.</p><p>The Land Transport Authority (LTA) now owns bus assets and pays the PTOs an operating fee while collecting all fare revenue and setting the service levels.&nbsp;The Government is now subsidising public transport services to the tune of $2 billion a year \u2013 or $1 for every journey.</p><p>This mesh of responsibilities involving the operators, the regulator and the Government potentially introduces inefficiencies and additional costs.&nbsp;These will eventually trickle down to commuters and taxpayers, manifesting in either increased fares, higher Government subsidies, lower service coverage or all of the above.</p><p>Some service coverage is already being reduced.&nbsp;In the past three years, about 30 bus services have been shortened or removed. Such changes have affected my residents in Bedok Reservoir who continue to voice their concerns to me about long wait times and crowded feeder bus rides to the Bedok Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station.&nbsp;Elderly commuters who favour direct trunk services, which facilitate shorter walking distances for the commute, are also affected by these changes.</p><p>As the Leader of the Opposition said when moving his Motion, we need to move beyond one-time fiscal handouts and explore possible structural changes to existing policies to reduce cost of living expenses for Singaporeans.</p><p>It is therefore timely to revisit the proposal to establish a National Transport Corporation (NTC). This was first proposed by the WP in 2006.&nbsp;We envisaged the NTC as a publicly owned, nonprofit, multimodal land transport entity which will oversee the planning and operation of all MRT, Light Rapid Transit (LRT) and truck bus services in Singapore.</p><p>The NTC offers many benefits over the current public transport model.</p><p>First, under the NTC, the substantial profits which go to PTOs and their shareholders could instead be redirected to benefit commuters.&nbsp;Such revenue could mitigate fare increases and subsidise transport for the elderly, people with disabilities and low-income households, directly addressing concerns about the cost of living.</p><p>Second,&nbsp;with full access to the NTC's financial records, the Government could set fares just high enough to ensure the NTC's fiscal sustainability, without overly burdening commuters.&nbsp;The complex fare adjustment formula can be done away with.&nbsp;Fare adjustments could be introduced progressively, avoiding abrupt changes during times of economic hardship.</p><p>Third, the NTC could manage bus interchanges, MRT and LRT stations and their associated linkways, leveraging the rent from these prime retail and commercial areas to support its operations. This will help moderate fare increases and the need for ever growing Government subsidies.</p><p>Fourth, the NTC could hire top transport engineers and managers, both locally and globally, based on their expertise, track records and commitment to public service.</p><p>Companies are fuelled by their people.&nbsp;Profit motives are not the sole drivers of efficiency and productivity improvements. By setting stringent key performance indicators (KPIs) and empowering these professionals, the NTC can continually improve service standards.</p><p>In contrast, the current penalties for PTOs' service disruptions are trivial compared to their profits and do not directly affect executive pay.&nbsp;The NTC's approach will see a marked improvement in performance management.</p><p>Fifth, for transparency and accountability, the NTC should disclose its executive salaries, primary profit sources and major cost drivers, enabling the Parliament and the public to examine its financial health and hold relevant parties accountable.</p><p>Sixth,&nbsp;a unified transport entity like the NTC would ensure more uniform service standards, enhanced service integration and comprehensive access to data for service improvement.</p><p>Utilising a vast array of commuter data, the NTC can employ artificial intelligence (AI) to forecast travel trends, dynamically directing buses and trains where they are most required.&nbsp;Improvement suggested by commuters in one region of Singapore could be applied island-wide.</p><p>Seventh, the NTC would yield economies of scale in procurement, staff allocation and technological infrastructure, leading to further savings that benefit commuters.</p><p>Eighth, the NTC would assume operational responsibilities currently held by the LTA, allowing the LTA to focus solely on its regulatory role, eliminating potential conflicts of interest from being both a regulator and an operator.</p><p>Lastly, the NTC would be given the freedom to experiment with and spearhead land transport solutions and position Singapore at the vanguard of global transport innovations.&nbsp;This could pave the way for Singapore to be an earlier adopter of advancements like autonomous buses or eco-friendly hydrogen-powered vehicles.</p><p>Sir, the NTC is a rethink of Singapore's public transport model.&nbsp;It shifts us away from public transport companies that profit from Government subsidies to a non-profit, unified provider that will be more efficient and affordable for both commuters and taxpayers.</p><p>This new model will place the needs and well-being of our commuters at the heart of our transport policy. It will not only address the immediate cost concerns of Singaporeans, but also steer Singapore's public transport into the future.</p><p>Sir, I support the Motion standing in the name of my hon friends, the Leader of the Opposition and Member for Aljunied, Mr Pritam Singh and the Member for Sengkang, Mr Louis Chua.&nbsp;</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.</p><h6>5.31 pm</h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang)</strong>: Speaker, Singapore has one of the lowest car ownership rates among advanced economies worldwide. In 2022, there were only 149 cars per 1,000 inhabitants here, a rate less than half that of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) or Taiwan, a quarter that of the UK and Switzerland, and six times less than New Zealand or the US.</p><p>The upshot of this, is that our streets are amongst the least congested in the world compared to global cities such as London, Chicago or Paris, where drivers spend more than 130 hours in their cars, sitting in traffic in 2022.&nbsp;Local commuters only lost 26 hours to jams and correspondingly less in terms of economic costs from lost time and petrol. This is admirable for a global city and one that we should not take for granted. This is evident for anyone who has had to endure rush hour in the major metropolitans of our neighbours, whether it be Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta or Manila. The major reason for this favourable anomaly is, undoubtedly, the system of Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) and the Vehicle Quota System (VQS), of which, COEs are the much-reviled offshoot.&nbsp;</p><p>COE prices hit a new high in October 2023, following repeated new records set in prior months. The Open category, now changes hands at $158,000, more than five times the recommended retail price of a brand new Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla sold elsewhere in the world. This is one of the major drivers of ever-rising pressures on our nation's cost of living. And COEs were implicated in the most recent increase in headline inflation.</p><p>Some may argue that cars in Singapore are a luxury and a car-lite society is both better for the environment and more than made up for, by an excellent transportation system. Surely, the price of COEs is only the concern of an elite few.</p><p>But for middle-income families with younger children, as so many of my Sengkang residents are, a car is almost a necessity for getting kids to and from child care and school, co-curricular activities, enrichment class and weekend shopping trips.&nbsp;Similarly, those who are elderly or less mobile may well feel that a car in the family is less of a luxury, and more of a need.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And car ownership is more widespread than we may think; two in five households own one.&nbsp;And even for those who do not own a vehicle, the price of cars and COEs bleeds into our costs every time we hop into a taxi or book a private hire car.</p><p>The high prices of COEs for cars had even spilled over into that of motorcycles, at least until recently, where the relatively low costs of ownership used to be a refuge for those with more modest means wishing to have their own private mode of transport.</p><p>The VQS and COEs were introduced in 1990. The objective, along with ERP, was to restrain ownership so that road traffic remains smooth. Inherent in the policy is a decision to exchange certainty in congestion management, for uncertainty in prices faced by aspiring car owners, along with the possibility of inequity in access and usage.&nbsp;Put another way, the Government consciously chose a quota system, knowing that it could lead to rising costs. If so, it follows then, that policy-makers should step in to manage prices when they get too far out of whack.&nbsp;</p><p>Since its introduction, the system has been repeatedly tweaked. These included minor adjustments, such as tenders became monthly instead of quarterly; but others have been more consequential, such as a decision to go from closed to open bidding,&nbsp;to make COEs non-transferable,&nbsp;or the collapsing of private-car categories into the present two.</p><p>But the Government chose to lock in vehicle quotas \u2013 with some initial allowance for growth \u2013 at the levels associated with the new car registrations established in the years following the roll-out of the VQS. This has led to significant variations in the total quota in different years; the difference in the highest and lowest supply years has been, on average, as high as 4,300 every month.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, the rate of growth of cars was frozen. This means that the stock of available COEs is now indefinitely fixed, and hence, the allocation of COEs is effectively zero-sum. If you are an aspiring car owner, but are priced out of the market, then too bad for you. If a well-off family can afford to buy multiple cars for each of their children, it will come at the expense of others who are less able to do so. This could be a delivery person who may need a vehicle for work, a household with a sick or disabled member that needs a car for routine hospital appointments, or a family of five who would benefit from one ride to shuttle their kids to and from school. But the Government has emphasised that \u2013 while it aims to keep COEs affordable \u2013 they were decidedly not a tool for enhancing progressivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This capsule history lesson is instructive, because it helps us understand not only the motivations behind why a COE system was rolled out, but also, why this history has unwittingly introduced shackles that inhibits the successful and equitable functioning of the system today.</p><p>Perhaps the best way to think about COEs and the VQS is that it is a two-step system for controlling the vehicle population. The VQS first sets the total number of cars that ply our roads. After this is established, bidding via COE efficiently allocates the available quotas to potential car owners.&nbsp;</p><p>COE bidding requires each bidder to make offers, but only pay the price of the lowest successful offer. It was inspired by auction theory, and in particular, Nobel Prize winning insights into how best to ensure that each bidder bids as much as their own private valuations would carry them. At the same time, no bidder has any incentive to deviate from the bids that they put forward.&nbsp;The outcome will, in theory, not only raise the same revenue as an auction awarded to the top bidder, but also allocate these COEs efficiently.&nbsp;</p><p>This is all here and good, but herein lies the wrinkle between theory and practice. While the COE system was modeled after this so-called second-price, sealed-bid auction, real-world considerations have meant a departure from this theoretical ideal. Bidding is now open, rather than sealed. There are multiple certificates to be issued, not just one. And perhaps, most importantly, to make things easier for car purchasers, we now allow dealers to bid on the buyers' behalf, for multiple COEs.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, the Government has made some efforts to address the recent spike in COE prices. They have tweaked supply, mainly by bringing forward confirmed five-year COE de-registrations and have increased bid deposits for motorcycles, while shortening the temporary validity period. But these have had limited effect, which is unsurprising since the moves are one-off.</p><p>Measures that appeared to contain prices in the motorcycle COE markets are unlikely to work for car COEs, since dealer strategies for selling cars and motorbikes differ.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, the freed COEs still constitute only a drop in the bucket of the overall quota shortfall relative to high-quota years.&nbsp;Even with the cut-and-paste measures announced in November,&nbsp;as shared by Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat yesterday, my calculations suggest that these adjustments inject about 10% more COEs into supply, on average within each category per month. Whereas a more decisive cut-and-paste is required to genuinely move the needle.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;To be clear, the Government is well aware of how relative quota differences are unequal across the years, and has been aware of this for a long time. In response to then-WP MP Mr Low Thia Khiang's query in 1998, about whether COE prices were due to such quota imbalances, then-Minister for Communications Mah Bow Tan simply explained that they were fixed at the beginning of each quota year, conveniently side-stepping the issue of whether a more balanced distribution of quotas were called for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Members of the public also recognise this. A letter to The Straits Times on 14 October 2023 called for managing COE demand and supply, not alternative, newfangled systems. Another online commenter to CNA claimed that we, and I quote, \"are being penalised unnecessarily by a good system gone rogue\".&nbsp;Transportation experts also expressed their displeasure that the COE system has not gone through a more fundamental review to deal with changes since being introduced 33 years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And unlike Vegas, what happens in the car COE market does not stay in the COE market. Rising COE premiums affect the prices of used cars, of course. But they also affect the cost of motorcycles, which are frequently used not only for transport, but also to make a living.&nbsp;High COEs also add fuel to other expenses already on fire, ranging from private hire fees to motor repair.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, in response to a PQs filed by the hon Member Mr Yip Hong Weng in 2022, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) stated that they would not be exercising any controls on the private hire car (PHC) market.&nbsp;The response to another PQ filed by my hon friend Mr Louis Chua, likewise shunned the idea of restricting PHCs from the COE bidding process.&nbsp;Indeed, the Ministry has gone as far as to say that \"LTA has no plans to review the COE rules\".&nbsp;</p><p>Now what can we do? One approach, is to further segment the COE market in some way. This decision is not as radical as it seems. Since the scheme was first introduced, there have been changes to the number of categories, before being continually refined to the present five as I mentioned earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>Today,&nbsp;there are routine calls to cater to separate, specialised categories of COEs. One way would be to drop the Open category altogether, or further tweak the criteria for the other categories.&nbsp;One could also create a category specifically for vehicles driven primarily for commercial purposes or, as I had suggested in my speech on the Electric Vehicles (EVs) Charging Bill late last year, for EVs.&nbsp;</p><p>However, one potential implication of introducing additional categories is that, depending on the distribution of demand among the potential buyers, there could well be greater upward pressure on COE prices. Overall, the evidence suggests that categorisation is often gamed, and as a result, would likely do little more to improve equity considerations. so, for me, it does not offer a substantive way forward, in terms of arresting price increases, even if it could be used to fulfil other objectives.&nbsp;</p><p>The increased pervasiveness of private-hire cars, and their number has grown almost fivefold over the past decade, has also been blamed for rising COE prices.&nbsp;One aggressive solution is to ban PHCs from the COE market entirely, managing their quotas separately.&nbsp;MOT has suggested that there is no evidence to support this argument and has even gone as far as to suggest that doing so, could even drive up costs for consumers.</p><p>Even so, it makes sense to remove PHCs from regular Category A (Cat A) and Cat B bidding. Instead of banning such vehicles from the bidding process altogether, bidders for high-usage PHCs should be allowed to do so in the Open category, but be allowed to pay the respective Cat A or B prices. This is actually the current practice for taxi and cabs and given how PHCs essentially replicate many functions of the taxi \u2013 insofar as road usage is concerned \u2013 standardising the COE treatment for vehicles effectively used for commercial vehicles still makes eminent sense.</p><p>Of course, the practical question is how PHCs may be properly classified, if this were to be the case. I do not think that with rideshare data easily obtainable, that a data-savvy Government such as this cannot successfully make a determination between low-use PHCs \u2013 that is, cars that are only occasionally being operated as PHCs, when they do not exceeding a certain threshold of rides a month for instance \u2013 versus high-use PHCs, which are primarily operated as rideshare fleet cars. PHC drivers will be required to comply with their usage group, much like how weekend cars were restricted. And they will be monitored, by asking ride-hailing application companies to furnish these data. Only high-use PHCs would then be required to bid in the Open category.&nbsp;</p><p>Another strategy is to alter the bid structure. One such suggestion \u2013 which has previously been rejected by the Government \u2013 is to pay for exactly what one bids, instead of the lowest successful bid.&nbsp;Alternatively, bids could be set in terms of percentages of the open-market value of the vehicle. This system, the so-called ad valorem system, has been championed by some academics.&nbsp;Relatedly, categorisations could be altered and pegged not to the, say, cubic capacity or engine horsepower, but market value.&nbsp;Proposals of this nature are reasonable and have the added advantage of making the system more progressive. But, in my view, such proposals will make only a small dent on COE prices.&nbsp;</p><p>What would make the most impact is to smooth the vehicle quota supply by transferring excess quotas from the high-supply years to the low-supply ones, such that quotas are broadly equal across future years. Importantly, this involves more than just the marginal transfers from expected de-registrations that are largely the focal point today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the feast-and-famine nature of the COE market has long been recognised as a problem. What has made this approach even more problematic is that, in low-supply years, high COE prices discourage de-registrations since car buyers need to purchase new COEs at the high prevailing prices,&nbsp;whereas in high-supply years, those who have secured COEs at the high prices have incentives to sell their COEs, pocket the prorated reimbursement value while eating some depreciation, and re-enter the COE market. Both practices exacerbate the supply imbalances.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, the existing practice of reimbursing early de-registered COEs at their the book value should end. We may even wish to reconsider transferability, since there is very little evidence that this practice actually increases speculation.&nbsp;But importantly, transferability should be allowed not to other car owners, but to other cars in the same category, for a given COE holder. This preserves the flexibility for car owners to sell early should their circumstances change, without introducing perverse incentives to game the system.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus far, I had focused mainly on supply-side proposals. What about demand? Hopefully, it should be clear that the enormous variation in COE prices has more to do with known and alterable supply factors, rather than demand, which the data suggests are secondary.&nbsp;But perhaps more importantly, demand effects should be expected to moderate even further in the future,&nbsp;since increases in per capita&nbsp;incomes \u2013 which alter structural demand growth \u2013 should already be expected to moderate, given how we have already attained the status as a high-income country.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, two demand-side proposals merit further consideration. First, dealers should no longer be allowed to bid. There is substantial evidence that speculators bid up COE prices.&nbsp;Because dealers have a greater willingness to pass on costs \u2013 or occasionally absorb loss \u2013 they could contribute to upward price pressure, as some have suggested.&nbsp;Others, to be fair, have argued that dealers have an incentive to keep COE bids low, since they sell cars and COEs in a bundle, and can pocket the difference if COE prices are low.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless, the evidence suggests that dealer intermediation has likely resulted in greater concentration in the distributor industry,&nbsp;and such market power is seldom good for competitive prices. After all, price discovery has already improved substantially with open bidding, thereby diminishing some of the benefits of dealer hand-holding.&nbsp;In my view, the presence of distributors \u2013 despite the benefits of convenience of having a one-stop shop for purchasing a car \u2013 interferes enough with auction prices as to render their exclusion the lesser evil.&nbsp;Better for such distributors to offer advisory and guidance, perhaps, for a fee, than be in a market-making position of collecting and making multiple bids.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, require second car purchases to be in the open category. The inequity of second or third car purchases has bothered many, and one proposal has been to apply some form of additional buyer duty on such purchases, as the Member Hazel Poa has mentioned, under the premise that these purchases \u2013 however small \u2013 could still fuel demand and push up COE prices, as my hon friend Gerald Giam has suggested.&nbsp;While the Ministry has declined to pursue such restrictions, one alternative \u2013 which admittedly would require some policing \u2013 would be to require households seeking a second or third car to do so in a distinct category, thereby limiting their price pressure on Cat A and B.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, I have focused on solutions in the COE market for cars. Even so, I will reiterate what my hon friend Faisal Manap had previously shared about our position on motorcycle COEs. The issues in this category are somewhat distinct, not least because many riders are lower-income and require access not just for private transportation but to make a living. Progressivity should, therefore, be an even greater&nbsp;concern in this market. To this end, one is left to wonder why motorcycle growth is constrained in much the same manner as cars, given their much smaller vehicular footprint.&nbsp;</p><p>I will close, Mr Speaker. I believe that the recent cyclical high in COE prices has come at an inopportune time and has contributed to already rising costs of living. The existing VQS-COE system is broken and, while the Government has made tweaks to the system, these do not address the true underlying problem that has led to boom-bust cycles in COE prices. Let us not ignore the most important driver of supply \u2013 the imbalanced monthly quota \u2013 and some of the most prominent sources of demand, from PHCs and wealthier multiple-car buyers. Let us better manage the COE system, an important driver of rising costs of living, which is consistent with the goals of the original Motion, which I support.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms Tin Pei Ling.</p><h6>5.51 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand in support of hon Member Liang Eng Hwa's amended Motion because, firstly, the amended Motion recognises the challenges that Singaporeans and Singapore face and, secondly, it is a fairer and more accurate reflection of our reality.</p><p>Sir, cost of living is a growing concern that has affected Singaporeans and, most definitely, my residents in MacPherson. Over the past months, a recurring feedback that I received from my conversations with residents, be it during my weekly block visits or Meet-the-People Sessions, centred on the rising cost of living and the consequential pressures they face.</p><p>More residents express anxiety and worry about affording daily living needs. Anecdotally, I have received feedback, especially from seniors, on higher cooked food prices at hawker centres and more residents have approached me to seek Public Transport Vouchers and grocery vouchers, which address their basic living needs and which will free up their cash for other important expenditures.</p><p>As residents feel the pinch trying to cope with basic living expenditures, they start to worry about whether they can still support the broader needs of their loved ones and whether life aspirations, which have been spurring them on, are still within reach.</p><p>These are valid concerns and we can all empathise very much.</p><p>Singapore is not alone in grappling with this issue of persistent rising cost of living. Around the world, countries are witnessing similar trends. Inflation rates are rising and the costs of essentials, such as food, energy and education, are soaring. The factors contributing to this trend are complex and multi-faceted. The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated these challenges, with supply chain disruptions and increased public spending amplifying price pressures.</p><p>As a small country with an open economy, we import most goods and, thus, have little influence over the prices set by others. In other words, we are price-takers.</p><p>While we have little influence over prices, our Government has the capability and duty to cushion the impact on our people and support Singaporeans through difficult times. Ranging from sound fiscal policies, generous but targeted subsidies, purposeful support packages, quality education and skills training aligned to market needs, quality job creation, enabling competition to keep prices reasonable, to timely intervention to curb opportunistic profiteering, these are just some of the actions that our Government can and has taken over the years to help Singaporeans cope with cost of living.</p><p>I will not list the specific measures here, as fellow MPs have already highlighted them before, whether today or in past sessions, but I can share an example of how my resident, Mdm Ho, who is in her 40s, and her family have received Government support.</p><p>Mdm Ho, her husband and four children live in a 3-room flat. The couple are working but do not earn much and, of the four children, one is in National Service, whilst three are still in school. Mdm Ho has eczema that affects her daily life, whilst her daughter and son have medical conditions that require regular treatments at the hospital. Hence, they struggle with cost of living, like any ordinary family in Singapore. In helping them to cope, the children receive various Government support, including MOE Financial Assistance that offered the youngest child, who is in Primary school, free textbooks, uniforms, meal vouchers and transport. The older schooling children receive meal vouchers and school bursaries, on top of the Edusave and CDA monies that they already have. The family also hold blue CHAS cards and receive full Medifund coverage, so, Mdm Ho and her two children are receiving regular medical treatments at no cost at Government restructured hospitals. In addition, up until Mdm Ho found a job earlier this year, the family also received public financial assistance from the Social Services Office. These public assistances are notwithstanding other Government support, such as the GST vouchers and Assurance packages.</p><p>Though Mdm Ho and her family have been receiving various types of Government support covering different needs, there are still moments when they needed a bit more help to make ends meet. So, we mobilised our own local help schemes in MacPherson to help them tide over. These include MacPherson\u2019s utilities support scheme, S&amp;CC support scheme, ComCare vouchers and local bursaries. These are fund-raised by our grassroots to give extra support to our residents and their families.</p><p>I wanted to share this example because, in my opinion, the Government has been providing support to Singaporeans and families and actively responding to the evolving environment with targeted policies and programmes and that communities and individuals, too, can step in to cover last miles and close gaps.</p><p>That being said, the recent intensity of escalating cost of living does necessitate our attention and actions.</p><p>Coming back to my earlier feedback about the increase in cooked food prices, I hope more support can be given to address it, given how fundamental and intrinsically intertwined hawker centres are with our daily lives. I should clarify that the price increase was despite the National Environment Agency (NEA) not increasing rent in most cases. In fact, for one of the hawker centres highlighted to me, there was rental reduction for some of the stalls. In MacPherson, most of the hawkers have been operating there for decades and share a strong bond with our residents, especially our seniors. Hence, they make great efforts to absorb cost increments and avoid raising prices if they can help it. Yet, I have been told that some of them could not help but raise prices by up to 10% this year. If I may warrant a&nbsp;guess, costs must have increased at every layer of their supply chain and the pile up was too much for our hawkers to bear. Still, for a constituency with a mature population and of largely middle- and lower-income profile like MacPherson, a double-digit percentage increase in cooked food prices is highly significant. Hence, there is scope for the Government to evaluate the impact further upstream and see how best to intervene, so that micro businesses like our hawkers can better manage their costs without being compelled to pass it on to the ordinary consumers.</p><p>The Singapore Government's ability to finance increasing social spending to support Singaporeans and families is a testament to its sound fiscal policies, disciplined governance and robust Reserves. Over the years, Singapore has maintained a prudent approach to fiscal planning, with a strong emphasis on balancing the Budget and ensuring sustainable economic growth. Our Reserves also proved to be our most precious asset which saw us through the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 the crisis of our generation.</p><p>Whilst there are obvious challenges that we still face, we have benefited from this Government\u2019s policies in various ways. That being said, we must not undermine the stresses and hardships that ordinary Singaporeans face on a day-to-day basis. So, this Government must continue to pursue policies that will alleviate cost of living pressures on Singaporeans and families.</p><p>Looking ahead, against a challenging macro environment fraught with geopolitical instabilities and economic uncertainties, our Government must also continue pursuing policies that will build a future-ready Singapore and cultivate a resilient, versatile and capable Singaporean workforce, whilst ensuring future generations are free of burden so that they can soar high and live fully.&nbsp;In Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20231107/vernacular-Tin Peiling COL 7Nov2023-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the Motion as amended by Member of Parliament Liang Eng Hwa. The amended Motion clearly reflects the challenges faced by Singapore and its citizens today, and more objectively reflects the reality of the global environment and the Government\u2019s actual actions and intentions in the past, present and future.&nbsp;</p><p>As the saying goes, clothing, food, housing and transportation are the basis of people\u2019s survival and the people are the basis of survival of the country. Clothing, food, housing and transportation are the most basic needs of the people.&nbsp;Against the backdrop of fast-rising prices in recent years, it is understandable that our people are worried about the cost of living.</p><p>Macpherson is a mature estate with a majority of elderly and middle- to low-income residents. Naturally, issues such as food, clothing and shelter have a greater impact on our residents. In the past year or so, in my conversations with residents, I have inevitably felt their pressure in terms of living expenses. We empathise with them.&nbsp;</p><p>Although this is a common challenge faced by the world, for ordinary people, it is a matter of life and death that urgently needs to be resolved.&nbsp;</p><p>In this regard, I believe that the Government will continue to pay attention to people's livelihoods, allocate funds and introduce targeted policies that are beneficial to the people to help them cope with various expenses.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the Government's policies and various assistance programmes, the community, private enterprises and individuals can also show kindness and help those in need.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, there is a 73-year-old Mdm Lim in our consistency. She is a cancer patient and is also the caregiver of her 90-year-old mother. Under normal circumstances, the pressure in terms of living expenses is not small. Fortunately, they live in a rental flat with a monthly rental of $66 , and also receive monthly subsidies from welfare organisations. Therefore, the burden of the living expenses is lighter and the medical expenses are borne by the Government. In addition, we also provide them with assistance programmes and subsidise their other daily needs, and invite them to participate in welfare activities organised by our community partners.&nbsp;</p><p>I do not know how many people have noticed, but I have an observation. In 2011, when I first became a Member of Parliament, I often heard elderly residents saying, in Singapore you can die, but you cannot get sick. I remember during a home visit, I met an old lady who said her husband was sick and bedridden, but because she was afraid of not being able to afford the medical expenses, she would rather let him suffer like that. I was shocked at that time. So, we launched the Macpherson Care Fund to help elderly residents cope with medical expenses&nbsp;and encourage them to receive treatment.&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after, the Ministry of Health (MOH) introduced many policies to help Singaporeans, especially the elderly, to cope with medical and care expenses. The Government also launched the Pioneer Generation Package, the Merdeka Generation Package and now, a package for the young seniors. Every package focuses on healthcare.&nbsp;</p><p>In recent years, although I occasionally meet residents who are worried about medical expenses, I no longer hear the words \"you can afford to die but cannot get sick\".</p><p>Of course, we cannot underestimate the pressures faced by Singaporeans. After all, the world is not peaceful and the global economic outlook is uncertain. We cannot predict how Singapore will be affected and what impacts it will have on Singaporeans. Therefore, the Government must continue to monitor the situation and introduce policies that benefit the people.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to highlight another point. As an open economy with little natural resources, Singapore needs to import almost everything from abroad. In this situation, we are not price-setters and cannot control prices. Some people may think that the Government should forcefully lower prices to benefit everyone, or that the present is more important and the Government can afford it, so it does not matter if we give more now, even if we borrow from future generations or we can use more Reserves. These ideas are dangerous.&nbsp;</p><p>First, the idea of forcefully lowering prices is a one-size-fits-all approach. Those who are economically able will consume more, which may lead to further price increases. Then it is tantamount to drinking poison to quench thirst. On the contrary, the Government's approach is to provide subsidies and assistance based on individuals\u2019 needs and situations. This approach is more fair.</p><p>Second, the idea that it does not matter how much Reserves are used. As the saying goes, there is no perpetual good fortune and no hundred-day blooming flowers. If we recklessly use our Reserves now, who can tell for sure that we will have enough Reserves to cope with difficulties if the world encounters another economic crisis, serious pandemic or natural disaster?</p><p>Do not forget that during the COVID-19 pandemic, we used our Reserves several times and we still have not paid the money back. The savings left by our predecessors helped us through the most difficult times. Similarly, we must also consider the future of our descendants. In short, the Government must strike a balance between the present and the future when formulating policies, and must not kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.&nbsp;</p><p>Our people do face many pressures and the Government must uphold the concept of people first and implement policies that are beneficial to the people and Singapore's long-term interests. I believe that the PAP Government will continue to care for the people and govern with the long-term welfare of the country and the people in mind.&nbsp;</p><p>I support the amended Motion.</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Faisal Manap.&nbsp;</p><h6>6.06 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, my esteemed Workers' Party (WP) colleagues have \ufb01led the original Motion regarding the cost of living in Singapore at a time when many Singaporeans continue to feel the resulting pressures. The impact has been especially severe on lower-income households, which I believe the Government is aware of.</p><p>I welcome the support measures that have been announced to date towards alleviating some of these pressures, such as the top-ups to the payouts under the Assurance Package, the CDC Vouchers, the Public Transport Vouchers and so on. These measures are meant to bolster the existing social safety net.&nbsp;</p><p>The social safety net which exists in Singapore is multi-layered, which the Government referred to previously as a \"kueh lapis\", with each layer meant to tackle a speci\ufb01c area of need. It is an approach meant to prevent dependency, free-riding and abuse of the various measures in place. I also note that Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong had recently said that ComLink would be enhanced towards helping families in non-\ufb01nancial ways, such as coaching. This is meant to aid social mobility and prevent further social strati\ufb01cation.</p><p>Having all these systems in place is well and good. However, I believe it is also important that we establish a means of assessing the e\ufb00ectiveness of our social safety net. To this end, I would like to reiterate a call I \ufb01rst made back in 2014 calling for Singapore to adopt the International Labour Organization (ILO)'s Social Protection Framework.</p><p>ILO's social protection approach calls for a \"fair and inclusive globalisation\" involving an \"integrated set of social policies designed to guarantee income security and access to essential social services for all, paying particular attention to vulnerable groups and protecting and empowering people across the life cycle\". There are four essential guarantees, namely, \"access to essential healthcare for all, income security for children, assistance to vulnerable groups, and income security for the elderly and disabled.\"</p><p>If the Government would prefer a more localised framework, then it is notable that a group of academics led by Assoc Prof Teo You Yenn and Dr Ng Kok Hoe have published two reports on the \"Minimum Income Standard\" for households in Singapore. The latest version was released in September 2023 and provoked discussions in the media and online forums.&nbsp;</p><p>The report has a comprehensive de\ufb01nition for what is considered a basic standard of living in Singapore. It is about having opportunities in education, employment and work-life balance, and access to healthcare. A basic standard of living \"enables a sense of belonging, respect, security and independence, and includes choices to participate in social activities and the freedom to engage in one's cultural and religious practices.\"</p><p>In responding to the report, three Ministries, namely, MOF, MOM and MSF, released a joint statement. In that statement, they noted that what the report described was, I quote, \"what individuals would like to have\". The Government also recapped the various measures that had been taken to address the needs of lower-income households, such as the payout increases for ComCare, the Progressive Wage Model and the Majulah Package. According to the statement, the Government, I quote, \"regularly reviews the scope, coverage and the payout quanta of our schemes.\"</p><p>I believe that the process of reviewing the various layers of social assistance can be further improved. To this end, I would also like to reiterate my previous call for the establishment of three Social Protection steps, corresponding to 30%, 50% and 80% of the median income per household member. Based on the median income per household member of $3,247 released in February 2023, the three steps would correspond to approximately $1,000, $1,700 and $2,600. Broadly, these levels do correspond to the existing thresholds for the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS).</p><p>Using the resulting statistics, I would like to propose again that MSF publish an annual Social Protection Report. The report could include information on the number of recipient households and track movements of households from one step to another, amongst other statistics.</p><p>There are several good reasons for establishing a more systematic approach towards tracking the e\ufb00ectiveness of our social assistance programmes via the Social Protection Report. It would create accountability for the use of public funds in our social assistance programmes. Rather than report on spot \ufb01gures on the numbers of recipient households, the report would present a more holistic picture on the state of social protection and assistance in Singapore.</p><p>The Government could also set objective KPIs based around the Social Protection Report. A vital KPI could be reducing the percentage of households in Steps 1 and 2 within a reasonable timeframe, perhaps within \ufb01ve years.&nbsp;</p><p>If the percentages stagnate or if the report indicates a lack of progress, it could indicate a need to re-examine current approaches and identify gaps in the existing social protection system. For example, some recipient households may be in need of assistance in securing a place in a childcare centre or a student care centre for their primary school-aged children so that the parent can pursue employment without worrying about caregiving.</p><p>The Social Protection Report could also be useful in raising awareness among Singaporeans of the nature of the issues faced by our lower-income groups. This, in turn, could foster better coordination between Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs), non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the Government agencies as they rely on a uni\ufb01ed set of statistics and tracking tools. It may also encourage more individuals who are better o\ufb00 economically to step up and help their fellow Singaporeans in need by volunteering their time, energy or just making donations to aid the work of VWOs and NGOs. Sir, in Malay please.&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20231107/vernacular-7 Nov 2023 - Mr Md Faisal A Manap - Motion on Cost of Living Crisis.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;The Workers' Party (WP) Members of Parliament have tabled a motion suggesting that the Government review its policies with the aim of lowering the cost of living for Singaporeans and their families, especially the lower income group who are more affected.</p><p>In 2014, I suggested that the Government adopt the social protection framework of the International Labour Organization. I would like to repeat the same recommendation to the Government. Through the framework, the Government is able to establish policies that guarantee income security and access to essential social services for everyone, giving special attention to the vulnerable group, and protecting and empowering our people throughout their life journey.</p><p>There is also another framework in the report on Minimum Income Standard published by academics, Assoc Prof Teo You Yenn and Dr Ng Kok Hoe. I am confident that with the appropriate framework in place, we will be able to monitor and review the effectiveness of the social assistance policies for lower-income Singaporeans. I would also like to once again suggest that the Government establish three levels of social protection, where each level matches the 30%, 50% and 80% level of median income.</p><p>I further recommend that the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) publish an annual report on social protection, using information that includes the number of families receiving social assistance, the number of families who have successfully progressed to a higher level, and more. With this information, we can better understand the effectiveness of the social assistance policies that exist in Singapore and also consider the need to change policies so that appropriate assistance can be provided for those in need.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Sir, the Forward Singapore report that was recently released spoke of the risk of our society becoming more stratified and less mobile as our society develops. The Government pledged to do more to ensure equal opportunities to temper unequal outcomes and prevent the creation of a permanent underclass. These are objectives I support as well.</p><p>The Social Protection Framework I have proposed would complement the Government's effort to achieve this objective and track the progress of efforts undertaken towards achieving them.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Senior Minister of State.</p><h6>6.17 pm</h6><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Finance and Transport (Mr Chee Hong Tat)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, cost of living is a major concern around the world.&nbsp;Food and energy prices have risen significantly, caused by disruptions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and extreme weather patterns.&nbsp;</p><p>Many countries were affected.&nbsp;For instance, Germany saw natural gas prices peak in 2022, at nearly tenfold of the 2021 average.&nbsp;While prices have since moderated, they remain significantly above the pre-war prices.&nbsp;India continues to see prices spike across various food items, including essentials like rice and vegetables. From June to August this year, tomato prices surged by 1,400% at some wholesale markets.</p><p>We have experienced price increases in Singapore, too. But, thankfully, not at such magnitudes.</p><p>But we have to acknowledge that inflation has affected all Singaporeans. Families need to spend more when they go to the market to buy groceries or when they have their meals in hawker centres and coffee shops.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My residents in Bishan-Toa Payoh are affected, too, including lower-income families, retirees and couples with young children and elderly parents to support.&nbsp;As MPs and Grassroots Advisers, we understand the pain that our residents are going through, and we feel for them and their families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On top of imported inflation, we also face rising domestic cost pressures.</p><p>We have a tight labour market and low levels of unemployment.&nbsp;Real wages have been rising for workers across the board.&nbsp;We are committed to raising the income and skills of our lower-wage workers \u2013 something I trust Members from both sides of the House will support.&nbsp;Through the Progressive Wage Model and other measures, the earnings of our lower-wage workers have increased faster than median wages.&nbsp;</p><p>But wage growth means higher business costs, especially in more manpower-intensive sectors from healthcare to food services. This has contributed to overall inflation.&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, inflation has peaked and is on a broad moderating path.&nbsp;Core inflation fell from the peak of 5.5% in January this year to 3% in September 2023.&nbsp;It is expected to edge down further to between 2.5% and 3% in December.</p><p>MAS expects the moderation to continue for 2024, with core inflation forecast at 1.5% to 2.5%.&nbsp;If we include the impact of the GST rate increase in January, core inflation for 2024 is projected at between 2.5% and 3.5%.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, the impact of the GST increase is one-off. It should not cause an ongoing increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in future years.</p><p>These are positive signs, but the Government remains cautious because the global situation is uncertain and there are dark clouds on the horizon.&nbsp;Further shocks to global energy and food prices could bring additional inflationary pressures and economic slowdown.&nbsp;There are many uncertainties in our external environment.&nbsp;But what is clear is this: the Government understands the concerns of Singaporeans and we stand ready to support Singaporeans where needed.</p><p>Sir, the Government has cushioned the impact of global inflation on households by adopting an effective multi-pronged approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>First, MAS moved early to tighten monetary policy significantly, substantially strengthening the Singapore dollar.&nbsp;This has helped to contain imported inflation and preserve our international purchasing power.&nbsp;Had we not done this, core inflation this year in 2023 would have been about 2.5 percentage points higher.</p><p>Second, we keep our economy competitive to create good jobs and sustain real income growth for Singaporeans.&nbsp;Between 2017 and 2022, real median income grew by 1.8% per year.&nbsp;Real income at the 20th percentile, that is, lower-income households, rose even faster, at 2.9% per year over the same period.</p><p>Unfortunately, in the first half of this year, median real income declined, even though nominal income rose slightly, as the Senior Minister of State for Manpower updated the House earlier today. This is due to the weaker economic outlook and elevated inflation.&nbsp;</p><p>It is understandable for median real income to have ups and downs, depending on the overall economic performance.&nbsp;But our experience in Singapore is that so long as our economy grows and remains competitive, real income can continue increasing for a broad segment of our workers.</p><p>In the long run, the key to sustaining real wage growth is to raise productivity and upgrade the skills of our workforce, to take on better jobs with higher pay.&nbsp;The Government has invested in many initiatives to support businesses and workers in this transformation and we will continue to do so.</p><p>Third, we ensure that basic needs like education, healthcare, housing and public transport remain accessible and affordable for all.</p><p>Everyone receives some help in these areas, but those with less receive more support. It is a fair and progressive system.</p><p>Even as inflation is moderating at the macro level, we recognise that many Singaporeans feel the pressures from higher costs of living.&nbsp;MPs from both sides of the House have raised this topic in Parliament, reflecting the concerns of our residents.</p><p>To our fellow Singaporeans, the Government hears you and understands your worries.&nbsp;That is why we have been doing more to support Singaporeans, to cushion the impact of rising prices.&nbsp;We review our support regularly and step in to enhance it when necessary to provide additional support, especially for lower- and middle-income families.&nbsp;</p><p>The Government enhanced the Assurance Package in Budget 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>As Members will recall, 2022 saw the fastest rate of increase in prices since 2008, with consumer prices going up by 6.1%, compared to 2021.&nbsp;To help households cope with this increase, the Government enhanced our support from the $6.6 billion announced at Budget 2022 to $9.6 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>This way, we fulfilled our commitment to offset additional GST expenses for at least five years for the majority of Singaporean households and for about 10 years for the lower-income households.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, in September 2023, the Government announced a $1.1 billion Cost-of-Living Support Package. This includes a $800 million enhancement to the Assurance Package, bringing it to over $10 billion.</p><p>Singaporeans will receive the additional support from these packages soon.&nbsp;Every adult Singaporeans will get at least $200 in cash next month. Amongst them, about 2.5 million eligible Singaporeans will get $500 or $800 in cash. And every Singaporean household will receive $500 in CDC vouchers in January 2024.&nbsp;HDB households will also get more help in U-Save and S&amp;CC rebates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Many of my residents, including retirees who are staying in private properties, said they appreciate the additional support provided and look forward to receiving the $800 special payment in December and the $500 CDC vouchers in January next year.&nbsp;</p><p>Through all of these packages, the Government will fully cover the increase in spending by lower-income households this year due to inflation and the GST and substantially cover the increase in spending by middle-income households.&nbsp;</p><p>The Government provided this assurance at Budget 2023 and we will honour it.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, different families have different circumstances and challenges.&nbsp;The broad-based support that we provide will help every family, but we recognise that there may still be gaps for some households.&nbsp;For families who need more help, we have other supporting measures, such as ComCare and the Silver Support Scheme.&nbsp;</p><p>We will continue to monitor the trends closely. As we have often said, we are prepared to do more to support Singaporeans should it become necessary and we will do so in a manner which is fair, effective and sustainable for both current and future generations.&nbsp;</p><p>The Government will continue to do our best to operate key services efficiently and keep costs of providing services as low as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of water, PUB incorporates successful R&amp;D efforts into its operations to reduce costs.&nbsp;For instance, the upcoming Tuas Water Reclamation Plant (Tuas WRP) will generate 80% of the energy it requires for used water treatment, compared to only 25% for the conventional WRPs. This will reduce energy costs and is made possible through enhanced primary treatment of used water and co-locating with the Integrated Waste Management Facility.&nbsp;</p><p>Tuas WRP will also adopt membrane bioreactor technology to produce higher-quality effluent, which can be directly discharged to the sea. This avoids the need to construct a long and deep discharge pipe, which could have cost an additional $650 million.</p><p>But despite our best efforts, the cost of providing key services will be affected by rising inflation, including higher energy and manpower costs.&nbsp;So, the unavoidable question for us is how we want to pay for the cost increases.&nbsp;</p><p>It is fair for these cost increases to be borne by the users and beneficiaries of these services&nbsp;\u2013 if not in full, at least partially, so that they are prudent in their usage. For example, when the cost of providing electricity or water goes up, we do want users to find ways to improve energy or water efficiency and to reduce their consumption.</p><p>Even as some of these cost increases are passed on to users, the Government is mindful that we must keep basic services affordable.&nbsp;For essential services like public healthcare, users only bear part of the cost. When costs go up, a large part of it is paid for by the Government through increased subsidies so that the bills facing users remain affordable.</p><p>When fee increases cannot be avoided, we also provide targeted and direct support for more vulnerable groups in society, such as lower-income and retiree households. Examples would include U-Save rebates and public transport vouchers.</p><p>Sir, it is always tempting to ask: why not have Government simply subsidise the services themselves?</p><p>But we need to remember that the cost increases do not magically disappear as a result. They still need to be paid for, whether by taxpayers today, or by our children and grandchildren in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>We know from the experiences of other countries that subsidising petrol, electricity or water directly causes problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>First, it blunts the price signals and results in over-consumption because there is less incentive to improve efficiency and reduce wastage.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, households will get the subsidies whether they need them or not. Furthermore, the wealthier segments of society are likely to end up getting the larger share of the subsidies, because they consume more.&nbsp;That is what happens when governments give out more subsidies for water and fuel. I am referring to direct price subsidies.</p><p>Who benefits more? It is inevitably the higher-income groups with bigger homes and bigger cars, swimming pools and jacuzzis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So, the way we design our subsidies is important.&nbsp;Instead of subsidising the services themselves or designing tiered pricing schemes, we price the services fully, but give direct help to households that need financial assistance, in cash or vouchers.&nbsp;</p><p>This way, we can target more help to lower- and middle-income Singaporeans. It is more cost effective and we can achieve better outcomes for society as a whole.</p><p>Sir, let me now respond to some of the issues that Members have raised on water prices. I think Mr Pritam Singh would agree with me that water security&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">is a matter of national survival.&nbsp;</span>Today,&nbsp;Singaporeans enjoy an uninterrupted supply of high-quality water. This did not come by accident, but is made possible by long-term planning, innovation and gumption.&nbsp;Our founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew famously said once: \"every other policy has to bend at the knee for our water survival\".&nbsp;</p><p>And that is precisely what happened \u2013 one of the most remarkable achievements in modern Singapore.&nbsp;We now have a sustainable and robust water supply system based on four National Taps. These are imported water from Johor, local catchments, NEWater and desalination.&nbsp;Each of these taps plays a vital role in ensuring a safe and resilient water supply. But each of these taps also faces rising costs.</p><p>To safeguard water security, we need to continue making investments to upgrade and maintain the system, while stewarding our limited resources.&nbsp;Otherwise, the miracle that Mr Lee achieved will be short-lived.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, we must first right-price water to reflect its scarcity and to encourage its sustainable and prudent use.</p><p>I was listening carefully to Mr Pritam Singh's speech earlier I do not think Mr Singh will disagree with me on this point.</p><p>Water is priced to recover the cost of its supply and production and to reflect the cost of producing the next drop of water from NEWater and desalination.&nbsp;Even with active cost mitigation measures by Public Utilities Board (PUB), the total cost of supplying and producing water has increased significantly.&nbsp;</p><p>Singapore cannot compromise on having a high-quality and reliable water supply. It is for our national survival. It is necessary to revise the water price now to catch up with these cost increases.&nbsp;Deferring the price increase now will only result in a widening cost gap, that has to be made up by larger, more significant price increases in future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To cushion the impact of higher water price in 2024 and 2025, the Government will provide eligible Singaporean HDB households an additional $20 per quarter of U-Save from January 2024 to December 2025, or a total of $80 per year for two years.&nbsp;</p><p>The additional U-Save rebates will, on average, fully offset the increase in utility bills for 1- to 2- room flats and about 80% for 3- to 4- room HDB flats and about 65% for larger flats.&nbsp;On average, this translates to 3- to 4- room HDB flats paying about $2 more per month and 5-room HDB and larger households paying about $4 more per month.</p><p>Sir, the WP also suggested having additional tiers for water price.&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, we price water to reflect its scarcity value. This means the same rate is paid by everyone, from the very first drop used by the household, so that all users take into account the scarcity value of water.&nbsp;To discourage excessive use and to send a message to households on water conservation, we set a higher price for water consumption that far exceeds the average household consumption level.&nbsp;And as Mr Pritam Singh pointed out, this threshold is set at 40 cubic metres a month to accommodate most household needs. Over 96% of households consume less than this threshold.</p><p>Having additional tiers below 40 cubic metres would mean that all households, rich or poor, pay a water price lower than its scarcity value for the first block of consumption. Or, if you have even more tiers, then, across the different tiers, the water that is being consumed at the lower tiers will also include a subsidy to the wealthier families that consume more water.</p><p>This would distort the households' incentive to conserve water from the very first drop. It also means that the Government will have to subsidise everyone for water, not just the lower- and middle- income, which is more costly and inefficient.</p><p>Instead, the Government's approach is to price water fully. Then, we provide targeted and tiered support though our U-Save rebates to those who need it most. Lower-income families staying in smaller flats get a larger rebate, as I shared earlier, which effectively translates into a lower price for them.&nbsp;</p><p>Businesses do not receive U-Save rebates. We do not subsidise their water or electricity consumption. Instead, we work with them, including helping our SMEs to be more energy and water efficient.</p><p>Sir, we also cannot have our cake and eat it. If the Government provides broad-based subsidies for all households through a multiple-tier water price, we cannot then also give out U-Save rebates for the same purpose.</p><p>The experiences of other countries have shown clearly that broad-based subsidies can lead to wasteful and ineffective outcomes. The Government is unable, after spending on these subsidies, to have sufficient resources left to provide more targeted help to those who really need it.</p><p>Mr Speaker, the same rationale applies to electricity.&nbsp;We have taken steps over the years to strengthen our energy resilience to ensure supply stability and continuity, and this is an important task that MTI, EMA and the power sector has taken on.</p><p>The tariff, as Ms Sylvia Lim mentioned, should reflect the cost of producing electricity from the first electron. Just as water, we want to price it correctly from the first drop.&nbsp;And then, what we do, similar to water, is we then provide means tested U-Save rebates to help families, especially lower- and middle-income families, give them more help, give them more support.</p><p>Sir, Ms Sylvia Lim's idea of time-of-use pricing is something which we do agree with. And that is why MTI and EMA have also announced an initiative as Ms Lim had mentioned in her speech. This is an accurate reflection of the actual cost of producing electricity during different periods of the day.</p><p>Sir, I would now turn to GST.&nbsp;Overall, we have provided high quality public services to Singaporeans and we have achieved good outcomes for our programmes, and we were able to do so, despite having an annual Budget that is less than 20% of Gross Domestic Product, which is much lower than most advanced economies.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Government's spending needs are rising steadily, especially healthcare costs as our society ages.&nbsp;There is therefore a need to raise revenues to pay for these higher expenditures. We have explained this in the House and also elsewhere many times.</p><p>The Opposition has once again asked if we can defer the GST increase, especially given our higher-than-expected revenues. This too has been debated thoroughly in this House. I think it is important to set out once more the Government's philosophy behind the GST system.</p><p>First, the GST is a critical component of our tax system and we are raising the GST not for immediate funding needs, but for our medium-term needs.&nbsp;This includes rising social spending in areas such as increased healthcare for our ageing population and more support for vulnerable segments of society.</p><p>Second, we design our GST system to take care of the lower-income. In 2012, we made the GST voucher (GSTV) scheme permanent.&nbsp;The GSTV provides bigger offsets to lower-income households.&nbsp;Coupled with the absorption of GST on publicly subsidised healthcare and education, we achieve an outcome where lower-income Singaporean households face a lower effective GST rate than higher-income ones.</p><p>As we had shared in this House previously, the bulk of the GST revenues are paid by higher-income groups, as well as foreigners and tourists.</p><p>Third, we are able to defer the impact of the GST raises because of the comprehensive Assurance Package which benefits all Singaporean households.&nbsp;The Assurance Package will defer the GST increase for the majority of Singaporean households by at least five years.&nbsp;For lower-income households, we will defer the GST increase for them by about 10 years.&nbsp;Since launching the Assurance Package in 2022, we have enhanced it twice to uphold this Government's commitment.</p><p>Sir, we have gone through these points in this House before many times.&nbsp;And while the WP has consistently objected to the GST in previous years, we are glad that at the debate on the President's Address in April this year, the WP has acknowledged the need for a 7% GST.&nbsp;And earlier, I heard Mr Leong Mun Wai saying he also agrees with the 7% GST.</p><p>But the WP and the PSP should be upfront and consistent. It cannot have it both ways, objecting each time the GST rate needs to go up, but wanting to keep and spend the revenues from previous GST increases.&nbsp;The only disagreement, based on my understanding that the Opposition now has, is to ask if we could defer the GST increase, because we have higher-than-expected revenues.</p><p>Sir, I ask the Opposition to please look at the broader and longer-term fiscal trends. We may have had a good year this FY, but we do not have a structural surplus.</p><p>Our fiscal expenditures have been rising steadily and will continue to increase and we are almost certain to face a funding gap in the coming years if we do nothing about it.&nbsp;MOF had published an Occasional Paper earlier this year to highlight this trend.&nbsp;</p><p>We are expecting more social spending, in healthcare for our ageing population and to better support vulnerable groups in Singapore.&nbsp;Without the GST increase and tax measures announced in the last two Budgets, we would not be able to close the projected fiscal gap.</p><p>We have been fortunate to have higher-than-expected revenues in FY22.&nbsp;The Government did not plan its Budget on the basis that we will have these unexpected upsides in revenue collections.&nbsp;These were either sentiment-based revenues which are volatile from year-to-year, or due to higher-than-expected economic growth.&nbsp;</p><p>And when we have these surpluses, the Government has made good use of them by flowing back these upsides to support businesses and households. We have done this during Budget and through off-Budget support packages.</p><p>We also allocated some of these surpluses into Funds for specific needs, such as the ComCare Endowment Fund to provide support to our lower-income families, or the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund to protect ourselves against sea level rises.</p><p>But we should follow through, to raise the GST to 9% on 1 January 2024. We can be confident that households will be amply cushioned by the Assurance Package, while we will have the higher GST rate in place, and can start to collect additional tax from non-citizens and visitors.</p><p>Mr Speaker, I will now turn to transport-related issues, and I will start first with public transport and then I will cover some of the points raised regarding COE.</p><p>Sir, on public transport, we had a session in October, during the Sitting, I think I answered a series of PQs, and I remember having supplementary questions from Mr Gerald Giam as well.</p><p>Sir, Mr Giam spoke about the profits earned by the public transport operators. I had mentioned this previously when we were discussing this issue, and I explained to Mr Giam and the House that we have to look at the different types of public transport service.</p><p>For buses, for example, the revenue that is being collected from commuters does not go to the operators. The revenue comes to the Government, and the Government then pays the operators. We pay them a rate that was agreed through the bus contracting tenders.&nbsp;And I also shared with Mr Giam and the House that over time, as we gain experience in doing bus contracting, we had been able to squeeze out more productivity improvements and reduce the payments and the rate of return for the bus operators.</p><p>For trains, the operators do collect fares to cover their operating costs, so the fares do affect their overall financials. And I shared, during October's Sitting, that in the latest financial year, after accounting for Government grants, SBS Transit reported a loss of several million dollars for their rail operations, while SMRT Trains reported an operating profit of $6 million dollars, which represents a profit margin of less than 1%.</p><p>So, just to be very clear, these are the kind of returns for the rail operations. And I also shared what we are doing, an ongoing process to try and improve the way we do bus contracting, to be able to squeeze out more savings for commuters and taxpayers.</p><p>Sir, Mr Giam had a second point where he mentioned about whether we can nationalise our public transport system. Sir, I think, first, we take a look at where we are today.</p><p>Do we have a well-functioning public transport system overall? I think so.&nbsp;Public transport fares, if you look at the lower-income households in 2013, public transport expenditure was about 3.1% of their household income, it has fallen to 2.4% in 2022.</p><p>So, from accessibility, affordability and also network improvements, system improvements, I think over time, our current system has achieved good outcomes for commuters, and this is also reflected in the overall survey results and ratings that commuters have given us.</p><p>Of course, I am not saying that there are no areas for improvement; there are, and we will continue to look at what we can do to improve. But overall, compared to many other cities, I think, to be fair to our public transport operators and to our public transport workers, who have been working very hard to achieve this outcomes, they have, overall, done a good job.</p><p>So, what Mr Giam mentioned about nationalising, and I think he calls it the NTC, is actually not a silver bullet. I hope Mr Giam can agree with me that nationalising is not an assurance or guarantee that outcomes would be better. Yes, you can take away the profit element if you nationalise and turn it into a Government department, but just because a nationalised entity does not make profits, does not make money, does not necessarily mean commuters will get better outcomes. I think we have to be quite clear about that. What we want, at the end, is to have better outcomes for commuters, to have a better transport system for Singapore.</p><p>Mr Giam also spoke about setting KPIs. Sir, we have seen from the experiences in other countries, how this approach sometimes may not work. I mean, if you look at history. The then-Soviet Union, under the previous central planning system, uses KPIs to try and track performance, and I think that I do not have the elaborate further. I think Mr Giam will agree with me that it is not a good outcome.</p><p>So, KPI is not a substitute for the profit motive that we need and the competition that we need, to spur the players to continuously improve. And we are adding additional pressure on them to improve their productivity. The new fare formula has a productivity component. We will exert pressure on them through this fare formula productivity component, to look at ways to continuously improve their productivity.</p><p>Sir, Mr Giam also mentioned about the coverage of service. I understand, and I think I did explain this to him previously, that when we do some of the changes with the bus services, some of the commuters will be affected, and I do recognise that&nbsp;\u2013 my residents, too, have been affected by such changes.</p><p>But the reason why we make these changes is because we have limited resources available to serve different needs, different groups of commuters. In different towns including, I am sure, Mr Giam's constituency, there will be new developments, new BTO flats, and the residents there will need new bus services to connect them to the bus interchange or to the MRT stations. So, where do we get the resources to serve these new demands? We have to look at how can we re-allocate some of the existing services.</p><p>It is not a simple exercise. We do not do it in a very drastic way because we do recognise the impact. We do it in a very calibrated manner, we look at which are the bus routes that run parallel to MRT lines, and where there is an option for people to take the bus, go to MRT station and then complete the longer part of their journey, the trunk service on the MRT. So, the bus then can provide better connectivity within the town as a feeder service.</p><p>But having said that, I have mentioned this to Mr Giam before and I still make the offer to him today, if there are some specific areas of concern faced by his residents, please do let me know, please do let LTA colleagues know. And we will discuss with you to see what we can do to improve the situation on the ground.</p><p>Sir, allow me to now turn to COE. I want to start by saying that we just had a session on this yesterday. I answered a collection of&nbsp;PQs. I think we took quite some time. And I think Ms Hazel Poa and Assoc Prof Jamus Lim were both present in the Chamber. I do not know whether they heard my reply yesterday, because some of the points that they raised seem to have reflected that they heard me. But again, some of the points that they raised, they may have missed out or maybe they have forgotten what I have said. So, it is okay. Let me please have this chance to address some of the points that they raised.</p><p>Sir, I will start by actually thanking Assoc Prof Lim for acknowledging that&nbsp;\u2014 well, he raised many different ideas. They are all the different fancy ideas for improving the COE system, that in the end, actually only make a small difference, or in his words \"small dent\". And what he feels, if I had heard him correctly, is that the more effective way is to do the smoothening of the supply of the COE.</p><p>Sir, that is exactly what I said yesterday in my reply. We are going to use the \"cut and fill\" method, not \"cut and paste\". \"Cut and paste\" is what you do on Microsoft Word. We are going to do the \"cut and fill\" method, where we \"cut\" the supply from the peak years, and then we fill the troughs, the short-term trough years.</p><p>So, by doing this, we are able to reduce the peak-to-trough ratio and achieve the outcome that I believe Assoc Prof Lim is also advocating for.</p><p>But I also, in response to Mr Saktiandi, gave a qualifier that we cannot overdo this, because you are effectively borrowing supply from the future. These cars that we are now borrowing the COEs from, are still on the roads. They have not yet been de-registered. So, if you overdo the \"cut and fill\", it means that in the short term, in the short run, you do have many more cars and it could lead to congestion.</p><p>So, therefore, yes, we are looking at ways to do more \"cut and fill\" and we have announced increases in the quota for this coming quarter&nbsp;\u2013 35% more than the last quarter for Cat A, 35% more for Cat B, 65% more for Cat C. We are doing that, but we also need to be mindful of the impact if we overdo it.</p><p>But I do thank Assoc Prof Lim for actually agreeing with us, that this is the most effective way to be able to deal with these concerns that we see in the COE market.</p><p>Sir, Assoc Prof Lim also spoke about whether we could, if I heard him correctly, ban PHCs from COE bidding, and I think what he meant was then to have a separate category, because you cannot simply just ban them. I mean, there is genuine demand for these cars, so you cannot just ban them. I think what he meant was to have a separate category that they do not have to participate in the COE bidding with the Cat A and B. There is a separate category for PHCs.</p><p>Sir, I explained this yesterday that, of course, conceptually it is not unthinkable to do something like this, but the trade-off is this: when you create a new category for PHCs, the supply for the COE does not magically appear. We still have to look for where to re-allocate the supply of COEs to put into this new category.</p><p>We are not talking about a magical solution, where I suddenly have new supply coming in. So, if we accept that point, Sir, then we are looking at a re-allocation from Cat A and B when we create this new category.&nbsp;And when we do that, as I explained yesterday, it is difficult to ascertain at what level of the supply should you shift into this new category, because the PHC market is still evolving and there are fluctuations from quarter to quarter, as we can see from the data.</p><p>If you allocate too much, you shift too much, it will actually affect the supply of COEs in Cat A and Cat B, and that will cause prices to spike even further. I think Assoc Prof Lim understands this point. But if you do not allocate enough, you do not shift enough, then there could be a problem for the PHCs, and which will, in turn, affect the drivers and commuters.</p><p>So, this is something that, I think, we have to be quite careful. But, Sir, I did mention in my reply yesterday that we are studying whether there are other ways to address this concern, maybe not through the COE system, but whether there are other ways, taking into account the reality that PHCs do travel more on the roads, a point that Assoc Prof Lim also mentioned.&nbsp;But they also serve a useful role in society, for commuters to meet their point-to-point journeys.</p><p>Sir, Assoc Prof Lim also mentioned about pay-as-you-bid. Sir, this is not going to give a different outcome from the current system. Let me explain.</p><p>Our current system is open bidding. This is not a closed bidding, where I do not know what people are bidding and I just go into the bid without knowing what other people are bidding. The COE system is online, you go in, you can see very clearly what other people are bidding, and you decide then how much you want to bid, based on your willingness to pay and you look at where that bid price is right now, and whether you are willing to pay more than that, to be able to secure the COE.</p><p>So, whether we do pay-as-you-bid, or we do the current system, I think that the outcome will be the same. The second point that Assoc Prof Lim mentioned is, can we use open market value (OMV) instead of other criteria to determine the COE bidding?</p><p>Sir, we already have Cat A and Cat B to sort of proxy measure the kind of cars that people are buying.&nbsp;It is not a perfect correlation, of course, but many of the cars in Cat A do have a lower OMV compared to the cars in Cat B, so I think to some extent, this already achieves that purpose of being progressive.</p><p>But more importantly, Sir, we have the Additional Registration Fee (ARF). So, car ownership is progressive, the COE system has some elements of progressivity, but beyond that, if you look at the car ownership policy as a whole, the ARF is the other tool and perhaps the more effective and more direct way of having a progressive car ownership policy.</p><p>We, only very recently in Budget 2023, raised the ARF for luxury cars. And yesterday, I answered a question that after doing that, the number of luxury cars responding to the policy signals have actually come down.</p><p>I go back to my earlier point that Assoc Prof Lim mentioned as well, that he recognises that all these fanciful ideas are just going to have a small dent&nbsp;\u2013 in fact, I would say a very small dent&nbsp;\u2013 and this is not going to solve the fundamental issues. He agrees with us that the more fundamental approach, the better approach, is to look at how we can do more smoothening of the supply using the cut-and-fill method&nbsp;\u2013 which we are already doing.</p><p>Sir, let me now turn to some of the points that Ms Hazel Poa raised. Unfortunately, she is not in the Chamber right now.&nbsp;Ms Poa asked whether we can have a 0.25% growth rate for Cat D. I think this is similar to the question that the Leader of the Opposition asked yesterday and Mr Murali Pillai also raised in November last year.&nbsp;</p><p>As I had explained yesterday in the House, we have to look at the usage of motorcycles. It is similar to how PHCs are being used&nbsp;\u2013 because it can be dual use. People do use it for their personal use and also to do business, unlike, say, Cat C, where it is predominantly used for business needs.</p><p>But I do acknowledge the concerns that Mr Pritam Singh, Mr Murali Pillai and Ms Hazel Poa have raised&nbsp;\u2013 which is that the buyers of motorcycles tend to come from more lower-income households compared to car buyers. I had mentioned this in my reply yesterday.&nbsp;That is why we have lower ERP charges, we have lower ARF for motorcycles.</p><p>We will look at whether there are other ways to address this concern, to reflect the intent of what Mr Pritam Singh, Mr Murali Pillai and Ms Hazel Poa would like to achieve. But I do not think we should go down the path of having a growth rate because they are quite different from Cat C in that regard.</p><p>Ms Poa also asked about the point-based system. By this, I think what she meant is whether we can do the allocation by giving certain weightage to certain categories of families and buyers.</p><p>Sir, I understand where Ms Poa is coming from, but I think if you think about it in practice, if you are going to implement this idea, it is not so simple in practice.&nbsp;There are many Singapore families who would have a dependent, whether a young child or elderly parent. It would be very challenging to determine who is more deserving of a car. How would the person sitting at LTA be able to decide who is more deserving when all families would have different circumstances and needs?</p><p>Instead, our approach is to make mass public transport affordable, accessible and convenient, and also to complement this with shared point-to-point transport services, including taxis, private hire vehicles and car sharing and through this multi-pronged approach, be able to better meet the needs of our Singaporean families, who may not need to own a car all the time and use it all the time but they may need it during certain times of the week to bring the family out for an outing or to send their parents for medical appointments.&nbsp;If we can create more options for them to be able to use the car without necessarily having to own the car, I think that is one way in which we can help more families.</p><p>For certain categories of families and individuals, for example, persons with disabilities who need a car for their livelihood, we do have a Government scheme called the&nbsp;Disabled Persons Scheme where we waive the ARF, we waive the COE. This is something which we do on a very targeted basis to help these individuals.</p><p>Sir, on the point about&nbsp;foreigners or families who own multiple cars, I have addressed it yesterday, but since Ms Poa brought it up, allow me to&nbsp;explain this point again.</p><p>I shared yesterday that foreigners win about 1% of the bids for Cat A, 4% of the bids for Cat B. If you combine this with what I said earlier about the bidding system, they are not going to be the ones who are going to influence the bid price.&nbsp;Likewise, families who own multiple cars&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;they make up 5%&nbsp;of the total number of resident households.</p><p>So, again, the numbers are not so significant. We do not think that these two categories of buyers \u2013 foreigners and families that own multiple cars&nbsp;\u2013 will be the ones who actually end up driving the COE prices.</p><p>Because of that, introducing something like the ABSD may sound good, may make us feel \"shiok\" for short while, but it is not really going to solve the problem if our concern is about cost of living and high COE prices. It is not going to solve the problem.&nbsp;What Assoc Prof Lim mentioned earlier and what we are doing, the&nbsp;cut-and-fill, that is a more direct way&nbsp;of solving the problem.</p><p>Sir, I just want to end off on one final point on COE before I move on to my next topic, which is what Mr Leong Mun Wai mentioned. I think he may have misunderstood my data.&nbsp;Yesterday, I shared that the&nbsp;percentage of households that own cars has fallen gradually over time, from 40% to about one third now.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe just allow me to clarify, Sir, that this trend has been happening not just in recent times when COE prices are high but even during the time when we have plentiful supply and COE prices were much lower.&nbsp;So, even then, we see the shift.&nbsp;It could be a generational shift. Maybe more people now may not feel that driving is necessary. Or like what I mentioned earlier, they may not need to own a car, they can just use the services of car from time to time when they need it. It could be that maybe they find that the public transport system has been improving over time and they would prefer to use public transport, which is also more sustainable for the environment.</p><p>Whichever the case may be, Sir, this trend has actually been consistent, whether COE prices are high or low. So, I thought I just clarify that point that Mr Leong mentioned.</p><p>Mr Speaker,&nbsp;we have been able to keep our public services and finances sound through this combination of not delaying necessary adjustments while providing needed support to households.</p><p>Even in years when inflation is high, we still have to raise some charges and taxes because it is necessary to do so. It is not prudent or sustainable for the Government to avoid or subsidise every cost increase. Doing so will entail either a high burden on current and future generations of taxpayers or a deterioration of service standards.</p><p>It is not the responsible thing to keep kicking the can down the road or to avoid introducing painful but necessary increases.&nbsp;We may make some people happy by pursuing such policies but when the financing gap starts to accumulate over time, we will make everyone worse off because it will be even more painful to fix the problem later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, the Government's policies should be seen together and not in isolation or piecemeal. The different policies and measures work together as a whole to collectively help ease the cost pressures on Singaporeans without undermining our fiscal sustainability.&nbsp;This is why I support the proposed amendment from Mr Liang Eng Hwa because he is right that the Government should continue pursuing policies that together lower cost of living pressures on Singaporeans and their families.</p><p>Our policies need to be sustainable because we care for Singaporeans now and also for our children and grandchildren.</p><p>I also applaud and encourage the community and kind-hearted sponsors to continue stepping forward with philanthropic donations to help support vulnerable groups in society.&nbsp;There are many ground-up initiatives, including from the NTUC and community groups, which provide local-level assistance to vulnerable residents, on top of Government subsidies. You heard from some of our&nbsp;MPs earlier.</p><p>The CDC Mayors and many of our grassroots advisers do this regularly with community partners and donors. Community and corporations do their part alongside the Government in a whole-of-society effort to support the vulnerable.&nbsp;</p><p>This is our Singapore way&nbsp;\u2013 not just enabling ourselves and our family to do well, but also helping to support others in society so that we can progress together and leave no one behind.</p><p>Mr Speaker, the reality is that global inflation will remain elevated for some time to come.&nbsp;We cannot fully insulate ourselves from these global forces. Prices of goods and services will rise to reflect higher costs.&nbsp;</p><p>If we do what is politically convenient and prevent prices from rising, I am afraid we will create more problems.&nbsp;Giving more price subsidies will benefit certain groups at the expense of others. In particular, we end up helping the rich more than the poor.&nbsp;We will lose fiscal discipline and erode self-responsibility.</p><p>The fiscal deficit that gets created cannot be wished away and the burden will fall on future generations of Singaporeans.&nbsp;In the long run, it will hurt Singapore and Singaporeans.</p><p>Overall, the Government has moderated considerably the impact of inflation on Singaporeans, especially for lower- and middle-income segments, and we have done so on a sustainable basis, spending within our means and helping as many people as possible.</p><p>We will continue to monitor the need for more targeted support if inflation or economic outlook worsens. We will do so while maintaining discipline in ensuring that our interventions are fair, sustainable and effective.</p><p>Sir, we welcome the Leader of the Opposition's call for a review to make sure that our policies are fit for purpose in a new era of higher prices.&nbsp;The Government has been reviewing our policies, including as part of Forward Singapore.&nbsp;Some changes have already been announced, for example, the&nbsp;Majulah Package for young seniors and the new housing model.&nbsp;Existing schemes such as Workfare are being enhanced and new initiatives such as re-employment support&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">have been proposed.</span></p><p>We welcome further inputs into these policy reviews as we chart our way forward, but not all ideas will be feasible or will achieve our shared goals of a fairer and fiscally sustainable system.</p><p>To Members of this House and to all Singaporeans, I want to assure you that this Government will be responsive to the concerns of our people. We will continue to do our best to mitigate cost pressures for businesses and families. Importantly, we will do this in a way that is responsible and right for Singaporeans, today and tomorrow. [<em>Applause.</em>]</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Pritam Singh.</p><h6>7.13 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Speaker, and thank you to the&nbsp;Acting Minister for responding to my&nbsp;intervention on relooking water pricing tiers.</p><p>As I heard him, when he spoke about broad-based subsidies, I was concerned that he may have misunderstood my proposal.&nbsp;As we know, the price of water has three components. That is how it is priced in Singapore. There is the tariff, waterborne fee and the conservation tax. I had not been talking about the tariff and the waterborne fee. I understand they have specific purposes. For example, the waterborne fee is a charge to offset the cost of treating used water and to maintain the public sewage system.</p><p>When I spoke of tiers for water conservation tax, I was not suggesting that, for example, a user at 35 cubic metres per month is going to be charged zero to 10 at one rate, then 10 to 20 \u2013 once you hit 35, if you pay the water conservation tax, that would be tiered for users who consume between&nbsp;30 and 40 cubic metres of water.&nbsp;That progressivity, in my view, would serve the purpose of the water conservation tax, which is to reinforce the water conservation message.&nbsp;That was the suggestion.</p><p>The Acting Minister was talking about broad-based subsidies and the rich also getting subsidised. That was not the focus of what I was driving at. I hope I made myself clear. I will be happy to clarify if the Acting Minister has his queries on this.</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Mr Speaker, I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his clarification. I understand where he is coming from. I think we are all on the same page when we want to look at how we mitigate the impact on lower-income families. We share the same objective.</p><p>The way that we are doing it now, all three components&nbsp;\u2013 the tariff, the water conservation tax and the water-borne fee&nbsp;\u2013 all three components actually add together to reflect the true cost of producing water, the next drop of water.&nbsp;And because of that, we feel that it is better to let this true cost be reflected from the first drop.&nbsp;But then, we help the lower-income with means-tested U-Save rebates.</p><p>So, I think our objectives are similar. But it is just the way in which we achieve it, we may differ somewhat. But I think, with Mr Pritam Singh's clarification, the gap has narrowed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Gerald Giam.</p><p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong>: Sir, I thank Senior Minister of State for responding to my proposals.</p><p>I wish to, first, make a correction to one of the figures I cited in my speech earlier. I said between 2011 and 2022, SMRT and SBS Transit together posted profits averaging $55 million a year and reaching $110 million in the last financial year. The $55 million figure is incorrect. For that date range, it should actually be $74.6 million. So, the sentence, should read, \"Between 2011 and 2022, SMRT and SBS Transit have together posted profits averaging $74.6 million a year, reaching $110 million in the last financial year.\" These numbers are from two companies' financial statements.</p><p>Sir, just some clarifications on Senior Minister of State's response just now.</p><p>I am surprised that the Senior Minister of State is saying that setting KPIs does not work and he cited the Soviets. Surely, he is aware that setting individual and team KPIs is an established practice in many organisations. Even the Ministerial salary framework includes KPIs.</p><p>But my point was that tying an executive's salary to their achievement of performance targets is a better motivator of that executive's performance than a company's profitability. It is also more aligned with commuters' interests.</p><p>Next, the Senior Minister of State said that with our NTC, there is no guarantee that it will get better outcomes.&nbsp;But what we are seeing now is a public transport model that is sucking up Government subsidies while still posting million-dollar profits which benefit shareholders, not the commuters. Can the Senior Minister of State then assure us that the current model is fiscally sustainable and will produce better outcomes in the long run?</p><p>Finally, just one last point.&nbsp;I was not criticising the public transport workers in any way. In fact, I think they are doing a fantastic job in terms of keeping our public transport system working. What I was talking about was the public transport model, not the workers.</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, first, let me thank Mr Gerald Giam for his clarification and showing appreciation to our workers; 4 November is Public Transport Workers' Appreciation Day. So, thank you to Mr Gerald Giam for acknowledging their hard work.</p><p>Sir, the profit numbers that Mr Gerald Giam cited represent the profit numbers for the group as a whole.&nbsp;So, if we look at SBST, for example, they have both local and overseas operations.&nbsp;Locally, they have bus, they have MRT. They also have taxis. They also have other operations. I am sorry, SMRT. I was referring to SMRT, not SBST. SBST does not have taxis. SBST has MRT, bus and also overseas operations.</p><p>So, if we take a look at the total package of the scope of what they do overall, I think those numbers would have to be looked at more specifically when it concerns the component that has to do with fares, because we are talking about fares here. Right?&nbsp;So, there is no point we have an argument about how much money they make with their advertising or their overseas investments. Those are separate. It is part of the numbers that you see as a group.&nbsp;But for the purposes of our debate here, we should be looking at the numbers that are linked to fares.</p><p>And as I explained earlier, Sir, for buses, yes, the profit numbers today that you see reflect some of the older contracts that we did previously.&nbsp;But if we look at the newer contracts, we have, with experience, actually tightened the terms and conditions. And there is now also more competition. We now have four bus operators. So, as a process, achieving savings for commuters and for taxpayers, that will take time to achieve, but we are making steps in the right direction. We are seeing a reduction in the returns for the newer contracts.</p><p>For MRT, I need to highlight that what we are talking about here again \u2014</p><p>I am sorry, Sir, just to reiterate one more point on the bus is that the fares do not go to the bus operators directly. I mentioned this a few times. The fares come to LTA. LTA then pays the operators. So, if we collect less than what we have to pay them, that is actually Government subsidy.</p><p>The trains, I mentioned that the train operators do collect the fares and that is part of their revenue.&nbsp;But if we look at the train operations for both SBST and SMRT trains, the numbers, as I shared earlier, SBST making losses of several millions; SMRT trains making a profit of 1% return, $6 million.</p><p>So, I think we have to look at it in the right perspective rather than look at the macro numbers, which may not be relevant to the discussion that we are currently having with public transport fares.</p><p>On the second point about KPIs, Sir, I did not say that KPIs are not relevant at all. I did not say that. What I said was that KPIs should not be a substitute, because if you only rely on KPIs and nothing else, then you will have a problem. But I do not think that is what Mr Gerald Giam is saying as well. So, we may not differ that much. I think we can both agree that KPIs can form part of the overall performance management tracking, but&nbsp;they should not be the only way of improving performance.</p><p>And in the case of the public transport operations, if we look at buses, for example, one of the reasons why we are able to have better outcomes, partly, I want to give credit to our LTA colleagues. It is because, over time, we do learn how to do the contracting better. But it is also because there is more competition.</p><p>So, if you nationalise, you take away this competition element, you may not actually achieve the same outcomes as what you are able to achieve now. It is an assumption that nationalising, taking away the profit element, means better outcomes for commuters. Need not be.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim</strong>: Speaker, two clarifications from me.</p><p>The first has to do what Senior Minister of State Chee mentioned. He said he wondered if I heard him yesterday. Indeed, I did. And that is why I referred to the cut-and-fill method. But I also wonder if he heard me just now when I also pointed out that the Government action in the cut-and-fill method did not strike me as decisive enough. And by my calculations, it would not move the needle.</p><p>So, if the difference is one of degree, I wonder if the Government will commit to an eventual target of a more or less equal vehicle quota for every year sometime into the future. And if they are willing to do so, how will they actually avoid the existing incentives for individuals to sell COEs in shortage years and to buy them in abundant years. That is my first question.</p><p>The second one has to do with what the Senior Minister of State mentioned about PHC participation in Cat E.&nbsp;Just to be clear, my suggestion was that PHCs should \u2013 it is not that they should not be allowed to bid, but they should be treated the same as taxis rather than being banned altogether.&nbsp;So, on that, I wonder if Senior Minister of State Chee will agree that the common treatment of PHCs as well as taxi cabs makes much more sense than the current approach.</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Mr Speaker, I did explain earlier in my&nbsp;response that, to do cut-and-fill, we have to also be mindful of the trade-offs because we are effectively borrowing from the future.</p><p>So, I did hear the suggestion from Assoc Prof Jamus Lim. Same concept but the Member wants us to do more. And I clarified that it is not that we do not want to do more but there are trade-offs and we need to be careful because, if you borrow too much, you actually may introduce more volatility. Please do not forget that the cars that are being deregistered in future, some of them may want to buy another car.&nbsp;And we are also borrowing from the future. So, you are effectively shifting some of the supply to now before the cars are deregistered. So, you are adding to the short-term congestion.</p><p>So, yes, we accept those trade-offs and we are willing to do some, but to what extent? There is a balance.</p><p>But the more important point is that we do not disagree on the method. We both agree that cut-and-fill to reduce the peak and trough is the more effective way.</p><p>If I may add, Sir, on PHCs, because that is the second question from Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.&nbsp;The injection that we have done, 35% increase for Cat A, 35% increase for Cat B, compared to third quarter, which is injected some already. So, this is in addition to that, we are injecting 35%, compared to third quarter.&nbsp;That number is actually more than for the previous few quarters the percentage of car-leasing companies that were bidding.</p><p>So, if you look at the companies that are bidding PHCs, I shared yesterday that, for Cat A, it is about 21% or thereabouts, it dropped to 16% in the last quarter. Cat B, I shared also that it is about 23% or thereabouts.</p><p>So, what we have injected, 35% for Cat A and Cat B, it is actually more than the bidding, the bids that were won by the car-leasing companies for the past few quarters.</p><p>Of course, I did qualify that I cannot predict how prices will move because that depends on demand, and demand is not within the Government's control.&nbsp;But in terms of planning and injecting, we are doing our best to try and inject as much as we can without affecting the future supply volatility and without affecting short-term congestion on the roads.</p><p>Sir, I think the point about having a separate category, I also explained this yesterday and also earlier. Allow me to just quickly recap.</p><p>It is not that it is undoable. But whether you treat it like taxis or you put it as a separate category, that means, different from taxis, the reality is that you still need supply to come from somewhere, right? You cannot just suddenly have new supply magically appear.&nbsp;It has to come from somewhere. And where would that be? It will be Cat A and Cat B.</p><p>So, if you create a new category, whether you put it together with taxis or you put it separately, you have to move some of the existing supply from Cat A and Cat B to this new category.</p><p>It is not that it is undoable or unthinkable but it introduces complexities because we&nbsp;run the risk of either over re-allocating or under re-allocating and that would have unintended consequences.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms Sylvia Lim.</p><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>: Thank you, Speaker. I have one clarification for the Acting Minister.&nbsp;Does he not agree that when we talk about utilities in the current climate, conservation is a key aspect of it. I think the Government has recognised this. We have seen recent statements about the need to conserve energy and water.</p><p>In this respect, U-Save vouchers, no doubt they are appreciated by the residents who receive them, but it actually does not really encourage conservation of the utilities.&nbsp;So, I am just wondering whether the Acting Minister would agree that we may have to keep an open mind as to whether we need further tools to encourage residents to conserve on the use of utilities.</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Mr Speaker, I&nbsp;am not sure why Ms Sylvia Lim felt that U-Save rebates are not encouraging people to conserve electricity and water.&nbsp;If we look at it from the recipient's point of view, this is a fixed amount, means-tested. But what they receive is a fixed amount. If they consume a lot, actually, the amount of subsidies they receive is still the same. If they consume less, then actually,&nbsp;the amount of subsidies can help them to sometimes even fully offset the electricity bill or to reduce it substantially.</p><p>So, the incentive to want to save is still there because it is a fixed amount. It is not embedded in the price, unlike a price subsidy, whereby if I consume more, actually, I do end up getting a higher quantum of subsidies because it is embedded in the price.&nbsp;In our case, we reflect fully the price so as we incentivise the right behaviour to conserve electricity and water, a point that we both agree. That is important. But the way in which we then provide the help is through the U-Save rebates. It does not distort the behaviour. It does not change the incentive to want to conserve, but it provides the help in a means-tested manner to our lower- and middle-income families.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms Hazel Poa.</p><h6>7.30 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: I would like to seek two clarifications from the Senior Minister of State.</p><p>First, the Senior Minister of State mentioned that the bus fare goes to LTA, not to the bus operators. Can I clarify then who proposes the revision in bus fares? Is it LTA?</p><p>Second, I thank the Senior Minister of State for responding to my suggestions about the points-based system. He mentioned that it would be difficult because there are many families with children and, therefore, a bit difficult to decide. Would he consider a system whereby, say, the bidding price is given a certain number of points, say, every $1,000 is one point, and then every child that the family has is allocated a certain number of points, so that those with more children get more points and those families with people with disabilities (PwDs) also get additional points? And then COEs are allocated based on the total number of points. Would he consider a system like that?&nbsp;</p><p>The Senior Minister of State mentioned the Disabled Persons Scheme (DPS), which I understand is only for livelihood purposes, not for families with disabled people, and for them to move around.</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Mr Speaker, the public transport fares are set by the Public Transport Council. In October, I shared the fare formula and that was also previously announced, and the different components that made up this fare formula. So, it is a very transparent process. There are some indicators that we look at \u2013 what is the national benchmark for wage increases, what is the CPI, what is the energy cost. And, of course, as I mentioned earlier, there is that productivity component to incentivise the operators to want to improve productivity over time.</p><p>Sir, the second point that Ms Poa raised, I think it goes back to the earlier reply that I gave. You cannot run away from some judgement call if you go down a points system because who would be more deserving? It is really going to be very, very difficult to differentiate. If you use the number of children, for example, I have four children, but I think Ms Poa will agree I should not get additional subsidies or priority just because I have four children. So, there are many, many situations that you look at; it is very difficult to then say how many children as the only yardstick or as the only criterion. So, the way that we think about it is this: how do we help the families through different avenues \u2013 not just COE alone, because COE is really more for allocation of a scarce resource \u2013 but how do we help different families who may need the car not all the time, but at certain times of the day or certain times of the week.&nbsp;</p><p>So, one way is to use point-to-point service, and we are doing a review on that; a point-to-point review. I mentioned this yesterday as well. How do we enhance the services for commuters to meet evolving commuter needs? And it will include families that Ms Poa and others have highlighted, where there is a genuine need for point-to-point service and instead of just relying on car ownership alone. Some of them can own a car but some of them may not be able to own a car. Can we help them in other ways? Point-to-point service, car sharing, and I think it takes a whole-of-society approach, not just the Government because for many of these families that need help, sometimes they also receive some help from the community and from voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs). So, it is a whole-of-society effort; that we do our best to support these families.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms Lim, do you have a further clarification? Okay, Mr Leong Mun Wai.</p><h6>7.34 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I think we have gone through a lot; we covered a lot of ground. But as I hear the debate go on, I just felt that probably it is about balance. Policymaking is about balance. So, I would like to ask the Acting Minister two questions with regard to that.</p><p>I think the way the Government conducts policies today, a lot is profit-seeking and using the market model. So, I think, as the alternative parties, what we are bringing to the House is that we hear a lot of feedback about problems. So, the angle must be, besides using the market model completely, there must be more consideration for the social aspects of a lot of the policies. So, let me ask the Acting Minister two questions in relation to that.</p><p>One is, for example, the water price. We know from the statistics provided by the Government that most of the increase in the water demand comes from the big users \u2013 the water-intensive industries and all that. So, maybe the Government wants to make ourselves more competitive \u2014</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Leong, you should just ask your clarification and not make another speech.</p><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong>: \u2014 make ourselves more competitive. So, we want to know whether if we alter the way the water is priced, the Leader of Opposition talked about having another category under 40 cubic metres. Is it possible to have another category, between 40 cubic metres and 80 cubic metres, so that we differentiate and we push the cost more to the big users? Because right now, you look at the water prices we are doing and whenever we need to increase our water supply, we need investments. And so, as a result, the burden of the investments comes back to the average Singaporeans. Do you agree with that? That is one point.</p><p>Second point about the COE, it is the same thing. Cars are a scarce resource. So, we have to allocate that. But if we use the market system, the Singaporeans will be squeezed out of the market very soon, the average Singaporean. So, as a result, do you agree that we ought to see how we allocate this scarce supply of cars, not just by the market price but by the Government coming in? Maybe one of the solutions, do you agree, is to adjust the allocation to, like what I said in my speech, those that go to Cat B, shrink it; increase the supply for Cat A and C drastically.</p><p>Currently, I think it is about 50/50, right? Maybe 70/30? Will that solve the problem? \"Solve the problem\" meaning, will that allow average Singaporeans a better chance of having a car, even going into the future?</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Senior Minister of State Chee.&nbsp;</p><h6>7.37 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Mr Speaker, I first need to say that I reject the way that Mr Leong has characterised the way the Government operates. I think that is quite uncalled for. I just spent a good 40 to 45 minutes explaining our approach to helping Singaporeans cope with the rising cost of living and what we are doing through different ways in a fair, effective and sustainable manner. We can debate about different ideas. We can discuss different possibilities, like what the Leader of Opposition and I have done just now on water. That is okay, Sir. But I reject what Mr Leong has said, that the Government is profit-seeking.</p><p>Sir, if we look at public transport, just now Mr Giam mentioned, if we are indeed profit-seeking, the way to do it is to pass through all 22.6%, as recommended by the formula. Did we do that? No, we did not. We passed through less than one third and we absorbed the rest, because we understand that in this current environment, we do not want to add further stresses on Singaporean families. And this cost the Government $300 million to plug the delta, the 15.6%. And on top of that, every year we give $2 billion for public transport, $1 billion thereabouts for bus, $1 billion for MRT. Again, this is profit-seeking?&nbsp;</p><p>So, Sir, I respectfully ask Mr Leong to withdraw that comment as I think it is not fair and it is not the right way to describe the way the Government operates or to conduct this debate. Can I pause here to ask if the Member agrees to withdraw that comment first before I answer the rest of his questions.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Leong.</p><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I think one of the basic approaches adopted by the Government is still to make sure that public services are profitable. I will stand by that. So, if they want to ensure that the public services are profitable, then it is profit-seeking.</p><p>So, if there are certain industries like the bus services that you cannot make a profit yet, then it might be because that you are still trying out the model. Because this contracting is a new model, when compared to other things. But whereas in the established areas, like water and COE, you definitely have \u2014</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Leong, actually all Senior Minister of State Chee is asking is: are you withdrawing? If you are not, then the short answer is no.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong>:&nbsp;No, I am not withdrawing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Yes, thank you.</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, since Mr Leong has refused to withdraw, I would have to put on record that we reject the way he has characterised the way the Government operates and then I can give many more examples. But in the interest of time, maybe just allow me to comment on one thing.</p><p>Sir, the bus contracting model that Mr Leong mentioned, I do not know if Mr Leong is aware that, at the moment, for bus services, LTA, as I mentioned earlier, provides $1 billion every year because it is loss-making. Almost all the bus services that are running on our roads today are not making profit. They are all losing money.&nbsp;</p><p>Why do we continue to run them? Because they meet the needs of our residents. Because they meet the connectivity, commuting needs of Singaporeans. So, even when the bus service is not making money, we know this is a public good. This is a public service. It is an essential service. We continue to run that service even though it is not making money. And then to make sure that we are able to run this on a sustained basis, the Government then provides the subsidies to the tune of $1 billion for bus and $1 billion for MRT. So, Sir, we are looking for financially and fiscally sustainable outcomes. It is different from profit-seeking.</p><p>Sir, the social aspect in policy formulation, I think it is very much top-of-mind for the Government. If you listen to different generations of Finance Ministers during Budget, there will always be one segment on the economy because we do need to grow the economy to earn a living, to create jobs. But there is always an important segment also on social policies. National Day Rally \u2013 the Prime Minister has always focused as well on different ways of improving our social policies \u2013 housing, education, healthcare.</p><p>So, again, Sir, I reject the way that Mr Leong has characterised the Government's way of working to say that we only care about profits and there is no social aspect in our policymaking. It is absolutely untrue.</p><p>Sir, I now turn to the point that Mr Leong mentioned about water, and I am not sure whether I heard him correctly. He said that we should have a different category from 40 cubic metres to 80 cubic metres. Sir, I explained earlier, and I think Mr Singh also mentioned in his speech, that, today, 96% of households consume below 40 cubic metres. So, I am a bit puzzled why Mr Leong is proposing that we should have a different category between 40 cubic metres to 80 cubic metres, catering to some of this 4% and then to provide subsidies for them.</p><p>I find it quite strange why he is proposing something like this. I thought the right thing to do, Sir, is to price the water correctly from the first drop, starting from the first drop. But we understand that there are different families with different needs, different financial circumstances and we want to then provide more help and support to the lower- and middle-income families. And the way to do this, the most effective way, in our view, is to then provide means-tested U-Save rebates that are fixed in a the quantity, so that if you consume more, actually beyond that, you pay. So, there is a strong element, strong incentive to encourage people to save water. I think that is the better way to do it and not to create a new category between 40 cubic metres to 80 cubic metres.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Leong.</p><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Prime Minister does not think that this is developing into a brawl. But we are just trying to clarify further. So, can I reply to the Acting Minister through you, that one, I did not say that the Government did not consider social factors at all. What I am saying is that, when we are debating here, maybe we are trying to push and say that, let us consider the social factors a bit more? So, as a result, I think the Acting Minister has also misunderstood me.&nbsp;</p><p>What I mean to say is that for water, for example, the water demand is increasing very fast but it is because of the big user. So,&nbsp;recently, when we announced the 18% increase in water price, if we have another category for the bigger user, then maybe the lowest 40 cubic metres do not need to have price increases. Push the price increase to the next category. So, is that possible or not?</p><p>Of course, it will affect the competitiveness of the water-intensive businesses in Singapore but it is unfair for Singaporeans, right? When the big users are the ones who are increasing the demand and we have to put a lot of investment into water supply and then the costs are borne by the smaller user because of the price increase.</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Mr Speaker, I think first, we have to get our facts correct.&nbsp;The demand for water in Singapore is predominantly actually from households. The majority is actually not from businesses.</p><p>So, when we look at businesses, we charge them the full price of water from the first drop and we do not give them any U-Save rebates unlike households. So, that is the difference. Contrary to what Mr Leong seems to have understood, it is actually the other way round. We charge everyone the full price of water from the first drop and then we give means-tested subsidies through U-Save rebates to households, lower-income households getting more but for businesses, they do not get any U-Save rebates. What we do with them is to help them to improve their energy and water efficiency.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Leong, if it is a clarification, I will allow it. Is it a further clarification? [<em>Interruption.</em>] Ms Hazel Poa.</p><p><strong>Ms Hazel Poa</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I like to seek a clarification from Senior Minister of State when he said that the bus services are making losses, can I clarify whether that takes into account advertising revenue from advertising on the bus surface, the panels behind the bus, in the bus, panels at the bus stop, at the bus interchanges, rent from kiosks at the bus stops, at the bus interchanges and so on?</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Sir, the buses are running because they provide an essential service, they are not making money and we are providing subsidies to the tune of $1 billion every year. I do not know which advertising firm Ms Poa has in mind but if you think you can make $1 billion dollars in advertising revenue, please let me know.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Leong, if it is a clarification, yes.</p><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong>: One more clarification for the Senior Minister of State. As far as I know from the statistics, currently the big users account for 55% of the demand, right? The households 45%, right? Is that statistic correct?</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Sir, I am sorry if I mis-spoke and I got my facts wrong. I need to go back and double check this. But if the data is the other way round, I apologise for the factual error. But it does not change the point I was making and I hope Mr Leong can agree with me on that, that we charge businesses and households the true cost of water from the first drop and we do not provide U-Save rebates to the businesses. That part I can confirm and double confirm.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Saktiandi Supaat.</p><h6>7.49 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the amendments proposed by Member Mr Liang Eng Hwa, as they reflect the existing global drivers and efforts so far as well as trade-offs.&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in Malay, please.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20231107/vernacular-7 Nov 2023 - Mr Saktiandi Supaat - Motion on Cost of Living Crisis.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>I am concerned about the rising cost of living that our people are experiencing. Therefore, the issue of cost of living has been a core priority in this House this year, and I, as well as other Members, have previously raised it, together with the impact of high interest rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is evidently front-and-centre in the Government's policy making efforts with the announcement of the $1.1 billion Cost-of-Living Support Package last month, building on the Assurance Package, and other measures announced at Budget 2023. Singaporeans will be receiving at least $400 in cash and CDC vouchers, with lower income Singaporeans receiving up to $800 cash in December 2023. There will also be rebates to manage Service &amp; Conservancy Charges (S&amp;CC) and U-Save rebates.</p><p>Some of the inflationary pressures that Singaporeans are facing are also happening worldwide, due to the Russia-Ukraine war and bad harvests related to climate change, for example, driving up energy and food prices.&nbsp;Not to mention the risks of supply chain disruptions, higher interest rates in a longer environment and the possibility of an escalation of the situation in the Middle East.</p><p>Aside from specific government support through fiscal assistance, which have been very helpful to our people, many Singaporeans may not know that our government and financial agencies actually play a big part in shielding their wallets from some of these economic spillovers. The effectiveness of a strong SGD currency policy, for instance, as result of MAS tightening monetary policy five times in a row, including in two off-cycle moves last year, has enabled MAS to contain imported cost pressures,&nbsp;and some economists such as OCBC\u2019s chief economist is of the view that this will be sustained for several quarters ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;While inflation is still elevated, MAS' five successive monetary policy tightening moves since October 2021 have tempered the momentum of price increases. The effects of MAS' monetary policy tightening are still working through the economy and should dampen inflation even further.</p><p>I am also concerned and have asked many questions alongside other Members in the House about the increase in transport costs including high COE for motorcycles and cars. The Government recognises that some Singaporeans and the Malay-Muslim community rely on motorcycles for their livelihood, and there is a higher proportion of lower-income individuals among motorcycle owners than car owners. This is one of the reasons why the ARS Additional Registration Charges, road tax and Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) for motorcycles are lower than other types of vehicles. To protect against speculative bidding behaviour for Category D COEs, MOT introduced several measures in the last two years. These are very much welcomed. It includes raising the bid deposit for Category D Temporary COEs, or TCOEs, to $1,500; and reducing the validity period of COEs to one month.&nbsp;</p><p>The price of Category D COEs has dropped from over $13,000 in November 2022 and remains at around $11,000 in the recent bidding exercise.&nbsp;The Government has said it will continue to study ways to improve the COE system for Category D, including new ideas. Hence, I am waiting whether they will look at ways to improve this system.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Sir, some of the inflationary pressures that Singaporeans are facing are worldwide \u2013 I mentioned this in my Malay segment \u2013 due to the Russia-Ukraine war and bad harvests related to climate change, for example, driving up energy and food prices. I think many are not aware&nbsp;\u2013 I mentioned in my Malay segment about how MAS policy has helped to mitigate imported inflation.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">&nbsp;According to a study by NUS, Singapore\u2019s food prices are also much less volatile than </span><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">global food prices. This in part is due again to our exchange rate policy accordingly and is helping us in terms of purchasing power in the world market, thereby, providing a greater buffer towards global food price shocks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">As cited by the NUS study, our various policies such as increased local production, diversification of food sources and stockpiling are all working to help insulate Singaporeans from externally driven cost of living pressures, a</span>lbeit the cost of living pressures continued to be there because of global factors.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Speaker, the Government has also rolled out a suite of policies to keep day-to-day costs down, such as HDB\u2019s requirement for all coffee shops leased from HDB to offer budget meal options to diners by 2026.&nbsp;The issuance of CDC Vouchers to households is of special mention </span>\u2013 I mentioned it in my Malay segment as well&nbsp;\u2013<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"> these are complemented at the local level by individual constituencies\u2019 grassroots efforts. I think Acting Minister Chee highlighted that in his speech as well as other Members as well.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I just want to share the experience at Toa Payoh East, at the local level, for example, I launched the Cost of Living Assistance Programme, called CLAP, sometime in the third quarter of 2022, a ground-up initiative working together with hawkers and donors and grassroots to assist lower- to lower-middle income households </span>\u2013&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">we wanted to capture the lower-middle income households </span>\u2013&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">in Toa Payoh East with their daily expenses.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Ground-up initiatives with the merchants and grassroots supported initiatives to assist residents who are affected by high cost of living especially groceries and essentials. I just want to highlight, it is a tripartite involvement </span>\u2013<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"> merchants, residents and Toa Payoh East Citizens\u2019 Consultative Committees (CCC) </span>\u2013&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">to help residents as much as possible and also to make sure that the hawkers actually do have business.&nbsp;This initiative also hopes to bring back some business opportunities to the heartland&nbsp;shops and convenience for residents. So, they get about $100 worth of CLAP vouchers, which can be used to offset their purchase for meals and essentials items at the participating hawkers and heartland merchants. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">The aim is to target low- to middle- income residents, as I mentioned. I think we expect to help up to about 500 families from last September in 2022 when we first launched up to end of this year. So far, we have given out close to about 200 and has benefited merchants and hawkers at Lorong 7 and Lorong 8 Toa Payoh.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">The purpose I am sharing this is to highlight that there are discretionary measures that advisers and MPs can do on top of the ComCare and welfare assistance that are available that the Government has provided to alleviate cost pressures which includes CDC Vouchers, GST rebates and transport vouchers.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I am wanting to highlight that the CDC Vouchers are not means-tested. It is the Government spending about $600 million, I think, if I am not mistaken&nbsp;</span>\u2013<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"> up to about $600 million so far and is not means-tested.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">So, on top of that, we have these discretionary measures that, I think, all the advisers and MPs can </span>undertake in their respective constituencies.</p><p><a href=\"https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/gia/article/food-price-inflation-in-singapore-during-global-food-price-shocks\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"> </a></p><p>Against this global backdrop, Mr Speaker, the Government is also implementing tough decisions for longer-term economic policies and fiscal measures. Acting Minister Chee has highlighted extensively the impact of the increases in the GST and how they matter for Singapore \u2013 carbon tax and water prices, COE quotas, for example, with specific objectives. The main thing is it helps to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability and reduces burdening future generations of Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>These are necessary to achieve other policy objectives beyond just keeping inflationary pressures for Singaporeans' day-to-day lives in check.&nbsp;It is essential that Singapore continues to address our medium- to long-term challenges head on even as we face inflationary challenges now.&nbsp;That is the Singaporean way, and I think Acting Minister Chee mentioned it, that has ensured Singapore\u2019s survival, gelling a very long-term strategic perspective even as we face short-term challenges but with the welfare of Singaporeans taken care of and negative impact mitigated, especially for the more vulnerable groups.&nbsp;</p><p>These policies will invariably lead to price increases in the short term, but ensure fiscal sustainability and environmental sustainability measures are needed now and I think we need to address them now before things get worse in the medium to long term.</p><p>Sir, the current approach to ensure affordability for Singaporeans amid these price increases is more prudent as they also minimise the cost pressures on Singaporeans who are most feeling the pinch in terms of cost of living through measures, such as providing targeted assistance to lower-income groups, providing offsets and subsidies to help ease the burden on households and staggering the implementation of policy initiatives as well as increasing wages progressively for low-wage workers.&nbsp;All these are already mentioned by Members as well as Acting Minister Chee earlier.</p><p>One example I just want to highlight again, as what the Acting Minister has mentioned, is&nbsp;the recent announcement by the Public Transport Council to allow a 7% fare increase in 2023.&nbsp;This is one example reiterating again what the Acting Minister mentioned,&nbsp;one instance where the Government has calibrated the impact of cost of living pressures.</p><p>The Acting Minister for Transport has also explained the recent decisions and the Government's core consideration that fares remain affordable while the public transport system remains financially sustainable. That is quite important and he has shared this with the House last month as well.&nbsp;</p><p>I will not belabour these points. But what is key are actually the 10% reduction in the cost of monthly concession passes, implementation of a new discounted monthly pass for Workfare Transport Concession cardholders and the $50 Public Transport Vouchers for lower-income households. These further measures accompanying the fare increases demonstrate the Government's approach to targeted help in ameliorating cost of living pressures for the lower-income group.</p><p>In general, I am reassured in terms of public transport, that the Government has kept public transport fares affordable.\tPublic transport is already heavily subsidised. The Government is actually spending quite extensively with the additional subsidies to lower the proportion of household income spent on public transport, which has fallen as well.</p><p>Before I go into my last segment and conclude, I just want to reiterate some feedback from residents, highlighting thanks in terms of efforts from MOT and LTA in providing those transport vouchers to residents. Many of the residents have come forward to seek help in terms of transport vouchers. I think that sort of additional help on that front has helped, especially with the recent changes in the monthly passes as well.</p><p>Another example I want to highlight before I end is the additional&nbsp;U-Save rebates announced last month that will serve to cushion the impact of increases in carbon tax and water price.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, the carbon tax itself is something that the WP has also agreed on in this House, that there is a need for Singapore to implement for the sake of our planet and also for our country.</p><p>Over the next two years, the additional U-Save rebates will, on average, fully offset the increase in utility bills for 1- to 2-room HDB flats, about 80% for 3- to 4-room HDB flats, and about 65% for larger flats. This is another way that the Government is making sure that the cost of living pressures on the lower-income households are moderated even when we need to make the hard decisions of implementing such policies at this juncture.</p><p>Mr Speaker, the Government has taken active wide-ranging steps to cushion the impacts of inflationary pressures on ordinary Singaporeans and has helped reduce their vulnerability to price increases through various measures, through monetary policies, fiscal assistance and also at the grassroots and through discretionary measures that can be undertaken on top of ComCare and welfare assistance.</p><p>Ultimately, the global inflationary environment and pressing needs from Singapore society, such as an ageing population, mean that there are multiple fiscal demands that the Singapore Government needs to meet. As a society, we will all need to take on a fair share of these cost pressures where the Government will ensure that it is affordable for the average Singaporean while taking special targeted measures to provide more assistance for the lower-income groups who have heavier financial burdens.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my view that this approach is more prudent than deferring these real demands to future years, which would simply be kicking the can down the road where we do not know if the same or new inflationary pressures would be around. There is no guarantee that we may already have shifted into a new normal of higher prices. In this vein, there may not come a better time to implement some of these policies. Mr Speaker, I support the amended Motion.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Senior Minister of State Chee.</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, I have checked and would like to confirm that if we look at the total water consumption in Singapore, 45% comes from the domestic sector and 55% is from the non-domestic sector. I apologise for my error earlier.&nbsp;Sir, for potable water, the split is 60% domestic and 40% non-domestic.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Xie Yao Quan.</p><h6>8.04 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong)</strong>: Mr Speaker, in Mandarin, please.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20231107/vernacular-Xie Yao Quan COL Motion 7Nov2023-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;Official data shows that since July 2021, which is in the past 20 months, the price of eggs has gone up by almost 40%. Price of chilled chicken saw similar increases. Food and food ingredient prices have gone up by 11%. For F&amp;B establishments, including hawker centres, coffee shops and restaurants, prices have gone up by 12.5%.</p><p>Many residents have told me that the extent and speed of cost-of-living price increases have become unbearable. Previously, you can buy a lot of things with $50 at the wet market, but now it does not buy you much.</p><p>As Members of Parliament, we feel keenly the impact of cost of living on Singaporeans in the past two years. Thus, today's debate is of great significance and precisely because of this, our debate should stick to the facts and analyse the factors behind the rise in cost of living objectively and accurately, and take a realistic approach to alleviate concerns of Singaporeans. This includes various considerations,&nbsp;trade-offs and compromise so as to avoid politicising this issue.</p><p>This is the responsibility that Members of Parliament and political leaders should take upon themselves. The first point I want to make is that GST should not be made the scapegoat of the increase in prices.</p><p>In the last two years, prices have gone up by more than 10% overall, but during this period, GST have gone up by one percentage point. A crucial point is that the Government has increased the subsidies for the lowest-income Singaporeans under the permanent GST Voucher scheme. This will fully offset the impact of GST increase on the 30% lowest-income Singaporeans. This means that the actual impact of GST increase on these Singaporeans is not two percentage points, but zero.</p><p>Even for middle-income Singaporeans, the actual impact of the GST increase is also much lower than one percentage point. Because the Government boldly launched the Assurance Package, the impact will only be felt five to 10 years later.</p><p>This means that the cost-of-living pressure that Singaporeans are experiencing now is due to other reasons, not GST. One key reason is the global market volatility and the rise in global prices. Singapore is a small country and we import many of our raw materials and goods, so we will be inevitably affected by fluctuations in global prices.</p><p>For example, global chicken feed price has increased in the past two years. So, we have experienced an increase in egg and chicken prices. Global oil and gas prices have also increased and directly affected our electricity price, MRT fare and prices of public services. As a small country, what can we do?</p><p>The Government has one major weapon, which is the Singapore dollar. Through strengthening the Singapore dollar exchange rate, we have managed to offset 2.5% of inflation.</p><p>I believe Singaporeans know that the strength of the Singapore dollar did not occur by chance. It is due to the Government's prudent management of the economy and finance. Individually, we can also take steps to cope. In fact, a lot of residents know that domestic prices are affected by the global market. Singaporeans can also take a prudent approach in spending.&nbsp;</p><p>When we talk about inflation, it is actually an aggregate of the price increases of all goods, but in this basket of goods, there are still cheaper choices available. For example, seafood. According to official data, average prices of red snapper and batang have indeed increased by 20% and we have seen this at the markets. But according to official data, the price of sea bass has remained stable during the same period. So, we can eat sea bass instead of red snapper and batang. Savvy saver are still able to save money.</p><p>Another important aspect is the increase in the prices of public services. The cost of public services is also affected by the global market and prices.&nbsp;For the increase in cost, the Government has chosen to increase prices to maintain high quality public services. This is the responsible way.</p><p>For Town Councils, although they are not Government departments, they also provide public services. Thus, the recent increase in Town Council S&amp;CC charges also reflects these increases in cost. This is a responsible way to deal with cost increases. Besides the global market, another factor for the increase in the cost of living is our domestic wages. In particular, I would like to point out the increase in the wages of low-income Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>Increasing the wages of low-income Singaporeans is the aim of the Government's Progressive Wage Model (PWM). This is an important policy. Because of PWM, between 2017 and 2022, the wages of low-income Singaporeans have increased by 2.9% annually. This is higher than the 1.8% annual wage increase of middle-income workers.</p><p>In the next five years, the Government will go one step further and aim to increase the wages of low-wage Singaporeans by up to 80%. This will benefit hundreds of thousands low-wage Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>Sustaining this wage increase of low-income workers at a faster pace than middle-income workers so as to close the gap between the two is something that the Government has put a lot of effort into.</p><p>As a Jurong GRC Member of Parliament, many of my residents have benefited from the PWM. So, I strongly support this policy, but this policy also implies that the overall domestic wage will increase and ultimately businesses will have to increase prices. A crucial consideration is whether Singaporeans support the PWM and whether they are willing to pay a little more so that low-income workers can earn more.&nbsp;</p><p>This also applies to hawker food prices. Hawkers are self-employed persons, so they are not included in the PWM, but they also work hard to make a living. They also want to earn more. After all, other Singaporeans are enjoying wage increases.</p><p>I believe that in the past two years, hawker food prices have increased by 13% on average. This reflects the reality. Hawker food prices have increased not just because food and electricity prices have increased.&nbsp;I have a resident who runs a noodle stall. He recently increased his prices by $0.50. I asked him, \"So, you have increased your prices.\" He said, \"I have no choice.\" What I was hesitant to ask was, actually, \"Others have increased prices and you are only increasing prices now?\"</p><p>So, Singaporeans have to face the same question. Are we willing to pay a little more at hawker centres so that hawkers can earn a little more? Regardless whether they are low-income workers or self-employed persons, Government has another major initiative - Workfare. This provides direct payout to those Singaporeans who earn low income and it helps to supplement their income.&nbsp;</p><p>Through Workfare and PWM, on one hand, the Government directly supplements part of the wage increase of low-income Singaporeans; on the other hand, it guides businesses and consumers to take on part of the increase in cost through market.</p><p>This reflects the fundamental policy of the Government, that is, a small country will always face big challenges. When we are faced with challenges, the Government faces the problem squarely and launches responsible and sustainable policies as there is no free lunch in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>The Government will directly bear part of the cost, while the rest is shared with the people. In the past, we have faced similar challenges and the current issue of cost of living is no exception. In fact, many Singaporeans are aware of this. Many residents have asked me, \"The Government is providing so much assistance. How can it be sustained?\"</p><p>As long as the Government, people and business community continue to work closely together and contribute their part, I believe we can overcome the current challenge of cost of living.&nbsp;</p><p>I support the amended Motion by Mr Liang Eng Hwa.</p><h6><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Louis Chua.</h6><h6>8.17 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I second the Motion as filed by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Pritam Singh. The discussion on the cost of living crisis which we are facing today, is not complete without a review on the state of inflation in the country.</p><p>In its October Monetary Policy Statement, the MAS shared its expectations for Consumer Price Index (CPI)-All Items inflation to average around 5% in 2023, down from 6.1% the year before, and for the inflation rate to average between 3.0% to 4.0% in 2024. In recent months, we have seen inflation rates gradually slowing down over the course of the year.</p><p>The decline in overall inflation rates is perhaps cold comfort for many Singaporeans, as prices are ultimately continuing to rise even amid the high prices we are seeing today. And that this is still significantly higher than what we have been used to in Singapore, double that of the 1% to 2% average inflation rates in the last four decades.</p><p>Even if inflation rates return to lower levels, prices are now permanently higher. With crude prices rising meaningfully since the third quarter, potentially even hitting $150 as the World Bank has warned, food commodities prices threatening to climb even higher if we witness a strong El Ni\u00f1o, and the second order effects on inflation potentially coming through, inflationary pressures could well pick up.</p><p>Interestingly, the MAS expects core inflation to be lower than headline inflation at 2.5% to 3.5% for the year as a whole. Unlike many countries where core inflation is defined as that excluding food and energy costs, Singapore excludes accommodation and private road transport costs, which according to the MAS, and I quote, \u201care excluded as they tend to be significantly influenced by supply-side administrative policies and are volatile.\u201d</p><p>While I accept that the MAS Core Inflation measure is used for monetary policy decisions, a person without knowledge of the technicalities will nonetheless find reports of a return to price stability as being different compared to their lived experience. After all, the CPI is meant to be a fixed basket of goods and services commonly consumed by resident households. And looking at the relative weight of accommodation cost as part of Singapore's CPI basket, it comes in at 21.97% \u2013 the highest single component.</p><p>Moreover, to say that accommodation costs have no direct impact on the monthly cash expenditure of most households in Singapore as they already own their homes, does not take away the fact that especially in a country like ours, which prioritises home ownership. The cost of purchasing a home is a big concern, as it is going to be the single largest expenditure item for the vast majority of households. It is not just any expenditure item, but one that relates to our basic need of providing for shelter and our livelihoods.</p><p>As such, my speech today will primarily touch on housing, and as rightly pointed out by the MAS, is significantly influenced by supply-side administrative policies. Hence, we need to take a closer look at our supply-side policies to ensure prices are well managed.</p><p>Before I touch on housing, back to the October Monetary Policy Statement. The MAS took pains to reiterate that excluding the impact of the increase in GST rates both in 2023 and 2024, inflation rates would be lower. The question then is, why add fuel to fire?</p><p>Layering on a higher GST rate on top of the inflationary environment we see today with the rising prices of many essential goods and services, is only going to make it even more difficult for Singaporeans to cope with the mounting cost of living pressures. Should we not be insulating our people instead of hitting them with more? Even the MAS Chief Mr Ravi Menon has acknowledged the 1% dish point increase in GST, has an immediate impact on inflation.</p><p>This is especially the case where I shared in my speech in Parliament just last month: the Government's fiscal position is shaping out to be much better than projected, with operating revenues now $8.2 billion higher in the first half of the financial year.</p><p>To reiterate, in Budget 2022, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong shared that the GST hike will bring in about 0.7% of GDP in revenues annually, or about $3.5 billion when the full hike is in place in 2024. Even with a one-percentage point increase in the GST thus far, the Government expects GST revenues in FY2023 to be $2.9 billion higher than FY2022.</p><p>In response to my speech, Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat repeated the same response as that shared by Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong in the Budget 2023 round-up speech, where according to them both, \u201cDeferring the GST increase will only store up more problems for the future, leaving us with less resources to take care of our growing fiscal needs and we cannot count on short-term upsides to fund structural needs.\u201d Again, I listen very carefully to what Senior Minister of State Chee has said earlier, but the question here remains relevant. And that is, is deferring the GST hike in 2024, even for one year, when we have already achieved the revenue increase which the GST hike was meant to bring, going to store up more problems for the future?</p><p>Returning to the subject of my speech today, which is on housing costs. Based on the latest third quarter 2023 data, HDB resale prices continued its ascent, up about 1.3% from the last quarter, with the increase higher than the 1.2% quarter-on-quarter increase initially estimated for the quarter. This is despite additional cooling measures introduced more than a year ago in September 2022 involving tighter housing loan criteria and a new wait-out period of 15 months for current and former owners of private residential property to buy a non-subsidised HDB resale flat.</p><p>Compared to a year ago, public housing prices are now 6% higher versus private housing prices at about 4% higher. In each year since 2020, public housing price increases have outpaced that of the private residential market. And cumulatively, we have seen resale HDB prices up by 36%, compared to private residential at 28% since the start of 2020.</p><p>Moreover, it is not like what a Business Times columnist puts it, where he calls on Singaporeans to simply \"stay cool and do not go overboard chasing after million-dollar HDB flats\". While one may argue that the HDB resale market does not reflect the affordability of new BTO flats, ultimately, this will feed directly into the formula for pricing new BTO flats, as Minister Desmond Lee shared that, and I quote, \"When pricing new flats, HDB first establishes their market value by considering the prices of comparable resale flats nearby as well as the individual attributes of the flats, and prevailing market conditions.\"</p><p>Looking at the residential rental market, Minister Desmond Lee is hopeful that in the coming quarters, rental pressures are expected to further ease, as a significant number of residential units are completed, as shared in response to a PQ in September where Member Mr Henry Kwek asked, what more can the Ministry do to moderate or reverse escalating rental cost to help tenants manage their cost of living.</p><p>I agree with the Member's call and have, in March this year, also called on the Government to support Singaporeans intending to rent a house in the open market and to consider mechanisms to moderate rents in the housing market.</p><p>But while rental growth rates have moderated, compared to a year ago, private residential rents are up by 19%, well above overall inflation rates and up by close to 59% over the last three years. While the HDB does not publish a rental index, a comparison of median rentals across HDB towns paints a similar uncomfortable picture. Over the last three years, median rents for a 4-room HDB flat have risen by roughly 35% to 78%. Median rentals for a 4-room HDB flat in Sengkang, for example, is now at $3,200 a month compared to less than $2,000 three years ago.</p><p>While we may say that as a country with close to 90% home ownership rate, those who need to rent form a minority. Soaring rents impact young Singaporeans who have not been able to purchase a flat but need their own space and households who may be particularly vulnerable given their tight financial circumstances and yet do not qualify for a public rental flat as they may be earning a household income of more than $1,500 a month, for example.</p><p>I am cognisant that the HDB website has recently been updated to remove references to any income figure and that HDB takes a needs-based approach and reviews all requests for public rental holistically. The ability to afford other housing options, such as renting from the open market or purchasing a flat remains debatable, in my view. This is especially if households are currently renting in the open market, and cannot afford the high resale prices today. Even if some can eventually secure a BTO flat, they would need a place to call home in the interim.</p><p>Just last month, there were two separate residents who lamented to me that their landlord is raising their rent to beyond their gross household income. In one case, his rent is going up from $1,500 to $2,500 a month, beyond his gross income of $2,200 a month; while in another case, his rent is going up from $3,200 to $4,200 a month and he cannot simply downgrade to a smaller flat due to his household size of eight. I have in January and March 2023, called for support measures for households in need and these cases are just a small subset of many Singaporeans who face similar predicaments.</p><p>Having described the challenges we are facing in the public housing market, I recognise that the Government agrees that there are issues relating to availability and affordability today. Where I believe our views differ however, is on the sufficiency of the current measures that have been taken.</p><p>On housing availability, the Government has reiterated its position that it has significantly increased the supply of BTO flats and will launch up to 100,000 new flats in total from 2021 to 2025. Similarly, I have over the course of a number of speeches, shared that this may not be sufficient.</p><p>Even if the HDB launches 100,000 flats in total from 2021 to 2025, this implies that BTO supply falls 20% from current levels to about 18,400 flats in 2024 and 2025. Moreover, while the average of 20,000 BTO flats between 2021 to 2025 is an increase compared to average of 17,000 flats between 2016 and 2020, this is still 13% below the average of 23,000 flats in 2011 to 2015, during the time when Mr Khaw Boon Wan was the Ministry of National Development (MND) Minister and sought to address the backlog in HDB flats.</p><p>Moreover, while BTO application rates have in 2023 declined to about three times thus far, it remains unclear if the 1.6 times application rate seen in the October BTO exercise is sustainable, or just a result of the first-time introduction of certain specific rules.</p><p>On housing affordability in Budget 2023, the Government has increased the CPF Housing Grant for first-time families to enhance housing affordability in the resale market. As what a head of research at one of the real estate agencies pointed out then, such beneficial effects could be short-lived as it could result in further price inflation, as these could be priced in by the market.</p><p>In addition, with the new BTO classification system from second half 2024, Plus flats will be priced with more subsidies, on top of the subsidies already provided for standard flats today. Again, while the intention is to improve affordability, with the new classification applying only to new BTO launches and not to the existing stock of more than a million HDB units already in the market, the measures could potentially add further upside pressure to resale HDB prices in some of these locations. As reported by CNA last month, prices for flats located near MRT stations or town centres are now higher by up to $10,000 compared to before, according to industry insiders.</p><p>Moreover, there has not been any concrete policy proposals on addressing the needs of those needing to rent in the open market.</p><p>In response to my Parliamentary Question (PQ) in January 2023, Minister Desmond Lee shared that, \"Providing subsidies or grants for renting flats in the open market is likely to induce demand and drive up market rents, which would compound rather than help solve matters. As such, we have no plans to provide such rental subsidies\". Is this not the exact approach that the Government is taking, when providing targeted subsidies to enhance affordability in the resale market? Why the double standards? Especially when it comes to vulnerable families who have not been able to obtain a public rental flat?</p><p>What then should be done to address the issues of availability and affordability today? To put simply, if the fundamental demand-supply imbalance we are seeing today is not sufficiently addressed, the market is simply doing what it is supposed to do. With prices and rents continuing to appreciate, while many Singaporeans are not able to address their housing needs. If the idea is not to crimp the real demand side of the equation since access to appropriate housing and shelter is a basic need for all, addressing these problems would then necessarily require adjustments to the supply side of the equation, for the market to find a more appropriate equilibrium point.</p><p>In other words, we need to increase the supply of HDB flats across both the for-purchase market and also the neglected for-rent market.</p><p>Rather than reduce the supply of BTO flats by close to 20% from 2024 onwards, we ought to ensure that we keep up with the current pace of launches, and this is only just about in line with the average of 23,000 flats from 2011 to 2015.</p><p>As I have shared in my MND Committee of Supply speech, a local academic put it very succinctly, and I quote, \u201cHaving excess flats is actually a feature and not a bug. It just means that if some Singaporean want to get married and wants a new house straight away, there is a house available!\u201d And he goes on further to say, \u201cTo me, BTO is the real culprit behind our uncontrolled fire\u201d.</p><p>Moreover, a lot of the demand from first time home buyers in the resale market today is&nbsp;also a function of the long wait times for a new BTO flat. To take it one step further from&nbsp;ensuring adequate supply, we ought to also ensure that we strive to continue reducing&nbsp;the long waiting times for a BTO flat and build a larger percentage of flats ahead of&nbsp;demand, as I have shared in my MND Committee of Supply speeches over the years.</p><p>After all, if we can build industrial facilities ahead of demand, can we not also build residential homes&nbsp;ahead of demand and have a fundamental re-think of the BTO system?&nbsp;I do appreciate Minister Desmond Lee's assurance that the HDB is planning to launch&nbsp;more Shorter Waiting Time flats, of around 2,000 to 3,000 flats per year by 2025. However,&nbsp;this is essentially at similar levels to the number of such flats launched in the last five&nbsp;years, ranging from about 1,096 in 2018 to 2,850 in 2020.</p><p>In the rental market, it is alarming that while there continues to be a very limited stock of&nbsp;rental flats today, the pace of construction appears to be slowing drastically compared to before. As at FY2022, there were 63,681 rental flats under management, a net increase of about 541 flats in the five years since FY2018. That appears to be a noticeable slowdown&nbsp;compared to the average net increase of 1,640 units per year between 2011 and 2020.</p><p>The pace of development of rental flats is expected to slow down even further, where there are only 900 public rental flats currently under construction and will be completed&nbsp;in the next five years. In other words, just about 180 flats per year. Why are we&nbsp;constructing new rental flats at a pace which is a mere 10% of that in the past decade?</p><p>To minimise the agonising wait for an allocation of a rental flat and to alleviate the worries&nbsp;of many Singaporeans who have not been able to access a rental flat, it is imperative that&nbsp;we do not neglect the housing needs of vulnerable Singaporeans in our pursuit of home ownership as the only acceptable housing model for Singapore. And it is&nbsp;important for us to resume the pace of rental flat construction, to be at least on par with the net increase between 2011 and 2020.</p><p>While the supply side solutions I have proposed to address the current predicament are&nbsp;not new per se, and various WP MPs, including myself, have called for this&nbsp;during the Housing Motion debate and MND Committee of Supply debates in recent years, what is worth&nbsp;highlighting is that demand appears to be much higher than what was previously expected;&nbsp;or at least what I had previously expected.</p><p>It appears that Singapore's population grew at 5% to 5.92 million as of June 2023, the&nbsp;fastest growth rate since 2008. This could partly explain the tightness we are seeing in&nbsp;the housing market today. And while I am not privy to the Government's desired&nbsp;population growth rate, if such growth rates persist, then we could have an even bigger&nbsp;problem down the line with housing supply set to taper off from next year.</p><p>Coupled with the steady decline in average household sizes, it now appears that elevated levels of housing&nbsp;demand are likely to be more permanent than transient, and we need to better prepare our housing market for this reality.</p><p>Finally, as an adjacent point, even if we have successfully adjusted our policies to address&nbsp;the current cost of living crisis, addressing the issue of soaring public housing prices today&nbsp;does bring us to the next logical question \u2013 what will happen when we reset prices&nbsp;downwards?</p><p>The lease decay issue continues to be the elephant in the room, and more than five years&nbsp;since the term \"VERS\" entered our lexicon in Prime Minister Lee's National Day Rally speech in 2018, many unanswered questions remain.</p><p>Even as we debate the issue of soaring housing prices today, we cannot be silent on the&nbsp;eventuality of the value of HDB flats reaching zero at the end of the 99-year lease, as this&nbsp;will simply mean that the higher the rise in prices today, the harder the fall eventually.&nbsp;In Mandarin please, Mr Speaker.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20231107/vernacular-Louis Chua Motion 7Nov2023-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;Although the inflation rate has eased in the recent months, prices remain high and continued to be on the rise for many Singaporeans, and the current inflation rate is still much higher than what we were used to.</p><p>I would like to reiterate that the Government's fiscal situation is currently much better than expected. In this cost-of-living crisis, when we have already achieved the revenue growth expected from the GST hike, will delaying the GST hike until 2024, even only for a year, bring more problems for the future as the Government has said?</p><p>Regarding public housing, the latest data shows that as of June 2023, Singapore's population has grown by 5% to reach 5.92 million. This is the fastest growth rate since 2008. Last year, the number of registered marriages also reached an all-time high in our country's history. If the population growth rate continues, we may face even bigger problems as public housing supply will decrease by nearly 20% from 2024.</p><p>To effectively address the housing problem, we need to adjust the housing supply, so that the market can find a more suitable equilibrium. In other words, we need to increase the supply in the BTO market, as well as the rental market which has been overlooked.</p><p>Mr Speaker, I hope the Government will seriously consider the points that we have raised to alleviate the cost-of-living pressure for Singaporeans.</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms Yeo Wan Ling.</p><h6>8.36 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>: Mr Speaker, we have just come out of a three-year global pandemic and it was not too long ago, that many parts of the world were still completely shut in, logistics lines cut off, and our roads, malls, offices empty. We are now rebuilding our communities, our businesses and our trade links. This is a mammoth task made even more complicated with the ongoing wars.</p><p>As we traverse the new world in the new normal, and as we pick up pieces \u2013 broken families, familiar places now gone, groups dispersed \u2013 we find ourselves in the middle of a hurricane of cost increases and resource shortages. From petrol, electricity and water, to bus rides, cai png and kopi \u2013 indeed, the global cost increases are felt at very local, very personal and very real everyday ways.&nbsp;</p><p>In Punggol, a town of young families, many with upwardly aspirations, my residents have shared with me their concerns over food prices, healthcare costs, utilities and tuition enrichment classes for their children and, of course, the cost of owning a car and property in Singapore. They have expressed their appreciation for GST Vouchers, CDC Vouchers, U-Save Vouchers, Transport Vouchers, bursaries and top-ups that they have received over the years to help with cost pressures.</p><p>For some residents who have fallen on tough times post-COVID-19, perhaps from being retrenched, a business gone south or having fallen gravely ill, help is never too far away with SSO, CDCs, Medical Social Workers.</p><p>For those who have somehow fallen through the cracks&nbsp;\u2013 a single parent, a caregiver wishing to return to work, an undiagnosed special needs adult, our local community welfare teams provide weekly ration packs, monthly essential items, care vouchers and pro-bono services, like legal clinics, respite care and counselling sessions.</p><p>Our Town Council, too, has also formalised a welfare committee assisting residents who have fallen behind on their&nbsp;S&amp;CC fees or needing simple repairs around their homes. Support, of all shapes and sizes, are readily available and always at hand. And yet, in Punggol, I have observed that there are more who are stepping up to support the community instead.</p><p>Indeed, when the going gets tough, the tough gets going! Complementing national level policies, micro-spheres of influence make long-term, impactful differences on the ground. Our micro-spheres of merchants, small businesses, religious organisations, volunteer groups and charities have created a sustainable and wide web of safety nets for our residents.</p><p>I am touched that our temples, themselves reeling from low temple donations during COVID-19, now provide weekly rations to my welfare team, packed full of nutritious goodies to be distributed to our residents. Our temples, churches and mosques give free Maths and Language tuition for our residents, and they doubled their classes post-COVID-19 when demand surged.</p><p>A moral welfare society is now building a free traditional chinese medicine (TCM) clinic to complement primary care in Punggol. All residents across all households and age groups are welcome. Many volunteers at the tuition and TCM centres are retired educators and healthcare professionals, and I appreciate how Singaporeans stepping up to support their communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our Punggol Merchants' Association sprung into action and introduced, with the help of our residents, $3 budget meals at all Punggol Shore food court stalls. One food court operator took it further and partnered with the National Taxi Association with the introduction of a free kopi programme card to address the livelihood crunch that our drivers face. They have since extended this programme islandewide. Such budget meals and kopi programmes are popular and welcomed, and I understand that the MND has introduced budget meals at all HDB-owned coffeeshops. Can we also consider getting privately-owned coffeeshops to also offer budget meals, perhaps through their Merchant Associations?</p><p>With all these examples, I do believe in our businesses and community ecosystems \u2013 to do right for themselves and for our community \u2013 in the face of challenges and pressures, finding the right balance between costs of living and costs of business. Perhaps, instead of looking at this as a tug of war, let us support and help our businesses, our SMEs, our towkays do something that they do best in, and that is selling their goods and services well, and creating good jobs, future-ready good jobs.</p><p>The Labour Movement supports our companies with the upskilling of their workers and the redesign of jobs, so that more pockets of workers \u2013 such as caregivers, women returners&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;can partake in the workforce, and alleviate income pressures at home.</p><p>An example of such a programme is the C U Back at Work, or CUB, Programme that the NTUC Woman and Family Unit has piloted to help mothers and family caregivers to return to the workplace confidently. Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) is key to the program, and companies redesign work hours or locations around the time availability of workers.</p><p>Instead of price cuts and the passing on of costs to just another stakeholder upstream or downstream, FWAs can solve financial stresses for Singaporean families by adding an extra channel of income and help companies with resources and productivity.</p><p>Hence, Mr Speaker, let us help our Singapore businesses do better in what they have set out to do. I call on our Government to reduce business costs by simplifying work and Government compliance processes for our businesses, and to support our companies in job redesign and the upskilling of workers.</p><p>Mr Speaker, true character is shown in times of adversity. And indeed, in the face of global price surges and its impact on everyday life of Singaporeans, I have seen the mettle in our Singaporean businesses, I have felt the kindness in our communities and I have heard the steely timbre in our people's voices.</p><p>As the dust settles, let us continue to be united stakeholders in building our Singapore community, economy and lives with kindness and resolve, even when we have global challenges looms ahead.&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the amended Motion proposed by hon Member Mr Liang Eng Hwa.</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>: Senior Minister of State Sim Ann.</p><h6>8.43 pm</h6><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Ms Sim Ann)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, thank you for letting me join the debate.&nbsp;Acting Minister Chee had earlier shared in detail on how we tackle rising costs \u2013 managing the Singapore dollar to contain imported inflation, ensuring our economy remains competitive to create good jobs and sustain real income growth, and providing support packages targeted especially for vulnerable groups.</p><p>I wish to respond to some specific points raised by Members on topics including housing affordability, cooked food prices and profiteering.&nbsp;</p><p>First, on housing affordability. Members would recall we have had an extensive debate in this Chamber in February on housing affordability and even more recently, there was a major announcement on upcoming changes to the BTO classification framework.</p><p>Before I respond to points made by Members, including Mr Louis Chua and Mr Leong Mun Wai, please allow me to set out the Government's overall approach towards maintaining stability in the housing market.</p><p>As economic conditions improve and wages rise in Singapore over the long term, we expect to see this reflected in a gradual rise in housing values and prices.&nbsp;Sudden shocks in either the public or private housing markets will cause serious problems and even hardship for Singaporeans, and this is why the Government actively uses policy levers to moderate price increases.</p><p>What do these levers comprise?</p><p>First, careful land use planning, coupled with a land recycling strategy, to ensure a steady supply of both public and private housing, to meet Singaporeans' needs.</p><p>Second, pricing BTOs, which by the way, in response to the point made about the five \"C\"s, these BTOs have become more and more similar to condominiums, in terms of build quality and aesthetics. Pricing these BTOs with a view to affordability, not cost recovery.</p><p>Third, demand-side levers for public housing such as grants and priority schemes for various categories of buyers.</p><p>Fourth, maintaining controls on home loan financing, whether through CPF or cash to encourage prudence on the part of home buyers and moderate price increases in the HDB resale and private property markets.</p><p>And fifth, additional measures such as ABSD to cool the overall housing market where necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>Recent housing price movements have been due to specific imbalances which the Government has identified.&nbsp;The first imbalance: our building programme fell behind in the last three years due to COVID and we are catching up.</p><p>To date, HDB has completed close to 75% of the projects delayed by the pandemic and should complete the rest of the delayed flats by early 2025. And we are committed to launch up to 100,000 new flats between 2021 and 2025.</p><p>The resumption of delivery of private housing will also, over time, ease the crunch in private housing and moderate rentals and home prices.</p><p>The second imbalance. HDB resale prices have risen significantly in recent years.&nbsp;This is due to buyers turning to resale when BTO construction was affected by COVID-related delays and shifts in social norms prompted by the experience of the pandemic, contributing to overall increase in housing demand.&nbsp;The catch-up in BTO supply will help moderate demand for resale units as people move into the homes they have booked.</p><p>We have implemented two rounds of cooling measures in December 2021 and September 2022. Coupled with the broader economic climate and mortgage interest rate increases, these have moderated property prices.&nbsp;</p><p>The prices of private residential properties increased by 0.8% in 3Q2023, lower than the quarterly average of 2.1% in 2022. Similarly, prices of HDB resale flats increased by 1.3% in 3Q2023, a figure that I believe Mr Louis Chua also quoted just now. And this is lower than the quarterly average of 2.5% in 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>The third imbalance. This is the fact that mature estate BTOs had presented a specific set of concerns.&nbsp;The price of mature estate BTOs drove much of the ground concern about BTO prices. So, when people talked about BTO prices being a concern, they were mostly talking about the BTO prices that they saw in the mature estates.&nbsp;</p><p>The issue we faced was how to price mature estate BTOs because these are very sought after so that they do not rise out of reach of most buyers and also not in a way that induces its own demand, which is why we announced the introduction of a new housing framework, comprising a new classification of \"Standard\", \"Plus\" and \"Prime\" flats, to take effect from the second half of 2024 onwards.&nbsp;</p><p>The new framework seeks to ensure homeownership remains affordable, including in choice areas, by providing additional subsidies to these flats, but also tighter restrictions, so that they are affordable even upon resale.</p><p>This also helps to keep our system of subsidies fair, while keeping to market principles. This means that we can also maintain a good social mix, even in good locations, because housing will be accessible to a wider range of Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on our ground engagements, Singaporeans are generally aware of and support the new housing framework and its objectives. This will help implementation go more smoothly next year.&nbsp;</p><p>So, measures are in place for each of the specific imbalances causing price increases in BTO, resale and the private housing markets.</p><p>Despite having to tackle these imbalances, we have broadly maintained measures of public housing affordability.&nbsp;In 2022, eight in 10 first time home buyers of BTO and resale flats had a Mortgage Servicing Ratio (MSR) of 25% or less upon key collection. This meant that they could finance their monthly instalment with CPF, with little to no cash outlay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Government will continue to monitor closely and adjust policies whenever necessary. And I am glad that Mr Louis Chua acknowledges our housing moves. However, he seems to think that we have not done enough.&nbsp;I noticed that Mr Louis Chua had co-authored a piece in January this year, saying housing in Singapore is affordable. Perhaps, he no longer thinks so.&nbsp;But I am glad that he agrees that the fundamental issue with housing affordability is one of supply, not policy.</p><p>Supply was indeed disrupted due to COVID.&nbsp;But we are catching up with the backlog.</p><p>Mr Louis Chua seems to think we should build more. In fact, HDB is already doing all it can on the supply side. We have also activated more levers on the demand side, for instance, by prioritising BTO flats for young married couples.</p><p>Through catching up on supply and managing demand, we are stabilising the housing market and there are signs that this is happening.</p><p>Launching 100,000 flats from 2021 to 2025 which I mentioned previously means a commitment of 20,000 flats per year.&nbsp;And prior to 2019, HDB launched about 16,000 to 17,000 new flats per year, a figure that Mr Louis Chua had also noted.</p><p>But at that time, the WP thought that was too many and said so. Now, we have 20,000 flats per year and it seems the WP thinks it is too few.&nbsp;So, I have to ask what figure does the WP propose? And should your higher number be adopted and if the market comes down due to over-supply, then, what will your party be saying then?</p><p>I notice that Mr Louis Chua appeared to express some puzzlement about where all this demand for housing is coming from and he seems to want to link this to population increase.&nbsp;In fact, Mr Louis Chua should know because we have brought this up, we have mentioned this during the debate on the housing Motion in February this year. We have been building HDB flats faster than the HDB population growth.</p><p>And, in fact, the average number of persons constituting each HDB household has been going down. This is the decrease in household size that Mr Louis Chua has also noted.&nbsp;</p><p>And what is the cause of this reduction in household size?&nbsp;One factor, and I think this is a long-term one, has to do with the fact that we have heard the housing aspirations of singles and we have, over the years, progressively provided more housing options for the singles so that there are more housing types that they can buy, be it on the resale or the BTO market. And, in fact, we have further open this up with the new BTO classification framework that was announced.&nbsp;</p><p>Given rising rates of singlehood, even if the population were to remain completely static, demand for housing is going to increase over time because the reduction of household sizes is set to continue. This is the reason why I seek Mr Louis Chua and the WP support for all our levers on both the demand as well as on the supply side. Please support us in having a robust recycling strategy for our land in addition to having careful land planning.</p><p>Let me now turn to some points that Mr Leong Mun Wai has repeated. These are familiar points because he has also raised them during the debate in February.</p><p>He talked about the PSP's proposal of an \"Affordable Housing Scheme\". And as far as I can make out, the affordable housing scheme tries to do a few things.&nbsp;It seeks to achieve dramatically lower BTO prices by leaving out land cost at the point of first purchase, while seeking to assure existing homeowners that their home values will not be destroyed via a crash in the resale market and avoiding being seen as raiding the Reserves. These are the three aims.</p><p>However, the first aim is simply incompatible with the second and the third aims, which is why the proposal was met with considerable scepticism, from Members of this House as well as the public.&nbsp;</p><p>More importantly, the affordable housing scheme does not address the specific imbalances in the housing market that the Government has already responded to and identified. For example, dramatically lowering BTO prices is likely to trigger even more demand, especially in the very popular prime areas, instead of moderating demand. On the other hand, the Plus/Prime model which we have announced will address this concern.</p><p>I now turn to Mr Leong Mun Wai's mention of his Millennial Apartments scheme and I would also like to address some points that Mr Louis Chua has made about addressing the rental market in flats.&nbsp;</p><p>I say this to Mr Leong Mun Wai and Mr Louis Chua. Let us listen to what younger Singaporeans want.&nbsp;MND and HDB have been engaging Singaporeans at large but also younger home buyers or prospective home buyers. And most of the younger Singaporeans we have engaged indicated a preference to own their own homes; own rather than rent.</p><p>So, we are not closed to new ideas. We have, indeed, been hearing inputs from Singaporeans about alternative typologies of housing but we also have to recognise that the very strong desire for home ownership is present within Singaporeans and we will have to prioritise building for home ownership, not so much building for rent, especially if we are talking about people of middle-income.&nbsp;But we will, first, make sure that there are still public rental options for those who are unable to attain the goal of home ownership.</p><p>Also, we are ramping up supply for the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS). We will have close to 2,000 PPHS flats at the end of this year and we seek to double this to 4,000 by 2025.</p><p>In terms of how the rents are moving in response to the various measures that have been undertaken, I would like to share that private and public housing rents are showing signs of stabilising.</p><p>In the second quarter of 2023, the increase in private and public housing rents moderated to 2.8% and 3.0% respectively, as compared to 7.2% and 4.4% in the previous quarter and we expect this to further ease as more homes are completed and become ready for their owners to move into.</p><p>Allow me to move onto concerns raised by several Members, including Mr Leong Mun Wai, Ms He Ting Ru, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Ms Yeo Wan Ling and Mr Xie Yao Quan on food, especially cooked food.&nbsp;</p><p>We had proactively launched the Budget Meal initiative in 2023 to increase the availability of affordable food options in HDB estates, especially for residents who need them.&nbsp;</p><p>These budget meal options are typically lunch or dinner meal options that are priced affordably and are comparable to meals sold at lower price points at nearby eateries, including HDB coffee shops or hawker centres.</p><p>We have observed that rental coffeeshops leased under the Price-Quality Method (PQM) tenders typically provide budget food options with prices at around $3 to $3.50, across different estates.&nbsp;I should add at this point that operator proposals for PQM tenders that include healthier food options are already given more points and more favourably considered under the quality criteria. So, I want to thank Ms He Ting Ru for supporting this idea. We are already doing it.</p><p>Currently, some 114 HDB rental eating houses offer budget meals and drinks. And by 2026, budget meals will be offered at all 374 HDB rental coffeeshops. Members of public can use the BudgetMealGoWhere site to find out what budget meals are offered at HDB coffeeshops near them. HDB also puts up decals at participating coffeeshops to help residents identify the participating stalls more easily.</p><p>However, while we help residents with their cost of food, we are also mindful that rising costs affect everyone, including coffeeshop operators and stallholders.</p><p>To ease the transition for them, HDB has also offered a rental discount of 5% off the market valuation-based renewal rents for a period of one year from the time of the tenancy being renewed, subject to verification that the new budget meals and drinks have been implemented.&nbsp;</p><p>In the spirit of partnering Singaporeans under Forward Singapore, we soft-launched an effort last month to crowdsource the public's recommendations and verification of budget meals in coffee shops across the island.</p><p>Using the CrowdTaskSG portal, the public can be part of this nation-wide pilot campaign called the Great Budget Meal Hunt by submitting information on affordable meals they would recommend to others or by verifying the details of a budget meal listed on the BudgetMealGoWhere site.&nbsp;Over the past week and a half, we have received 245 recommendations of affordable meals and 319 verifications across 91 coffee shops. We welcome Singaporeans to contribute actively to this initiative.&nbsp;</p><p>While the current budget meal initiative only applies to coffee shops rented out by HDB, there are also sold eating houses that are privately owned. HDB is studying regulatory options to require budget meals to be provided in these sold eating houses. This includes making the provision of budget meals a condition for the renewal of use of the outdoor refreshment areas&nbsp;\u2013 an idea that Mr Murali Pillai had raised previously.</p><p>We will continue to work with coffee shop operators to find sustainable ways to offer affordable food options to residents.&nbsp;</p><p>Some Members have also raised their concerns that businesses may take advantage of the inflationary environment to raise prices exorbitantly.</p><p>The Government takes a strong stance against profiteering and will not hesitate to take action if there is a case to be made. To date, the Committee Against Profiteering (CAP), which I note Ms Hazel Poa also sits in, has received over 350 feedback submissions, of which 32 cases have been found to involve GST misrepresentation and which have been resolved.</p><p>If Mr Leong has concerns about GST misrepresentation, in other words, a business unjustifiably raising prices by attributing it to GST increase, he can make a submission too to the CAP.</p><p>However, there is also broad recognition also that many businesses are facing rising costs, as Mr Mark Lee has pointed out, including the cost of utilities, manpower, rental and raw materials, and some may need to raise prices in order to remain viable. These could include our hawkers and SMEs.</p><p>The best safeguard against profiteering is healthy competition. We have a robust system in place to remove impediments to competition and encourage a diversified supply chain, which help to ensure that businesses compete fairly and that consumers have sufficient choices.</p><p>The Government keeps a close watch on the prices of essential goods and services, especially during this challenging period, and will not hesitate to investigate anti-competitive behaviour. Should a member of the public come across such egregious cases, they can report this to the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) and the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE).</p><p>If Ms Hazel Poa, as she said in her speech, felt that the scope of the CAP that she sits on is not sufficient for possible upstream cases of price rises to be investigated, I think CCCS would be glad to hear from her with regards to specific details and investigate them.</p><p>To further help Singaporeans make better purchase decisions on essentials, CASE has developed an app Price Kaki to compare the prices of items sold at supermarkets. To address potential concerns about shrinkflation, CASE has introduced a unit pricing feature this year on Price Kaki to help consumers more easily compare the prices of products with different package sizes and across different brands.</p><p>Specifically, on business rentals, Ms Hazel Poa had suggested releasing guidelines on fair rental prices.&nbsp;</p><p>The Parliament has passed a Bill mandating that tenants and landlords of qualifying retail premises comply with the leasing principles set out in the&nbsp;Code of Conduct for Leasing of Retail Premises in Singapore. This is to ensure industry-wide consistency in leasing principles and practices to provide certainty to landlords and tenants and set out a dispute resolution process that is affordable and expedient.</p><p>The Act will take effect in early February 2024 as sufficient time has to be given for the industry to transition to mandatory compliance. The code will be reviewed and updated as necessary, based on feedback from industry players.</p><p>Let me now turn to some points on supporting persons with disabilities and caregiving that Mr Gerald Giam had raised.</p><p>We empathise with the challenges of those who need additional support, such as caregivers and persons with disabilities.&nbsp;I beg your pardon, I think it was Mr Dennis Tan who raised these points.&nbsp;</p><p>To Mr Dennis Tan's points, I would like to clarify that financial support schemes for caregivers such as the Home Caregiving Grant or the&nbsp;Migrant Domestic Worker Levy Concession do not just apply to caregivers of disabled seniors but persons with disabilities too, including care recipients with autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability.</p><p>Similarly, all Singapore residents have basic health insurance coverage for life, regardless of pre-existing health conditions. MSF has also recently increased funding to adult disability homes and day activity centres in 2021. Mr Speaker, in Mandarin, please.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20231107/vernacular-Sim Ann COL 7Nov2023-Chinese (MND).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;Mr Speaker, cost of living is an issue that touches the lives of all. We have experienced high inflation for the last few years due to the dislocations in the global economy caused by the pandemic, conflict and geopolitical tensions.&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, inflation is moderating, but we recognise that many households still feel the pressure from cost of living. That is why the Government has enhanced the Assurance Package to help everyone cope better. We try our best to operate public services efficiently and to keep costs low. However, cost is inevitable as things still cost money. When costs go up, despite our best efforts, they still have to be covered.</p><p>For essentials, some of it will be covered by Government subsidies, for example, healthcare and public transport costs, but not all. Some part needs to be paid by consumers. Some consumers will need help with this. We will provide them targeted direct help if need be, for example, U-Save rebates and public transport vouchers. And those who need more help will get more support.&nbsp;This is much better than subsidising the product directly or having tiered pricing schemes because that is more expensive and less effective.</p><p>Overall, we have provided high quality Government and public services to Singaporeans. The Government Budget is less than 20% of the GDP, which is much lower than most developed countries.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, the Government's spending needs are rising steadily, especially in healthcare.&nbsp;</p><p>The GST increase is essential for this. There is no good time to do it. But through the Assurance Package, the Government has effectively delayed the impact on most citizen households while getting the new rate implemented and the additional revenues flowing. For example, the bulk of the GST revenues are paid by higher-income groups as well as foreigners and tourists. While the Government is helping most Singaporean households, the higher-income groups as well as foreigners will contribute more to Government revenue.</p><p>Through this combination of not delaying necessary adjustments while providing needed support to households, we can keep our public services and finances sound while helping Singaporeans going through a difficult time</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the point that was just raised&nbsp;\u2013 I believe it was by Mr Louis Chua&nbsp;\u2013 on delaying GST increase for one or two years on the basis that finances have been better than expected.</p><p>We are actually doing much better than that. With the Assurance Package, we have delayed the impact of the GST increase for the majority of Singaporean households by at least five years and by about 10 years for lower-income households.</p><p>In conclusion, we recognise the impact of inflationary pressures on Singaporeans. Many are cutting back on spending while we ride out the economic uncertainties. We empathise with these challenges and we will do more, if necessary.</p><p>But, we have to do it right. This means: one. preserving market principles and not over-regulating <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">\u2013&nbsp;</span>to allow the market to allocate resources and determine price so that we can have an efficient, productive economy while intervening decisively where market failures exist; and two, fiscal sustainability \u2013 to intervene prudently so as to remain responsible to future generations.</p><p>In the longer term, the only bulwark against inflation is to remain competitive, to grow the economy and to achieve wage growth for all. This is the sustainable and sensible way ahead and this Government is committed to this mission.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the amendments to the Motion raised by Mr Liang Eng Hwa.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Louis Chua.</p><h6>9.11 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I thank the Senior Minister of State for the response to my speech. I just have a couple of clarifications.</p><p>But before that, I do need to highlight that I think all of us agree here that policy-making needs to be dynamic. As what the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Pritam Singh, has said in his opening speech, we need to ensure that our policies are reflective of the circumstances today and tomorrow versus the past.</p><p>In this regard, I also acknowledge and agree with the Senior Minister of State when she shared that the reduction in household sizes is a key factor in driving housing demand. I also note that just in the last five years, you see that the average household size has come down very rapidly from about 3.5 to close to about three.&nbsp;</p><p>I agree that even if the population remains static, that is going to be a significant source of demand, but the population is not static.</p><p>At the same time, the uncertainty I was expressing is that if you look at the population growth rate today, that appears to be a step up, not just in percentage. If you look at it in absolute terms, I think the number is close to about 280,000 or 290,000 persons' increase in the last one year versus the increase of about 28,000 to 29,000 in the last five years' average. prior to COVID-19.</p><p>I think this is also a big question mark&nbsp;\u2013 as to what then is the forward looking policy when it comes to the incoming net migration, because as far as I understand, our total fertility rate (TFR) is at an all-time low. I think a lot of the new housing demand is also driven by the population policies.</p><p>At the same time, as I shared in my speech, we are looking at a record high number of marriages. I think that was recently reported in the last one to two months. That appears, again, to be a step up in the housing demand versus what we have seen in the past decade or so.</p><p>All these factors, put together, would suggest that perhaps, if we look at housing demand, that appears to have stepped up versus what it was previously. I agree with what the Senior Minister of State has shared earlier. So, the clarification&nbsp;\u2013 two clarifications here \u2014</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: It is a rather long preamble.</p><p><strong>Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis</strong>: Sorry, the two clarifications here is that I understand that the Government has ramped up the supply of BTO flats, but I am still not sure as to why when it comes to rental flats, there is a significant reduction in the pace of increase.</p><p>Secondly, can I check with the Senior Minister of State to confirm if she believes that we have already cleared the backlog of demand from prior years?</p><p><strong>Ms Sim Ann</strong>: In response to Mr Louis Chua's questions, first of all, in terms of backlog, I have shared that we are in the process of clearing the backlog and that HDB has delivered close to 75% of the COVID-19 delayed projects. This will continue and we seek to get back on track.</p><p>Not only do we seek to get back on track, we do recognise the need to have a buffer. This is also something that Members have talked about. It is something that we do agree with. We see the need for a buffer. This is also the reason why we are seeking to ramp up supply of Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS) flats. We know that this is very important to Singaporeans who are waiting for key collection.</p><p>In terms of population growth, we have discussed population growth in this House over the years. I do not propose to go over it in detail. Suffice to say, we have seen that in the last few years, due to COVID-19, that has caused very sharp fluctuations in population. I believe that the sharpest growth post-COVID-19 and the reopening of our economy in terms of non-citizens actually would be the category would not be living in our HDB flats, particularly, the migrant workers.</p><p>But overall the Government is planning to ensure that through our land use planning as well as making sure that we have got all the supply side and demand side factors in place to ensure a steady supply, both of private as well as public housing.</p><p>And I thank Mr Louis Chua for also agreeing on the observations that I have made.</p><h6>9.16 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: I made these remarks yesterday, but I notice that today there are more Members who are in this House. I am going to repeat my remarks that I made yesterday. Which is that in the past, Members have taken this opportunity for raising points of clarification to make mini speeches before asking their clarification. As I highlighted yesterday, there have been occasions where one such mini speech exceeded five minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>So, I want to remind Members that under Standing Order 48(3), no Member other than the mover \u2013 and in this case, it is Mr Pritam Singh \u2013 is allowed to speak more than once on a Motion.</p><p>Making a point of clarification or asking supplementary questions are not the occasions for a second speech. I will certainly allow some leeway for Members to explain their point of clarification or make your question intelligible, but I ask Members please, for your cooperation and understanding, to observe the Standing Orders and to keep your points of clarification and questions concise and to the point.&nbsp;Mr Leong Mun Wai.</p><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Speaker. I have two clarifications for the Senior Minister of State.&nbsp;One, the HDB recently reported a $5.38 billion dollars deficit. A lot of this&nbsp;is probably due to the subsidies given to the BTO buyers because HDB paid $5.9 billion to the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) at the same time in the same year.</p><p>Sir, I have two questions:&nbsp;will this deficit $5.38 billion ultimately be paid by the Singaporean taxpayer?&nbsp;And two, when the Plus and Prime flats come into operations, will this deficit actually go up higher?</p><p><strong>Ms Sim Ann</strong>:&nbsp;Actually, I am very glad that Mr Leong seems to have come round to the idea that there is a deficit in our building programme and the deficit is made up by the subsidies that are given to Singaporeans; so, the answer is yes, these deficits are taxpayer-funded. That is why much as we would like to be as generous as we can, we also need to be responsible. We need to be good stewards of public resources and we have to run the public housing building programme with sustainability in mind.</p><p>As to whether or not with the Prime and Plus going forward whether there will be more subsidies, I think that is not something that we can determine just simply by the introduction of the framework alone. But the intention of the framework is to streamline demand, streamline demands so that people would make quite prudent choices and it will emphasise the principle of owner occupation and what I can say to Mr Leong is that the subsidies will be very well used.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms He Ting Ru. You did raise your hand, right? Yes.</p><p><strong>Ms He Ting Ru</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Just a really quick clarification. I thank Senior of State for mentioning under the HDB PQM framework. I just wanted to make a quick clarification that in my speech, I was asking for more consideration and weightage to be given to outlets and restaurants that actually offer healthier options. I was not saying that it was not already being done. but I think the point is well taken.</p><p><strong>Ms Sim Ann</strong>: I think on the principle we are not disagreeing and I happened to share Ms He Ting Ru's passion for healthy food so this is certainly something that we will look into. But we also have to balance against the other relevant considerations for quality because after all, coffee shops do serve a wider range of consumers and residents. And people have different preferences for what they want to see in the coffee shop.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Leong Mun Wai.</p><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have one more clarification for the Senior Minister of State. So, comparing with our Affordable Home Scheme&nbsp;\u2014 of course, there will be issues that we still need to discuss about the Affordable Home Scheme. But the current Government home scheme, do you agree that it has led to high HDB prices? At the same time, every BTO flat, not only the buyers pay for the land cost but all Singaporeans have to pay for the deficit?</p><p><strong>Ms Sim Ann</strong>:&nbsp;I am afraid the nature of Mr Leong's question is not very clear.&nbsp;Could Mr Leong rephrase his question, Mr Speaker?</p><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong>: Mr Speaker, sorry about that. What I mean is that I am trying to compare our Affordable Home Scheme with the current BTO scheme of the Government. Of course, there will be some disadvantages, some problems, some issues that we need to overcome, but I think the Affordable Home Scheme's problems can be overcome too.</p><p>So, we are making a policy decision here. The current BTO scheme has led to&nbsp;increasing prices of the BTO, because you have to incorporate the rising land cost. As a result, it has led to rising HDB prices.&nbsp;Secondly, every BTO flats need to be financed by HDB and it creates a deficit which, ultimately, is paid by all the Singaporeans.&nbsp;So, there are two disadvantages of the current BTO scheme.&nbsp;Do you agree to that?</p><p><strong>Ms Sim Ann</strong>: I am afraid I will have to answer Mr Leong's question with a question of my own. He has not made clear how his Affordable Housing Scheme does not result in the outcome that he claims the BTO scheme has created?</p><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is only fair that Senior Minister of State answers my question first and then I will answer her question.</p><p><strong>Ms Sim Ann</strong>: As with every Government scheme, when circumstances evolve and change, it does prompt a review. However, I think that the comparison that Mr Leong is asking me to make is a spurious one because the Affordable Housing Scheme, as I have said before, is one which I do not think has convinced Members of this House or even many members of the public because it seeks to reconcile three quite incompatible aims.</p><p>It seeks to dramatically lower BTO prices by&nbsp;leaving out land costs at the point of first purchase. But&nbsp;perhaps&nbsp;his party is worried that the scheme will be rejected outright by homeowners who are worried about a crash in the resale price so it tries to assure people that it does not do. And then also,&nbsp;the scheme seeks to avoid being seen as a raid on the Reserves. But as I have said these three aims are not compatible because by taking land cost out at the point of first purchase actually that already has an impact on the Reserves.</p><p>This topic has been covered quite extensively over more than a day of debate in this House, so I do not propose to go through it again. But I do not see how I can make any meaningful comparison from between a scheme that has worked, and which requires adjustments from time to time to meet changing circumstances and evolving demand, with a scheme which, as far as we can tell, is actually not able to be internally consistent and is not one that has&nbsp;been convincing to both Members of this House and the public.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: If I may, actually this topic was subject to a debate in a previous Sitting for which we came to a conclusion. Let us come back to the Motion at hand and let us confine our clarifications to the speeches relating to the Motion proposed by Mr Pritam Singh.&nbsp;Mr Leong.</p><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is exactly because of that, I am not asking for a revisit on the pros and cons of the Affordable Home Scheme. I am just saying that based on what the Senior Minister of State has said, does she agree that the current schemes has got these two disadvantages: one, HDB prices will continue to go up as long as land cost goes up; two, and when the&nbsp;Government or HDB sells the BTO flat, there will be a subsidy and this translate into HDB deficit and this deficit goes to the budget and all Singaporeans have to pay for it?</p><p><strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan</strong>:&nbsp;A point of order, Mr Speaker. We have debated this time and again. We should not be wasting time on revisiting this debate over and over again. It is a waste of everyone's time. So, can I ask Mr Speaker to make a \u2014</p><p>Mr Leong Mun Wai:&nbsp;Point of order, Sir. A point of order, Sir.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Leong, sit down first. Let Mr Lim make his point.</p><p><strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan</strong>: So, can I invite Mr Speaker to make a decision on this so that we can move out of this debate. Otherwise, we will be going back to issues which we have debated over and over again, and now resurfacing yet again.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Actually, I did say this. I thought Mr Leong was going to make a different point of clarification.&nbsp;I will allow one last response if Minister of State Sim Ann wants to make it; and then I am going to move on.</p><p>Senior Minister of State Sim, would you like to respond to that last clarification by Mr Leong?</p><p><strong>Ms Sim Ann</strong>: I think Mr Leong is tying himself up in knots because if he considers the increase in housing prices over the years as a disadvantage of the scheme, is Mr Leong saying that prices must remain static in order for the housing market to be considered favourable and in order for our housing policy to be considered a success? In which case, I think Mr Leong did not pay attention when I explained that with&nbsp;favourable economic conditions and growing wages over time, we do expect to see a gradual increase in home values and prices.</p><p>So, it seems to me that Mr Leong is tying himself up in knots and I am not convinced that members of the public will agree that static prices over the long term is what the housing policy should be aiming for.</p><p>The second way in which he is tying himself up in knots is that by posing this question about deficit, the deficit incurred by HDB, to me, it seems to me that Mr Leong is denying that housing should be subsidised at all. If you want to subsidise any product, be it housing, be it education for that matter, defence, street lighting, these are public goods that are provided.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of housing, it is not 100% subsidised by Government; there is some payment from home owners. But the subsidy from Government and by extension taxpayers is very substantial; and therefore, it seems to me that Mr Leong's line of questioning will inevitably lead him to conclude that there should not be any subsidy.</p><p>So, I really think that for both Mr Leong's good and for the House's good, I think we should pasue this because Mr Leong, you are leading yourself down a path of no return.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Let me remind all Members of Standing Order 50, which relates to the point I made earlier. Can I invite Mr Pritam Singh to make your closing?</p><h6>9.29 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, thank you to all in the House who have spoken on this Motion.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, I will get straight into it.&nbsp;The Workers' Party (WP) rejects the amendment proposed by Member Mr Liang Eng Hua Hwa. We have no substantive quarrel with Amendment No 3, which does not substantially change the thrust of our Motion.</p><p>A careful examination of our proposals today would show that they would neither undermine Singapore's fiscal sustainability nor would they unduly burden future generations.</p><p>However, we disagree with Amendment Nos 1 and 2.</p><p>Amendment No 1 which states that \"cost of living is a global concern\" reads as an attempt to minify the role Government can and should play to reduce cost of living burdens on Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>While global factors are important, these should instead prompt a review of existing policies with the view to relieve cost of living pressures.</p><p>We also disagree with Amendment No 2 and its use of the words \"continue pursuing policies\". The use of the word \"continue\" suggests to us, at least, that the status quo is fine. We disagree.&nbsp;Indeed, we have proposed specific structural changes to the system that we believe will work better than current policies.</p><p>The WP Members of Parliament have made concrete proposals in several areas.&nbsp;We urge the Government to conduct a comprehensive review of its policies to better support Singaporeans and their families during this cost of living crisis.</p><p>On the electricity front, Member of Parliament for Aljunied GRC, Ms Sylvia Lim observed that the need for Singaporeans to conserve energy is more urgent than ever, given the risks of high prices and supply shortages caused by conflicts around the world.&nbsp;She recounted the Government's answer to managing household electricity bills, was the open electricity market. But the dramatic failures of retailers in 2021 has cast doubt on the viability of the open energy market to bring down household electricity bills.&nbsp;She asked the Government to look again at her earlier suggestion of tiered electricity pricing and to also consider lowering charges for consumption during off-peak hours.</p><p>Staying on utilities and specifically water prices, my contribution to this debate was my calling on the Government to review the price structure of water for both domestic and non-domestic consumers. Such a review would have the objective of creating a more fairly tiered structure that promotes water conservation and potentially lowest cost for business and many households.</p><p>Aljunied GRC Member of Parliament, Mr Faisal Manap, reiterated the call he made in 2014 to the Government to establish a means of assessing the effectiveness of our social safety net. Back then, he proposed that Singapore adopt the International Labour Organization (ILO)'s social protection framework. He suggested that if the Government prefers a more localised framework, the Government should then look at the minimum income standard published for households in Singapore, reports that have been published by local academics led by Assoc Prof Teo You Yenn and Dr Ng Kok Hoe.&nbsp;The Government is not precluded from publishing its own list of basic needs and those extras required for thriving in Singapore as a way of tracking outcomes for Singaporeans.</p><p>Sengkang GRC Member of Parliament, Ms He Ting Ru's speech covered several keynotes in health and the health and care ecosystem where the Government can and should be working harder to control the cost of healthy living in Singapore. Her speech reflects the WP's concern about the effect by increasing cost of care is having on the physical and mental well-being of families and calls for more support in areas like mental healthcare and intermediate and long-term care.&nbsp;For instance, she called for MediSave annual limits to be increased in line with medical inflation.</p><p>Hougang SMC Member of Parliament, Mr Dennis Tan asked for the current means testing in healthcare to be improved upon to better account for an individual's financial situation and health conditions so that healthcare can be more affordable and accessible. He called for help to be given to more Singaporeans who may need more assistance, even though they may be adjudged not to be eligible based on present household income or annual value of their home, especially when they are not able to receive financial assistance from members of the same household.</p><p>He called for more help to be extended to adults with special needs or other forms of disability who are in the working adult age group, but who are unable to work and require part-time or full-time care from family members, especially in families where the parents are getting on in age.&nbsp;More help should also be extended to family members responsible for their caregiving.</p><p>Sengkang GRC Member of Parliament, Mr Louis Chua reiterated his call for the Government to defer the GST hike in 2024, with even one year being a helpful deferment, especially when the Government has already achieved the revenue increase which the GST hike was meant to bring.&nbsp;</p><p>On housing, he called for the Government to increase the supply of HDB flats across the for purchase market and also the neglected for rent market, especially as our population growth and housing demand appears to have stepped up.&nbsp;To ensure all Singaporeans can access appropriate housing and shelter, addressing the fundamental demand-supply problem would necessitate adjustments to the supply side of the equation so that the market can find the appropriate equilibrium.</p><p>On private transport, Sengkang GRC Member of Parliament, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim called for changes to the COE system that would rationalise high prices. He explained why expensive COE affect not just households that may have very legitimate need for cars, such as families with children or the disabled, but also everyone that books a taxi or PHC.</p><p>He stressed the importance of smoothing out the vehicle quota supply across the years and seizing the practice of reimbursing early deregistered COEs at their book value.&nbsp;He also suggested prohibiting dealers from bidding directly for COEs and treating private hire cars in the same manner as taxis are, which is to have them bid in the open category albeit paying Cat A or Cat B prices.</p><p>On public transport, Aljunied GRC Member, Mr Gerald Giam called for a National Transport Corporation to be established as a publicly owned non-profit land transport planner and operator of all MRT, LRT and trunk bus services.&nbsp;This will allow the early profits of the current public transport operators to be redirected to benefit commuters by mitigating fair increases and providing free transport for the elderly and people with disabilities.&nbsp;He explained how the NTC could bring about significant productivity gains and economies of scale when compared to the current public transport model.</p><p>Mr Speaker, some of these proposals by the WP will be revenue-neutral. Others will result in increased expenditures.</p><p>Sir, at the National Day Rally this year, the Prime Minister shared with the public that the new classification system for HDB flats into Prime, Plus and Standard from the existing mature and non-mature classification, would see the sticker price of an $877,000 5-room BTO flat in Ang Mo Kio, for example, come down.</p><p>The question is how would this reduction in price come about? Would it be from the Chief Valuer relooking at how land is priced for public housing, or as should be assumed, from an increase in taxpayer subsidies from HDB flats, drawn from the yearly Budget?</p><p>The reality, Mr Speaker, is that the Government will look to lower HDB prices through the deployment of taxpayer dollars. Inevitably, it is a taxpayer that is going to foot the bill for a larger HDB subsidy to make HDB flats cheaper. And this is an amount that the Government believes it can absorb without an increase in taxes. Otherwise, it would not have pursued the new HDB BTO classification system.</p><p>In the same spirit, Mr Speaker, the WP believes that we should continue to look beyond short-term relief in addressing this cost of living crisis and to relook at prevailing orthodoxies on other schemes so as to lower cost for Singaporeans and their families.</p><p>A few other proposals will put&nbsp;cash in the hands of vulnerable workers and seniors to help them navigate their way out of this difficult period, for example, by reviewing with a fresh perspective, both MediSave, as well as the Workfare Income Supplement.</p><p>A few other proposals may prompt behavioural shifts towards greater efforts to reduce wastage and more sensitivity to sustainable usage of utilities, such as water and electricity.</p><p>At their core, all the proposals prompt the Government to relook at its legacy policy with an eye on battling the cost of living crisis that Singaporeans find themselves deeply mired in.</p><p>Mr Speaker, it has been a long day. But I would like to thank all Members, including the office holders, PAP Members of Parliament, PSP, Non-Constituency Members and the Single Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) for participating in this important Motion. I may not have referred to all of you in my roundup speech but I thank you for your participation.</p><p>The Workers' Party will vote in favour of the original Motion and reject the amended Motion for the reasons I have provided earlier in my round-up speech.</p><h6>9.39 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Are there any clarifications for Mr Pritam Singh? I do not see any.</p><p>We have now come to the conclusion of the debate and I shall put the questions to the House for a decision.&nbsp;We have three amendments proposed by Mr Liang Eng Hwa. We will deal with the amendments first.</p><p>Amendment No 1 is, \"In line 1, after the words 'That this House' to insert the words 'acknowledges that cost of living is a global concern, and'\".</p><p>The question is, \"That Amendment No 1 be made\".

(proc text)]</p><h4 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Enhancing Public Rental Housing for Human Thriving</strong></h4><h6>9.43 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would first like to extend my gratitude for Members of the House who are able to stay despite a very long Sitting today and for lending me their presence and attention to this issue.</p><p>Mr Speaker, a hallmark of this Government's commitment to its people is the Housing and Development Board (HDB) policies and how it aims to meet every Singaporean's housing needs.</p><p>I am pleased with the recent housing policy announcements that make housing more accessible to more diverse groups of Singaporeans whilst also enhancing the subsidy schemes that strive to make our housing system a fair one. Today, I would like to address our public rental housing and to highlight the potential we have of transforming it and harnessing it to catalyse the social mobility of our lowest income Singaporeans.</p><p>In recent years, the Ministry of National Development (MND) has taken the step to incorporate and integrate rental flats into build-To-order (BTO) purchase blocks, such as the ones in Marsiling and Bukit Batok. This is a bold move that I support.</p><p>I know itis not an easy decision, as I am aware that there are pockets of Singaporeans who hold quite contrary views and who are concerned that having rental units within their blocks could cause a devaluation of their flats.</p><p>Nevertheless, I am glad the Government chose to do the right thing by prioritising social mixing and integration over political popularity. This addresses the larger social good, especially with emerging trends and threats of social polarisation along class lines that our society is facing. All Singaporeans need to support this effort, if we truly believe that each one of us are our brother's keepers.</p><p>To uplift those struggling with their lives, there is more our public rental housing can do beyond just providing a roof over heads.&nbsp;In my speech today, I make a case for enhancing public rental housing to enable human thriving.</p><p>In past Parliament Sittings, I sought statistics from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and MND on how long it takes for the average rental housing family to move out to their own purchased flats. The answer is seven years.&nbsp;</p><p>My hon colleague Ms Mariam Jaafer also sought information on the rate of transition by rental flat families to their own homes in the last five years. The statistics were: 36% moved to their own houses in less than five years, 32% in five to 10 years and a good remaining 32% after more than 10 years.&nbsp;</p><p>What if we can improve these statistics by enabling more families to achieve social mobility and home ownership sooner?</p><p>I invite this House to consider and urge MND to study the role of space and aesthetics in helping rental flat families achieve financial self-sufficiency and social mobility quicker. We can do this by reimagining and redesigning rental flats to help occupants unlock their full potential.</p><p>I invite this House to go on a design thinking journey&nbsp;with me to understand how <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">space and aesthetics&nbsp;</span>in our living environment actually have a profound impact on human functioning and thereby can aid with social mobility.</p><p>Firstly, on the role of space and well-being.&nbsp;From my conversations with healthcare providers at Woodlands Health Campus and Yishun Health, which we collaborate with in the community, data from our healthcare system shows that lower-income residents tend to be \"frequent flyers\" at hospitals. The phenomenon of 20% of healthcare users taking up the majority of healthcare expenses is not uncommon.</p><p>We can understand that one factor leading to poor health is overcrowding and another is stress.&nbsp;Infections spread easily amongst family members in cramped environments and poor hygiene in common spaces can facilitate disease across households. Poorer health leads to poor employment retention and more frequent school absences.</p><p>MSF is very familiar with these challenges&nbsp;\u2013 high rates of employment turnover and disproportionately higher rates of school absenteeism amongst children from rental blocks communities.&nbsp;The common and perplexing challenge many social service agencies face seems to be&nbsp;\u2013 how come the poor seem to be less motivated?</p><p>If we pause to think about it, might it not be because they are struggling more in their day-to-day lives due to basic, bare-bone and often stressful living conditions which they do not have the resources to improve on their own?&nbsp;</p><p>Home becomes a place just to survive but not to thrive in. We under-estimate the amount of energy it takes to overcome challenges inherent in the current rental housing premises, leaving less energy for constructive actions, such as focusing on job performance or school performance.</p><p>Let us look squarely at just one such challenge observed in our rental estates&nbsp;\u2013 overcrowding.&nbsp;It is not uncommon when I do my house visits to come across families with three, four, sometimes five children living in a 2-room flat.</p><p>Under the current public rental housing scheme, 1- or 2-room flats are the norm and, on a case-by-case and very limited basis, 3-room flats are made available to very large families. The HDB occupancy cap for renting out flats and commercial property does not seem to apply to the Public Rental Scheme and these bring real struggles for the inhabitants.</p><p>Having people live in insufficient spaces makes it difficult to keep common spaces tidy.&nbsp;Household and personal belongings tend to spill out into common corridors, creating obstruction and potential hazards. These then create tensions with neighbours and among family members, adding on stress from conflict in their day-to-day lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Many Town Councils and the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) regularly receive feedback on fire hazards and end up having to manage neighbourly disputes that are hard to resolve because people simply do not have sufficient space for their daily activities, such as their laundry, their clothes racks, their shoes. Such neighbourly tensions make for very poor quality of life for residents and also create unnecessary toll on public resources.&nbsp;</p><p>Another important side effect of overcrowding is on children's development.&nbsp;During the COVID-19 pandemic, immense challenges were faced by children in rental flats trying to cope with home-based learning in limited space. In a community collaboration that Nee Soon South had with Yishun Health and SportSG, it was observed by volunteers in a football programme for children from rental block families that the kids had poorer hand-eye coordination and could not throw or catch as well as other kids.</p><p>We suspect that space constraints had a role in limiting the amount of play within flats, compromising the psychomotor development of children who live in cramped spaces.&nbsp;One can imagine that children living in such tiny flats are very much curtailed in their play. They cannot really throw a ball to their sibling at home without the risk of hitting something or getting yelled at by a frustrated parent.&nbsp;How can we expect children to study, play, learn and grow up well physically, emotionally and mentally in such conditions?</p><p>In the latest URA guidelines issued in January 2023, \"the threshold of 70 square meters is a reasonable size for small families.\"&nbsp;I would like to ask MND what is the prevailing floor area of 1- and 2-room public rental flats and is there a minimum space per resident that is adhered to that provides for conducive living?&nbsp;</p><p>In England, the Building Research Establishment estimates that hazards in poor housing costs the National Health Services in England \u00a31.4 billion a year but that the full societal cost, including long-term mental health, suffering and trauma treatment, is around \u00a318.5 billion per annum.</p><p>I urge MND to work with MSF to do the necessary research into living spaces and their impact on early childhood development outcomes.</p><p>Next, I would like to talk about the role of aesthetics in human potential.&nbsp;From the earliest philosophers to modern-day psychologists, scholars and researchers have recognised the power of beauty to inspire and motivate us.&nbsp;Research in psychology has shown that exposure to beautiful environments can have a positive impact on our mental health and well-being.</p><p>For example, a study published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology found that people who worked in aesthetically pleasing environments were more productive and had a greater sense of well-being than those who worked in less aesthetically pleasing environments.</p><p>Furthermore, aesthetics can also inspire us to be our best selves. Art can help us to see the world in new and different ways, challenging our perspectives and inspiring us to be more empathetic, compassionate and socially responsible.</p><p>What we can infer logically is that just focusing on objective functionality alone, without considering the value of aesthetics is to miss an opportunity&nbsp;\u2013 to inspire and catalyse&nbsp;empathy, compassion and an increased sense of civic responsibility in rental housing communities.</p><p>If one pays attention, it is not hard to notice that the general cleanliness upkeep in rental estates is much more challenging than those in purchased estates. What is commonly observed are higher rates of high-rise littering, misuse or poor use of common chutes, dirty common corridors and void decks. Most Town Councils share a common challenge in having to deploy more cleaning and maintenance resources in rental block areas.</p><p>I say this not to shame rental block residents but for us to really investigate what the causes and reasons behind such behaviours are.&nbsp;They reveal little willingness or motivation in occupants to help upkeep and maintain common spaces.&nbsp;Is this function simply because of a lack of ownership because the flats do not belong to them?</p><p>If that is so, how then do we explain the behavior of much more cooperative behavior when people stay at hotels? We do not own the premises in hotels but we do not also commonly hear of people trashing hotel rooms or littering at hotel lobbies and premises even though the people who stay there are temporary occupants.</p><p>This begs a deeper examination into the factors contributing to civic behaviour.&nbsp;What common sense tells us is that the common behavior and attitude of people towards places and things that are beautiful and pleasing is that we are naturally inclined to want to keep them that way.&nbsp;As the philosopher Immanuel Kant once aptly said, \"Beauty is a symbol of morality.\"</p><p>Beauty has the power to evoke and inspire the higher qualities and virtues in human beings. When we are exposed to beauty, we are more likely to feel motivated to pursue our goals with greater determination and to push ourselves to be our best selves.&nbsp;</p><p>My team's research found recent projects in the US that have discovered the tremendous role aesthetics and design play in helping to rehabilitate homeless communities. One of them is the first shelter project in Oregon that uses trauma-informed design by a non-profit called Path Home.&nbsp;</p><p>Here, Mr Speaker, I would like to show a visual example of what their shelter for the homeless looks like. Permission to show a slide, please.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Go ahead.</p><p><strong>Ms Carrie Tan</strong>: Does it not look beautiful? This is a homeless shelter.&nbsp;The founder of Path Home shared in an interview that the design was \"based on research done since the 1960s in hospitals, looking into what kinds of facilities promote better reactions among patients.</p><p>\"Some of the key elements they\u2019ve identified include having a connection to nature \u2013 lots of light, real plants indoors and outdoors \u2013 and building with natural materials, so they used a lot of real wood. The color palette is also very calming \u2013 lots of greens and turquoises from the ocean.\"</p><p>The founder also said, \"It\u2019s about helping families feel worthy (so) that they can get up and do the hard work to get their lives back on track.\"</p><p>This project has had much success and positive feedback from its inhabitants. It demonstrates the role of aesthetics in uplifting the human spirit and catalysing human motivation.</p><p>We under-estimate just how being able to have something beautiful can uplift an individual's sense of self-esteem and fundamentally shift their self-perception and motivation. We see the same principle across many makeover TV shows across different cultures, TV shows where a makeover has the power to change someone's life by changing how they perceive themselves.</p><p>There is also a global architecture firm called the Workplace Group at HOK that has created a landmark guidebook on trauma-informed design with the goal of helping people to quiet the part of the brain that stays in survival mode.&nbsp;</p><p>Research has shown that the positive emotional effect of the aesthetic experience affects mood and indirectly promotes health and well-being. These benefits include improvement of memory, lower stress levels and increased social connection.</p><p>By using design to enhance living spaces with aesthetics, colours, lighting and art, instead of inhabitants coming home feeling fearful and on high alert from a difficult day, chronically operating on flight or fight mode, they can be more relaxed when they return home, which has proven to improve executive functioning. This can help them focus better on actions like applying for jobs or getting their children to school.</p><p>Given the availability of such information and knowledge on how space and aesthetics can help improve human performance, we would be doing a disservice if the Government does not start incorporating such principles in the way we design public rental housing.</p><p>The prevailing approach that provides only a basic and functional roof over people's heads needs to change. This belief, long held by too many in the system, that providing a pleasing and comfortable environment for public rental housing residents might demotivate them from working hard to move out, also really needs to change.&nbsp;These are limiting beliefs that curtail the possibilities and potential of our own citizens who are striving hard to improve their lives.</p><p>We can do more for the Singaporeans who need our utmost support to help them overcome the adversities in their lives.&nbsp;And having aesthetically pleasing homes, with just sufficient space for inhabitants to participate in daily activities stress-free, is akin to having an ever-present cheerleader that one can come home to everyday.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of assuming and blaming lack of personal motivation for poor social mobility outcomes, let us take a more scientific and proactive approach to study the environmental factors that we can enhance to improve human motivation and potential.</p><p>I recognise that in these fiscally challenging times, cost is always a consideration. Instead of increasing costs, there are ways we can rethink the design and construction of rental housing to optimise the value of expenditure we are already planning to spend on rental housing provision.</p><p>Furthermore, any incremental costs could have a disproportionate positive return in terms of wellbeing and savings in longer-term healthcare and welfare spending. The long-term gains may well outweigh the short-term incremental costs.&nbsp;</p><p>Architects and design thinkers know full well how design influences and shapes human behaviour. We must recognise the importance of space and beauty in our lives and strive to create environments that inspire and enable human thriving. By doing so, we can unlock the full potential of our rental housing families and give them that much more \u2013 a better starting point to recover and thrive from their adversities.</p><p>The Government does not need to do this alone. There are philanthropists and now, many family offices we can tap on to do this with.&nbsp;I urge MND to&nbsp;partner with the philanthropic and private sectors, to get sponsorships and to work with arts groups, Design Singapore, local artists, designers, developers and volunteers to create uplifting designs and furnishings in rental living spaces.</p><p>The co-living pilot refurbished from the old Anderson Junior College hostel was well intended but implementation fell too far short. MND launched this in March and I believe it is not too late to still harness this opportunity to pilot such partnerships for the transformation to redesign and rethink our rental housing approach.&nbsp;We can do better, so let us do it together.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Minister of State&nbsp;Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim.</p><h6>10.01 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister of State for National Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Ms Tan for her passionate speech on enhancing the living environment to motivate, empower and uplift public rental households.&nbsp;</p><p>We share Ms Tan's belief in the power and social impact of good design. As the master planner and developer of Singapore's public housing estates, HDB appreciates the importance of quality homes and environments that enhance residents' wellbeing and support Singaporeans to lead their best lives.&nbsp;</p><p>To that end, HDB launched its \"Designing for Life\" roadmap in 2020. The roadmap seeks to enhance residents' physical, mental and social well-being through thoughtful, resident-centred design, for example, by bringing nature and greenery closer to residents, improving facilities for active living and providing ample community spaces to encourage social connections.&nbsp;</p><p>Rental flats are always built as part of a wider HDB neighbourhood. This means that rental tenants enjoy the same communal facilities and amenities as sold flat owners, including community living rooms, roof gardens, fitness facilities, playgrounds, neighbourhood shops, preschool centres and Active Ageing Centres.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the years, we have made progressive improvements to our rental flats to enhance their design and provide a better living environment for our tenants.&nbsp;Rental blocks that were built since 2007 are better designed with enhanced natural lighting and ventilation within units and at the corridors. These newer blocks are very different from the older rental blocks that have long corridors with units lined on both sides.</p><p>In addition, we have been building public rental flats alongside sold flats \u2013 in the same projects and, since 2014, in the same blocks and on the same floors.&nbsp;In integrated blocks such as those at Marsiling Greenview and West Plains @ Bukit Batok, public rental flats look no different from sold flats from the outside. On the inside, they have similar finishes and fittings as 2-room Flexi sold flats.</p><p>We do this because having a good social mix is a key objective of our public housing programme.&nbsp;</p><p>After the first integrated block was completed at Marsiling Greenview, we commissioned a study with the National University of Singapore to understand the impact of this integrated design.&nbsp;We found that the design features have encouraged interactions and ties between owners and tenants, for example, by locating sold flats and rental flats on the same floor, minimising visible differences between sold flats, and rental flats and having shared amenities such as playgrounds.</p><p>&nbsp;The study also found that owners and tenants have the same perceptions of what constitutes a liveable environment and they act in similar ways to uphold these standards, for example, in terms of upkeeping shared corridor spaces and managing cleanliness.&nbsp;</p><p>We are encouraged by these findings and will apply these learnings to the design of future integrated blocks. Another 17 integrated blocks will be completed in the next five years and we will continue to build them, including in future Prime and Plus projects.&nbsp;</p><p>We also explore new typologies to improve the living environment for public rental tenants. For example, we announced earlier, as shared by Ms Tan, that we are piloting a new public rental typology for singles called the Single Room Shared Facilities (SRSF).&nbsp;The SRSF aims to give tenants greater privacy while providing shared facilities to prevent social isolation. Each tenant will have their own private bedroom that comes with basic furnishings such as a bedframe, table and wardrobe. Amenities like toilets, kitchens, dining areas and laundry rooms will be shared to ensure that we make good use of the space and to facilitate social interaction.</p><p>For older public rental blocks, HDB keeps them in good condition through regular maintenance and upgrading. Older rental blocks will typically be upgraded together with sold blocks when the entire area is rejuvenated through HDB's various upgrading programmes.&nbsp;We are also progressively redeveloping older clusters of rental flats. Tenants who are relocated can move to newer rental flats with improved designs.</p><p>We empathise with Ms Tan's point about providing a good living environment for rental families with young children. We have been making efforts in this area and will seek to further improve the design of flats.</p><p>Under the Public Rental Scheme, HDB generally offers 1- and 2-room flats to cater to both singles and families.&nbsp;The vast majority of our public rental households \u2013 more than nine in 10 \u2013 have four or fewer persons.&nbsp;We do not have a hard space norm per person but we recognise that some larger households may have space concerns and have already started some efforts to help provide a better environment for families with young children, including using good design to overcome the constraints of land and space.&nbsp;Families with at least three members will be allocated a 2-room public rental flat. These are typically sized similarly to 2-room Flexi sold flats.</p><p>In recent years, HDB has also started building 2-room rental flats that come with an additional partitioned space. The space can be used as a child's room with a single bed and a small wardrobe, or as a study or activity room to support children's development.</p><p>For larger families, those able to form two family nuclei will be allocated two public rental flats. Where possible, HDB strives to ensure that both flats are located near each other to facilitate mutual care and support. HDB also works with MSF to offer 3-room public rental flats to selected large families with children on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Like Ms Tan, we are driven by the desire to see families achieving social mobility and seniors ageing well even if they live in public rental.&nbsp;But to achieve these, hardware alone is insufficient. We need to pair hardware with good social support and programming to make concerted efforts to address households' needs and aspirations holistically.</p><p>For example, HDB works with relevant people sector partners to support seniors in public rental flats with active ageing programmes and assisted living services.</p><p>At a rental block in Kebun Baru, the Integrated Dementia Assisted Living project by Dementia Singapore offers a telehealth room, community kitchen and social programming to support seniors living in the rental block to age well in place.&nbsp;</p><p>For families with young children living in public rental flats, Government agencies and community partners work closely together through the ComLink+ programme to provide coordinated support. ComLink officers and Family Coaches will journey with families, understand their needs and aspirations and work with them to develop goals and action plans. Different agencies and partners then work together backend, behind the scenes, to support families' individual needs \u2013 the Ministry of Education for school subsidies, the Ministry of Health for healthcare, Family Service Centres for family counselling, community-based after-school care and programmes for children, and so on.</p><p>In Boon Lay, for example, children in ComLink+ families may spend their after-school hours at the Tak Takut Kids Club. The club is operated by 3Pumpkins, a community-based organisation. Located at the ground floor of a rental block, it runs various free play, sports and crafts activities, and provides a safe and supportive environment where children can grow and express themselves.</p><p>In November last year, we worked with MSF to launch the ComLink Rental Scheme to strengthen our efforts and go further upstream.&nbsp;Once families apply for a public rental flat and are assessed to be eligible, they will automatically be enrolled in ComLink+. A ComLink officer will then proactively reach out to them to offer support even before they move into their rental flat and continue to journey with them as they work towards achieving stability, self-reliance and social mobility.</p><p>To date, over 700 families have been engaged under this scheme.&nbsp;When public rental families achieve stability and build up their finances, we support them on their journey towards homeownership.</p><p>I have met many rental families and I know that many of them hope to buy their own flats. Families can count on our full support.&nbsp;</p><p>We provide substantial housing grants for lower-income families on top of the significant subsidies that we provide for all BTO flats. First-timers can tap on the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant and receive up to $80,000 while second-timers can tap on the $15,000 Step-Up CPF Housing Grant.&nbsp;</p><p>We also have the Fresh Start Housing Scheme, which helps second-timer families with young children living in public rental flats to own a home again.&nbsp;The design of this scheme embodies the idea of social empowerment \u2013 coupling strong support from the Government and the community, with commitment and hard work from families. We enhanced the scheme recently to offer 3-room flats on shorter leases so that families have more housing options and increased the grant amount from $35,000 to $50,000.&nbsp;</p><p>There is also a dedicated Home ownership Support Team at HDB, who will provide one-to-one guidance to tenants on their homebuying journey. The team will share practical tips and advice on their housing budget and options and guide families through the process of flat selection, application and booking.</p><p>The team has reached out to about 1,500 households over the past three years.&nbsp;Mr Khairi and Mdm Dayang is one of them.&nbsp;Together with their five children \u2014</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Minister of State&nbsp;Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, you have a minute left. Just to let you know.</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Together with their five children,&nbsp;</span>they moved into their new home earlier this year. Before that, they had been living in public rental for some years. The Home ownership Support Team worked closely with them for over a year, guiding them on their housing budget and options. I am happy to hear that Mr Khairi and Mdm Dayang are now the proud owners of a 3-room resale flat. They were able to tap on housing grants totalling $87,500 and can service their mortgage entirely using their monthly CPF contributions, without any cash outlay.</p><p>In conclusion, Sir, supporting and uplifting those who are more vulnerable among us requires a holistic approach. We pay attention to the design of our homes and living environments and we go one step further, to pair hardware with software, and marshal resources from across Government and society to support families.&nbsp;</p><p>We welcome the people and private sectors to contribute your ideas and resources too and work with us to uplift families in public rental flats.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

At the post-Secondary level, junior colleges and the Millenia Institute equip students with the necessary academic skills and knowledge through the A-Level syllabus as required for further education, particularly at the universities. On the other hand, polytechnics and Institute of Technical Education provide more industry-based and applied learning that prepares students for the workforce.

The AAR covered SCDF's firefighting procedures, operational safety, equipping and training.</p><p>As part of the AAR, the IRG also audited over 260 firefighting operations in 2021 and 2022, where at least one firefighting water jet was deployed. The aim was to assess whether the operations were conducted professionally and safely and whether adequate command and control was exercised by the commanders on the ground. The IRG further scrutinised 61 of these cases that required more than two firefighting water jets, that is, more challenging incidents.</p><p>The audit found that while the operations had largely been conducted competently and safely, there were occasional individual lapses such as officers not wearing their Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) properly, or not using the Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) during damping down operations.</p><p>The IRG made recommendations to improve operational safety as well as command-and-control.</p><p>Establishing a Staging and Breathing Apparatus Control Officer (BACO) control point for all residential unit fires has been implemented since 18 September 2023. The control point helps ground commanders to track the deployment of firefighters, as well as to check on the PPE of the teams before they are sent into the scene of the fire. Previously, this control point was only established for major fire incidents.</p><p>Issuance of Body Worn Cameras (BWCs) to all Section Commanders, which will be achieved by March 2024. Currently, only officers who are holding the appointment of Deputy Rota Commander and higher are issued with BWCs. The wider deployment of BWCs will enhance the quality of post-incident AARs. By mid-2024, when the camera is capable of livestreaming to the SCDF Operations Centre, it will also enhance sensemaking during ongoing incidents.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">A new generation of breathing apparatus with telemetry capabilities will be progressively deployed from mid-2024. This project was initiated two years ago, and has been in development.&nbsp;When introduced in 2024, it will enable transmission of the data of the air capacity remaining in a firefighter's breathing apparatus to the BACO control point for monitoring. This next-generation breathing apparatus will also come with a Personnel Distress Device (PDD) that is automatically activated once the air tank is turned on, as compared to the existing PDD, which must be manually turned on by the firefighter. With the new PDD, after a period when the firefighter is motionless, the PDD will automatically trigger an alert to the BACO control point, so that officers there can make appropriate interventions.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Enhancements to the selection process for ground commanders. The SCDF is also conducting a comprehensive review of the training of ground commanders, including enhancements to the training syllabus to underline the importance of command responsibility and introducing exercises to stress-test the command-and-control capabilities of the commanders.</p><p>Mr Murali also asked about the deployment of Full-time National Servicemen (NSFs), in particular, as firefighters and how we ensure their safety. First, only NSFs who are certified to be medically fit and are of Physical Employment Status \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B1\u2019 or \u2018B2\u2019, will be deployed as firefighters.</p><p>Second, firefighting training at the Civil Defence Academy (CDA) is conducted with \u2018live' fire simulators to provide realism so that trainees, regardless whether they are Regulars or NSFs, can gain relevant experience operating in conditions that closely resemble real fires. The training curriculum is reviewed regularly to ensure currency and robustness.</p><p>Even after graduation from CDA, training continues to be an integral part of a firefighter's daily routine. They undergo exercises and drills during each shift to familiarise themselves with their respective roles and functions, as well as to maintain individual fitness and other competencies. Annual proficiency tests are conducted by CDA to ensure that their skills and fitness levels continue to meet the required standards.</p><p>The safety of all SCDF personnel, whether they are Regulars, NSFs, NSmen or Volunteers, is of paramount importance to us.

For example, while telecommuting may not be suitable for frontline workers, other arrangements, such as flexible-shift scheduling and staggered hours may be implemented.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Hence, providing FWAs should not be overly prescriptive for employers as they would know how to optimally balance the needs of their business with those of their employees, whether it is to support caregiving or upskilling. We are mindful to not take a rigid approach, which may affect workers' employability and firms' productivity. Instead, we want to build up a norm where employers and employees can discuss constructively what kinds of FWAs work best for them.&nbsp;The Tripartite Guidelines will lay out how employers can assess FWA requests fairly and require them to do so. At the same time, it will also lay out how FWAs should be used responsibly by employees. Employers should also manage and appraise employees on FWAs fairly, in line with the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices.</p><p>With a tight labour market, it is in employers' best interests to offer the right FWAs that allow them to maintain productivity while attracting and retaining talent.

Under the SRF, the FI stands at the top of the waterfall. If the FI does not fulfil any of its four anti-scam duties, it will compensate the scam victim fully for the loss suffered, regardless of whether the Telco has discharged its duties or the victim has taken the necessary precautions. Likewise, if the FI has fulfilled its duties but the Telco has not, then the Telco is expected to bear full responsibility for the loss.&nbsp;Only if both the FI and Telco have discharged their duties fully, will the customer, who stands at the bottom of the waterfall, have to bear the loss.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">&nbsp;This approach recognises the key roles of FIs and Telcos in preventing scams, and reflects the SRF's policy intent of strengthening their direct accountability to consumers.

As it stands today, the number of phishing scams has continued to rise in the first half of this year compared to the previous period, but has declined as a proportion of total scam cases, from 17% to 13%. The average loss per phishing scam has also declined by 20% over the same period. The Government will continue to monitor this closely.

These scammers run sophisticated operations with extensive networks and are adept at using technology to swiftly move funds, often across jurisdictions, to evade detection by the authorities.

We have therefore been engaging these platforms to implement safeguards, such as implementing user verification processes to ensure that accounts are legitimate. We would like to work with other countries to collectively engage these online platforms.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Third, we continue to engage our foreign counterparts to exchange information on the latest scam variants and strategies to combat scams and learn from one another's experiences.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In short, this transnational scourge is not something we can

Since its inception in April 2022, there have been over 100 applications for the DPE one-stop professional service (\u201cService\u201d). The Service helps SMEs to set up data security practices and incident management plans, provides data protection and cyber awareness training to the SME's staff and comes with a one-year retainer service that includes software updates and reviews of the SME's systems and data handling processes.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of the applications for the Service come from SMEs in sectors, such as healthcare and IT which handle a large amount of personal data (more than 500 individuals). Over 40% of the applications are from micro-SMEs. Specifically, four applications are from the education sector and none are from the exercise sector. To date, 50% of all applicants have successfully implemented the Service, while the remaining are at different stages of implementation.</p><p>Different SMEs have varying data protection needs depending on the volume and type of data they handle. IMDA has been collaborating with various sector champions to promote the DPE, including in the education and exercise sectors. For example, IMDA is partnering the Committee for Private Education to encourage small-to-medium private education institutions to adopt the DPE to protect their customers' personal data. IMDA will also continue to encourage all SMEs that handle a large amount of personal data to adopt the DPE, including SMEs in the exercise sector. The data protection measures will aid SMEs in upholding confidence and trust among their customers as they digitalise their processes and services.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Usage and Cost of Maintaining Wireless@SG System", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>30 <strong>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim</strong> asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) for each of the past 10 years, what is the usage rate, in terms of unique logins, for Wireless@SG; and (b) what is the share of resident versus non-resident usage for each of those years respectively.</p><p>31 <strong>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim</strong> asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what is the cost of maintaining the Wireless@SG system annually; and (b) given advances in mobile data technology and usage, whether there are plans for the eventual phase-out of the system.</p><p><strong>Mrs Josephine Teo</strong>:&nbsp;Wireless@SG complements Singapore's fixed and mobile connectivity services. The key difference between Wireless@SG and other Wi-Fi services is that Wireless@SG provides a harmonised platform for the public to seamlessly access free Wi-Fi services across all participating Wireless@SG operators. It is typically deployed at public locations with higher footfall or where people tend to congregate for longer periods, for example, hawker centres, community centres, libraries and shopping malls, to support our increasing connectivity needs. From 2018 to 2022, there were an average of 1.8 million unique logins per month, 98% of which were by residents<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>When the Wireless@SG programme was launched in 2006, IMDA had provided some initial funding support to Wireless@SG operators to defray one-time capital costs and encourage widespread deployment. Today, interested venue owners can contract with any of the four appointed Wireless@SG operators \u2013 Singtel, StarHub, M1 and SIMBA. Although IMDA may provide periodic funding to enhance the security and bandwidth of Wireless@SG, the main financial costs are carried by the operators and venue owners who pay for the deployment as well as ongoing maintenance and upgrades of the Wi-Fi hotspots. This arrangement is sustainable and can continue so long as venue owners see value in providing free Wi-Fi services for their customers through the convenient log-in access provided by Wireless@SG operators.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": ["1 : Users who registered for Wireless@SG using a local Singapore mobile number were classified as residents."], "footNoteQuestions": ["30", "31"], "questionNo": "30-31"}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Checks on Foreigners Working Illegally as Food Delivery Riders", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>32 <strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng</strong> asked the Minister for Manpower in view of the recent case of foreigners working illegally as food delivery riders in Singapore without valid work passes (a) whether there are routine checks conducted to identify such foreigners, especially those using foreign-registered vehicles; (b) what penalties apply to platforms that engage such foreigners; (c) whether there are plans for stricter penalties on account holders who abet such offences; and (d) to date, how many cases of illegal food delivery by foreigners have been apprehended.</p><p><strong>Dr Tan See Leng</strong>:&nbsp;The nature of food delivery work is decentralised and mobile. Hence, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) relies mainly on complaints to detect possible instances of foreigners working illegally as food delivery riders, in order to carry out enforcement actions.</p><p>From 2018 till 18 October 2023, MOM received a total of 163 complaints on suspected illegal foreign delivery riders. Our investigations established that the majority of these complaints were unsubstantiated as the foreigners were either legitimate work pass holders employed by the food and beverage establishments as in-house deliverymen, or there was insufficient information or evidence to warrant further action. Enforcement actions were eventually taken against 10 foreigners.</p><p>Platform companies or any party found to have abetted the illegal employment are liable to the same penalties as the foreigners who worked illegally as food delivery riders in Singapore without valid work passes, which is a fine not exceeding $20,000, imprisonment for up to two years, or both.
