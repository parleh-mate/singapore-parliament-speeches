(proc text)]</p><h6>12.01 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, another year, another Budget debate. This is where the Finance Minister holds centre court. I do not envy Deputy Prime Minister Tharman's job. He has to balance short-term needs with long-term priorities and the demands from the various Ministries that are responsible for the wide range of functions that straddle the entire spectrum of Government functions: from ensuring national security to fostering economic competitiveness, funding health and social programmes, developing infrastructure to providing the finest education that our children need to compete in this world.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Madam, coming up with the Budget is like juggling many balls in the air and ensuring none should drop. At the heart of it is the concept of allocative efficiency. How do we distribute limited amounts of money in a way that gives us the biggest bang for the buck?</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>As our Prime Minister said recently, a dollar spent on healthcare means a dollar less to spend on other areas, such as education, housing or security. That is not to say healthcare is less important than education. But the truth is, we have a finite number of dollars to spend on a variety of needs and desires. And then there is the law of diminishing returns. The more and more we spend on one area, the less bang for the buck we get. So, it is probably wise to spread the spending to many areas in a balanced and equitable way.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Madam, this is the rational view of things. But life is seldom rational. In fact, contrary to what is proclaimed in neo-classical economics about the rational economic man who makes rational choices to maximise his utility, most of the biggest decisions in life are not rational. Two of the biggest choices we make in our lifetimes are our choice of spouse and the career we choose. Neither of which are very rational decisions.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>I will not venture into the realm of marriage and spousal selection, but we all know that the heart rules the head in this area.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>And then, there is the issue of choosing a career. A doctor friend of mine told me that there is little correlation in choosing a specialty that earns the most money and one's academic performance in medical school. If everyone were economically rational, the smartest medical students would choose the best paying specialties, such as ophthalmology and surgery. Instead, there are many excellent students who become physicians and paediatricians, which typically pay less.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>I am fully aware that there are quite a few ophthalmologists and surgeons in this House and my comment in no way reflects on their academic ability relative to their peers. But even then, the fact that a few of them have given up their lucrative clinical practices to be in politics full-time is also, in itself, not a rational economic decision.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Madam, we now move on to a third important area where people are often not rational about \u2013 politics and the selection of their political leaders.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>The same doctor friend of mine told me he used to sit on the interview panels that selected candidates for our local medical school, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. These candidates have to submit a personal statement to convince the panels why they would make good doctors if they were given a choice. Many of these personal statements contain words such as \"compassion\" and \"empathy\".</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>This doctor friend told me that he would ask the candidates who used these words, \"What is the difference between compassion and empathy, and which trait is more important to have as a doctor\"? Most of these 19-year-olds could not really describe the difference.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>He tells me that the politically correct answer is both empathy and compassion are equally important. But in reality, on the ground, it is different. Empathy is more important than compassion in the short run.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>A patient is naturally drawn to a doctor with empathy even if, internally, the doctor has little compassion. And sadly, a doctor who is full of compassion for his patients will come across as a cold fish if he cannot demonstrate empathy.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Empathy includes feeling the disappointment, frustration and anguish of fellow Singaporeans that may have felt defeated in one way or another.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Madam, defeat is a very painful process, as I should be able to empathise from my repeated and prolonged experiences. But at least in this country, anybody that may have felt defeated will always find new hope and be able to forge a path towards new successes.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Compassion, on the other hand, is the feeling of distress and pity for the suffering or misfortune of another and often includes the desire to alleviate it.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>How a voter relates to a politician is not much different from how a patient relates to a doctor. They are quickly drawn to the one with empathy. Empathy is taken as a reliable proxy for compassion. But, in reality, it takes a person far longer to realise that his doctor or political leader has compassion and sincerely wants to help him.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>But the ability to empathise often does not truly reflect deep compassion. You can empathise, but do you really do what it takes to help the poor and the needy?</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>And you know what? Voters may still vote for certain politicians and political parties because they think these people and parties can empathise and, hence, have compassion as well.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Madam, in recent years, our Government has done many things that benefit the poor and the vulnerable. We have come up with the PGP, MediShield Life, more childcare centres, more buses, more education grants, more HDB flats and so on, and the list goes on. We have passed laws that protect the vulnerable, such as on human trafficking and the mentally disabled and even the everyday consumer.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>And this new Budget underscores this commitment with the CPF refinement measures and the Silver Support scheme. Both these initiatives will provide greater support for older workers and senior citizens. They clearly exemplify the compassion and empathy in us.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>So, I asked my doctor friend again, \"Will the politics of empathy always triumph over policies and programmes of compassion?\"</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Here is his answer: \"In the short run, yes. But in the long run, no. Compassion without empathy is like a cold fish. Empathy without compassion is like a con-man. Whether you are a doctor or a politician, there is a third element that is as equally important as empathy and compassion. That is \u2013 competence. If all your patients do not recover and get worse or die prematurely, then, in the long run, everyone will know you are a bad doctor, even when you have the best bedside manners. Ultimately, you have to solve your patient's problems. You need to be technically competent in addition to having empathy and compassion.\"</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>While we may not be very rational beings, in the long run, we all have to face reality, whether in relationships, in the career we choose or the politicians we vote for. And a competency check is also a good reality check.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Madam, Singaporeans have had 56 years of experience with PAP's competency, starting in 1959 when Singapore achieved self-government. Admittedly, competency is always a work in progress and we can always improve, even if we make missteps along the way, such as the delay in improving our infrastructure and capacity of our public services, as our Prime Minister had mentioned recently. But by any international standards and in the large scheme of things, our PAP Government has always been competent.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>This Budget is a bold one although it, too, is a work in progress in our never ending efforts to put our political philosophy into policies, programmes and actions. We will only get better and better. Mdm Speaker, I support the Budget.</p><h6>12.12 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I wore the lens of a Professional, Manager, Executive (PME), otherwise commonly known as the middle-income or sandwiched class, and paid close attention to Deputy Prime Minister Tharman's speech last Monday. I tried my best to list down every single item that was targeted at PMEs and kind of gave up after the first hour.</p><p>Indeed, this year's Budget can be said to be one of the most inclusive Budgets I have seen, with many measures and assistance targeted at not just the lower income group and the Pioneer Generation and seniors but also the middle-income group, PMEs and further pushing boundaries to include freelance professionals and stay-at-home mums. The positive list of items is an extensive one and I do not intend to run through each to laud but I know the entire package will certainly give our Singaporean PMEs a leg-up and lighten some of the load which they currently have to bear.</p><p>I particularly like this year's Budget as it addresses the current realities whilst at the same time preparing every Singaporean for the future. In particular, I am glad to note the especial focus on developing our people, our Singaporeans, to prepare them to be future-ready. It also seeks to future-proof them so that they can weather any uncertainties and stay afloat during turbulent times. In preparing and developing our people, the string of SkillsFuture measures underscore the importance we place on our people, our most valued asset of Singapore. Whether one is in employment, in-between employment, out of employment, going into or starting employment or leaving employment or even not in a formal employment relationship, this Budget and its SkillsFuture initiatives will benefit you.</p><p>We know skills and productivity are so tightly linked and that skills and job competency, other than personal character and attitude, should be the paramount consideration for placement and progression in any job. It is about developing the right skill for the right job. Not just a skill but a deep skill. Not just one skill but also a second skill to weather storms better.</p><p>I have personally spoken to and engaged PMEs of various ages and gender and who belong to different life stages; they each have their fair share of challenges, from achieving work-life balance to ensuring they find the right job and draw a good wage. In particular, there are two groups of PMEs which we need to pay special attention to. They are the young PMEs and the mature PMEs.</p><p>Young PMEs want to land the first job, move up the career ladder and do well. Some have to pay off their education loans. Mature PMEs above 40 years of age fear if their jobs are stable and whether they can find a job if they lose it. They have mouths to feed, parents and in-laws to look after, mortgages and loans to service.</p><p>In short, these two groups worry about their employment and employability. It is, therefore, heartening to note this year's Budget seeks to address the challenges faced by these two groups through the SkillsFuture programmes, initiatives and funding to help Singaporean PMEs in their employment and employability.</p><p>However, all said and done, this Budget is a positive one for PMEs. But what is even more important is that the plethora of initiatives through SkillsFuture will only succeed, if and only if, everyone plays their part. And I do not just mean every Singaporean but also the industry and employers, the Government as well as the Labour Movement, unions and workers. Everyone needs to not just \"Do More\" and \"Do Well\" but to \"Do Together.\" I, therefore, urge each of the three parties to do three things.</p><p>Firstly, employers should lead by example. I urge Employers to come forward and avail themselves of the numerous programmes and internships that will be offered. More than that, employers play a crucial role in supporting this spirit of lifelong learning and CET. Employers should proactively send their PMEs for training and upgrading, something we see only in certain enlightened companies but do not see happening across all sectors and all companies whether big or small. Training support and funding are at an all-time high and employers should not use lack of resources as an excuse. Employers should use this opportunity to develop the Singaporean Core. Employers can also top-up the SkillsFuture credits of their staff to motivate them to embrace learning.</p><p>Secondly, employers must raise productivity through skills upgrading. As we embark on driving productivity across all industries and companies, including SMEs, I remind our employers that skills upgrading is one of the most important pillars to a motivated, engaged and productive workforce and also the Progressive Wage Model. The SkillsFuture plans will help not just individuals to realise their potential and aspirations to stay employed and employable but also for companies to grow and stay relevant and productive in a competitive and global marketplace.</p><p>Thirdly, employers must support their employees. As Singaporeans embark on individual-initiated training and on tapping on their SkillsFuture credits come next year to undergo training and upgrading, I urge employers to give the much needed support, encouragement and even time-off from their work. This is especially so when some of these individual-initiated training and their practicums and exams may be conducted during working hours.</p><p>Next is the Government. SkillsFuture Credit and Enhanced Funding for Singaporeans above 40. In this area, with higher training funding for mature PMEs above 40 years and the SkillsFuture credits which will benefit all PMEs above 25 years of age, I urge the Government to ensure that the credits are easily accessible and used. The ActiveSG Credit is one good example although a caution is that not everyone will know how to download the app and utilise it.</p><p>Likewise, learning from the UK's experience of the Individual Learning account, the quality of the training providers, including their programmes and delivery, is crucial. I also ask that the credits be allowed to be used to cover unfunded portions of course fees. The array of approved courses should extend beyond the WSQ training programmes or those at our local Polytechnics, ITEs and Universities but extend to a wider range of both certifiable or non-certifiable online and offline programmes which can help Singaporeans realise their passion and aspirations, including those programmes where it is an industry requirement for our PMES to undertake to stay current, employed or practising in.</p><p>All these will also then help stay-at-home mums who can undertake Lifelong Learning and CET and even prepare them if they decide to re-enter the workforce or stay connected and current. Freelance professionals can also embark on training to hone their skills or stay current in their industry since this training support is not tagged to an employer. Older Singaporeans, too, should also benefit from this credit to pick up a new skill or even learn a new interest. Since it is Lifelong Learning and lifelong, perhaps it can be extended to even useful courses at community clubs.</p><p>Finally, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman has announced regular top-ups and I urge for more top-ups at regular intervals during a person's lifetime, considering many of these PME programmes cost more and, in some instances, $500 may not suffice.</p><p>Second, with the focus on SkillsFuture, Aspire and CET2020 and the emphasis on skills as the criteria to enter into employment and move up within employment, I urge the Government to take the lead in making the \"one race to the top\" principle, that is, moving up regardless of academic qualifications but based on skills and competency, a reality in the Civil Service. For a start, with higher Government expenditure for a variety of infrastructure, can the Government, Statutory Boards and Government agencies provide even more jobs targeted specifically at mature Singaporean PMEs above 40 years?</p><p>Third, for the Government to successfully roll out the various programmes, they do not just have to come up with attractive, innovative and exciting initiatives but, more importantly, to partner employers, industry, unions and the Labour Movement, including e2i, to ensure good implementation, follow-through and ground acceptance. Our NTUC e2i and U-PME centre have been helping PMEs in Singapore and have started work with our tripartite partners, such as WDA. I urge the Government to work with us to better connect PMEs to jobs in the Jobs Bank, drive the progressive wage model for PMEs as part of the SkillsFuture initiatives and look at how to leverage and partner various stakeholders in this SkillsFuture journey.</p><p>Finally, for individuals and workers. We first need to take individual responsibility and initiative. The programmes, higher funding, awards and credits will only be useful if every Singaporean worker and individual steps forward to take personal responsibility and initiative. Regardless of age, gender and at whatever step of the career ladder you are in, take the individual initiative to tap on the array of programmes and funding, including the SkillsFuture credits, and embark on deepening your current skills and develop a second skill.</p><p>We need to cultivate a spirit of Lifelong Learning and Continuous Education and Training. Singaporeans need to embrace a culture and spirit of lifelong learning and CET. We need to learn, unlearn and relearn as current jobs become obsolete and new jobs are created. The old mantra is learn, work and retire. The new mantra will be learn, work, learn, work, learn, work, retire and continue learning. Start young if you can and start now if you are not so young.</p><p>We need to also keep an open mind. Deputy Prime Minister has shared some of the growth areas in our economy and the future jobs we expect to see. Follow your passion and dreams but at the same time keep an open mind to the sea of opportunities which are going to avail Singapore and Singaporeans. We cannot rely on skills and competencies alone; we each need to have the right mindset, right belief and the right attitude. Mdm Speaker, in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150304/vernacular-Patrick Tay Budget 4 March 2015_Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>This year's Budget is an inclusive one. Besides the senior citizens and low-income Singaporeans, it has benefits for the sandwiched class and PMEs as well.</p><p>I particularly welcome the series of SkillsFuture schemes. For SkillsFuture to be successful, the tripartite partners need to work together to create our future. I urge the Government to lead by example and help create more job opportunities for PMEs above 40 years old. The Government should also help to promote skills upgrading and the learning of a second skill.</p><p>Employers should seize the opportunity to encourage their employees to upgrade their skills and enhance their productivity. I also urge employers to top up their employees' SkillsFuture Credit.</p><p>Most importantly, it is the mindset of our people that is most critical. A breakthrough achieved through SkillsFuture is the idea of promoting individual-initiated training and encouraging people to take personal responsibility. We should create a culture of lifelong learning and cultivate a positive mindset. Singaporeans need to have the spirit where they constantly strive to improve and are always prepared for the unknown.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): In summary, I applaud the Government for the string of measures to benefit the many middle-income and PMEs in Singapore. The SkillsFuture initiatives are a step in the right direction. However, it requires the proactive and positive action of not just the tripartite partners, the Government, employers and the Labour Movement alone but by each and every Singaporean \u2013 young and old, male or female, whether one is in employment, in-between employment, out of employment, going into or starting employment or leaving employment or even not in a formal employment relationship.</p><p>We are only as strong as the weakest link, each and every one of us has to do our part to stay relevant and future-ready to ensure we have a future for ourselves and our country. I call on and rally our employers and industries, our Government and agencies, our unions and Labour Movement and, most importantly, our people to come together, work together, embrace the opportunities and move ahead and up together. I support this Budget.</p><h6>12.25 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join the Budget debate. I would like to break my speech into two parts: first, on the plight of SMEs and, second, on inclusiveness for Singaporeans.</p><p>On the plight of SMEs, as Members know, SMEs contribute significantly to the economy, accounting for 70% of jobs and deserve better attention.</p><p>The general feel is that things have become worse for SMEs in the last few years and business owners wonder if the Government is listening enough to their problems. Are we doing enough to help them? Or are we prepared to allow a substantial proportion of them to exit, shut down or die a natural death?</p><p>As many have mentioned before, only a small proportion of SMEs have benefited from the productivity push and I believe this is because of how we have defined and devised the incentives.</p><p>We should broaden the definition of productivity so that it does not only pay attention to improving companies' bottom lines. If we want our businesses to flourish, then they also need to grow their revenues. Our economic restructuring process should, therefore, focus not only on reducing cost but also on creating demand. This would help to bring about higher productivity, growth and incomes. The focus on innovation and internationalisation in this year's Budget is, therefore, timely.</p><p>We can also broaden the definition of innovation from its current form to include business model innovation. According to the latest SME Development Survey released in October, SMEs have embraced the need to restructure but 51% say that their main business strategy is to rethink their business model. Many of our SMEs need to restructure their business models to survive and they need help in this area. Besides giving incentives, exposure of our SMEs to new business concepts here and overseas, equipping them with the right mentors and facilitating collaboration would greatly help.</p><p>Regarding the foreign worker levy, the key idea for productivity improvement should be to incentivise, and not penalise, companies in making full use of their foreign manpower. Instead of having a blanket levy for all companies, why not we give a foreign levy rebate to companies that have a less than average number of foreign workers compared to their sub-sector average, while we continue to charge those that exceed the average number the normal or higher rates? This will give companies a tremendous incentive to push down their foreign worker dependencies and actually accelerate the restructuring process.</p><p>Higher business costs. Another concern for companies here is high business costs, which have become the bane of their existence. In my interaction with SMEs, I have come across many in the last year or so that have shifted part or all of their operations to lower cost countries. Just recently, I met the owner of a well-known large food product manufacturer at a grassroots event and he told me that he has already moved his entire manufacturing operations to Malaysia and Vietnam because he could not cope with the costs of operating here.</p><p>I have highlighted several times in the last couple of years in Parliament that we need to keep an eye on our business costs and that if it is not managed carefully, we would see an exodus of companies from Singapore. I believe that this exodus has started and is going to accelerate further unless we do something about rising cost.</p><p>Venturing overseas is positive and healthy for the economy and our companies, but relocating may not be. We must stop this exodus we are seeing today. Because once companies relocate, they are unlikely to come back.</p><p>Managing business costs. SMEs think about productivity or venturing overseas when they are able to. Currently, they are pre-occupied with their day-to-day concerns of managing costs and staying alive.</p><p>In Budget 2015 and the previous two Budgets, at best, businesses have been given a chance to breathe a small sigh of relief of not incurring additional cost pressures. We need longer term cost reduction measures if we are serious about nurturing a conducive SME business environment.</p><p>I urge the Government not to take the cost issue lightly and find a permanent solution rather than allocating large amounts from every year's Budget to help companies offset the high cost of doing business \u2013 Wage Credit is an example.</p><p>This approach cannot be a permanent solution. For the longer term, we need to identify and resolve some deeper structural factors in the economy, which have led to high business costs in Singapore. This needs a focused, experienced and diverse team to study the factors for a concerted period of time. I would like to urge the Government to focus on this and set up a Cost Competitiveness Committee like what we did 30 years ago to address the same type of problems that we saw in 1985. We have nothing to lose by forming such a Committee: at worst, we will confirm our cost structures are not wrong but, at best, we would be able to solve some of these problems.</p><p>Next, Madam, I want to shift the focus on inclusiveness for Singaporeans. As we debate Budget 2015, I would like to take a step back and look at how the Government has progressed since GE2011, how the four Budgets since have addressed the issues Singaporeans faced as a result of past policies. I would like to refer to the speech I made in this House on the Population White Paper in 2013 and also my response to the President's Address in 2014, where I raised various issues facing my fellow Singaporeans.</p><p>I explained that the biggest issue which resulted in the state of affairs in Singapore was the pursuit of a \"growth at all cost\" economic policy that focused on growing the GDP pie bigger without keeping a close eye on how such an economic policy would impact the lives of Singaporeans. I expressed that while the past policies were focused on economic growth and the pursuit of higher standards of living, the Government did not adequately focus on improving the quality of lives of Singaporeans as GDP grew.</p><p>While data pointed to higher wages for most Singaporeans, the cost of living increased at a faster pace, resulting in lesser savings, including retirement savings, as people forked out more to pay for everything, including higher prices for their HDB flats.</p><p>The \"growth at all cost\" and liberal immigration policies caused great difficulties for many Singaporeans. We saw infrastructure being stressed and Singaporeans facing tremendous difficulties with availability and pricing of housing, including HDB flats, a clogged up public transport system, overflowing hospitals and roads.</p><p>For some, the rapid development of Singapore caused serious displacements and dislocation as they could not benefit from the new jobs created simply because they could not keep up with the skills needed, no matter how much the Government tried to retrain them. A number became structurally unemployed, causing them great stress; many took part-time jobs that low-skill foreign workers typically did and, in return, for very low wages, not enough for them to cope with the daily needs of their families here in Singapore.</p><p>Looking at all these issues, some of our young raised questions about their future in their own home \u2013 Singapore. Can they afford a house or have jobs as they get older? It was vital that we could show the young a sense of \"Hope and Opportunity\" in Singapore for the future. They must be confident of Singapore, in Singapore.</p><p>So, what has the Government done since GE2011? Have they addressed these issues? This is my perspective. Has life become better for Singaporeans? I think, yes.</p><p>First, the change of economic growth policy. Some commentators have labelled this Budget as the most egalitarian Budget in the last couple of decades. Although the headline figures would certainly support this view, I believe that this Budget is simply another step in the process of building a more inclusive society, which began after GE2011.</p><p>In 2008, during the Budget debate, I called upon the Government to abandon the \"growth at all cost\" economic policy and I am glad that in February 2012, the first Budget after GE 2011, the Minister for Finance heeded this call and started talking about an \"Inclusive Growth\" strategy \u2013 which is economic growth that will benefit more Singaporeans&nbsp;\u2013 and it has adopted this approach since then in all the four Budgets. It has been four years since this change of mindset has taken place, resulting in many positive impact on many Singaporeans.</p><p>The tremendous increase in infrastructure and development spending from about $10 billion in 2009 to $19.5 billion in 2015 and the projected goal of spending close to 19.5% of the GDP on development expenditure will, hopefully, solve all the infrastructure problems facing our hospitals and transport system. I am confident that in four to five years, infrastructure issues, including housing, will not be a major bugbear for Singaporeans. Because the Government is forward-looking, there has also been greater focus on creating opportunities for future generations, so that our young see a sense of \"Hope and Opportunity\" in their own country.</p><p>And what are the changes that have happened? Because of the rapid rise of cost in the last 20 years, lagging wage increases, we saw a cross-section of Singaporeans become structurally unemployed or under-employed. They just could not be reskilled to match the jobs that were created. This resulted in short-term, transitional issues that needed to be addressed by policy changes which resemble those of a welfare state \u2013 where the Government has moved in to plug the gaps created in the area of depressed wages, healthcare affordability and to generally help low- and middle-income Singaporeans cope with the cost of living.</p><p>How has the Government achieved this? By redistributing Government earnings to help those facing difficulties in coping with the higher cost of living. For all Singaporeans, the Government has focused on helping families cope with the cost of education through subsidies for childcare, kindergarten, as well as top-ups to children's individual accounts to help them pay for some of the enrichment programmes which will otherwise be less affordable to them.</p><p>The other short-term and medium-term policies that have been put in place include CHAS for medical care, Workfare Income Supplement (WIS), which is now a permanent feature, regular CPF top-ups and utility rebates are also forms of transitional Government help to help the short-term issues.</p><p>Budget 2015 also addresses the plight of middle-income Singaporeans, who have been called the \"sandwiched class\". In addition to childcare and kindergarten subsidies, this Budget has also introduced a one-time tax rebate, which I hope can become a permanent feature in future Budgets, and also the reduction in the levy for foreign domestic helpers to help middle-income Singaporeans.</p><p>What about the longer term solutions put in place by the Government? For the long term, the key focus of the Government is to create well-paying jobs by building a good environment to attract quality investments.</p><p>SkillsFuture is an initiative introduced this year that gives every Singaporean a chance to upskill, while the focus on ASPIRE will help us create an environment where everyone is valued for his or her skill and given a well-deserved compensation that affords them a comfortable life here in Singapore. This, together with the policy introduced in Budget 2014, called the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF), will ensure that Singaporeans will not be unfairly treated by employers who may try to hire younger and lower paid foreign workers.</p><p>MediSheld Life, to be implemented later this year, is a relief for all Singaporeans that they will always have good and affordable healthcare. This, coupled with the huge increase in the number of hospital beds and new hospitals coming on board, should assure all Singaporeans that their healthcare will be taken care of as they grow older.</p><p>The Progressive Wage Model (PWM) policy to mandate a minimum wage for some categories of workers is a good start for a long-term minimum wage system that will assure Singaporeans that they will always earn enough to support their families as cost continues to rise here in Singapore. We should expand this to cover all low-wage Singaporeans.</p><p>Many prominent members of society have called on the Government to implement a national minimum wage. The business community has, in general, been reluctant in allowing wages to increase across the board, citing increases in business costs. This is a fair argument. Increasing wages would certainly lower margins of businesses. Despite these arguments, the Government has courageously begun the implementation of sector-specific minimum wages, through the Progressive Wage Model.</p><p>The Progressive Wage Model, however, does not provide a comprehensive longer term solution that we need. Some companies have gotten around this model by reclassifying their jobs in the two sectors affected, while employers in sectors not covered by the Progressive Wage Model have little incentive to redesign their jobs.</p><p>A Singaporean earning very low wages \u2013 who has a family to support \u2013 cannot cope with unrealistically low salaries, no matter which sector they work in. Having considered that, I think that we should formalise a national wage system so that Singaporeans are more self-sufficient and do not have to rely on regular Government interventions for them to cope.</p><p>Retirement and older Singaporeans. Without doubt, taking care of older Singaporeans has been one area where we can say the Government has done an excellent job in. Starting with the Pioneers aged 65 and above last year, who were given the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP) for healthcare needs, they now worry less about falling ill and being able to afford medical treatment. This is also a relief for family members who have to worry less about supporting their pioneer parents and grandparents, who mostly earned much lower wages and have much less savings compared to those who are working today.</p><p>The many changes to the CPF scheme, the regular CPF top-ups for older Singaporeans and the Government paying 6% interest for the first $30,000 of savings in the Retirement Savings account, announced this year, are all useful to help us build sufficient retirement savings.</p><p>The Silver Support Scheme, soon to be implemented, will help all lower income Singaporeans today have an assurance that they will get some help from the Government when they retire so that they do not feel disadvantaged by the huge income gap that we see today here in Singapore.</p><p>The long-term sense of well-being is a very important thing for us to build a sense of national identity. As long as we keep adopting this \"Inclusive Growth\" strategy that we started in 2012, I am sure we will do the right things to improve the lives of Singaporeans. We need to keep focusing on building infrastructure ahead of time, keep housing and public transport affordable in the long term, valuing all skills \u2013 not just academic excellence&nbsp;\u2013 and be willing to pay better for these skills so that not only those with good academic grades get paid better.</p><p>Over the past 10 years, some people have thought that the PAP Government has lost the plot in governing Singapore. As we can see from what the Government has done since GE2011, this Government did momentarily get distracted by the \"growth at all cost\" policy, but it did not lose the plot. Today, the Government has addressed many of the concerns that Singaporeans had.</p><p>At least for me, I am seeing that the Government is now addressing many of those concerns and, in a few years' time, we will see the full impact and feel the difference of living more comfortably here in Singapore.</p><p>While I am happy that we are heading in the right direction and have made good progress, there are some areas that we can still work on. No one is perfect. One area, I think, that we should continue to focus on is affordable housing. This will also help us build, among Singaporeans, a strong sense of stakeholdership in the country.</p><p>Would this Government consider removing the salary ceiling and providing first-time Singaporean home buyers a substantial housing grant, say, $50,000? This grant should be over and above the existing grants, but would come with one clause. First-time home buyers who utilise this grant will only be able to sell their properties back to the HDB. The HDB would buy back these homes at inflation adjusted prices, less the straight line depreciation for the years of occupancy. Every Singaporean should be allowed to buy at least one HDB flat, no matter what size of the flat, at a very affordable price.</p><p>National identity. Last year, I wrote about the erosion of our national identity and the urgent need for the Government to refocus on rebuilding it. I feel that as long as the Government focuses on \"Inclusiveness\" and on \"Singaporeans First\", we will have a chance of building a stronger national identity for our future Singaporeans.</p><p>National identity results in a greater sense of ownership and responsibility towards nation-building and we need to energise our young to feel the sense of ownership and responsibility. I am very sure that if we continue to focus on the inclusive growth approach and put in place measures that make each Singaporean feel that this is their home and not a hotel and that citizenship is a matter of pride to want to continue to build a better future for subsequent generations of Singaporeans, we would have succeeded in building a stronger national identity. I urge the Government to spend more in future Budgets focusing on this exercise of building the Singapore national identity.</p><p>In conclusion, at the end of the day, if every Singaporean can feel that their life today has become better than it was yesterday, then this Government would have done its job well. I am confident that we are heading in the right direction.</p><p>Let me conclude by speaking about a letter I received from a young Singaporean. After delivering my speech at the White Paper debate in 2013, I received an email from a young Singaporean lady who was leaving Singapore for university in Australia. She highlighted her various concerns and worries and her sense of disassociation with Singapore.</p><p>She had four main areas of concern. As a far-sighted lady, she worried about her employment prospects as she grew older. She was worried that she would be replaced by younger, faster, cheaper foreigners. She was also concerned that with the ever rising number of foreigners coming to work in Singapore, our infrastructure would be unduly stressed. She worried about the eroded sense of belonging that she and her friends felt and their view that the Government was more interested in luring foreigners than bringing Singaporeans home.</p><p>She said that friends and relatives asked if she planned to stay in Australia after her graduation. In 2013, she was unsure of her answer. I hope that today, in 2015, having seen all the policy changes implemented by this Government, she is encouraged and can say with conviction that she is going to return to her home, to Singapore.</p><p>I call on this young lady and all young Singaporeans studying overseas, \"Come back to your home, be part of our nation building for the next 50 years and more. This is your home! This is our home!\" Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I support the Budget.</p><h6>12.43 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Speaker, for this opportunity to speak on the Budget delivered by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman on 23 February 2015.</p><p>Like many who have spoken before me, I applaud this year's Budget. Together with Budget 2013 and Budget 2014, this year's Budget completes the holistic coverage of assistance, incentives and provisions for Singaporeans of all ages \u2013 from the young and young adults who are studying or starting their careers, through to the middle-aged employees who are thinking of changing their careers or starting their own businesses, as well as Singaporeans who are in their golden years.</p><p>For this year's Budget, I am particularly heartened by the greater focus on income redistribution, assistance and recognition for alternative pathways in education and careers, as well as lifelong opportunities and provisions for learning, training and upgrading of skills. These signal the Government's commitment to greater equitability to ensure equal opportunities remain for all Singaporeans.</p><p>While I appreciate the extent of coverage and assistance of this year's Budget, I wish to surface three proposals for consideration by the Government when implementing the programmes and schemes presented in the Budget.</p><p>First, SkillsFuture. The full suite of SkillsFuture scheme is a welcome move for Singaporeans as it lays a clear pathway of learning, training and employment opportunities throughout one's career.</p><p>The SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme is useful for our Polytechnic and ITE graduates to gain relevant work experience and training that will lead to industry qualifications. However, may I propose that university graduates or even undergraduates, also be included in this programme? Particularly, I would like to propose that Singaporean University students from general degree or less-specialised programmes, such as Science or Arts in our local Government-funded universities, as well as locally-based private universities, be included in this programme.</p><p>I have met University graduates from general degree programmes or less-specialised programmes who face difficulty in being employed as they may not always be seen to have the relevant or required industry skills or qualifications. If the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme can be extended to such Singaporean University students, even while they are still undergraduates, it will certainly prepare them better in terms of employability.</p><p>The SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative is another scheme that I applaud. This initiative will help to identify and groom Singaporeans with the capabilities and potential to develop the right skills and experience and hone their leadership proficiencies. However, may I ask, is this initiative meant only for our local SMEs? Will MNCs also be able and encouraged to implement this initiative?</p><p>The reason I ask is because although largely anecdotal, I am sure we have heard from Singaporeans working in some MNCs that they have observed instances where those who are promoted or given leadership opportunities tend to be of the same race or ethnic backgrounds as the reporting or senior officers who usually tend to be foreigners and who are in positions of influence or power in these MNCs. Despite provisions by the Government to ensure equal opportunities and fairness in hiring and promotion, such as through TAFEP, MOM's Fair Consideration Framework and non-discriminatory hiring policies, these instances are still observed and felt by some Singaporeans. I urge the Government to create as wide a coverage as possible by including both the SMEs and MNCs. I look forward to the details of the SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative.</p><p>Second, stay-at-home-mothers (SAHMs), SkillsFuture and CPF. SAHMs is another group of Singaporeans I would like to make a pitch for under the SkillsFuture scheme. Based on 2014 data, the proportion of female Singaporeans and PRs who are employed seems to be on the uptrend from 2011 through to 2013, from the age group 25 years old and above. For the age group of 25 to 39 years old, more than 80% of our women are employed. This is encouraging. However, the numbers fall to below 80% for the age group 40 years old and above.</p><p>As our women become more highly-educated, have higher earning power, and marry and have children later, taking time off from work to be a stay-at-home-mother is increasingly an option. However, we recognise that the employment sector is a very dynamic one and work skills evolve rapidly.</p><p>Hence, the SkillsFuture Credit will be useful for stay-at-home mothers to finance their work skills-related courses while they are still stay-at-home mothers and before they return to the workforce. May I confirm that this will certainly be so for our stay-at-home-mothers? In addition, may I propose that the SkillsFuture Credit be made transferable between spouses and among family members? Hence, stay-at-home-mothers who need to undergo more intensive training can do so by utilising their husbands' SkillsFuture Credit, while stay-at-home-mothers who do not need the SkillsFuture Credit at that point in time, can transfer their credit to their husbands or other family members who can then utilise them.</p><p>Here, I would also like to propose that the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme be extended to stay-at-home-mothers who are returning to the workforce and who would like to equip themselves with current skills, experience and industry qualifications and that this programme can be extended to our stay-at-home-mothers on a part-time basis so that they can gradually return to the workforce.</p><p>For many stay-at-home-mothers, their CPF accounts do not receive any contributions during the time they are not working. Husbands who are gainfully employed and older children who are working can be encouraged to make voluntary top-ups or transfers to the CPF accounts of their wives or mothers. These top-ups should be made flexible and can be made from the husband's or children's CPF Ordinary Accounts and into the wife's or mother's CPF Ordinary or Medisave Accounts. The flexibility to transfer or top-up to one's Medisave Account will certainly help when MediShield Life premium payments kick in.</p><p>Third, on older Singaporeans and CPF contributions. I support the increased CPF contribution rates for older workers announced in this Budget. The 1% increase for each employer and employee contribution will be useful in helping Singaporeans to continue to save for retirement.</p><p>While I recognise that increasing CPF contribution rates for older workers may also create the adverse effect of making it less attractive for employers to continue to employ older Singaporeans, the reality is that our society is ageing. We will be working over more years as we are expected to live longer.</p><p>It is expedient to ask the Government to extend the 37% total CPF contribution to those aged 50 to 55, from up to age 50 only currently. It is also expedient to ask the Government to extend more Special Employment Credit to employ older workers. However, the onus is not just on the Government to give or provide more. Employers also need to re-look their hiring policies, specifically in retaining older workers beyond 50 years old.</p><p>It used to be that when someone tells you they are 50 years old, you may think the person is considered \"old\". But now, a 50-year-old is considered still young, with about 30 more years to live on average and can be economically active for at least another 15 years!</p><p>I hope that, in time, employers would be able to make that adjustment to retain older workers and eventually fully embrace the extended full 37% CPF contribution to beyond 50 years old for their workers. At this juncture, Mdm Speaker, please allow me to speak in Malay.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150304/vernacular-4 Mar 2015 _ Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar _ Debate on Budget Statement (Malay).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>I truly applaud the 2015 Budget because it presents the medium-term and long-term planning for Singaporeans of all backgrounds and capabilities.</p><p>The ultimate focus of this Budget is to provide support for skills and human capital upgrading, as well as lifelong learning. In my view, this is the main path for us as a nation with limited natural resources so that we can maintain our global competitiveness.</p><p>I am excited with the SkillsFuture scheme because I believe that many among our Malay/Muslim community can benefit from the schemes and incentives provided. I hope that we will not miss the opportunity to hone our skills and continue our education while enriching our work experience in an ever-changing world.</p><p>The SkillsFuture scheme also emphasises that a University degree is not the only path to success, to upgrade our skills and to find a better life for ourselves and for our families.</p><p>One role model is Mr Mustafa Lambak, who, I believe, many of us have already known through advertisements about Skills Upgrading and Lifelong Learning. Just like Mr Mustafa, we can also become good role models for our children so that we can inculcate in them the spirit of hard work, never giving up and to continue to pursue our dreams to improve our abilities and skills, regardless of age or background, as the saying goes, \"Like father, like son\".</p><p>At the same time, I would also suggest that the Government provide full waiver of fees for all Singaporean students who are studying full-time in mainstream schools or in private schools in Singapore and those who are sitting for the GCE \"O\", \"N\" and \"A\" level examinations, at least for the first time.</p><p>One particular example will be our students who are in the full-time madrasahs. This is one of the concerns of the Malay Members of Parliament from the People's Action Party as well as our Malay/Muslim community.</p><p>This suggestion is similar to the provision of the Edusave fund for all Singaporean students. I believe that no Singaporean student should be left behind in pursuing their dreams through educational opportunities.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;To conclude, Mdm Speaker, I am very heartened by this year's Budget, which complements the incentives, assistance schemes and provisions of the preceding years' Budgets.</p><p>Nonetheless, I hope the Government would consider the few proposals that I have made today, as we implement the schemes and programmes announced. With that, Mdm Speaker, I support the Budget.</p><h6>12.54 pm</h6><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, in Malay, please.</span></p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150304/vernacular-4 Mar 2015 _ Er Dr Lee Bee Wah _ Debate on Budget Statement (Malay).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>I would like to thank the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Mr Tharman, for crafting a Budget that is comprehensive and full of compassion. I am heartened to see that this year's Budget gives priority and emphasis on helping the less fortunate, as well as supporting and reducing the burden on the middle-income group.</p><p>The funds for education and learning are one way to provide assurance that the Government is very concerned and that it believes that lifelong learning is a rewarding investment because our people are the most important resource to Singapore.</p><p>I applaud this year's Budget because it focuses on the welfare of the elderly and demonstrates the Government's commitment to take care of them in their twilight years.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150304/vernacular-4 Mar 2015 _ Er Dr Lee Bee Wah _ Debate on Budget Statement (Malay).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>The interest rate for the first $30,000 in CPF will be increased to 6%. This news is very inspiring. I would like to ask the Government how the CPF Board is going to pay for this higher interest rate. Where will the money come from?</p><p>Now that we have such a high interest rate, surely my residents are very happy about it. If the economic situation allows, the housewives should take this opportunity to encourage their spouse or children to top up their Special and Retirement CPF accounts and save for the future. I hope the Government can provide more rebates to Singaporeans to encourage them to top up the CPF accounts of their family members who have no jobs.</p><p>In the area of preschool education, the Government is going to introduce a new Partner Operator Scheme. We are all looking forward to it. I hope this scheme can ensure that the school fees are kept at affordable levels. The details are yet to be announced. I hope this scheme will benefit not just the operators; the most important thing is for the parents to benefit directly. In the past, whenever the Government increased the subsidies, the operators will increase the school fees in tandem and the parents did not receive any benefits. I hope this time round, the parents' burden can be lessened by reduced school fees.</p><p>In addition, the Government will also do away with the examination fees. For poor families, this will greatly relieve their burdens. Talking about examination fees, I remember when I was in Secondary school, I needed to pay examination fees for taking national examinations. My father had no money and had to borrow from our relatives. Our relatives not only did not lend to him, but said, \"Daughters don't need to go to school, because daughters will be married out of the family in the future, like water thrown out\". Many years have passed and I still remember that incident. I really appreciate our education system, because better education can narrow the gap between the rich and the poor.</p><p>In the area of housing for the sandwiched class, I hope the Government can raise the family income ceilings so that more middle-income families will have the opportunity to buy HDB flats or ECs. Because of family income ceilings, some young couples are forced to buy private properties. Besides their own children, some young couples also need to look after their aged parents or grandparents; the mortgage to buy a private property has created a heavier financial burden on them.</p><p>Next, I am going to talk about petrol tax. Many residents have asked me why the Government is raising the petrol tax at this time. They are afraid that once the petrol tax is increased, the petrol companies will take the opportunity to increase the petrol prices and this may further cause other prices to rise, too. And as expected, as soon as the petrol tax is raised, the petrol companies raised the price of various grades of petrol. Who says that Singapore companies have low efficiency? The petrol price hike is higher than the petrol tax increase. One company even increased the diesel price whose tax is not even raised! When interviewed, their spokesman said, \"The petrol price depends on many factors, such as the storage cost, land cost and international fuel price.\" These are just excuses. Did their earlier price not include all these factors already? What is more, the international oil price has been declining all this while. The petrol companies must have made a lot of money.</p><p>We all know that what these petrol companies are doing is what we call \"looting during a fire\"; as my residents put it, \"They just increase the price, willy nilly\".</p><p>Next, I would like to talk about our SMEs.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, our businesses are disappointed with this Budget because they are facing a lot of challenges on the tightening of manpower. They thought that they can get some help from this Budget. The only consolation they have is the levy deferment.</p><p>Because our country is not big, we need to have foreign workforce supplementing where we are short of, if we are to help our economy keep pace with the changing global economy. They are necessary in sectors that often experience shortages of manpower, either because locals do not want to do the jobs or they lack the skills.</p><p>It is prudent that the Government, working closely with the trade associations of each sector, study how best to increase productivity and also their manpower needs. Many sectors will need more hand-holding if the Government can point them to the right direction and more productive work processes and practices which are proven in other countries, I am sure many of our companies would like to embrace the call for productivity.</p><p>A one-size-fits-all solution will not work across the board, as every sector has different challenges and the nature of the jobs is varied. For example, companies that produce goods or services for export, can we give them more foreign workers as they bring in foreign revenues? And for those companies in, for example, ship-repairing, ship-building, they are saying that without manpower how are they going to compete with companies overseas?</p><p>But let us not only think of foreign workforce in the field of manual work. There are some skilled personnel that we are in great need of, such as healthcare professionals and trained pre-school educators. There are insufficient teachers to meet the demand and grooming local educators takes time. In the meantime, a short-term solution to this crucial problem is hiring capable, qualified teachers from abroad.</p><p>In Taiwan, the pre-school teachers are bilingual and place great emphasis on environment cleanliness in their teachings, a valuable concept that should be imparted to children at a young age. We should, therefore, carefully take in more of such foreign workers who can add value to our society.</p><p>I am glad to note that the Government will be giving greater support and funding for SMEs to try out new ideas and venture abroad. But we should not put them on a boat with some rations and then expect them to sail the high seas.</p><p>I believe there would be government-to-government projects we can offer great opportunities for SMEs to participate in and to gain international exposure. Opportunities for such projects should be open to SMEs and not just GLCs like Jurong Consultants and Surbana. I believe SMEs, if given the chance and guidance, will be able to perform just as well.</p><p>Give our local contractors opportunities to do local projects so that they can build up their capability. These days, many big Government projects are still awarded to foreign contractors. I am not asking for a protectionist policy, but we should promote buy-Singapore products and services first. If our local companies can do it, we do not need to give it to foreign contractors. The Government should lead by example.</p><p>If our companies cannot win local projects, how would they stand a chance to venture overseas? I urge the Government to give them the boost they need. Our local construction industry, if properly developed, has great potential to venture overseas because there are lots of infrastructure projects overseas.</p><p>Additionally, many SMEs require transport to run their businesses, but they cannot compete with the big businesses in bidding for COEs, for example. I hope the enhanced Early Turnover Scheme can help them to continue to be able to afford a vehicle. I am eagerly awaiting details for improvements to the scheme.</p><p>Regardless of the sector, continuous education and training are always necessary to promote growth, be it at the individual or company level. SkillsFuture Credit is a good concept and the financial commitment from the Government is a clear indication that being less well-off should not stop one from improving your skills to seek a better future and contribute to our economic success.</p><p>However, more must be done to instil a mindset change in Singaporeans, from employees to employers, to respect craftsmen and all workers, regardless of whether they are white collar or blue collar workers. We should not be biased towards academic grades. Currently, almost everybody wants to be managers, CEOs. How many of us are willing to dirty our hands? Indeed, we need more skilled craftsmen, artisans, welders, builders, technicians, electricians, plumbers and so on.</p><p>We should pursue lifelong learning because of our own interest, because of our job requirements, that is, we can do our work more effectively and efficiently, not just for that piece of paper qualification.</p><p>Besides the MOE and WDA, ITE, Polytechnics and Universities should have more modular courses to meet the needs of the workforce. We need to offer a greater variety of courses so that we can reinforce the notion that education is for everybody at any level, not just those who are academically-inclined.</p><p>Learning how to fish to be self-sufficient is an important rule of life that should be ingrained in every Singaporean. We learn continuously to become the masters of our future.</p><p>As employees are making the effort to upgrade themselves, similarly, employers must open up. They, too, must set aside resources to groom employees and give them the opportunity to move up the ladder and, eventually, perhaps, to lead the company. Why must we always look outside when companies are looking for CEOs? Are foreigners necessarily better than Singaporeans? Perhaps, they can speak and present better!</p><p>Last but not least, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Mr Tharman has shared that development expenditures will grow to $30 billion by 2020. Investing in infrastructure is the right thing to do. Not every government can afford to do so without borrowing money, without printing money. Only a prudent and caring government like ours is capable of doing it.</p><p>We have read of countries which are struggling with their budgets and their deficits. Here, we are fortunate to have taken a balanced approach over the years in managing the economy. Because of this, today, we are able to give a good spread on the Budget menu to provide for the people.&nbsp;It is a Government that will not fall prey to populist rhetoric and yet it is not insensitive to sensible feedback from the people to build a fair and inclusive society. We must give credit to our Government.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, if every Singaporean is constantly learning new things to improve ourselves, if every company gives their employees the recognition and opportunity, I see a lot of hope in the future. I support this Budget, a future-ready Budget.</p><h6>1.10 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, a major theme of this year's Budget revolves around preparing Singapore and Singaporeans for the future. The two aspects of the Budget that are the focus of my speech are SkillsFuture and, more briefly, the inclusion of Temasek in the Net Investment Returns Framework. On both fronts, the Government has considerable experience to call upon and Singapore is not starting from a zero base.</p><p>First, SkillsFuture. As a national philosophy, upgrading of skills and lifelong learning are not a new phenomenon. Almost 35 years ago, then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew announced at the 1979 National Day Rally that the Skills Development Fund would be set up, compelling employers to pay a percentage of wages into the Skills Development Fund, as recommended by the National Wages Council. A month later, Minister for Finance Hon Sui Sen informed Parliament that the introduction of a Skills Development Levy was a necessary intervention, as the Singapore economy had to be upgraded and restructured promptly for Singapore to move up the economic value chain.</p><p>The Skills Development Levy Act of 1979 legislated skills upgrading primarily at low-level workers but also included mid-level workers and managers, too, with some, especially those involved in technology work, sent overseas for training in the early 1980s. Since the Skills Development Levy was introduced in 1979, an entire eco-system of training and skills upgrading has been part of the governance firmament in Singapore.</p><p>Lifelong learning is also not a new phenomenon. The Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund was first announced by then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in the year 2000 to promote and support lifelong learning in Singapore and to provide assistance and opportunities for Singaporeans to meet the needs of a knowledge-based economy and cope with the threat of structural unemployment.</p><p>Last year, during Budget 2014, it was announced that the Fund would be topped up by $500 million, bringing the Fund size up to a total of $4.6 billion. A decade later, by 2010, the National Productivity Fund was launched with a $1 billion injection. This year's Budget will see another injection of $1.5 billion into the Fund.</p><p>Over the years, the Workforce Skills Qualifications framework, a key component of the Continuing Education and Training (CET) system, allowed Singaporeans to improve their qualifications in various industries, from certificate up to diploma level, and even graduate diplomas for certain industries. In industries where there has been an acute shortage of skilled professionals, the Workforce Development Agency (WDA) has even introduced scholarships at the post-graduate level, thus providing opportunities for professionals who wish to upgrade themselves further. There are currently 34 WSQ frameworks covering the manufacturing and services sectors, such as precision engineering, aerospace, retail, hospitality, community and social services, financial services, infocomm and logistics, some of which have also been identified under SkillsFuture initiatives, in particular, Earn and Learn.</p><p>When the Skills Development Levy Act was amended in 2008 to cover all employees, including those earning more than $2,000 a month, in a functional way, the seeds were sown for SkillsFuture, with the Skills Development Levy acting as the primary tool to better support the CET system supporting all workers, regardless of age, skill or education level, to upgrade and seize new opportunities as they progress in their careers.</p><p>The long tail of experience surrounding retraining and lifelong learning makes it important for the Government to identify why and how SkillsFuture is different. How will it mark a critical shift away from the&nbsp;existing skills upgrading framework and what shifts in thinking among Singaporeans will be required for it to work?</p><p>To this end, the identification of the starting point of the journey in schools and in the provision of career counsellors commonplace in many Western countries like the US and Canada is a good place to start.</p><p>However, as the challenge is to convince hearts and minds, especially of those parents in an Asian society fixated on grades and a tuition culture, this will not be easy. To this end, I hope career counsellors in schools will work together with parents to identify the strengths and interests of students, with parents also playing their part in motivating children to aim for excellence, regardless of which path they choose.</p><p>Even employers will need to imbibe a new mindset and to accept that skills upgrading is a fact of life. Employees are more likely to stay on in a firm if the firm also shows a readiness to upgrade itself, too, and attempts to adopt new work processes, for example, appreciating the importance of work-life balance in the Singapore of today and tomorrow where the reality of dual-income households can leave precious little time to raise young children and to look after our elderly, to say nothing of pursuing other interests, such as community volunteerism or the onset of a medical issue for a family member.</p><p>A new feature of our skills upgrading system is the creation of SkillsFuture credit which provides learning credits for all Singaporeans above 25 years of age, supported by regular top-ups. The SkillsFuture credit largely mirrors the proposal made in the 2004 independent review by Lord Sandy Leitch to maximise the economic growth skills and social justice in the UK by 2020. The Leitch Review of Skills proposed the establishment of a Learner Account as the centrepiece of what it called Adult Vocational Further Education. In fact, the Earn and Learn work-study programme under SkillsFuture is also conceptually similar to the Leitch Review's \"Train to Gain\" programme with the focus on apprenticeships.</p><p>In fact, the creation of a SkillsFuture Credit along the lines of the UK model was also proposed in this House in 2010. I remember the Government's reply then was: \"International studies show that by providing a training account with monetary value may still not be the best and most effective way of motivating individuals to take up courses. What we have today in our system is a CET infrastructure that comprises a large number of training courses that individuals can go forward and sign up.\"</p><p>In view of this stated position of the Government five years ago, how does the Government envisage the provision of the SkillsFuture Credit as being enough of an incentive to motivate Singaporeans to take up courses to improve themselves?</p><p>In recommending the Learner Account, the Leitch report noted that for about 20% of those who did not pursue upgrading in the UK, lack of funding was not a reason. In fact, high course fees, lack of childcare support and transport were some of the potential issues that workers had to take into account when deciding whether to upgrade their skills.</p><p>In response, the UK government had sought to provide some basic courses for free in addition to extending study loans repayable only after a worker has exceeded a certain salary. It had also made an allowance for a support fund to provide assistance for costs, such as childcare, transport, books, equipment that can mitigate the impact of financial problems workers face as they upgrade their skills.</p><p>While some of these gaps are specific to the situation in the UK and in addition to their applicability or otherwise in the Singapore context, they are nonetheless lessons for Singapore and the Government should regularly review and identify the reasons why Singaporean workers may be hesitant to upgrade their skills as it looks to make SkillsFuture a success.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the SkillsFuture Council will have its hands full as SkillsFuture cannot represent upgrading for the sake of upgrading. Minister mentioned in his speech that the key challenge of SkillsFuture is to help uplift the SMEs and involve them in this process of skills development.</p><p>In the UK, a parliamentary innovation University's science and skills select committee in the wake of the Leitch report noted with concern that the conflation of skills and qualifications in targets could lead the UK government to assume that a qualification strategy is an adequate substitute or proxy for an overall skills strategy. The select committee noted that a qualification-focused strategy which identifies the numbers of workers who have upgraded their qualifications would inadvertently reinforce or could inadvertently reinforce the skills gap if companies were unable to achieve high-performance working practices and thereby raise productivity.</p><p>To this end, as SkillsFuture gets off the ground, it may be worthwhile for the Government to track the qualification and certification outcomes of SkillsFuture initiatives, especially for SMEs, so as to assess how the scheme has been effective in achieving the desired productivity increases and economic outcomes so as to better track the real value of the SkillsFuture initiatives for various industries.</p><p>The formation of the SkillsFuture Council has also resulted in the devolution of the CET oversight from the National Productivity and Continuing Education Council to the SkillsFuture Council. With the NPCEC renamed as the National Productivity Council also headed by the Finance Minister, greater synergies and coordination between both councils can be expected.</p><p>This administrative change should be a lot more significant than a mere change of nomenclature. This point is worthy of some reflection, considering the large amounts of public funds that will be devoted to SkillsFuture. For example, $250 million was set aside from the National Productivity Fund to improve productivity for the construction industry in 2010. Five years later, in view of the productivity numbers, there is some legitimate doubt as to how effective these huge investments have been.</p><p>Once again, going forward, the provision of an institutionalised, dedicated and regular review framework can be helpful to arrest efforts and correct the course of action that does not appear to be engendering favourable results. And this would be more critical over time as the reality of less physical room for manoeuvre becomes a reality, if it has not already.</p><p>Finally, some practical skills and qualifications are not learnt through skills upgrading but in the course of National Service, too, where specific skills or credit can be relevant in the private sector. Repair and maintenance certification and operating of heavy machinery and vehicles and leadership skills are part of a lifelong learning skills framework. These can give our NSmen a leg-up at certain workplaces.</p><p>I understand a similar recommendation was also made by the Committee to Strengthen National Service and I hope that skills and qualifications earned during the course of NS are constantly reviewed and incorporated into the SkillsFuture framework as far as practically possible.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the increased spending on human capital for the future must mean increased Government expenditure. For this reason, amongst the others, the Minister has announced the inclusion of the expected investment returns of Temasek in the NIR framework. The move of our reserves held by MAS and GIC from the NIR framework to the Net Investment Income (NII) framework was the subject of an extensive Constitutional amendment Bill debate in 2008.</p><p>Then, the Minister established that as Temasek was expected to make higher returns and was not encumbered from investing in high-risk assets, it would be difficult to project Temasek's future earnings. The Minister has stated in his 2015 Budget speech that Temasek's equity-only portfolio will continue to be more volatile and subject to more pronounced investment cycles than the MAS and GIC portfolios. For this reason, a brief primer from the Minister on the expected long-term real returns from Temasek's inclusion in the NIR framework and its methodology would be appreciated. In reply to Non-constituency Member of Parliament Mr Gerald Giam's Parliamentary Question in 2014, the Minister stated that for FY2009 to FY2013, the Government took in about 47% of the NIR and that the NIR contribution has been able to supplement the Budget by $7 billion to $8 billion annually.</p><p>I would like to enquire from the Minister, based on current projections, how much would subsequent Budgets be supplemented with Temasek's inclusion in the NIR framework.</p><p>In conclusion, Mdm Speaker, the Minister spoke at the 2014 Budget debate about changing social norms in three broad areas: in the workplace, in professional competencies and to change habits for the better. This was not hard policy&nbsp;per se&nbsp;but related to the important softer aspects which can be the critical factor that makes the difference between how successful or unsuccessful a policy is.</p><p>SkillsFuture requires social norms and attitudes towards education to change. A deep mindset shift towards lifelong education must truly be the goal for all Singaporeans. With human capital as our only natural resource, a more forgiving attitude must be exercised towards people who may not have succeeded at the first instance, either in an exam or at some other important career cross junction. Equally important, the opportunity for skills upgrading and a second chance should be one every Singaporean must grab with both hands.</p><p>SkillsFuture must be positioned as a key feature of the Singapore system. A large part of the continuing economic prosperity of Singapore should also serve as a report card for SkillsFuture. My recommendation to track the expenditure and to constantly review the implementation of SkillsFuture, notwithstanding, I support the initiative and encourage Singaporeans to draw up, review and update their own skills upgrading and career objectives and to tap on the initiatives that would be rolled out under SkillsFuture.</p><h6>1.24 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr K Karthikeyan (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, thank you very much for allowing me to join in this debate. I am happy that one of the key focuses for Budget 2015 is fostering deep skills and innovation. SkillsFuture which is aimed at giving opportunities to all citizens to develop themselves throughout life will promote the mastery of skills in every job, regardless of its holder's academic qualifications or grades.</p><p>This has been what the Labour Movement had been working on with our unionised companies and tripartite partners since 2012, through the Progressive Wage Model (PWM). PWM is a framework consisting of a four-in-one model of skills upgrading, productivity improvements, wage progression and career advancement, without looking at academic qualifications alone but through skills certification and experience.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the introduction of the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn programme that matches Polytechnic and ITE graduates with employers for structured on-the-job training and mentorship leading to industry qualification, is a good scheme. It is also important for the Government to work with employers and industry partners on sectorial manpower plans \u2013 mapping out education, training and career progression based on projected skills needs.</p><p>Back in 2012, the NTUC Oil Petrol Energy Chemical (OPEC) Cluster, set aside a $13 million funding for three years for training and skills upgrading, so as to grow the Singaporean Core. NTUC's OPEC Cluster comprises seven unions which take care of workers from Oil &amp; Gas, Petroleum/Refineries, Energy/Power, Chemicals and Biomedical Science sectors. The cluster was formed to create synergies amongst the tripartite partners and to help efforts to push forth better jobs and progressively higher wages for our workers.</p><p>Together, with e2i and WDA, the $13 million funding, aimed to benefit at least 1,000 technical professionals in the OPEC sectors to achieve higher wages progressively by 2015 by (a) attracting locals with skills upgrading to uphold the Singaporean Core; (b) strengthening training and development frameworks; and (c) enhancing career pathways from technical to engineering professions.</p><p>To date, I am happy to note that more than 900 technical professionals have enjoyed better progression in the four areas of skills, productivity, career and wages.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, this would not be possible without industry collaboration and close tripartite partnership with the companies and industry partners and funding support from the various economic agencies, such as e2i and WDA. Economic agencies like EDB also shared on the future skills set required in this industry.</p><p>As a cluster, our unionised companies and economic agencies came together to put in place relevant WSQ trainings, for example, WSQ Apply Principles in Low Voltage Distribution Network and WSQ Detect and Locate Underground Power Cables or WSQ Higher Certificate in Process Technology. And traineeship programmes, such as Place-and-Train programmes, structured in-house training and learning on-the-job, in-job role-specific processes, tools and equipment, so as to deepen both technical and soft-skills. In addition, career-progression pathways are being mapped out to indicate the competencies and skills needed for workers to progress through successive stages of their careers.</p><p>The incentives include subsidising companies' training costs and providing new hires with training allowances during their traineeships for a period of up to the first 12 months of employment with functional skills and also gain a good overview of the company's operations. One such beneficiary is Ms Regina Tan, who joined Singapore Power after graduating with a Degree in Mechanical Engineering. She shared that under e2i's Place and Train initiative, \"We had the chance to attend structured training comprising several WSQ programmes and on-the-job training. This allowed us to be well equipped before the start of the job.\"</p><p>Mdm Speaker, while it has been quite successful in the OPEC cluster, I hope that the WSQ framework will be more inclusive, to cover more areas across industries and, hence, set standards within the different sectors.</p><p>Such skills certification and progression ladders should be recognised by the industry as a whole and this requires industry collaboration. More can be done if all parties work together. It is important for us to continue to build upon a skills ladder, so that companies are supported by future-ready talent and capabilities, so that our workers are better trained, agile and adaptable to future requirements.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, under the PWM model, we encourage companies to improve productivity so that workers can carry out their jobs more effectively and efficiently. We believe that companies which can reinvent themselves through technology solutions and innovation will be more prepared to deal with future challenges. And, more importantly, our workers will have sustained real wage increases.</p><p>However, we need companies to be more forthcoming in identifying gaps, redesigning work, reviewing work processes, innovating and developing new products and services. Only then can we be more hopeful that we can have quantum-leap improvements in productivity and sustained real wage increases. So, this is important and more needs to be done in this area.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I applaud the Government in coming up with incentives and grants to encourage and support companies as they transform and innovate. I hope that companies can tap on the various Budget 2015 initiatives, for example, new tax incentives, Capability Development Grant, Productivity and Innovation Credit, and do more to improve productivity through innovation, optimise available manpower and value every worker.</p><p>Within the OPEC cluster, we have unionised companies like Infineum who has been increasing its effort on automation and the redesign of its work processes. The company also put in place an enhanced training and progression programme, which included modular courses and on-the-job training under the Progressive Wage Model (PWM). Technicians could be crossed-trained to upskill and move up the career pathways. A stable and reliable workforce, with average service of the technician pool at 15 years with the company and flawless performance in the company's operation translates to certainty in bottom line for the company. The ongoing productivity culture, such as RFID&nbsp;\u2013 readings of equipment captured in pass card automatically, also for safety reasons; or the redesigning of pump reading, lowering down meter, so that the worker need not climb up the ladder to see the reading and time-saving and age-friendly measures were also put in, also resulted in a significant increase of production over the last decade. Mdm Speaker, allow me to say a few words in Tamil.</p><p>(<em>In Tamil</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150304/vernacular-4 Mar 2015 _ Mr K Karthikeyan _ Debate on Budget Statement (Tamil).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, there are some Indians in Singapore who hold high positions. Nevertheless, there are many who find it difficult to progress in their jobs. Rather than find reasons for that, they should upgrade their skills. They should make use of the SkillsFuture Credit announced by the Government in this Budget to their advantage. They should come forward to take several efforts to upgrade their skills. They should approach their companies and apply to have them sent for skills upgrading training. Such training will be of great help to them in future.</p><p>We all remember hearing the Tamil movie song in the 1960s: \"Learn a craft and you will certainly agree that there shall be no worries\", which is important even today. In keeping with the Tamil proverb that \"what we have learnt is but a handful and what we have not learnt is as wide as the world\", we should come forward to continue learning regardless of our age. We should make use of the Government's assistance scheme and educate our children as far as possible. Do not put a halt to their studies because of a shortage of money. Approach the Government agencies for assistance.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, in summary, all four ladders \u2013 skills, career, productivity and wages \u2013 are integral and equally important components of the PWM and they must go hand in hand to ensure sustainable wage increases.</p><p>If wages go up without any rise in productivity, there will be an erosion of business competitiveness and a loss of jobs if the business downsizes itself. It is not a sustainable solution either for businesses to maintain competitiveness and profits by keeping wages down.</p><p>To uplift the broad-based business growth of companies and to help Singaporeans develop their careers across our economy, we need new forms of industry collaboration. With Budget 2015, I hope that all tripartite partners, companies and economic agencies can work together for the benefit of all. I borrow my fellow Nominated Member of Parliament Chia Yong Yong's guideline: if we lean too much to the right tool, then we are not doing the right thing. So, I applaud the Deputy Prime Minister for his balanced Budget. Madam, I support the Budget.</p><h6>1.34 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)&nbsp;</strong>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150304/vernacular-Seng Han Thong Budget 4 March 2015_Chinese_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>I remember that during my childhood days, when we worshipped our ancestors during the festive seasons, my grandmother would point to the offerings on the table and say: \"It would be better for us to serve her a drink while she is alive than to worship and offer her a chicken drumstick after she has passed away.\" What she meant was that actions speak louder than words and it is better to do it now rather than later. Lastly, something tangible is better than something imagined.</p><p>The Silver Support Scheme recently announced in the Budget was just that. A&nbsp;Lianhe Zaobao&nbsp;editorial said this was the highlight of Budget 2015. Indeed, to the 15,000 low-income elderly, this was a highlight. And to the Government, it is a challenge to let this group understand our intention that we not only want them to see that we care, but truly feel that we do. It is a challenge as this group is one with very little information, limited means of communication and gullible.</p><p>Just recently, it was reported that an old man was made to believe that he owed the Government money and had to work day and night to pay back. It was hon Member Mr Hri Kumar who later told him in person that he did not owe the Government any money.</p><p>I believe this old man is covered under the Silver Support Scheme and, this time round, if Mr Hri Kumar were to tell him that, in fact, the Government would like to give him money, he would be frightened and ask why the Government wants to give him money. My point here is that reaching out to this group of seniors is really a challenge.</p><p>I would like to commend the Pioneer Generation Office and their efforts in promoting the PGP. This is a&nbsp;hongbao&nbsp;packet given by the Pioneer Generation Office. It is very creative and very meaningful. It comes in a set of four, each with a meaningful phrase printed on it, such as \"Building Our Nation\", \"Sharing Our Joy\", \"One Sustained Effort\" and \"Passing Our Traditions to the Next Generation\". This is wonderful!</p><p>In the same spirit, I believe the Government can come up with creative ways to explain the Silver Support Scheme so that the 15,000 disadvantaged elderly can understand the scheme. As Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Mr Tharman has mentioned, this scheme is meant to help provide some relief for the disadvantaged. It is not the same as meeting a Fortune God or striking 4D. It is a token from the Government to let them know that even though life may not be easy, they have a good Government to take care of them.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, the Silver Support Scheme is a new feature in our social security landscape. As the Deputy Prime Minister put it, together with Workfare, both constitute the fourth pillar of our social security. They will help mitigate life's inequalities. The Deputy Prime Minister also said, \"It reflects a value we must preserve as an inclusive society.\" So, the very objective of this scheme is to help mitigate life's inequalities.</p><p>The challenge to the Government is how do we ensure that this message of helping to mitigate life's inequalities is put across to the 150,000 elderly Singaporeans aged 65 and above who will benefit from this scheme?</p><p>As we know, many of these vulnerable seniors are not well-informed, not well-connected and, from time to time, they can be misinformed. Some of them work as cleaners, hawker assistants and there are reports that they are being cheated on their hard-earned money and savings. Not long ago, we read in the newspapers that our fellow Member Mr Hri Kumar had to visit the house of an old man who had to work two jobs to return the money he owed to the Government. That is the challenge to the Government: how can we put across the benefit of this scheme to the seniors like this vulnerable old man? When they receive money from someone, they will also ask, \"Why give me this money? Is it true?\"</p><p>However, some may take it as \"teok bay peow<em>\"</em>&nbsp;or \u8d22 \u67db \u5230. As the Deputy Prime Minister put it, \"It is like Hock Lee Por\" of the olden days. Many believe that the \"Hock Lee Por\" is meant to help the vulnerable. So, I am confident that we can come up with a similar communication programme to reach out to this group that the Government is here to help and help the vulnerable for life.</p><h6>1.39 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, I speak in support of this Budget. This is a very interesting Budget in many ways. A number of speakers before me have said this Budget seems to signify a further move towards the left for the Government.</span></p><p>To me, I personally find this an interesting Budget because I think we move beyond the concepts of right and left in many ways. Singapore has grown and done very well, perhaps better than many other colonies, post-independence, largely because we have always been an open economy; we have embraced free trade, free investments and these created good jobs for our people. This may classically be considered ideas to the right. At the same time, though, we have also worked very hard to protect workers' interests, develop strong unions and these may very well be classified as ideas to the left.</p><p>What is really special about this Budget, though, is that it probably sets us in the right direction for the future, given the context we are in at the moment.</p><p>Understanding our context is quite important. Capitalism itself was never a system that developed top-down. It was something that evolved over many years, starting very simply with people trading, eventually finance developed, people started borrowing. So, it was a system that evolved bit by bit over the centuries. Understanding where we stand now in capitalism is probably an important starting point.</p><p>According to a McKinsey study, in the 1930s, the average lifespan of a Fortune 500 company was about 90 years. In the last few years, the average lifespan of a Fortune 500 company is just 18 years. This is a very important shift in the way we understand business and the way we understand capitalism. What it means is that in a person's lifetime, the company he is working for may very well no longer exist. The Fortune 500 companies represent the largest best capitalised companies in America. If the average lifespan of even those companies is 18 years, what that means is that for many other companies, the lifespan may well be less than 18 years.</p><p>In one human lifetime, that would mean that we may have to work in many different companies. Even if you look at the companies that have lasted for a long time, companies, such as General Motors and General Electric. General Motors has gone into very difficult times many times over, but has maintained its main business in automobiles. What that means for individuals who have worked within is that they may lose their jobs and there may be times when the company goes through a bad patch. General Electric is almost unrecognisable as the company it originally was. It no longer makes electrical appliances as its main business. It has moved into a variety of other businesses. So, again, what that means for individuals there is that they have also lost their jobs many times.</p><p>In this respect, the first aspect of the Budget that I would like to discuss in some detail is SkillsFuture. SkillsFuture plays an important part in preparing people for the age of capitalism that we are moving into or we are living in at the moment and are likely to face, going forward.</p><p>SkillsFuture requires our people to look towards their own lifespans with a view that they may have to change jobs many times in their life. They cannot assume that the same companies they start working in will be there forever. The SkillsFuture package starts in schools. It starts with internships and with education and career counselling for students. What this means is that students in schools will have to start learning and thinking about their future and their jobs at a much earlier stage. I think this is important. Certainly, when I was in school, career counselling was not a big part of the education system. Education was taught for the purpose of learning and that was the main purpose of education. But the reality is that students will probably have to be mentally prepared to pick up skills even while they are studying.</p><p>So, starting in school is an important first step. What would be important in making this part of SkillsFuture succeed is that the education and career counsellors should have sufficient familiarity with industry to be able to advise students about the skills that they will need when they get out into the working world.</p><p>The next aspect of SkillsFuture is just as important and, perhaps, the most important. This is the SkillsFuture package that will affect people after they start working. There are two components to this. The first is SkillsFuture Credit. This is where money is put aside for people to invest in SkillsFuture programmes. The second is the availability of schemes like SkillsFuture Study awards and fellowships. This, basically, provides financing for people to learn again at a future stage.</p><p>Now, I suspect people should actually take these learning opportunities not only as and when they need them because trouble arises, but also in anticipation of problems. In making sure that these things work, what would be important is to ensure the SkillsFuture Credit is sufficient for people to pay for the courses they need, in order to get the new jobs that may become available, especially where industries may become redundant or companies may be folding up. It is important that people use the SkillsFuture Credit for programmes that will equip them for their next job, as opposed to just spending it because there is some money there that needs to be spent.</p><p>The final pillar of SkillsFuture which will be quite important is industry collaboration. Having said that businesses may not last very long and that businesses' lifespan may be much shorter, what this means is that industry collaboration probably has to be a dynamic process. We will have to engage new employers on an ongoing basis, get their buy-in to train employees and invest in employees.</p><p>In this regard, one interesting aspect we might want to look at is a review of our employment laws. In many other countries, employment laws are much more rigid. They provide more protection to employees but that also means that it makes employers more cautious in employing. For example, in countries where termination or redundancy payments are statutorily pegged at a fairly high level, that means there is a high opportunity cost to fire an employee. That also means companies will be more careful about employing people. But what this also means is that when a company does employ people, the employment relationship itself is likely to last longer. And because of that, companies may be more incentivised to invest in employees and invest in training employees. So, this is a careful balancing act.</p><p>I think one of the reasons Singapore has a very low unemployment rate is because employers are very happy to employ as they know that the employment relationship can be ended by either party quite easily. However, if they are to realise that employment is going to be a longer term investment, they will be slower to employ. So, I think what we could do is probably have our employment laws moved to be slightly more protective to give employees a bit more protection but perhaps not to the extreme of some of our Western counterparts. This will still give Singapore a competitive advantage in the employment market, but, at the same time, allow both employers and employees to see the employment relationship as a slightly longer term one in which they might be more incentivised to invest.</p><p>Let me deal with one more aspect of the Budget that I think is quite important in the context of our evolving backdrop. Company lifespans are shortening but, quite happily, our people's lifespans are not. In fact, Singaporeans have one of the longest life expectancies in the world and very close to the Japanese. Most Singaporeans will be living beyond the age of 80. And what that means is that retirement adequacy becomes very important.</p><p>In this Budget, there are two important initiatives that deal with retirement adequacy. The first is that the CPF LIFE scheme is now being replaced by a more flexible scheme so that people will have three options. They can decide what amount they wish to put aside at the age of 55. Based on that, that amount will determine the income they will get once they cross the age of 65. So, in that sense, it gives people more control over their retirement.</p><p>The second important element that has been introduced is the Silver Support Scheme. This essentially gives retirees additional top-ups for those who might not have enough income in retirement and this covers the bottom 20%-30%. This is actually quite generous. I think an understanding of this has to be coupled with other schemes that are already in place in dealing with retirement. This includes schemes, such as allowing people to downsize by buying studio apartments. So, when they buy studio apartments, a large amount of capital will be released which they can use in any way they like, including, perhaps, to buy a more adequate CPF LIFE scheme. The second element that is quite important to retirement adequacy is the Lease Buyback Scheme. With this being extended to 4-room flats, this, again, allows people to capitalise on an asset and get more income.</p><p>Ultimately, what all of these schemes try to do is to give people adequate income in retirement. For most Singaporeans, the focus should be on how much income they think they will need in retirement and then deciding whether or not they can set aside enough at that time. So, CPF LIFE gives them some flexibility with that; the Lease Buyback Scheme gives them some; studio apartment scheme gives them more. These are all different schemes they can rely on. Of course, if children support them, that will be yet another source of income.</p><p>But in dealing with retirement adequacy, it is still possible for us to probably do even more to give people even more flexibility. One suggestion I have is to allow the CPF LIFE scheme to be charged against a person's HDB flat or property. So, what that means is that if a person does not have, say, $200,000 in the CPF account but wishes to get a higher income at the age of 65, he can agree to take a charge against his property for whatever sum his CPF might be short of, to top up with that amount. This will allow him to get a steady income after the age of 65. Part of that agreement, of course, will be that after, say, the individual and his spouse have passed on and when the flat is sold, the amount that has been borrowed against this flat will be paid back. So, this is yet another scheme that will give more flexibility to people to increase their income at retirement.</p><p>My suspicion is that this scheme will be most useful to those who are not eligible for the Lease Buyback Scheme. So, for those living in 5-room flats and perhaps for those living in private properties, who may want to stay where they are staying but will not qualify for the Lease Buyback Scheme, this will at least give them the option of getting more income out of the CPF LIFE option. An alternative to get the same result would be to extend the Lease Buyback Scheme to, say, even 5-room flats. This will allow more people to get income from their capitalised assets. But all in all, I think that this Budget makes important steps in providing for the retirement adequacy of people and in giving them options to get more income when they retire.</p><p>Let me finally deal with one issue that I think is of concern to many of my friends in this House, that is, the fact that this Budget is running a fairly significant deficit of about $6.7 billion. The reason that I would still support this Budget, notwithstanding this, is because a lot of this deficit arises from investments, including about $3 billion for Changi Airport's development. So, these are unlikely to be recurring expenditures.</p><p>In terms of looking at whether this deficit spending has any long-term implications, I will cautiously say that I do not expect it to be so. I am hoping that our future operational expenditures can be met by the operating income we will have, as well as the expanded income from the Net Investment Income that we will be getting from Temasek.</p><p>In that respect, I would support the Budget, notwithstanding the deficit. And I think it is important to know that this deficit is also being financed by surpluses we have had from previous Budgets within this term of Parliament. So, we are still not passing on a heavier burden to whoever may be here in the next term of Parliament.</p><p>With all this, I speak in support of the Budget. I think it is an important step in getting Singaporeans ready for the phase of capitalism that we are living in at the moment. I am not sure whether it is right or left, but I think it is certainly setting us in the right direction.</p><h6>1.53 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I will cover two aspects of the Budget in my speech.</p><p>First is on developing our local companies. Next, I will touch on developing our people for this new economy. I wish to declare that I own and operate local companies classified as SMEs.</p><p>I have spoken various times in this House about the importance of developing local companies, especially our SMEs. I have been concerned about our heavy reliance on MNCs and on Government-linked Companies to drive our economy. I acknowledge that we do need to be a relevant destination for MNCs as they provide a good source of employment and economic activities, as well as bring expertise into Singapore and open our access to new markets.</p><p>We need to complement the strategy of foreign investment with growing a sufficient base of strong local companies who are global leaders in their fields. The persistent lack of ground-up home-grown global leaders is rather worrying as we become a high-cost base where some MNCs will shun away from.</p><p>The recent productivity data is quite telling. Productivity growth has been good for export-oriented companies and for those in the finance sector, but it is negative for those focused on the domestic economy. Since our restructuring drive started in 2009, total cumulative labour productivity growth till today is 13%. However, the growth had come in just the two years when we were recovering from a severe downturn. In those two years, with good revenue growth, even those servicing the domestic economy had good productivity growth.</p><p>I believe we can conclude a few things from the data. Strong revenue growth is needed to achieve jumps in productivity. There will be limitations in increasing labour productivity through improving efficiencies if companies cannot find big new revenue sources through change in business processes or from new markets.</p><p>Hence, I am happy to see many of the measures in this Budget, some of which I had called for previously. First is on Merger and Acquisitions (M&amp;As). The domestic economy is serviced by more than a hundred thousand companies, of which, the vast majority are small and micro companies. It is challenging to make quantum leaps in productivity on small operating scales. I had called for the M&amp;A schemes to be greatly improved so that it will incentivise companies to amalgamate. Companies can acquire to buy market share or to absorb unique expertise that may be available in smaller companies to allow the acquirers to better compete.</p><p>Also, as we strive for companies to look overseas for revenue, it is important for our companies to have the right scale and basket of expertise to compete. Good strategic acquisition can see our companies acquire the right know-hows, market access and people to help bring about more successful internationalisation.</p><p>I hope the improvements to the M&amp;A scheme in this Budget will just be the start. It will signal to companies to seriously consider M&amp;A as a way to stay relevant and competitive. We should closely monitor its effectiveness to drive up M&amp;A activities and study what positive effects can come out of these mergers.</p><p>Some future enhancements to this scheme can include expanding the definition of M&amp;A to also cover the purchase of operations and businesses of SMEs rather than outright share sales, as some acquirers are wary of the potential liability associated with the acquired businesses.</p><p>In conjunction with M&amp;As, we can also encourage the acquirers to invest in automation of their acquired businesses to achieve greater productivity and to change old business models. This could take the form of more generous PIC incentives, for example, valid only in the first year of acquisition or special grants for productivity improvements.</p><p>I am also happy to see a greater push to create globally-competitive Singapore companies. I will speak further on this during the COS debate.</p><p>Even as we look at encouraging our local companies to venture abroad, a strong base locally is important. In this respect, I hope to see greater confidence in our public sector projects in local companies, particularly the promising and innovative smaller companies. Some promising and globally-competitive Singapore companies could be formed if we have confidence in our local solutions and allow such start-ups to prove themselves locally so that tried and tested solutions can be sold abroad. We can create more test-bed projects to incubate solutions from local start-ups. Smart and Sustainable Urban Solutions has been identified as one of the five growth clusters of the future. Many of these will involve public sector projects. I believe we can see more promising local companies emerge with exciting and globally-competitive solutions if we look at what our small but innovative companies can offer.</p><p>The Deputy Prime Minister spoke about deepening collaboration amongst companies in our industries, industry by industry. I, too, believe collaboration amongst our local companies is very important for success overseas, but such collaboration has been generally weak, not just compared to Germany and Switzerland, as cited by the Deputy Prime Minister, but also against our Asian neighbours, such as Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. I believe there will be scope to look at incentives to promote economic grouping and franchising. Certain industries can also benefit from shared resources, such as shared kitchens for the F&amp;B industry, or prefabrication factories for those in the construction sector. Even in the service sectors, such as preschools, it is possible to have shared curriculum and teaching resources and even shared facilities.</p><p>Next, on developing Singaporeans for the future. I wish to declare that I own businesses that supply education programmes.</p><p>The Deputy Prime Minister had said that we must become a meritocracy of skills, not a hierarchy of grades earned early in life. This is definitely a very worthy goal to strive for. There will be many challenges as we work towards this goal. After decades of having schools compete with one another in ranking, many high-stake examinations to sort students into academic streams and schools and the increasing use of scholarships in the public sector to pick talents, it is hard to reverse the mindset of people.</p><p>We do need some competition and pressure to motivate people. There is a place for scholarships as well. How do we achieve the right balance? How do we convince parents that there are many pathways to success when they feel convinced that they should spend enormous amounts of money to provide tuition to their children to get better grades to enter what they consider are the better schools?</p><p>There are no easy solutions. We need to continue the process of critical examination of our current system to see where competition may have become too excessive and where messaging may have been going against this concept of meritocracy of skills that we wish to strive for. We need to question if education has become just about scoring the right grades to graduate so as to get the passport to get on to the next phase in life, or if we are succeeding in imparting to our students a genuine love for lifelong learning.</p><p>One of the big words used throughout the Deputy Prime Minister's speech is \"innovation\". Innovation is not just a process. It is also a mindset. Singaporeans cannot suddenly become innovative when they enter the workforce. It should be a mindset that we instil in our children from young, throughout the education process. It is not something that we can teach in a subject called \"innovation\" and expect people to become innovative.</p><p>Wanting to promote innovation in schools is not new, too. We have creativity as a buzzword in education since the \"Thinking Schools, Learning Nation\" thrust from 1997. How do we push for something like creativity and innovation which are not easily measurable, in a big and sustainable way in our education system where, in general, people still value good grades above all else? Yet, innovation is so critical to Singapore's future.</p><p>We have achieved high averages in education performance internationally, as measured through test scores. I believe we will next need to work on developing innovation as a mindset in our students. It is hard to measure how we have succeeded in this, but we will need to build this mindset nevertheless.</p><p>To have a culture of innovation, our young will have to read widely, consider different perspectives, think out of the box and venture deep into subjects that may have no clear right and wrong answers. People will have to dare to question norms and find new solutions to old problems. They will need to dream big from young.</p><p>Madam, I am glad that this Budget has put the spotlight on developing Singaporeans through SkillsFuture. I am all for investing in our people. It will take some time to reap the benefits as strong skills will take time to build. It has been all too tempting in the past for companies to hire instant workers from overseas to fill gaps in skills. For Singapore to succeed in the long term, we need to look inwards and invest heavily on building our people. The journey may be long but I believe we need to persevere in the journey.</p><p>The programme is called SkillsFuture. For too long, we have chased knowledge and assigned too high a value to the proof of knowledge earned early in life. It is apt that we should strive to deepen skills across all segments of our population. We can and should aim to move even beyond developing skills.</p><p>Knowledge is important as it lays the foundation for what one knows. Skills are even more important as they allow one to put knowledge into practical actions. But I believe higher in the hierarchy is having strong and positive attitudes. With a positive attitude, one will make effort to acquire knowledge where it is required. The person will find ways to learn new skills where they are needed but may be lacking.</p><p>So, we have \"A\" for Attitude, \"S\" for Skills and \"K\" for Knowledge, or ASK for short. We can build this ASK-ing spirit in our people. We will need strong attitudes in our people to aspire to be the best, to be resilient and to be hungry for success and to want to constantly innovate.</p><p>The lifelong learning programmes that SkillsFuture will create should not stop at helping people acquire more knowledge and skills. While these are important, we can also include programmes that transform thinking and challenge our people to have higher aspirations. Working hand in hand with developing skills across all sectors, new transformative attitudes can help transform our enterprises to achieve the breakthrough that this Budget seeks to spark off. I share in the vision of this learning journey.</p><h6>2.06 pm</h6><p><strong>Prof Tan Tai Yong (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Speaker, for allowing me to join this debate. This is a very good Budget, indeed. I must confess that I do not always read through entire Budget statements. Given my own interests, I usually focus only on the parts on education, which have been uniformly generous over the years.</p><p>But despite my relative ignorance of the details of the Budget, from all I have seen and read so far and from what I have learnt from my more experienced parliamentary colleagues, I know that this is an unusually strong Budget, not just in terms of how much we are spending, but how we are spending it.</p><p>I would like to focus on the first part of the Minister's speech, on the impact of the Budget on people, society, its timbre and complexion. The key theme of Budget 2015 is \"Building Our Future, Strengthening Social Security\".</p><p>Mdm Speaker, this Budget has a hypothesis \u2013 to build our future, we need to strengthen social security and, in so doing, four thrusts were identified. The first thrust \"invest in skills of the people\", deals essentially with \"developing our people\".</p><p>In this speech, I want to make the point that the future is unpredictable. We will face challenges, possibly crises, of one form or another, and this will demand a new kind of Singapore. The kind, ironically, that does not come from stronger social security alone, but a sense that we can be strong, even without having to rely solely on inanimate things, such as infrastructure or systems or institutions, but on people and communities that can count on one another.</p><p>Every successive Budget since 1965 has tried to deliver the good life to Singaporeans. From the early emphasis on bread-and-butter issues essential to economic survival, such as job creation and building physical infrastructure, to the more current concerns of meeting aspirations about education, careers and social development, the Budgets have been geared towards growth and prosperity to improve the lives of Singaporeans. This Budget takes it a few steps further. It is geared towards long-term social security \u2013 learning and opportunities in our youth, support for continuing education, and peace and comfort in old age.</p><p>But to truly build a future, to make sure that Singaporeans are ready for the future, we need to not just ensure comfort and peace, but also to prepare for difficult conditions and uncertainty. While the Government needs to build and provide the necessary physical and social infrastructure, financial reserves and economic conditions to safeguard the population and stave off the worse, we need also to cultivate in our people the strength and resilience to cope with and deal with whatever comes along.</p><p>Because of the increasing volatility, both in the economic and physical world, the study of resilience in the face of large socio-ecological change has emerged as an important area of research. But while the physical variables under study are easily identified, the notion of resilience remains nebulous.</p><p>The idea of resilience has been taken to mean both alleviation and adaptation \u2013 two concepts that are often used in conjunction or interchangeably. While the first refers to the ability to carry on \"business as usual\" (R1), the second demands a rejection of the \"business as usual paradigm\" and the recognition, instead, of new realities (R2); these two approaches are actually quite antithetical to each other.</p><p>Too often, I think, the Singapore Government sees resilience as R1 \u2013 building the means to continuously improve the infrastructure so that Singaporeans are spared discomfort \u2013 more trains and buses to address complaints about our public transport system being \"too crowded\", for example. Singapore has a tougher benchmark for defining \"crowdedness\", it seems. In some cities, it takes seven people in one square meter to qualify for crowdedness; in Singapore, it is five people.</p><p>Another example, from one of my colleagues who works on water. Last year, around this time, Singapore had its worst drought in 140 years. But there was no water rationing and businesses experienced no interruption in water supply. This was a great feat. It showed that our systems are highly resilient. Even under severe conditions, we are able to stand up to the stress. But under R2, which requires systems, including actors, to adapt to changing realities, Singapore, in my view, could be seen to be quite vulnerable still.</p><p>If, under severe conditions, our infrastructure, our much-lauded \"forward planning\" can no longer cushion us from the very worst, what will happen to us on the day that systems fail, as they inevitably will? No amount of over-provision can guard against outlier crises.</p><p>Today, most of us will think that it is very unlikely that Singapore's essential services will be interrupted significantly in the future, a low probability that consumers will suffer much discomfort in the event of extreme weather conditions. We have high confidence that infrastructure is in place for alleviation. Yet, these expectations seem to be at odds with constant predictions of the likelihood of droughts and extreme events for Singapore.</p><p>How prepared are we then, psychologically, in the face of unexpected crises? In the Singapore case, because we score highly on R1, we might not do so well in R2. But this does not have to be the case.</p><p>And this is not an academic point \u2013 it is a reality about public life. I do not mean to say that we deliberately create bed shortages in hospitals, or train breakdowns \u2013 just to \"test\" people's resilience. Certainly not.</p><p>I must also add the important caveat that I do not think that we ought to make life any tougher for those at the lower end of the income scale \u2013 this is not about rolling back state support for those who need them. Quite the reverse, I think that we ought to have a more aggressive welfare distribution regime, because this would make society more equitable, more cohesive and more resilient.</p><p>So, what can we do to make Singapore more resilient, in the R2 sense of \"toughening up\" or adaptability to change? Here are some simple suggestions: Australia has regular water rationing, not because of any crises but because of a need to educate and remind its people that water is in very short supply and, if ever there was a severe drought, its people would be able to adapt. We could try this.</p><p>We can get parents and schools into the act \u2013 should more students take the school bus to school, rather than being chauffeured by their parents? Only 20% of Primary school-going children take the school bus to school. This percentage should be far higher, given the congestions we already have on the roads. And there have been suggestions, which I personally think are very good, that we get our students to clean up and be responsible for their own school environment, instead of relying on the cleaners.</p><p>In sports, athletes build muscles and mental strength through training and conditioning so that they can excel in strenuous and challenging competitions. In the same way, we need to build \"muscles\" in young Singaporeans, to give them the will, capability and strength to face tough conditions, when they come, as they will surely do.</p><p>We need to learn how to \"develop\" in our people resilience. To know what to do, how to do so, we need to test ideas out and see whether they work, or fail.</p><p>To this end, we need to sustain efforts to research society, people, values and identity \u2013 to understand ourselves better, to see how we can move forward as one people. In the coming Committee of Supply, I will speak about the need to set up a Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) Research Council to do this. Here, I want to highlight an important area of research that could be supported by such a Council.</p><p>The Minister speaks of the meritocracy of skills, where people keep learning and pushing themselves to achieve and their value comes from contributions at each stage of life.</p><p>I understand fully what the Minister meant \u2013 there is a weakness in evaluating someone with \"a hierarchy of grades earned in early life.\" But may I add \u2013 there is a similar weakness in saying that people \"are valued for their contributions at each stage of their life\".</p><p>I understand the intent and it is a worthy one. The Budget supports people investing in themselves, to support lifelong learning, education, career counselling in schools, SkillsFuture credits, subsidies for mid-career Singaporeans and industry collaboration.</p><p>But in this understanding, the \"contribution\" that we each make is seen in economic terms \u2013 our wages, what the market determines what we are worth and perhaps what we add to the GDP of the country. I do not disagree. These are necessary calculations. My point is: should people be valued for their economic contributions only?</p><p>I think valuation is neither a function of grades nor contribution alone. Rather, it is a mix of effort, character and the meaning and good we give to the environment in which we function. As a policy maker, I know that the Finance Minister has to use some objective criteria to allocate resources \u2013 grades are objective, \"contributions\", perhaps in terms of value-added to GDP, are objective.</p><p>For the past 50 years, perhaps it had been a useful way of proceeding. But increasingly, we have reason to be dissatisfied with this measure. I think the Minister, too, is dissatisfied. He says in his speech that we ought to develop \"a new economic and social culture\", and \"we can only get to where we want in the long term by taking steps now, moving ahead relentlessly and never thinking that the status quo will get us to a better place\".</p><p>Part of this culture, I argue, must see the move away from \"value\" as \"economic contribution\". Can the Minister and his colleagues at MOF help us come up with a better instrument of measuring value? Part of the work for the Social Science Research Council, perhaps, I think, can be to work out composite indices for such a measure.</p><p>The United Nations' Human Development Index (HDI) this takes into account a long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living. A qualitative measure beyond economics \u2013 Singapore ranks number nine in the \"very high human development\" category but still behind Norway, Australia, Switzerland, Netherlands, the US, Germany, New Zealand and Canada. Perhaps, we can examine more closely how Singapore can perform better along this index.</p><p>This effort may have already begun. The Budget Statement says that the Government \"aims to empower each Singaporean to chart their own journey and gain fulfilment at work and even in their senior years\".</p><p>Fulfilment, pride in work, excelling in what you are good at, doing something that benefits people around you \u2013 living a meaningful life \u2013 this is real empowerment. Increasingly, as Singapore matures, as our economy develops, Singaporeans will want to find higher order satisfaction. Comfort may not be enough. We want to feel that we are creating a life that has meaning, to live in a Singapore that has a sense of collective destiny, that values each person for his intrinsic worth and talent.</p><p>I have said earlier that comfort is not enough, and perhaps that is fortunate because, as I pointed out in my first section, comfort is not entirely attainable. In an uncertain world, where climate change is real, where economic cycles are more severe and frequent, it is unrealistic to think that we can always cushion the effects of these cycles, to keep \"business as usual\" for Singaporeans.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the Minister spoke about creating a spirit in Singapore. He spoke of Victor Poon, a self-taught swimming coach who spotted rising swimming star, Joseph Schooling. What impressed me most about the story of Victor Poon is that he epitomised a culture of personal effort and responsibility. He taught himself to swim by observing how others swam and improved his techniques, as he grew older, by reading the latest books on the sport. An accident, unfortunately, ended his swimming career, but he continued to develop his love of the sport through coaching. And the most impressive part of it is that all his self-improvements were done without the benefit of Government help. He did not get any but, more importantly, he did not expect any. He was essentially self-driven and he knew how to make the best of his own situation.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I will conclude with a reference to history since this is our Jubilee Year. Singapore's social and economic progress since 1965 has been nothing short of remarkable. The figures that reflect this dramatic growth are sufficiently well-known and there is no need for me to repeat them here. But what is worth reminding is that our starting point was a far cry from where we are today. In 1965, Singapore lost its hinterland, it had virtually no industries, a largely uneducated population of migrant communities and it was in the midst of a volatile and unfriendly neighbourhood.</p><p>Solid and far-sighted leadership, political will and some degree of luck, perhaps, put Singapore on a trajectory that led us to where we are today. But the most important success factor, in my view, was the sheer determination and gumption of the population. A tough, resolute citizenry made the difference and they built Singapore.</p><p>As the Singapore Government continues to do more for the population, this will make us more resilient as R1 \u2013 we will be able to withstand more shocks and continue \"business as usual\". But what about our ability to adapt, change, endure and persevere? Will we then gradually lose that toughness, resilience and resolve that the Pioneer Generation showed us in such good measure? Will personal responsibility give way to a sense of entitlement?</p><p>As we build the future, we need to remember what history has shown \u2013 the best foundations are not built of bricks and mortar; these do not last. What will withstand the test of time is the spirit of our people and our unceasing drive to create meaning in our lives. With this, Mdm Speaker, I support the Budget.</p><h6>2.20 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, first, I would like to commend the Finance Minister for a forward-looking and fair Budget. Its strong focus on building Singapore's future and ensuring a fair and just society provides both a springboard for our country to reach the next frontier of growth and the safety net for a more compassionate society.</p><p>By contrast, many developed countries are grappling with unsustainable budget deficits, with a growing number at risk of defaulting; cutting back on infrastructure projects, rather than putting growth and development at the top of their agenda.</p><p>As I listened to the Finance Minister's speech, I could not help but feel a surge of pride in being Singaporean and also of humility. Proud because it bore the hallmarks of good government \u2013 far-sighted, responsible, inclusive and responsive. Humbled because we know that such a Budget would not have been possible without our pioneer leaders who established an uncompromising ethos of high standards, financial prudence, incorruptibility and progress for all.</p><p>Another crucial feature inherited from our pioneer leaders \u2013 the unflinching attention to hard realities and the political will to confront them. That clear-eyed approach to Singapore's challenges and concerns is apparent in this year's Budget.</p><p>Madam, in my speech, I would like to discuss three challenges facing Singapore. First, becoming a necessary global city, as opposed to being just one out of many in the world. Second, embracing the future of work \u2013 the rise of the freelance economy. And, third, responding to changing norms, with the rising number of singles and single parents.</p><p>Madam, in 1972, our founding Foreign Minister S Rajaratnam used the word \"global city\" to describe his vision for Singapore's transformation. He also used another name: ecumenopolis, or the world-embracing city. He believed that the transformation was necessary for Singapore to overcome its inherent vulnerabilities and to succeed in a harsh world where small states often end up as pawns of bigger powers.</p><p>At the time, British troops had just withdrawn from Singapore. The Indochina conflict was festering with no clear outcome in sight. It was an unstable period during the Cold War, with the great powers vying for influence in the region. To cap it all, relations with neighbouring countries, especially Indonesia, were difficult and unpredictable.</p><p>Mr Rajaratnam believed that, by becoming a global city, Singapore would become a key node in the international system coordinating global flows of trade, money, materials, goods and people.</p><p>Singapore's hub status in maintaining the smooth functioning of the global economy would also enhance its strategic relevance. Multiple major powers would have a vested interest in the country's survival and success. This would give Singapore more room to manoeuvre and it could then better protect its national interests and bring security and progress to its people.</p><p>The Government's concerted and consistent efforts over the years to make Singapore a global city have paid off, as Singapore made its presence felt on international indices that measure global city performances. The 2012 Global City Competitiveness Index by the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Singapore as the third most competitive city in the world, after New York and London.</p><p>Singapore's trajectory to its status as a leading global city was neither smooth nor inevitable. Fundamental to its competitiveness has been its openness to the rest of the world and the quality of its human capital. Today, the Singapore passport carries weight all around the world. The Singapore brand is highly regarded internationally and doors open readily for our businessmen overseas.</p><p>But its growth as a global city has come at a price. This came to the fore in recent years when public unhappiness over immigration, income inequality, pressure on infrastructure and rising property prices became political hot potatoes.</p><p>These issues, however, are not unique to Singapore. They are also faced by other major global cities to varying degrees. The problems are most marked in the top cities, such as London and New York. In these cities, the rapid rise of wealthy elites has led to what economist Ajay Kapur calls a \"plutonomy\", an economy and society driven largely by the very rich.</p><p>While these cities boast areas with the highest concentration of billionaires, they also see a growing underclass with rising poverty levels. At the same time, the middle class is fast shrinking as white-collar jobs move out and the working class move to suburbs. These trends could shape the future of cities, both socially and politically. It is important to factor in these trends when thinking about Singapore's strategies as a global city while also tackling the problems that could endanger it.</p><p>Even as Singapore becomes more cosmopolitan and glitzy, we have to guard against becoming a luxury city, or a generic city with little to differentiate it from the others around the world. Madam, I took a stroll along Orchard Road recently and most of the shops fronting the street are no different from those in London, Paris, New York or Hong Kong \u2013 luxury fashion shops selling branded goods which are beyond the budget of the average Singaporean.</p><p>We need to ensure that these trends do not overwhelm our local cultures or our national identity. For Singapore is both a city and a country. In London and New York, their unhappy residents can shift to the suburbs or smaller cities in their countries. Singaporeans do not have that option. To preserve the feel of Singapore as a familiar home, we need to invest more in our local arts and heritage and in conserving our distinctive landmarks and localities even if they do not seem to make immediate or obvious economic sense.</p><p>We should jealously guard our few remaining sleepy hollows, such as our outer islands, with their small local businesses and rustic charm. May Starbucks never set up shop in Ubin. Given the polarising pressures of globalisation, it has become even more urgent for us to strengthen the people's sense of collective responsibility and common destiny.</p><p>If groups of people feel that the deck is stacked against them, that through no fault of their own, they are consigned to a desperate life, resentment will build up at the unfairness of it and be our constant companion. In this regard, I welcome the Budget's initiatives in strengthening the social compact and raising the taxes on the super-rich and providing more help to the poor and middle-income and giving everyone a fair stake in the country's growth.</p><p>Can Singapore be both a just city and a global city? I believe it can. In Singapore, the role of the Government differentiates its trajectory as a global city from New York and London. While the world beckons, we are masters of our own destiny. Indeed, we have proved this to be so over the last 50 years.</p><p>That said, we cannot run away from the fact that Singapore needs to continue to be, as Mr Rajaratnam put it \u2013 world-embracing. We need to continue to be world-embracing. Indeed, it is far from given that Singapore would continue to retain its high rankings as a leading global city, as fast-growing emerging market cities strive to leapfrog its peers. The ongoing shift towards a more knowledge-based economy is exacerbating this process, with human capital playing a key role in the relative competitiveness of cities.</p><p>Singapore has to watch this very carefully. Its ranking has fallen over the years in AT Kearney's Global Cities Index. This examines how globally engaged cities are across a broad set of measures, including human capital and cultural experience.&nbsp;New York has topped the rankings since the first report was released in 2008. However, Singapore's ranking has fallen, from No 7 in 2008 to No 9 last year, overtaken by Chicago and Beijing.&nbsp;</p><p>Singapore and Singaporeans must recognise this stark reality of the global race for talent, even as the Government addresses their concerns on foreigners and finetunes the numbers. The public concern over the foreign influx speaks to a deeper insecurity in citizens of their place in this country.&nbsp;The Budget measures targeting at empowering them, such as the SkillsFuture initiative, would go some way in assuring them.</p><p>But it is important to guard against xenophobic and racist sentiments from taking hold in our national psyche. Every critic of our foreign talent policy is not a racist or a xenophobe, but the racists and xenophobes among them must be identified and isolated. While we cannot control the global forces, we can shape the kind of society and people we want to become.&nbsp;This leads me to my second point, on the future of work.</p><p>Madam, cities will play a leading role in nurturing changes that will support the changing landscape of work. One of the greatest changes is the growth of independent and contingent workers. These workers go by many names \u2013 contractors, freelancers, consultants, portfolio workers, temps and the self-employed.</p><p>Their growth is driven by the development of tools that allow people to work independently across industries, such as software, design, journalism, marketing, legal services and architecture. This has opened up huge opportunities for project-based work.</p><p>Leading companies in other global cities are taking advantage of this entrepreneurial shift to be more precise in when and how they engage labour \u2013 moving closer to making labour a variable cost, rather than a fixed one. They bring in talent as needed and to acquire the services of people with highly specialised expertise that many companies could not afford to hire full-time.</p><p>These virtual work arrangements appeal to mothers who need more flexibility, older workers who want to be active but not strapped to the desk and young \"Generation Y\" professionals who want flexible lifestyles.</p><p>This trend is apparent in developed countries, such as the US and UK. According to research, one-third of Americans are estimated to be freelancers. By 2020, freelancers are expected to make up 50% of the full-time workforce. In the UK, freelancers have become the fastest growing group in its labour market, with a surge in home workers.</p><p>In Singapore, I have met many professionals of various ages opting to work as freelancers, rather than as full-time employees. They put a high value on freedom, flexibility, purpose and meaning. Work-life balance is important to them.</p><p>Madam, in my previous speeches, I have called on companies to provide more flexibility and work-life balance, but progress has been slow. Now, with the focus on productivity, many workers report even greater stress at the workplace. For some, especially the middle-level workers, their salaries have stagnated or moved up only very slowly. They feel hard done by and tend to blame the foreigners for their plight. On the other hand, employers often complain that Singaporeans are reluctant to work long hours, weekends or night shift. We hear this very often when we ask employers why they are not hiring Singaporeans or it is hard to hire Singaporeans. Hence, the paradox: increasing job vacancies in the market but Singaporeans, especially those in the PMET group, complaining there are no suitable jobs for them. This has driven an increasing number to try out freelancing or contract work.</p><p>Companies should take advantage of this new pool of labour and view it as a possible solution to the labour crunch. They should offer more jobs that can be performed remotely and independently. On its part, the Government should do more to ensure a supportive business environment for those who want to just work for themselves.</p><p>The SkillsFuture initiative is a useful measure to deepen the skills of freelancers. They do not have the luxury of being sent for courses on the company's expense. But it is important to ensure that the courses available would cover a wide range of subjects across disciplines.</p><p>Some of the most sought-after freelance jobs in developed countries involve infographic design: the skill of presenting complex information in a sharable way. Another is writing \u2013 compiling analysis or writing for publications and blogs. These are specialised skills.</p><p>Our policymakers must review how the greater use of contingent work arrangements affects income, consumption and access to health and retirement benefits. This group does not have income security and many do not have sufficient CPF. They are not entitled to employer's CPF contributions, annual leave or medical leave. This is also a problem faced by other self-employed workers, such as taxi drivers. We need to tailor our various schemes and programmes to take into account this growing sector.</p><p>Our current system is heavily geared towards people working in conventional ways \u2013 from applying for housing to preparing for retirement \u2013 and all these must change. Our support mechanisms must also develop greater flexibility to respond and adapt quickly to these new trends.</p><p>Another area that requires a policy change relates to the changing norms in our society, which brings me to my third point. As in other developed countries and major global cities, Singapore is seeing a rise in the number of singles and single parents. Many of them are not \"swinging\" singles but \"stressed\" singles, who are juggling work and care-giving responsibilities. Some had to give up work to cope with their care-giving duties. This includes singles who took over the care of their aged parents on behalf of their married siblings.</p><p>A case in point is Mr Seah Chin Pang, who came to see me at my Meet-the-People session this Monday. He is 56, single. He used to work as a security guard and took the night shift so that he could care for his elderly parents. His father, aged 92, was suffering from brain cancer. His mother, 88, is suffering from colon cancer. As their health worsened, Mr Seah had to stop work in October last year to care for them. His father died in December 2014. His mother remains bedridden and requires a maid and home nursing. All these have taken a toll on Mr Seah personally and also on his finances.&nbsp;One encouraging aspect is that he came to see me not to ask for financial assistance for himself; he came to ask for free home nursing service and community help for his mother. We will help him.&nbsp;But his case highlights how our policies need to provide greater support for single caregivers.</p><p>The same goes for single parents. In 2011, 26% of households with children under the age of 18 were headed by single mothers. I have formed a single mothers' group in my constituency to support this growing group. One of their biggest challenges is raising their children on their own and supporting the family with only one income.</p><p>They are divorced from their husbands for various reasons \u2013 their husband was abusive, had a mistress, left them in the lurch, or the relationship had become so toxic that the children were being affected. They would rather have stayed married and had a wholesome family. But it was not to be.</p><p>It is not that they did not value the institution of marriage. It is hard for them to understand why they are being penalised for their misfortune to stay married. Because of the current official stand on marriage and family, Government policies discriminate against single mothers. They receive less paid maternity leave and are not entitled to tax incentives that married mothers receive.</p><p>Madam, one theme that runs through the Budget Statement is the importance of building a fair and inclusive society. This spirit should be extended to singles and single parents. We can send pro-family signals in other more positive ways, without penalising singles and their children who require our support, not our condemnation.</p><p>Madam, in conclusion, as we celebrate SG50 this year, I believe that the fundamental challenge for Singapore lies in accommodating two identities \u2013 the global and the local one \u2013 and how it serves both the global economy and local needs, taking into account the changing lifestyles and concerns of its citizens.</p><p>As Mr Rajaratnam warned in his Global City speech, \"Laying the economic infrastructure of a Global City may turn out to be the easiest of the many tasks involved in creating such a city. But the political, social and cultural adjustments such a city would require to enable men to live happy and useful lives in them may demand a measure of courage, imagination and intelligence which may or may not be beyond the capacity of its citizens.\" It was up to us, he said, to equip our people \"intellectually and spiritually\" to make the transformation.</p><p>In this regard, I support the point made by Nominated Member Prof Tan Tai Yong on the need to build up the resilience of our people to make sure that our people are able to have that robust and tough attitude to life to make difficult transformations to ensure progress for our future. Madam, 50 years from now, may the future generation of Singaporeans look back upon this period and similarly find inspiration in our foresight and determination to tackle the challenges ahead. On that note, I support the Budget.</p><h6>2.39 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, thank you for allowing me to join the debate. At the start of this term, the President, in his Address, had spoken about the need for economic growth, the promise of better distribution, the call for unity. At that time, I had asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister to go beyond the rhetoric and make \"growth real for Singaporeans.\"</p><p>This included: one, targeted subsidies for Singaporeans; two, better distribution of wealth \u2013 including placing a heavier fiscal responsibility on the rich; and, three, more manpower for social services.</p><p>Over the years and certainly in this Budget, I think the Finance Minister has addressed all three \u2013 I will say how and why in the COS debates later and give some suggestions on where we could do more, and other areas in which we could do less.</p><p>Today, I would like to ask the Finance Minister to make growth real by distributing wealth even better, by making this distribution a matter of personal choice, not&nbsp;fait accompli, by making Singapore a fairer and more just society in thought as well as deed and by expanding the public spaces we all have and treasure.</p><p>First, distribute wealth better. I thank the Finance Minister for the courage to raise taxes on the rich. I would like to suggest that the Government give further incentives to the rich who donate.</p><p>A few years ago, there was a temporary increase of deductions to 2.5 times until 2015. It ends this year. When I asked for this to be kept permanent, I was told that what we do is already generous by international standards.</p><p>This year, the Finance Minister has extended this 2.5 times tax deduction till 2018, for which I thank him. This ensures some distribution, not by tax, but voluntary giving. I would like him to consider making this 2.5 times permanent until such time as he sees a need for revision.</p><p>The figure for donations from individuals is now at a high of $1.25 billion, a 14% rise from the amount of $1.10 billion in 2012. This is no small amount, given that the Budget for MSF was $1.69 billion in 2013.</p><p>Can I ask the Finance Minister what the revenue implication of this increase to 2.5 times has been over the years? What is the total increase in donations? What has been the reduction, if any, in tax collected? Or has this been tax revenue-neutral?</p><p>From my rough calculations, I think if the income tax was at 25% and tax relief at four times, then it might be revenue-neutral. At the moment, I think we could be gaining in donations more than we are losing in tax revenue. Make no mistake \u2013 I am not proposing an increase in tax to 25%. I am reiterating my call for a three times tax deduction, assuming, of course, that my rough calculations are right.</p><p>The Finance Minister has given a three times tax deduction for 2015, but this will expire at the end of this year. I urge the Minister to revise the policy thus \u2013 three times until 2018 and 2.5 times to be made permanent.</p><p>We can tax the rich more, or we can allow them to redistribute wealth in their own way and towards causes which they support. This latter way is voluntary, less certain and more persuasion perhaps needs to be done. But to do it this way allows us to build a stronger, more cohesive society in the end, because we are all helping our fellow countrymen.</p><p>Donations are not like taxes because they are voluntary. But they do have something in common. For a long time, donating, as an act, has been cast as a matter of compassion, as something that the rich are in a \"position to confer\". But I argue that the time for this has passed \u2013 at a time when the rich have become rich because of the stability of Singapore, the public infrastructure built, the collective efforts of all Singaporeans, all these positive externalities \u2013 donations from those who have succeeded are not merely kindness or generosity, it is a public duty. It is not, or not only, compassion; it is fairness.&nbsp;This is not compassion. This is fairness.</p><p>Madam, this is a Budget that helps us understand the role of luck in our lives. This is a Budget that makes it less important whether you are born rich or poor, brainy or not, athletic or not, entrepreneurial or not. It is generous to the poor; it is fair to the rich.</p><p>It is a Budget that ties our collective destiny together, expands our civic and shared spaces; it is a Budget that will make SG50 a celebration and SG100 a real and brighter possibility.</p><p>In this, we must change the mindset that donations are a function of generosity and magnanimity. Donations and charity, rather, are a recognition that success is also a measure of luck \u2013 of genetic endowment, or fortuitous meetings, of kindness from strangers. For example, there is an episode of \"The Noose\", a satirical news programme, which, sometimes, I like better than real news.</p><p>It is about a boy who scores very highly for his PSLE and he attributes it all to his own hard work \u2013 leaving aside the fact that his parents are both doctors with the wealth necessary to ensure that he is chauffeured to and from school and attends expensive high-quality enrichment classes. This is perhaps the mindset in many students and young Singaporeans. It is a mindset bred by years of \"meritocracy\".</p><p>I have previously spoken out against a strict definition of meritocracy. In this Budget, we see that the Finance Minister has also moved away from it \u2013 from the hierarchy of grades to a mastery of skills, with many different paths to a good career.</p><p>Meritocracy is, indeed, a terrible system that does not account for the role of luck, for circumstance of fortunes.</p><p>But, luckily, in the real world, we also have national Budgets \u2013 we have men and women leaders who will decide that, in the spirit of fairness, we should make allowances for the things that a system of meritocracy does not and cannot. In the past, I have argued for unequal treatment in schools \u2013 ensuring that the least advantaged students get more subsidies, more attention. Today, I would like to argue also for more public spaces in Singapore, so that people of all income groups and classes can interact, think and value common things about and in our country.</p><p>Expanding civic spaces. Madam, I did my National Service and completed my in-camp trainings many, many years ago \u2013 I am quite old now. I had met many Singaporeans from all walks of life during those National Service and in-camp training days and made many friends as a result. I am the richer for the experience and the friends I had made have helped me become a better person.</p><p>Together, we went to many different training places in Singapore and overseas, trained as one unit under rain and shine, lived together and talked about all kinds of things and, most important of all, we became friends for life. I started as an Officer Cadet, became an Infantry Officer and finished up as the Chief Logistics Officer of a heliborne Brigade. I worked with a diverse team from manpower to administration to logistics, interacted with interesting vocations \u2013 storekeepers, drivers, cooks.</p><p>Sir, National Service, is a great public space for men. And, through men, as sons and husbands, we draw our families into this world as well. I support a strong and well-funded MINDEF and I have filed a cut for this Ministry and will say more about it then.</p><p>Here, I want to note the importance of MINDEF in creating common spaces for Singaporeans. And that is why I support our continued strong spending for MINDEF \u2013 there are those from both sides of the House who had argued that spending on defence, including its use of large tracts of land, is competing with other uses \u2013 that the resources could be better spent elsewhere. More dangerously, there are those who argue that National Service could be shortened because the opportunity costs of a young man's life are immeasurably high.</p><p>True, these resources could possibly be used better but this is true only in a very weak sense \u2013 that money used and spent on MINDEF is wasteful in the same way that health insurance is wasteful. We spend it hoping and wishing we would never have to use it, because we cannot count this spending as wasteful. We instead should see it as a shield, as a deterrent.</p><p>But there is a larger point to this. Michael Sandel, an American philosopher, is today writing at a time when there is great intractability in his country's politics. There is polarisation in public dialogue, distrust between reds and blues \u2013 there is a decreasing amount of common spaces in national life. For him, the American military is an example of public space.</p><p>Some years back, former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong had spoken out on the importance of these common spaces for a multi-cultural, multi-racial country. Today, more than ever, in a Singapore where ideas are contested, with the goals of development uncertain and, yet, where larger scale climate events are more imminent, where geopolitics remain as fraught for Singapore, we need large public spaces so we are truly one country.</p><p>Another important public space in Singapore is our hawker centres. I think it is a feature of our national life. Perhaps, this is a factor of my age, but I have become a bit allergic to cafes. Amongst the young people that I meet or hire, one of their common \"dreams\" is to \"own a cafe\". I think we have gone wrong somewhere here, if the sum of the aspirations of our young people comprise many of such dreams. I would rather have a bowl of&nbsp;bak chor mee&nbsp;than spending $15 on eggs and cream. And I dare say you will be hard-pressed to find any Singaporean who does not enjoy going to a hawker centre and trying the food there.</p><p>So, I hope our Ministries could adopt a whole-of-Government approach to consider how hawker centres can be made more user-friendly to allow people to linger for more than a quick meal perhaps, or to encourage hawkers to be closely linked to the people they serve each day. I do not have a hawker centre in my constituency, so, I will use another example.</p><p>Mr Toh Ah Wat is 66. He runs a drinks stall at an Ang Mo Kio market. He lives in a 4-room flat in Yishun with two of his four children and his wife. He takes only three days off a month. He works hard but his income goes also to those who live around the hawker centre. In fact, anyone who cannot afford a meal gets a free breakfast from him \u2013 two eggs, a hot drink and&nbsp;kaya&nbsp;and butter toast.</p><p>His wife, who works at the stall with him, says some people come in the afternoons for \"breakfast\" too, but he says, \"It is okay, whenever they are hungry, we will feed them. I am hoping that it will catch on among the other hawkers, too, but, so far, I do not think anyone else has done it yet. But it does not matter.\" He says, \"I will keep doing it and, someday, others will do the same way, too, if they can afford it.\"</p><p>He gives out 50 free breakfasts a month and I think, sometimes, he feeds more than their stomachs. He is a friend to them. Those people who know of his effort then give him the money to continue this work. Together, in his case, they enlarge the common space of Ang Mo Kio.</p><p>Hawker centres are a magnet for all Singaporeans. On any weekend, you will see top corporate bosses sharing a table with drivers, technicians, cashiers. It is a facet of social life that deserves to be enlarged.</p><p>So, I hope that the Government will conduct a review of public and social life in hawker centres, see what interactions and social life exist at present and create some new common spaces in and around hawker centres.</p><p>Madam, to build our future, we need to make growth real for all Singaporeans, to give each one of us a stake in a new and brighter tomorrow. This can only be the case if we are not divided by class, if the common spaces on this tiny island are large enough for all of us.</p><p>I have argued that our public space must be made stronger and better by first distributing wealth better through fiscal measures but also by changing our view of what it means to give to others in our community \u2013 out of a sense of fair play and duty to our fellowmen, rather than that of magnanimity and condescension.</p><p>This is one way of expanding public space in our minds. I also argue that public spaces, whether it is for security, for MINDEF or hawker centres \u2013 to name two&nbsp;\u2013 need to be well-funded and well thought out to ensure that Singaporeans of all income groups will have opportunities to come together, shoulder-to-shoulder, with a common goal \u2013 whether it is for something humble, such as enjoying a meal together, or a worthy and higher endeavour, such as protecting our home.</p><p>These are our common goals, our common spaces. We have to make them bigger and brighter, if we are to build a common future together. Madam, I support the Budget.</p><h6>2.54 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, I will deliver my speech in Malay.</span></p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150304/vernacular-4 Mar 2015 _ Mr Muhd Faisal A Manap _ Debate on Budget Statement (Malay).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Madam, the 2015 Budget, in my view, brings about a message of change in the Government's approach in its efforts to improve and bring benefits to Singaporeans.</p><p>It is observed that the Government's approach in this Budget is more inclined towards the left or an approach that emphasises more on aspects of social equilibrium, by giving more focus to the distribution of the state's resources to Singaporeans from all walks of life.</p><p>This shift is an encouraging one. As mentioned by my colleague, Ms Sylvia Lim, this Budget gives greater emphasis to the investment in human resources and the social safety net. Such emphasis is needed as the gap in income and property ownership in Singapore is worrying.</p><p>Madam, in this speech, I would like to touch on three aspects mentioned by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Mr Tharman, in his Budget speech, that is, firstly, on CPF; secondly, the Silver Support Scheme; and, thirdly, the fee waiver for national examinations as well as the Polytechnic and ITE examinations.</p><p>Madam, the Workers' Party would like to give two proposals for the CPF scheme. The first proposal is to lower the eligibility age to withdraw money from the Retirement Account, or the Payout Eligibility Age, previously known as the Draw Down Age.</p><p>At the moment, retirees will receive monthly payouts from the CPF Retirement Accounts when they reach the age of 65, beginning from 2018. We would like to suggest that this age limit to make a withdrawal should be lowered from 65 to 60 years old. We believe that this will provide relief to the account holders if they can choose to make their monthly withdrawals from their Retirement Accounts much earlier, for whatever reasons that they have.</p><p>The second proposal from the Workers' Party on the CPF scheme is something that has been mentioned before, that is, to separate the eligibility age to withdraw money from the Retirement Account, or the Payout Eligibility Age, from the retirement age. This will mean that the age when one can withdraw money from the Retirement Account will remain constant and will not be affected, even as the retirement age increases. We would like to suggest this because the majority of Singaporeans are unhappy that the Payout Eligibility Age limit to withdraw money from the Retirement Account is constantly changing and increasing. By maintaining this eligibility age limit, the account holders will have more assurance on when they can withdraw their CPF money and, therefore, they can make the appropriate plans.</p><p>Madam, the second matter that I would like to touch on is the Silver Support Scheme. This scheme is a good and much-needed initiative. This scheme enables Singaporeans aged 65 years and above, whose income levels are in the bottom 20%-30%, to enjoy financial support for life.</p><p>Madam, my concern about this scheme is its implementation process. The implementation process is an important aspect that will determine the effectiveness of this scheme in achieving its main goals. Through my observations and experience in the field of social work, whenever the criteria and assessment process are too stringent, there will be times when genuine and needy cases miss out on the opportunity to receive assistance.</p><p>As we know, the main aim of this scheme is to alleviate the financial burden of the elderly, who have contributed much to the development of Singapore and as a reflection of our values as an inclusive society. Hence, I hope that the Government will be able to implement the Silver Support Scheme with an open heart and mind and, with full of compassion, this scheme will provide maximum benefits to our senior citizens.</p><p>Madam, one more thing about the scheme is the payout method. As mentioned by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, payouts will be made to eligible senior citizens every three months. I believe that the payouts can be made every month so that it will be easier for the recipients to manage their monthly bills and expenditure.</p><p>Madam, the third matter that I would like to raise is the waiver of national examination fees, as well as the Polytechnic and ITE examination fees. I welcome this fee waiver for national examinations, such as the PSLE and the GCE \"N\", \"O\" and \"A\" levels, and also the fees for Polytechnic and ITE examinations, as announced earlier. This waiver of national examination fees covers all Singaporean students studying in the Government schools, whereas the waiver of Polytechnic and ITE examination fees are given to its full-time students.</p><p>Here, I would like to request MOE to consider extending this examination fee waiver to students who are in the private schools and also to students in the Polytechnic and ITE who are doing part-time studies.</p><p>Madam, in 2013, MOE<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;decided to extend the Edusave scheme to all Singaporean students aged between seven and 16 years. This decision was made 20 years after the Edusave scheme was introduced, that is, in 1993. Within that 20-year period, many students who were not studying in Government or public schools missed the opportunity to benefit from the scheme.</span></p><p>The Minister of State for Education, Ms Sim Ann, in her speech during the debate on the Education Endowment and Savings Schemes (Amendment) Bill, said that MOE had already conducted studies after the 2013 COS debates to extend the Edusave scheme and, after careful consideration, the Prime Minister announced that Edusave would be extended to all Singaporeans between the age of seven and 16 years old, during his National Day Rally speech in 2013.</p><p>Madam, I would like to request that MOE conduct a similar study and research on this matter, to consider the possibility of extending the waiver of national examination fees to all Singaporean students, instead of limiting it to students in the Government schools only, and to have similar measures for Polytechnic and ITE students who are doing part-time studies.</p><p>Madam, I would like to suggest that MOE also consider extending the FAS scheme to all Singaporean students studying in private schools. I feel it is important that every Government educational assistance scheme is extended to all Singaporean students because each one of these students will grow up to become citizens who will contribute to the development of the community and the nation.</p><p>Madam, in conclusion, I hope that the Government will seriously consider the suggestions that are put forward so that the above-mentioned schemes can bring more benefits to Singaporeans as a whole, in line with the Government's objective to build a fair and inclusive society.</p><h6>3.02 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the Budget. This year's Budget is an important one. I wish to start by commending the Minister for Finance and his colleagues at MOF for putting together what is a well-thought through and balanced Budget.</p><p>As our nation comes together to celebrate 50 years of Independence, it is especially timely that a central theme to emerge from this year's Budget is the need for more \"collective responsibility\" in how our country functions. Indeed, such a sense of \"collective responsibility\", shared by all Singaporeans, will be indispensable moving forward, if we are to achieve our stated goal of \"happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation\".</p><p>As with Budgets presented before this Parliament in recent years, this year's Budget continues to strike a balance. On the one hand, we need to continue to position our economy to sustain long-run success against the backdrop of a global economic environment that is constantly evolving. On the other hand, as a society, we recognise that there can be social costs to rapid economic growth. So, the Government has been consciously building up our social infrastructure and programmes to reach out to those segments of our society who need a helping hand.</p><p>This is a delicate balance that we need to strike. If we over-emphasise economic growth \u2013 run the engine of growth on over-drive \u2013 we risk becoming a country that becomes increasingly unequal, where the gains from growth do not trickle down broadly to all strata of society. We risk then becoming a house divided. Conversely, if we become overly generous in the social assistance that is extended through Government policies, we risk over-stretching our fiscal resources which we have prudently built up and steadfastly safeguarded over the years.</p><p>This year's Budget does a commendable job in continuing to fine-tune the tools and instruments that we use to achieve this delicate balance. Our economic trajectory moving forward will continue to depend on our on-going efforts to raise the productivity of our workforce. SkillsFuture has the potential to become an important thrust in this productivity drive. The Mittelstand model in Germany \u2013 where SMEs have built up the backbone of their workforce through a system of apprenticeship and gradual mastery of an expertise \u2013 has been critical to Germany's productivity and income growth. I thus applaud the Government's initiative to move our SMEs in this direction by providing substantial support to promote institution-based and structured job training that leads to a recognised qualification.</p><p>In terms of social assistance, I am heartened by the fact that the quantum of GST Vouchers will be increased and that S&amp;CC rebates will be extended, with the biggest beneficiaries being the lower income families and the elderly.</p><p>The centrepiece of this year's Budget in terms of social assistance is, of course, the proposed Silver Support Scheme. This will certainly go a long way towards ensuring that Singaporeans who have contributed to our economy throughout their working age years, but who now need some assistance in their retirement, will have a further safety net to prevent them from falling through the cracks.</p><p>This year's Budget also has several measures to reduce the burden on those in the \"sandwich\" class, who need to shoulder the responsibility of being caretakers for both their parents and their children. The reduction of income tax by 50% up to a cap of $1,000 and halving of the Foreign Domestic Worker levy are measures that will provide more options to middle-class Singaporeans who seek to juggle their work and family commitments.</p><p>While there is much to like about this year's Budget, there are, nevertheless, three broad issues that I would like to raise in reflecting on the challenges that lie ahead for Singapore.</p><p>The first is the issue of ensuring that our spending remains sustainable and responsible. Our Government has been doing the right thing, in terms of communicating to the public that our expenditures are inevitably rising. This is due to an ageing population, rising healthcare and the need to continually invest in upgrading our infrastructure and facilities. We have been, and always should be, upfront about what our projected outlays are, how we intend to finance them and how we continue to set aside sufficient amounts for the future in our reserves.</p><p>One does not have to look hard to find examples of what can go disastrously wrong when governments fail to be honest about their fiscal capacity. Witness, for example, what has happened in recent years to several European countries that have spent beyond their means. There will be payback time. In this regard, we, in Singapore, are fortunate to be dealing from a position of strength amidst a time of rising necessary expenses.</p><p>We are a rare country. We do not have our own natural resources and, yet, through the wisdom of our founding generation of leaders, we have set aside enough of our reserves and we have been, and continue to be, investing it wisely. This has helped us in no small measure to finance our rising social expenditures. Apart from oil- and mineral-rich countries, we are perhaps the only nation where our Net Investment Returns (NIRs) have consistently financed Government spending in a sustainable way. Speaking from my own background in finance, for the GIC to sustain a 6%-7% US dollar rate of return over a long horizon of 20 years is no small feat.</p><p>Our commitment to such investment returns is commendable. Thankfully, we have been able to meet these commitments up to this point. I support the Government's intention to include Temasek Holdings in the NIR framework, as well as to spend up to 50% of MAS, GIC and Temasek's long-term expected returns in the service of the nation.</p><p>However, I also urge the Government to be prudent in spending up to this limit. Building up a critical mass of reserves is important, as a bigger percentage of a small notional value is inferior to a smaller percentage of a large notional value. To determine the value of these expected long-term returns, I hope the Government will establish a robust framework that will stand the test of time, even as the global investment climate and outlook have become more volatile and uncertain. Any modelling errors will not just be mathematical errors. They would have a real impact on future generations of Singaporeans.</p><p>The second point I would like to emphasise is that our viability and success as an economy can only be maintained if we safeguard our reputation as one of the best places in the world for doing business. We have to ensure that the right institutions and conditions are in place for worthy businesses to take root and expand, whether these be our own domestic SMEs or foreign multinationals looking to us as a base for their regional operations.</p><p>Along these lines, I agree with the proposed plans to delay previously announced increases in foreign worker levies for S Pass holders by one year and to also put on hold for a year the planned levy increases for Work Permit holders. Our labour market is very tight.</p><p>In my role as a member of the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for MTI, I have often heard feedback from SMEs that the availability of good workers remains a constraint. Our SMEs often say that they are making a concerted and genuine effort to hire Singaporeans and PRs, but it is an ongoing challenge to recruit and retain such personnel amidst the tight and competitive labour market. The measures in this year's Budget are, therefore, a pragmatic means to ensure that we do not choke off the necessary labour resources for our firms to stay vibrant, while continuing to stay the course of weaning our economy off an over-reliance on inexpensive foreign labour. I should further add that several business owners that I have spoken to are looking forward to hear more details about the Government's approach to implement the Sectoral Manpower Plans (SMPs) in all key sectors by 2020.</p><p>We also have to guard against a situation similar to that in the US where some companies are unable to expand due to the dearth of H1B visas that are set aside for relatively skilled foreign talent. Recently, the nine foreign Chambers of Commerce have voiced their concerns that some foreign companies are considering a pull-out from Singapore due to their inability to fulfil their staffing needs. We should pay heed and ensure that we do not over-tighten the supply of labour to the point where it has drastic consequences for all companies \u2013 including Singaporean companies \u2013 and the economy of Singapore.</p><p>My third and final point is that our sense of collective responsibility as a nation needs to go hand-in-hand with a spirit of personal responsibility. We have to strive to build a culture where each member of our workforce openly embraces the opportunities to improve themselves, reskill and upgrade, in order to stay productive and relevant in the fast-paced global economy.</p><p>This year's Budget does the right thing by, once again, making monetary support available and by putting in place schemes, such as SkillsFuture. But without a personal commitment \u2013 rooted in a sense of responsibility towards oneself and one's family \u2013 we will not have the necessary buy-in for these policies to take off. On our part, the Government will need to collaborate closely with industry in order to identify the right training courses to sponsor under SkillsFuture that would ensure a tight fit between the skills that our workers acquire and the skills that the industry needs.</p><p>To sum up my Budget speech, a number of principles have helped us to successfully navigate as a society to our 50th year of collective existence. It is useful to take stock and recognise that there is no free lunch out there. Even while the Government can soften the landing for those who are falling through the cracks and try to level up the playing field for all Singaporeans, we should not forget how and what got us here. We must safeguard our strong fiscal position. And we have to be nimble and willing to upgrade in order to stay ahead in what is going to be an increasingly competitive global landscape.</p><p>Our strengthened social safety nets will help us to ensure that no one falls through the cracks. But our mindset as a society should never turn into one where we expect someone else to cushion the fall for us. Only then can we retain our hunger, our drive, to keep improving Singapore. Together, let us build another good 50 years. I support the Budget.</p><h6>3.13 pm</h6><p><strong>Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, Budget 2015 is innovative, comprehensive and also seeks to reduce income inequality.</p><p>Yes, Budget 2015 is a breakthrough Budget, but there is a need to identify whom this breakthrough is for. \"There is no free lunch\" has been the mantra of this Government for a very long time. In keeping with this mantra, for about 50 years, assistance schemes have been kept measly and targeted at a small group of people.</p><p>The reality, however, is that, in any society, some people need free lunches. After pressures from various quarters and, especially from the people of Singapore, there seems to be a mind-shift in the top echelon about doing more for the less-abled. So, the breakthrough is more for the ruling Party, the Budget is a testament to that and, so, it must be welcomed.</p><p>The Silver Support Scheme is a permanent feature of Singapore's social safety net which gives assurance in retirement. The scheme will disburse annual payouts targeted at needy elderly Singaporeans who comprise the bottom 30% of the lower-income and sandwich class aged 65 and older. It will cost $350 million for the first year and will likely rise over the years when more Singaporeans turn 65 and the cost of living rises.</p><p>The scheme is especially welcomed. It is a signature scheme which the Government officially acknowledges that there is a sizeable number of senior citizens who receive a meagre income for sustenance. About 150,000 people will benefit from the scheme.</p><p>The scheme should be reviewed every four years for future batches of the elderly to prevent under-declaring their income, which defeats the purpose of promoting strong work ethics.</p><p>While the Silver Support Scheme is commendable, it benefits a relatively small group of senior citizens. Many citizens over the age of 65 have contributed much to Singapore in their younger days. The Government could have recognised the contributions of these older citizens by a Senior Citizen Allowance Scheme which will give all citizens above the age of 65 years $500 two times in a year. Such a scheme will be on top of the Silver Support Scheme. The scheme should cost the Government about $450 million in the first year.</p><p>Budget 2015 should also mention the Social Service Sector, an important sector which provides for social and community services in Singapore. The Government should help this sector to achieve sustainable economies while using resources productively, instead of just depending on charity for funding their objectives.</p><p>Since the intent of HDB's resale levy is to reduce the second subsidy for second-time HDB flat buyers, it is a fair policy to have. It is the desire of many middle-income families to move to a slightly larger HDB flat. To a considerable number of citizens who aspire to upgrade to a bigger flat, the resale levy, which has to be paid upfront, remains an obstacle. The resale levy policy could be revised where the levy of between $15,000 and $50,000, depending on the type of first flat owned, is added to the price of the second flat and the second-timer is given an option to either pay upfront in cash, or monthly, throughout the duration of his mortgage loan.</p><p>Car ownership. In Singapore, car ownership is a necessity rather than a luxury for needy commuters. They need a car for various reasons. The bigger upfront fees, cap on car financing loan and deposit quantums mean many middle-income commuters who want a car will be priced out of the market. At the time of introducing the curbs on car financing, the Finance Minister said that the measures were not permanent and were meant to keep a lid on inflationary pressures and rein in borrowing. As concerns of inflation have now lessened and as car loans are not unsecured, the Government should lift the cap on car loans at up to 60% of the purchase price.</p><p>The Government should also consider removing the Certificate of Entitlement system, which curbs car ownership, to a system which is premised on car usage.</p><p>In the Our Singapore Conversation, job security emerged as the top three concerns of Singapore. In a recent Nielsen survey, job security topped the list of concerns for Singaporeans. Even if the unemployment rate in Singapore among citizens remains relatively low at 2.6%, the unions reported that: \"At the national level, 7,710 workers were retrenched in the first three quarters of 2014, based on figures from MOM. This is higher than the 7,220 laid off in the corresponding period a year before, as more workers were retrenched in the services sector last year.\"</p><p>The Budget could have called for the establishment of an insurance scheme as a safety net for middle-income Singaporeans for whom the security of continuous employment is increasingly being thrown into question. The Korean Employment Insurance Scheme (EIS) should be studied as a model.</p><p>The Budget will provide for a Personal Income Tax Rebate of 50%, with a cap of $1,000. It must be noted that the majority of Singaporeans, about 55%, do not pay income tax. So, even if most squeezed middle income families will not cheer this tax rebate, it will, nevertheless, benefit a sizeable number of middle-income and the high-middle income families.</p><p>The Budget halves the Foreign Domestic Worker concessionary levy&nbsp;\u2013 from the current $120 to $60&nbsp;\u2013 to help families who are taking care of the elderly from 1 May. The concessionary levy will also be extended to households with children aged below 16 \u2013 up from below 12. This levy could be totally waived for the first Foreign Domestic Worker for households who employ such workers to care for senior citizens. This would not only further lessen the burden on such households, but will also help the elderly to age in place rather than in a nursing home.</p><p>The Budget announced that the top marginal income tax rate will go up to 22% from the current 20% for the highest income-earners with a chargeable income of above $320,000. There will also be smaller adjustments made to raise income tax for the others in the top 5% bracket. I suppose this is done presumably to meet the rising social expenditure.</p><p>The Budget will be funded by the top 5% of income earners from 2017. We have got another two more years to go. What will happen when the economy hits a recession? How do we fund it then?</p><p>Tax increases may also affect people's confidence in Government policies when overdone and might affect Singapore's competitiveness. The Government has to find a balance for it.</p><p>Some analysts have predicted that the Government will further raise indirect taxes, like GST, to fund the rising social spending. GST is a regressive tax and the Government should not only maintain the GST at the current 7%, but should also identify essential goods and remove the GST on these essential goods.</p><p>To help cushion the impact on the lower income earners, we should exempt GST on certain necessities, such as milk powder, diapers, medicines, health supplements, mobility aids and exercise equipment for the elderly. Apparently, the usage of diapers was rationed in some nursing homes to reduce costs. In my opinion, this is very unhygienic for the wearer.</p><p>Yesterday, Nominated Member Ms Chia Yong Yong cautioned not to lean too much to the left, lest we have nothing much left in social spending. While this idea seems intuitively correct and is consistent with the popular narrative of the economy, I would also like to point out that between countries like Sweden which spends about 30% of its GDP on social spending and others like Hong Kong which spends about 3%, there is a middle path. Finding the middle path is what Singapore has to get right.</p><p>The need to raise revenue to meet the rising social spending, though, is real for the Government and it should consider the following measures.</p><p>First, raise the top-marginal income tax rate to 25%. I think it will raise a lot of eyebrows, but this would still be one of the lowest top-marginal income tax rates in the world and, at the same time, would raise our revenue of $500 million to $1 billion.&nbsp;The Finance Minister said that the change to top income rates is expected to raise additional revenue of $400 million per year when it comes into effect. So, if it is raised by a further 3%, the additional revenue would be about $1 billion.</p><p>Second, reinstate estate duty at 5% for total assets, without differentiating between residential properties or other assets between $10 million and $15 million, and 10% for amounts above that.</p><p>Third, raise the casino tax rates to 22.5% for non-premium players and 7.5% for premium players.</p><p>Fourth, include capital receipts, which include revenue from sales of land and capital goods and other capital receipts, as revenue receipts.</p><p>Education. The Budget announced several measures for students from childcare to Polytechnic education, for example, the new partner operating scheme, lifting of examination fees and so on, but it stopped short of making major announcements for tertiary students, except for the top-ups to Post-Secondary Education Accounts which the Finance Minister said could be used for offsetting course fees for ITE and Diploma students. This is probably because of the Government's concern about the graduate glut which it feels could result in \"over-educated and under-employed\" workers.</p><p>I am all for the Government's initiative to build a foundation and create an environment for lifelong learning which empowers each Singaporean young or old to chart their own journey in life and to gain fulfilment at work and even in senior years.</p><p>I myself obtained my BA in Communication and Media Management last year from UNISA. I think I am one of the oldest Members in this House and all the Ministers are my younger brothers.</p><p>The Government appears to be offsetting the effect of increased interests for CPF accounts for the first $30,000 in CPF accounts from the age of 55 by increasing the contributions of employees aged 55-65 for both employees and employers. In total, we believe this signifies the Government's intention to stick to a more conservative approach to the CPF. We continue to urge the Government to move towards more flexible options for the usage of CPF savings. This is increasingly the case because Singaporeans, starting from their late 50s, cannot afford to be cash-strapped.</p><p>Singaporeans have expressed that concerns, especially manpower issues, are not adequately tackled in the Budget. Most importantly, the issue of rising costs of business and high rental costs for SMEs was not addressed. Every type of costs should be reviewed, from skills levy, utilities, hiring of workers. For example, some restaurants cannot cope with customers because of the worker crunch. This problem may lead to a dip in productivity or for it to stay flat for sectors, such as construction, retail and food and beverage.</p><p>We need to micro-manage the system of hiring Work Permit holders not just by giving monetary incentives to boost productivity for companies. Productivity incentives should not be positioned as subsidies. As I mentioned in my Budget speech last year, the firms with low productivity should be allowed to be restructured, acquired or even closed down.</p><p>As Singapore faces economic uncertainty and global competition like other counties, we need to foster deep skills and innovation to be positioned amongst the leaders in Asia and globally. The next stage of economic restructuring is to keep the economy vibrant by pushing for innovation beyond productivity.</p><p>To meet our future economic and social needs, Singapore is investing in infrastructure for the future, such as embarking on the development of Changi Airport's new Terminal 5.</p><p>Middle-income families in Singapore are the group that forms the bulk of the community who are generally viewed as helping to maintain society on an even keel. It is the middle-income group that we want to look after. They are also the active stakeholders with investments in infrastructure. They feel the squeeze in the rise of their monthly income, compared to households from the top and bottom of the ladder.</p><p>Driven by technology advances, these are the Singaporeans who should be most interested in the SkillsFuture initiatives which aim to encourage continuous learning to master the skills relevant to their work or pick up new ones or, hopefully, lift up their wages.</p><p>I hope the SkillsFuture initiatives will take a targeted approach by identifying the skills required by each sector to support their development. More details on the SkillsFuture credits should be more forthcoming to fund their training costs.</p><p>Attrition risks may put firms off SkiilsFuture Credits and I would caution that the SkillsFuture initiatives may not lead to more job loyalty or higher pay increase because most Singapore employers are rather stingy or because they really cannot afford to pay.</p><p>In fact, I would think SkillsFuture may lead to more job hopping!</p><p>Also, $500 SkillsFuture Credit for every Singaporean 25 years and above can also be accumulated for future years may not be ideal.</p><p>What should be noticed is the Special Employment Credit (SEC) and the additional SEC which provide employers with a wage offset encouraging Re-employment beyond age 65.</p><p>What can be deduced from Budget 2015? It has taken incremental steps in addressing some of the inequality in our society. But incremental means unnecessary inconveniences and hardships for those who are affected now by these problems and need solutions to them now and not in the future.</p><p>Budget 2015 recognises that many Singaporeans clamour for a more egalitarian society where income inequality is further reduced, but has attempted to address them not in a holistic manner but with tokenism.</p><p>With its lack of sufficient support for Singaporeans wishing to pursue University education to the schemes to encourage employment beyond age 65, Budget 2015 sets the vision for most Singaporeans to be employed after attaining their ITE or Diploma qualifications and to stay employed to a ripe old age.</p><p>Perhaps, Budget 2015 has tried to entrench the \"work till you drop\" mantra because the current Government is concerned that competitors are out to steal the lunch of Singaporeans and that it is better for us to guard our lunch.</p><p>So, yes, from \"no free lunch\" to \"guarding your lunch\", there has been some progress and Budget 2015 highlights this and I thank the Finance Minister for his hard work on this Budget. Mdm Speaker, I support the Motion.</p><h6>3.32 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, one of my business friends cheered the Budget deficit this year and declared that Singapore would need to get used to frequent budget deficits, given the current voter sentiments. I reminded him that Singapore could go down the road of Greece if we have persistent budget deficits. He shot back and said that the US has survived with many years of budget deficits.</p><p>Singapore is no US. For the record, the US has been running a budget deficit in 45 out of the past 50 years and the US national debt is now at a staggering US$18 trillion. Of the US$18 trillion, more than US$6 trillion of the debt is held by foreign investors, the largest chunk of which is held by China and Japan at about US$1.3 trillion and US$1.2 trillion, respectively.</p><p>Will ASEAN bail Singapore out like what the EU has done for Greece? The answer is a definite no. Will China and Japan bail Singapore out if we have massive debts? The answer is far from certain. If we start to have persistent budget deficits over the years just to please the voters, it will be the beginning of a slippery slope downhill. Singapore will fall into the trap of what was expressed in the Chinese saying \u201c\u5bcc\u4e0d\u8fc7\u4e09\u4ee3\u201d \u2013 that is, our prosperity will decline sharply after the third generation.</p><p>Hence, there is a need for the Singapore Government to exercise financial discipline. For that matter, we are glad that the current $6.7 billion deficit in this year's Budget could be funded by the $15 billion Budget surpluses accumulated over the last four years by the current term of the Government. In addition, much of the $6.7 billion deficit is meant for the Changi Airport Development Fund which amounts to $3 billion and other provisions for top-ups, such as the Special Employment Credit Fund and so on. This is prudent.</p><p>When the Government introduced the Pioneer Generation (PG) Package last year, the Government set aside $8 billion to fund the PG Package. This year, the Government introduced the Silver Support Scheme which would only start in 2016 and would cost about $350 million in the first year. However, the Government does not specify how it is to be funded. Is it to be funded through the Budget of next year and future years? Or is the $350 million part of the $11.67 billion for Special Transfers, Top-ups to the Endowment Funds and Trust Funds? If it is not, would the Government consider using part of the remaining surpluses of $8 billion accumulated over the last four years to set up a Silver Support Fund so as not to burden the future generations too much? By the way, I support the principle behind the Silver Support Scheme where the most needy receive some financial support. In this way, we could better make use of the limited resources rather than giving money to all above 65 years old, as suggested by Mrs Lina Chiam. In fact, this suggestion of giving money to all, including millionaires above 65 years old, goes against the policy of taxing the rich, which is supported by even Mrs Lina Chiam herself and the Workers' Party.</p><p>Madam, I turn now to the increased petrol duty, which was labelled as the biggest stink in this Budget, as proclaimed by many car users. The increase in petrol duty would yield about $177 million a year or a net revenue of $33 million in the first year after the one-off one-year road tax rebate. As mentioned, the petrol duty hike has caused much angst among car users. If this Budget is an election year budget, as framed by Ms Rachel Chang of&nbsp;The Straits Times&nbsp;in her commentary, then the $33 million gain from the petrol duty hike does not appear to be a clever move. This is because most of the Budget goodies only take effect in the later part of this year or in 2016, but the increase in petrol duty is immediate, burning a hole in the pocket before one can smell something sweet.</p><p>The increase in petrol duty, however, needs to be looked at in totality, together with the policy tweak on the Carbon Emission-based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS). I understand that the Government is trying to urge Singaporeans to buy car models with lower carbon emissions by increasing the rebate quantum and petrol prices at the same time.</p><p>Assuming an average car owner uses about 50 litres of intermediate grade petrol a week, the impact of the increased petrol tax of $0.15 per litre will cost about $416 a year, inclusive of GST. Over a 10-year period, assuming all other factors remain constant, the impact is $4,160. This is less than the $5,000 rebate for an A4 band car, the lowest band that enjoys Additional Registration Fee (ARF) rebates due to lower carbon emissions. Nonetheless, I must say the cost of a greener car is much higher than a normal car currently. Moreover, the current tweak in the CEVS only increases the rebate for the highest band of the lowest carbon emission car without touching the rest of the bands.</p><p>Hence, I would like to urge the Government to be more generous in the ARF rebates under the CEVS. Otherwise, the increased petrol duty is unlikely to nudge Singaporeans to buy greener cars and will be portrayed as a means to raise tax revenues.</p><p>Madam, I would like to touch on the mindset about older workers and please allow me to speak in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150304/vernacular-Ang Wei Neng Budget 4 March 2015_Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;Ten years ago, workers aged 50 to 59 made up 17% of our workforce. By 2014, this ratio had increased by five percentage points to 22%. In fact, with every 10 working adults, more than three are above 50 years old. In this year's Budget, the employer's CPF contribution rate for workers aged 50 and above is raised by 0.5% to 1%. Consequently, that pleases one-third of our workforce. As a matter of fact, these older workers have, for a long time, been unhappy with their lower employer's CPF contribution rate, particularly the older white-collar workers. They often questioned if their productivity was, indeed, lowered significantly upon turning 50 or 55.</p><p>Perhaps, we could reflect on why the Government had made significant reductions to the CPF contribution rate of workers above 50 years old in 2003 and 2005. At that time, we were going through a financial crisis and many companies were retrenching workers. In fact, those who were in their 50s were the worst hit. In subsequent years, even though the economy had recovered, the influx of foreign workers had eroded the competitiveness of our local workers, especially the older blue-collar workers. In order to encourage employers to continue hiring older workers, the Government had to lower the employer's CPF contribution rate.</p><p>Today, the tide has turned. With economic restructuring and tightening of the foreign workforce, employers are more willing to employ older workers and have since learnt to appreciate their reliability. Moreover, employers receive Special Employment Credit of up to 8% of the worker's pay when they hire workers who are above 50 years old. This is why the employment rate for those aged 50 to 64 has increased year on year, reaching a new high last year and is likely to improve further.</p><p>In view of the above, maybe the Government could consider gradually increasing the employer's contribution rate for workers between 55 and 62 years old, until they reach the same rate as the younger workers. This suggestion will bring about the following benefits.</p><p>Firstly, we can recognise the contributions of older workers, just like how we recognise the contributions of the Pioneer Generation.</p><p>Secondly, we can rectify the wrong perception that productivity of older workers will drop significantly once they reach the age of 55 or at any particular age.</p><p>Thirdly, a higher employer CPF contribution will enable older workers to accumulate more CPF balances, so that they could better enjoy their twilight years.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;I had earlier explained in Chinese that when we reduced the employer's CPF contribution rate in the last decade, it was because we were concerned that employers may be reluctant to hire older workers probably due to their perceived lower productivity. That may hold true for older blue-collar workers, in particular, involving manual work. In fact, the abundance of foreign workers at that time might have further eroded the competitiveness of our local older workers.</p><p>However, the tide has turned. The tide turned after we started the economic restructuring process. The tide turned after we tightened the growth of foreign labour in recent years. The tide turned as many employers now cannot find enough local workers. In fact, many firms have to resort to hiring older workers in their late 60s on a part-time basis so that they could have enough quotas to hire foreign workers.</p><p>In the first place, the pay of many older blue-collar workers is quite low. For an average monthly income of $2,000, 1% additional CPF contribution will mean $20 more each month. For employers, the additional CPF contribution is unlikely to be a deterrent factor for employing older workers, considering today's tight labour market, not forgetting the generous 8% Special Employment Credit for hiring older workers. Hence, the time may be ripe for the Government to set a timeframe to restore the employer's CPF contribution rate for workers between 55-62 years old in stages. Why 62? Because it is the official retirement age right now. This will send a strong message that older workers are valued, just like how we value our Pioneer Generation. With this, I support the Motion.</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>: <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Order. I propose to take the break now.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, when I sat here listening to Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam on 23 February delivering the Budget speech, I could not help but wonder what the Budget entitled, \"Building Our Future, Strengthening Social Security\" really meant to my fellow Singaporeans. To tell you the truth, I do not know yet. But one thing I do know, Madam, is that more and more Singaporeans are watching and they want this Parliament to continue to make Singapore better and, most importantly, to improve their lives.</p><p>I saw that there are many noble objectives that this Budget aims to achieve. But, Madam, it is how we work towards achieving those goals that really matters because that is how we will and can affect the lives of Singaporeans for the better.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, by all counts and benchmarks, whether in education, housing, economy, healthcare and many more, as a young country, we can be proud to say that we have done reasonably well. Singaporeans know that they are living in a much better condition than in many other countries. The challenge then is for us to continue to do well and improve on our shortcomings. Since the early days of Singapore's Independence, we have worked hard to provide for our people and we have focused on the fundamentals and basics very well. The three areas of thrusts that we had single-mindedly worked on, namely, public housing, education and employment, have brought us far and forward in development. Living conditions improved, lives got better, there were good-paying jobs and our citizens became more educated.</p><p>Over the past 50 years, our country has progressed, all communities in Singapore flourished and progressed, including the Malay community. Coming from the Malay community, I would say that we have made lots of leaps and bounds in progress and this has happened unabated for many years. The Malay community made significant progress in many areas, like housing, educational achievements, employment and also businesses. The rapid development of our economy had provided an impetus for the community, which is a minority in Singapore, to advance and stand tall side by side among other fellow Singaporeans. Nevertheless, Madam, even as we continue to progress, we still face challenges that we need to overcome together. Just like many others in this country, this is a new Singapore, a new landscape where we face many common challenges. These challenges cut across racial and cultural boundaries.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, there are lots of good things that we can say about the proposed Budget, like the timely introduction of the Silver Support Scheme for the elderly in the low-income bracket, the SkillsFuture Scheme, the enhancement of the CPF for workers above 55 years of age and many other programmes to support low-income families and students. These are desirable \"goodies\" and we want them. The rational questions will be to ask: how much more will these cost us in the future? And can we continue to afford all these good programmes in the long run?</p><p>I would like to thank the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance for giving a very comprehensive and inclusive Budget this year. We are fortunate to have a Government which has steered our economy on an even keel through these difficult years. We were able to do so because we were united as a society and we operated as a country with one voice. And we have been able to advance for 50 years, each year adding more progress to the previous.</p><p>The key point now is for Singaporeans to pause and ponder: how can we go on for another 50 years? Are we able to continue to keep alive that same spirit of working together as one so that we can stay united and in harmony for not just the next five to 10 years or, better still, another 50 years? There are many issues today which can cause divisiveness in our society. I would like to highlight my concerns of three key challenges that could divide us and cause a breakdown of our society.</p><p>The first challenge is the \"widening income gap and income divide\". Many of my colleagues in this House have spoken of these issues. As a city state where residents live in very close proximity, our challenges are further amplified. We see, we observed, we hear, we are so connected and, naturally, we compare and we reflect. There are acute stresses of wanting to achieve and do well. Sometimes, it manifests itself in unhealthy and unsavoury behaviour in the society; even in such an important area as the education of our young. I acknowledge that in the last few years, our Government through specific policies and also the Budget, had attempted to address some of the worries and trends. In this year's Budget, more is being done to make us a more inclusive society.</p><p>The second challenge is the issue of \"local versus foreign\". Rightly or wrongly, this has become a very thorny and emotional topic that has touched many lives of Singaporeans and foreigners alike. Mdm Speaker, I am sure that this House will agree with me that, in all that we do, we must think of Singaporeans first. We are, after all, the elected representatives of Singaporeans. I believe we can do more to ensure that Singapore always has a strong Singaporean Core and that Singaporeans must always come first, even as we welcome newcomers and new businesses to sink roots here. I do not think anyone \u2013 individual or company \u2013 will argue with the fact that while we welcome people to Singapore, we would also like to be assured that they will contribute to the Singaporean Core. This House has shown time and time again and, as illustrated, that we have been judicious and have always put Singaporeans at the centre of whatever is important and good.</p><p>The third challenge that we face is the \"political divide\". I met an old friend recently who expressed his concerns about what he called a very divided Singapore. He highlighted that, nowadays, in all his interactions with friends, colleagues and even family members, he noticed people are more polarised and divided. This view is not an isolated one. I have heard many expressing similar perspectives. Worse, we have many fellow travellers who are always willing and waiting to wedge any crevice they can find to create a chasm in our community. It seems almost fashionable for people to ape the politics of divide from other parts of the world and push the idea that only through deep divisions that our country can progress. Those who have turned a blind eye to events of the past that caused bloodshed and disharmony would, I hope, think carefully before they embark on the bandwagon to create discord in our society. I urge Singaporeans to pay close attention to their antics and to ask: why are they doing what they are doing? What is their motivation?</p><p>I am not saying everyone must agree with all Government policies. By all means disagree. By all means share with us your disagreement, as one would in a democratic and civil society. But do not hide behind the cloak of anonymity in the new media. We have seen this trend and, of course, some would say we cannot stop them and it is part of the new age. So, we have to ask ourselves: what else can we do to overcome this? How do we share with other Singaporeans so that they can make an informed judgement and not let their emotions move them to illogical actions?</p><p>A case in point is this Budget. In it, there are many important strategies, messages and policies that need to be properly articulated, explained and digested. How do we do this properly and effectively? If there is one thing that I could think of which is more important now than ever is communication. This can be through various media or by face-to-face engagements. We have to balance between those who are net-savvy and the older generation who would rely on the print and broadcast media, and, of course, the face-to-face interaction. While we move with the new media, we have to go back to the basics of yesteryears. The Government should have more information officers to go out and explain policies to the public, together with the Members of Parliament. Grassroots organisations should review their terms of reference and put in more effort and time on such engagements. In the old days, we used to warn the public \"don't listen to rumours\" and \"don't spread rumours\". This is still relevant today \u2013 and the new media is one big rumour-mongering machine.</p><p>In this regard, I would urge the Government to put more resources for our young people to keep them engaged. I am glad that the Government is injecting more resources to give our young job opportunities, career opportunities, so that they do not feel left behind or unwanted. While it is good that we have counsellors to help our young in the institutions of higher learning to chart their career paths, we should also have counsellors to guide our young beyond just career and economic objectives. Life is more than just about money and economics. How do we imbue in our people a sense of responsibility and a sense of ownership in the destiny of our country?</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I would certainly say from the way our Budget is rolling out the various benefits for the elderly, working families and even for the working adults, we are a caring society. Beyond social assistance, it is a right strategy to give Singaporeans more opportunities for them to further their training through the SkillsFuture Credit scheme so that they can aim at excelling in their careers or, at least, be ready for the future. I laud this initiative and encourage Singaporean workers to maximise their potential through SkillsFuture and many other CET programmes. Mdm Speaker, in Malay.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150304/vernacular-4 Mar 2015 _ Mr Zainudin Nordin _ Debate on Budget Statement (Malay).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Just like Ms Chia Yong Yong, I am concerned with the proposal to withdraw the CPF money much earlier. It will not only increase the risk to our workers; in fact, it will also reduce their CPF savings in their retirement age. I believe that it is better if we encourage our workers to save their money and keep it in their CPF accounts as long as possible, so that they can benefit from the new CPF account schemes that will be launched soon.</p><p>Another idea that I strongly support is the one proposed by our parliamentary colleague, Dr Intan Azura, to waive the annual examination fees for our&nbsp;madrasah&nbsp;students. This is the policy of an inclusive society which is encouraged by our Government. And I hope that this idea will be accepted by the Government.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;In conclusion, Mdm Speaker, this year, we celebrate SG50. We, Singaporeans, have benefited from a stable and peaceful Singapore that is the envy of many around the world. It would not be wrong to say that we want to continue with the current prosperity and stability and maybe even more. But, Madam, Singaporeans do face real challenges that may directly or indirectly due to the current and the past policies of our Government. I am sure that the Government will make an effort to improve and come up with programmes and policies to look after the needs of all Singaporeans. All I ask is that we recognise our residents for who they are, what they aspire to and help shape Government policies to help them achieve their dreams as we have hoped for all Singaporeans. Then, we would have forged a new social compact where we all can work hand-in-hand for a better tomorrow for our Singaporeans. Mdm Speaker, I support the proposed Budget.</p><h6>4.18 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to participate in this year's Budget debate.</p><p>I would like to start by recalling the outcome of the final report of \"Our Singapore Conversation Survey\" which was carried out in 2012. In this survey, public housing, public healthcare and job security were the top three priorities cited by Singaporeans in what they want to see in Singapore in the next 20 years. I had the opportunity to participate in some of these conversation sessions. Many of us wondered at that time whether this exercise was, indeed, just another \"talkshop\" or&nbsp;wayang, as some detractors call it, to give the appearance that the Government is interested to listen to its people.</p><p>Today, I feel a sense of pride and satisfaction in that I had participated in an exercise which may have contributed in some ways to the string of policies which has benefited and will continue to benefit our community in years to come.</p><p>In public housing, for example, MND has ramped up the development of public housing and, in the process, helped to contain the rising prices of HDB flats. In public healthcare, we have the introduction of MediShield Life which seeks to keep healthcare costs affordable. And while job security is something that cannot be guaranteed, the Government has introduced measures to help Singaporeans who lose their jobs to acquire new skills and to create more opportunities to get themselves back into the job market. To many of us who were involved, it does seem that the Government is, indeed, listening to the voices of its people and taking concrete steps to address the concerns of its people.</p><p>In the same vein, as in the last couple of years, this year's Budget has yet more measures to help the community. To name a few, the SkillsFuture Credit provides funds for working Singaporeans to upgrade themselves. An enhanced CPF income ceiling and interest rate help increase the available funds for retirement. Also, the Silver Support Scheme provides funds to the low-income elderly.</p><p>Since yesterday, we have had a lengthy debate on the measures introduced in this year's Budget, so I would like to focus on just a few areas pertaining to cost of living. Despite the many forms of assistance from the Government, bread-and-butter issues continue to be a concern for many Singaporeans who still worry about bringing up their families in today's environment. Property prices have risen considerably, the cost of education, transport, basic necessities have all gone up and it makes me wonder if future generations will actually have a harder time than our generation.</p><p>Madam, just a few weeks back, a survey done by REACH says that the top three concerns amongst Singaporeans are retirement adequacy, healthcare costs and cost of living. This is despite a more rosy report on household expenditures a few months back that says that household income has risen faster than expenses. I think we know now that household income does not rise at the same rate for everyone and that those in the lower-income bracket are likely to rise at a lower rate quantum-wise. One can make a point that for low-income Singaporeans, cost of living will always be a concern and assistance from the Government will always be appreciated. But when middle-income Singaporeans express these concerns and hope for some form of assistance from the Government, I think we should be more alarmed and delve deeper into the root of the problem. More so because we pride ourselves to be a developed country with one of the highest GDP per capita in the world.</p><p>In discussing cost of living issues, I noted that, generally, priorities in what we spend on have changed dramatically. Many household items considered luxury in the past have become cheap enough to be owned by many households. Handphones are now a must. Cable TV, LED TV, computers, air-conditioners are more commonplace. These additional expenses, on top of the traditional basic necessities, have all added to the monthly expenses that a family needs to cope with. Furthermore, some Singaporeans have taken that additional property loan, car loan, personal loan and hire purchase which then increase their debt obligations and add to their pressure in meeting monthly expenses. Most Singaporeans spend first, then see how much they can save. The more prudent ones will set aside a fixed amount of minimum savings, spend within a budgeted amount and save the balance. According to another survey, only three out of 10 Singaporeans start to think about retirement planning when they start working. There is certainly room for improvement for the average Singaporean to manage their expenses and finances better so that they do not fall into difficulty when they lose their job or fall seriously ill. The Government launched MoneySENSE in 2003 to educate the public on financial literacy, but I see it even more relevant today as we face a future of rising costs, uncertain global economic growth, volatile job opportunities and the spectre of rising interest rates. We should take personal responsibility for our own finances and ensure that we do not live beyond our means and are not saddled with huge household debts.</p><p>Having said that, there are areas where I think the Government can and should do more to help the average Singaporean, not only for current generations, but also for future generations. I have singled out two areas. First is public housing and second is public education.</p><p>Housing is a basic necessity. One can rent a house to stay or buy it outright. Singaporeans tend to buy rather than rent where housing is concerned. In fact, Singapore has one of the highest home ownership rates in the world. Some buy two, three or more houses. Some buy for their children in fear that property prices will go up and become unaffordable. Some buy to rent out and earn passive income. Of course, there is nothing wrong with all this. But for the majority of Singaporeans, we own one property to call home. Home prices have been escalating, driven by strong demand and, more recently, due to the prolonged low interest rate environment. It is not uncommon to hear people making a tidy profit from selling their homes and then buying a bigger home and taking more loan. The term \"asset-rich cash-poor\" is common now as people continue to plough as much as they can of their savings, both cash and CPF, into their property, leaving very little for their retirement.</p><p>In a survey done by DBS Bank last year, many Singaporeans do not have a retirement plan. Many hoped to have $3,500 to spend a month for 15 to 20 years, but many hardly have enough in their CPF savings to meet this need. This is a problem of today. I think we have too much of our accumulated wealth locked into our properties, thus, the phrase \"asset-rich cash-poor\" cannot be more apt. Can we then imagine the implication for future generations should home prices continue to escalate? Is this sustainable? Or will more people then resort to renting a home because home prices have become unaffordable.</p><p>Madam, there is only 716 sq km of Singapore. Unless we are able to acquire land somewhere else, future generations of Singaporeans will have to contend with the prevailing prices of the day and, if they cannot, they may have to rent or maybe even migrate. I, therefore, hope that the Government can tighten the regulation on public housing prices to ensure that it remains affordable for generations to come. I also hope that we are able to reverse this \"asset-rich cash-poor\" phenomenon, perhaps, by capping the amount of CPF funds we can use for property purchases so that more Singaporeans have sufficient retirement funds and are able to retire comfortably without having to downsize their home.</p><p>Now, allow me to touch on public education. Since our Independence, the Government has rightly provided practically free Primary and Secondary education. Singaporeans have benefited from this free education and we currently have one of the best educated and efficient workforces in the world. Tertiary education, however, is not free and, in fact, its cost has been on the rise recently and can no longer be regarded affordable for some courses. There are bursaries and financial assistance schemes available for students to tap into to help defray the cost of education. However, affordability is not a given and there is the possibility that cash-strapped parents may allow or even encourage their children to join the workforce first, instead of continuing their further education.</p><p>In today's environment, Secondary school education is hardly adequate, not if we want to continue producing a world-class workforce. ITE and Polytechnic graduates are in high demand and, with the recent focus on making our ITE and Polytechnic programmes world-class, there is an even stronger reason to ensure that our youth maximise their education beyond Secondary school and then keep them motivated in lifelong learning when they eventually join the workforce. There are more than 40 countries that provide free post-Secondary education. Some are world-class, notably Germany. World-class education is a competitive advantage in today's world and costs should not be an impediment for all Singaporeans to maximise their potential, be it in academic, technical or craftsmanship. The advantage of having free public education at tertiary level is that parents are not worried about the cost of education and their children inevitably receive maximum education based on their capability and potential.</p><p>I noted that education expenses already constitute a substantial portion of the annual Budget. After speaking at length about managing expenses, I am not about to suggest that we make tertiary education free without more careful study on the impact on our finances and our tax system. But we should view education as an investment, not cost, and, like all investments, its viability will depend on the future value it generates. I think it is worthwhile to think about as we look to future generations to sustain our ageing population.</p><p>We can perhaps start with a targeted approach to provide free post-Secondary education for sectors with acute manpower shortage, like childcare and healthcare. Might this not nudge a parent or a student to consider a career in these sectors? I hope that this is something the Government can look into as we not only improve the quality of our workforce but also take away a major cost pressure from parents. In the meantime, we should make post-Secondary education, be it ITE, Polytechnic or University highly affordable and accessible to all, so that no child is left behind and are sufficiently equipped when they join the workforce, no matter what their capabilities and potential.</p><p>Madam, in Malay, please.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150304/vernacular-4 Mar 2015 _ Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein _ Debate on Budget Statement (Malay).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>For many years after our Independence, the Singapore Government has focused on economic growth. Today, we are one of the most developed countries in the region and, indeed, the world, with one of the highest GDP per capita. However, economic growth comes at a cost. Prices of property have gone up, prices of transport, food and goods and services in general have all gone up. It has become more and more challenging for Singaporeans to cope with day-to-day expenses. Additionally, jobs have evolved and, today, it is difficult to secure a good job without a good education and relevant skills.</p><p>According to a survey conducted by REACH, Singaporeans are still concerned with retirement adequacy, healthcare costs and cost of living. In the last few years, the Government has done much to alleviate these concerns. The Government has introduced MediShield Life last year to help Singaporeans cope with healthcare costs. In this year's Budget, the Government has introduced more measures, such as the SkillsFuture Credit which gives Singaporeans funds to help them acquire new knowledge and skills. The Government has also enhanced the CPF scheme so that we have more funds for our retirement. For the lower-income elderly Singaporeans aged 65 and above, the Government will be introducing the Silver Support Scheme which will give out between $300 to $750 every three months. For working couples with young children, the Government has pledged to make available more affordable childcare.</p><p>These are, indeed, good measures which will benefit the community. However, concerns still remain, especially for those with young families to bring up. Will we still be able to afford a house? Will we have sufficient funds to take care of our children's education and growing up needs? I, therefore, hope that the Government will continue to ensure that prices for housing and cost of education remain highly affordable.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Madam, I would like to applaud the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance for this excellent and wide-ranging Budget. I hope the Government will continue to provide assistance to all Singaporeans to cope with cost of living, healthcare costs, education and retirement adequacy. I support the Budget.</p><h6>4.33 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Lim Swee Say)</strong>&nbsp;(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150304/vernacular-Lim Swee Say Budget 4 March 2015_Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>This year's Budget takes care of workers and all citizens, including children, students, working adults, working parents and retired senior citizens. It even helps middle-income families cope with various challenges in life.</p><p>More importantly, this Budget not only takes care of today, but also strengthens the foundation of our future.&nbsp;This is, indeed, a very good Budget. Many workers, union leaders and residents all welcomed this Budget. At the same time, they have also been asking, \"Will future Budgets be just as good or even better?\"&nbsp;Take, for example, when we introduced the Pioneer Generation Package last year, those who were below 65 years old asked, \"Will there be a package for the second generation of Pioneers?\"&nbsp;This year, we rolled out the Silver Support Scheme to take care of low-income senior citizens for life. Some people asked, \"Will this scheme be terminated halfway?\"&nbsp;This year, we also announced the SkillsFuture Credit Scheme at a cost of $1 billion, which will be topped up every few years. Will future governments have the means to sustain this scheme?&nbsp;</p><p>I can see that they are both relieved and worried at the same time.&nbsp;Relieved, because this Budget helps to lighten their burden in supporting their parents and children and even helps relieve their personal concerns.&nbsp;Worried, because they are afraid that future governments may not be able to provide a Budget that is equally good or even better. Then they will have to worry again.</p><p>I can tell them very honestly that no one can guarantee future Budgets will be just as good or even better. Every government of every country hopes to announce a good budget every year so that citizens can benefit. It is something they want to but are unable to.</p><p>We are different. We are able to deliver what we aim to do for our people. Why? The reason we can have such a good Budget is because, through the years, we have worked hard together, strived together and progressed together.</p><p>I still remember the 1960s. Back then, our economy was still lagging behind, there was no job security and unemployment was high, wages were low and working conditions were poor. But the tripartite partners and the entire nation worked together to modernise our economy, our companies and our workforce to achieve full employment.</p><p>I also remember in the 1990s, as China embarked on economic reforms, the entire Asia region prospered. This gave our economy an added boost, but also brought about greater pressure. During that time, we worked together to go global, explored new territories and created what we have today.</p><p>Likewise, looking ahead, if we want to have a good Budget to take better care of our people, we still need to work hard together, have the courage to take on new challenges and strive for new breakthroughs. We will continue to move forward, from \"Modernisation\", \"Globalisation\" to \"Futurisation\".</p><p>We want to achieve economic growth, with companies growing and careers making good progress, so that our economy, society and Singapore will have a better future.</p><p>It is not a given that we will have a good Budget every year. We have to work hard together for a better tomorrow.&nbsp;Together, let us strive for it!</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, Budget 2015 is a good Budget. Some questions raised: is it prudent; is social spending sustainable; and will it lead us to becoming a welfare state? This is the last time I am speaking in the Budget Debate in my capacity as NTUC Secretary-General. So, allow me to share the viewpoints of the Labour Movement and the tripartite partners, too.</p><p>In the unionised sector, there are 1,500 unionised companies and organisations. Last year, wage increases ranged from 0% to 13%. Bonus ranged from zero month to 8.3 months. Collective Agreement took between three meetings and more than 50 meetings before the union and the management could reach agreement. Why the difference across these companies? We live in a real world and the reality is that even though we, as union leaders, always try to do our best for our workers, how much we can secure for our workers depends on how well the business is doing, in terms of profitability, in terms of growth. It is always easier to secure more for workers when there is a growing pie and much tougher when we have to fight over a shrinking pie.</p><p>The same reality applies at the national level, too. Should we try to do more good for our people? Our hearts say \"Yes\" but our heads also remind us that we can only do more good for our people if we have more resources. And this can best come about if we can keep growing our economy and employment, too, so that we will not end up becoming a welfare state.</p><p>So, instead of having to balance future Budgets by cutting back on spending, we believe that it is better to balance future Budgets by growing our economy and revenue. To succeed, we have to keep progressing from one stage of development to the next. Along the way, we will be confronted with new \"bottlenecks\" and we have to find ways to break them. For a fisherman who cannot find enough fish to catch, fish is the \"bottleneck\", he will have to find a better place so that he can break this \"bottleneck\". When he has found the right place, when there are enough fish for him to catch, more than what he alone can catch, then labour has become the \"bottleneck\". He will employ more boats and more fishermen to help him to catch more fish.</p><p>Having caught more fish, but more than what his men can now process, then production capacity is now the new \"bottleneck\". So, he has to purchase machines and equipment to speed up the processing. And by the time he is able to produce more fish products with all these capital investments, more than what he can sell, then market has become the new \"bottleneck\". So, he has to invest in product development, process development and, most importantly, market development.</p><p>From this simple story, you can see that only by breaking new \"bottlenecks\" along every stage of development can a business continue to upgrade and grow. In this case, from a resource-intensive industry to a labour-intensive industry, to a technology-intensive industry and to, finally, a knowledge-intensive industry.</p><p>This, too, is what we have to do as an economy. We have to keep breaking new \"bottlenecks\" as we restructure our economy, as we move from one stage of development to the next. For illustration, I would just like to recall two defining moments in the past. In the 1960s, job was the \"bottleneck\", because we did not have enough jobs for our workers. Our response then was to embark on a journey of \"Modernisation\". So, the tripartite partners, instead of confrontation, we moved towards collaboration. As a result, we were able to secure full employment for our people and sustain it till today. I think it is an achievement that we all can be proud of. So, we succeeded through modernisation to break the \"bottleneck\" of jobs.</p><p>In the 1990s, it was a period of transformation for the Asia Pacific. To many multinational companies at that time, in their market segmentation \u2013 Asia Pacific was classified as part of the ROW. What does ROW stand for? \"Rest of the World\" means etcetera, etcetera. So, they paid a lot of attention to the North American market, to the European market, but Asia Pacific, together with the other under-developed markets, are called \"Rest of the World\".</p><p>However, in the 1990s, with the Opening of the China economy, together with Japan and others, including Singapore and ASEAN, we collectively retransformed Asia into what they called a BOW \u2013 \"Best of the World\", because companies realised that they could not continue to grow, they could not outperform their competitors if they were not able to capture this very important market of the Asia Pacific. So, they rebranded Asia Pacific from the \"Rest of the World\" to \"Best of the World.\"</p><p>They decided to move away from vertical division of labour towards horizontal division of labour. In other words, instead of looking at Asia Pacific as a low-cost production base, they decided to move in some of the high-quality jobs, including product development, process development, innovation development, into the Asia Pacific.</p><p>The rapid growth of Asia brought new opportunities to Singapore but, at the same time, new threats too, because we could have been leap-frogged by our competitors.</p><p>Our response at that time was to embark on a journey of globalisation. I still remember that at EDB, we talked about Inner Globalisation within Asia Pacific and Outer Globalisation beyond Asia Pacific.</p><p>However, as we competed for better quality jobs, we realised that our limited experience, our limited capabilities in advanced knowledge, R&amp;D, innovation and high-tech industry were our \"bottleneck\". So, what did we do? We embarked on a journey to nurture, support and upgrade our workforce, businesses and economy to where we are today. Because of our focus on globalisation, we were able to break the \"bottleneck\" in our skills and capability.</p><p>Today, we still have to keep running because the world keeps changing. After modernisation in the 1960s, globalisation in the 1990s, what is next? I tried very hard to look for a suitable word. I searched all dictionaries and I could not find one that I feel is suitable. I have no choice but to come up with my own. It is called \"Futurisation\", meaning a mindset of moving faster into the future. Do not wait for the future to come to us but we go to the future, ahead of our competition. Meaning a mindset of preparing ourselves better for the future, ahead of our competition.</p><p>In this journey of \"Futurisation\", we have to break not one, not two, but three \"bottlenecks\".</p><p>The first is the \"bottleneck\" of capacity for future growth. Without additional capacity in our economy, there will be no room for growth. We have been expanding our workforce but the pace has slowed. Manpower utilisation is near full capacity. Unemployment is low, our employment rate is high. For males, our employment rate is higher than all the OECD countries. For females, we are among the top 15. Our foreign manpower is now reaching the long-term target of about one-third versus two-thirds. So, in other words, there is now limited scope for us to grow our workforce. Growth will continue to slow down to 3%, to 2%, and even, eventually, 1%, between now and 2020, 2030.</p><p>What this means is that more of our growth in our future economic capacity will have to come from growth in labour productivity and innovation. We have heard this many times before and I have to say it one more time. If productivity growth remains low or even negative, we could end up with low growth or even economic stagnation due to this lack of capacity.</p><p>When that happens, wages will go down, unemployment will go up, re-employment will drop. There will be less or no Budget surplus. It will be harder to do more good for our people. I am sure we do not want this to happen and that is why we must find ways to break this economic capacity \"bottleneck\".</p><p>We are seeing encouraging progress in our strife for higher productivity. In fact, many Pioneers and early adopters are showing the way, including the SMEs. But they are the minority as of now and what we need to do is to continue to press on to widen our outreach, quicken the pace to bring on board the majority, the early majority, the late majority. We have to transform not just company-by-company but also sector-by-sector and make productivity a truly National Movement.</p><p>The second \"bottleneck\" we have to break is manpower optimisation. We have two-thirds local manpower, complemented by one-third foreign manpower. The challenge is how to ensure that two-thirds plus one-third will be more than one and not less than one. In other words, we must find ways to value every worker \u2013 all collars, all ages and all nationalities, too. Local workers and foreign workers.</p><p>I often hear employers telling us that it is not possible to transform every job to be attractive to Singaporean workers. So, it is not possible to attract Singaporean to take up every job. And my reply to them is always that we do not have to do that. There is no need for us to try to transform every job so that every job is attractive to Singaporean workers. All we need to do on the whole is to transform at least two-thirds of the jobs in Singapore to attract the two-thirds workforce who are the local workforce, because it is not our intention to drive away all foreign workers in Singapore. You see, there will always be the one-third in the workforce that comes from foreign manpower. Therefore, my point to them is that you have to apply your mind, do not try to work on every job, but if every one of us is able to redesign to transform two out of three jobs into better jobs that are more attractive to Singaporeans, then we are there.</p><p>SkillsFuture initiatives, such as Earn and Learn, are very much welcomed by the Labour Movement. Because we believe that through such programmes, it can help many new job entrants to move into new and promising industries and take on new careers without being hampered by their academic qualifications or the lack of working experience. In other words, if every employer values every worker and every worker values every job, then we can build a strong Singaporean Core and yet, at the same time, tap on the expertise and availability of foreign manpower in Singapore to help enlarge the Singapore economic pie. In this way, two-thirds plus one-third can be bigger than one, if we are able to break the \"bottleneck\" of manpower optimisation.</p><p>Last but not least, the \"bottleneck\" of mindset, the mindset of breaking away from the present and venture into the future. Again, many employers and companies would say that it is very hard to survive here. We ask them what they are going to do. Some would say, \"I want to keep moving to lower cost locations, lower wage locations, one after another.\"</p><p>It is like flying west in a plane, chasing after the sunset but never get to see the sunrise. Actually, this is possible. A photographer actually did that. He went onto the plane, keep flying west for 24 hours and he was able to capture this sunset around the world during the 24 hours, keep staying with the sunset. He did it because it is a very interesting project. But I do not think businesses will want to do that because if you keep going west, keep chasing after the sunset, keep going for lower cost locations, I think, eventually, you will end up with darkness.</p><p>Instead of flying west to keep up with the sunset, why not fly east? I think those of you who fly east before will know that the night is shorter and the sunrise will come sooner. And once the sunrise comes, we can stay in the sun for as long as we can, until it is time to move on to the next sunrise again.</p><p>This mindset of embracing the future is applicable to workers, businesses and the economy as a whole. We must not live with problems of today by chasing after the sunset. Instead, we must turn challenges of today into opportunities of tomorrow. Robotisation, 3D printing, uberisation, big data, Internet of Things, digitisation of services, O2O \u2013 Online to Offine, Offline to Online&nbsp;\u2013 all these are coming. In fact, some are already here. So, there is no place to hide.</p><p>With SkillsFuture, we hope that every one of us can put the SkillsFuture credit to good use. Some are worried that if we do not put the SkillsFuture credit to good use, then $1 billion is too much money to spend, too much money to risk. Some workers say, \"With $500, how much training can I really go for to really make a difference to up my future readiness?\" And we reminded them that SkillsFuture credit may be $500, but do not forget this is net of training subsidies. In fact, many training programmes in Singapore are subsidised by the Government up to 70% to 90%. Workers need to use the SkillsFuture credit only to pay for the net fees which are net of subsidies. At 70% subsidies, $500 can buy you training of more than $1,500 if my calculations are correct. With 90% subsidies and $500, you can go for $5,000 worth of training.</p><p>Therefore, my point in this is that, yes, it is a big investment that is more than just the $1 billion SkillsFuture Credit. What we have to do is to work together to make good use of this heavy investment. Let us help our workers learn hard skills, learn soft skills but, most importantly, help them to learn to be reskillable workers. Reskilling will not stop, because the future will not stop changing. Hopefully, if more workers can become reskillable workers, then more of them can become more employable in the future.</p><p>Likewise, business should really take full advantage of the Transitional Support package because we would like to see more companies re-engineering themselves, re-positioning themselves before the transition is over. Because this is only a Transitional Package.</p><p>In conclusion, Mdm Speaker, we live in a world full of challenges, some countries have to cope with challenges of failure, for example, uncompetitiveness, high unemployment, excess capacity in their economy. Our challenge in Singapore is of a different kind. Ours is not a challenge of failure, but a challenge of success. Not a problem with excess capacity but the challenge of keep growing, keep expanding while running at full capacity. I think it is better that we overcome challenges of success before they turn into challenges of failure.</p><p>We have succeeded before, from Modernisation to Globalisation. I believe we can make it again towards a better economy, a better workforce and better Budgets for many more years to come. Mdm Speaker, I support the Budget [<em>Applause</em>].</p><h6>4.57 pm</h6><p><strong>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, what prices a Budget? To me, the answer must be what it makes of a nation. I wish to direct my comments not at the fine details of Budget 2015 but at the strategic issues that it raises.</p><p>I will hazard a guess at what keeps the Finance Minister awake at night as he crafted the Budget. He might have had two dreams \u2013 the first about Singapore today and, the second, Singapore tomorrow; both of which can turn into nightmares if we do not get our fundamentals \u2013 our value system and, as Mr Lim Swee Say said, our mindset&nbsp;\u2013 right.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, in doing this, I rise to support the Budget statement with some important caveats so that Singapore remains a place where dreams can come true for many generations to come.</p><p>In his first dream, the Finance Minister knows of Singapore today where most people have a roof over their heads, jobs chasing them and food on the table when the economy is growing at a developed country rate of 2% to 3%.</p><p>He mitigates some gaps in socio-economic development via fiscal plugs, to ensure that everyone from the bottom up shares in Singapore's success. Even the sandwiched generation and the middle class are helped so that the working adults feel less of a pinch as they take care of their parents and kids.</p><p>What he knows is that with this judicious use of targeted redistributive measures to level up the bottom, as well as increased investment in broad-based human development through education and skills training, businesses in Singapore, too, should find workers who can add value, create value and will be worth a higher wage. This is important as the best form of welfare and enhanced social mobility is a good job and career for our citizens.</p><p>He knows, however, that this sweet dream can turn into a nightmare if he does not take care of the manpower and cost challenges that might come from a straitened labour market. So, he continues with the transition support packages, employment credit and does not raise foreign worker levies for now.</p><p>However, the biggest threat to his sweet dream is the demographic monster. Hence, he sets aside huge funds for the Silver Support Scheme, to enhance CPF savings, promote employment of seniors. Meanwhile, CPF LIFE and Medishield Life also provide social risk-pooling to cover basic retirement and healthcare needs respectively. It should be patently clear that as citizens and businesses put in their share, the Government multiplies it through such schemes \u2013 that there is a shared responsibility to safeguard our future.</p><p>All things being equal, Singapore should hum along in the next few years.</p><p>The real excitement, therefore, lies in the Finance Minister's second dream about what Singapore might be in the next decade and beyond. In fact, it is also a question of what Singapore could be and want to be.</p><p>In Singapore Tomorrow, the global technological revolution has not only changed the way we do things, but it has also changed the way we live, our relationship with each other and, of course, the role of the Government.</p><p>Today, the mobile phones have made landlines obsolete. A five-year-old car sharing service, Uber, is valued at a whopping S$55.5 billion. But this is only a start. For tomorrow, the sharing economy will be in full bloom. And the quantum leaps in infocomm and bio technology, and quickened financial velocity and human migration will mean that the world is in a constant flux of super-fast and super-connected change.</p><p>Just to spur a bit of imagination, let us imagine a world where computers are no longer a device that we carry around, but embedded into wearable technology and flexi screens, aviators and intelligent homes which share information seamlessly in augmented reality to help us make efficient decisions. Consumer medical devices perform diagnostics and monitoring and, when combined with information about our own personal genomes, people can take greater charge of managing their health and improving their life expectancy. Renewable energy could reach grid parity and food could be grown vertically in an urban landscape.</p><p>In this future world, borders are blurred, systems are complex and everyone is inter-connected. What will be needed is a system change and not just piecemeal catch-ups. State regulations will need to be redesigned to ensure there is no dysfunctional, unfair and unethical use of these technological innovations and systems.</p><p>This is perhaps the essence of the Finance Minister's dream and possible nightmare. Ironically, as society prospers, citizens expect more from the Government. Will this mindset erode our competitiveness and resilience? So, how will governments cope as citizen-customers demand more from them, 24/7? Or will Singaporeans be on the cutting edge of these changes and the Government more properly finds itself in the role of regulator and facilitator? What is our collective mindset that we have today in Singapore?</p><p>In a recent trip to Silicon Valley and San Francisco, I looked into the face of the future, thanks to a connected network which put together visits to 10 interesting companies that imbibed the power of a \"we can do\" collaborative mindset of the people who are building that future. When I went to visit the offices, it was clear to me that the offices were designed as places where the brightest gather, exchange ideas, innovate, collaborate but, most importantly, nurture the belief that the power to create the future is in their hands. Not the hands of the government, not the hands of someone else.</p><p>This is the opposite of a dependency or entitlement mindset; the opposite of a complaint and grumble culture that saps energy. Many purposeful and gungho people, Singaporeans included amongst them, are dreaming up disruptive innovations for the common good, some of which will, no doubt, become a commercial success.</p><p>To cite one example, I think of Scanadu, set up by a couple, Sam and Walter, in Palo Alto in 2011 to build up what until then was the fictional Star Trek tricorder&nbsp;\u2013 a multi-function hand-held device used for medical sensor scanning, data analysis and data recording. They did this because when their five-year-old son tragically fell 40 feet and lapsed into a coma, they learned that none of their son's various health data could be consolidated for collective analysis. Their company motto? \"We are the last generation to know so little about our health\". Scanadu crowdfunded US$2.25 million from 8,800 backers in more than 100 countries through the website \"Indiegogo\". Then, they went on to raise $20 million in total, counting Yahoo's Jerry Yang amongst its funders. I was told that there was a Singapore company that also funded them. They shipped their first consumer medical device just last month. When I tested it when I was there, it measured all my vital signs in less than 10 seconds, just by putting it to my temple. Very simple. If successful, cumbersome hospital lab tests and long waiting times will be a thing of the past. Obviously, jobs may be lost, new ones will be created, well-being will improve.</p><p>Another example, I spent time with my good friend, Ms Tan Le, who is a star in the National Geographic brain games series. Her company, Emotiv, uses big data analytics to transform the way the functioning of the brain is studied so that even the physically disabled can now move things just with their brain power. What is even more fascinating is her own life story, her journey.</p><p>Tan Le was a Vietnamese refugee taken into Australia at the age of five. Her mum and granny taught her to be independent and take responsibility for her own life. She was a little bit traumatised by the deaths that she saw as she made that journey, but she steeled her mind to survive for a better tomorrow. She graduated with a law and commerce degree and went on to become a serial entrepreneur. Before long, she was named Young Australian of the Year, made it to Fast Company's Most Influential Women in Technology in 2010, Forbes' 50 names you should know in 2011 and earned a place in the \"Hope\" section of the Eternity Exhibition of the National Museum of Australia. How did a poor refugee girl achieve all these and all under the age of 40? Tan Le says, \"It's all in the mind\". What we think, we become.</p><p>Looking at how she has transformed her destiny so successfully and across so many different fields, it is clear that the best adaptive system is based on the adaptability of people. It is all in the mind.</p><p>These examples made clear that the killer app to survive and thrive in the fast-changing future is not found in a \"thing\", it is not found in \"money\", it is not found in Government schemes, but in people with the right mindset.</p><p>Closer to home, we celebrate our Jubilee year with pride and gusto. This is a dream come true for our Pioneer Generation. Let us recall our heritage: 50 years ago, Singapore was rejected by the Federation of Malaysia and we lost our economic hinterland. The British pulled out and more than 25% of jobs vanished overnight, the better tomorrow which immigrants sailed to Singapore for, disappeared.</p><p>As we celebrate SG50, I spent time chatting and interviewing a number of Pioneer Generation members (PGs), one by one. I asked them about why they chose to stay in Singapore 50 years ago, what they did to survive and how they thought about their future then, because it must have been quite bleak. Their answers varied slightly, but some patterns emerged quickly. Some chose to stay in Singapore because they had nowhere to go, some because it would have been a loss of face to return empty-handed and others stayed quite simply because they felt settled here already. But once settled, they all steeled their minds to survive and prosper.</p><p>Many took on two or three jobs, focused on a desire to own a roof over their heads, get their kids to schools and have the next generation do better than themselves. Each one of them took, what Member Chia Yong Yong said, personal responsibility to provide for themselves and their families. Collectively, they harboured hopes for a better future for their children and their&nbsp;kampungs.</p><p>We prospered because of their sense of hope, hard work and perseverance. We must have the same mindset that built Singapore we know today in order to build a Singapore tomorrow.</p><p>In the Finance Minister's Jubilee Year Budget, future-readying our people takes centre stage, and rightfully so. The enhanced support for innovation and internationalisation for Singapore enterprises to create jobs and maintain competitiveness and the enhanced school subsidies and lifelong learning and SkillsFuture schemes are introduced to ensure there is social mobility for all.</p><p>But has the Budget gone far enough to boost our mental toughness? I think not. Perhaps, the SkillsFuture initiative could be renamed \"Our Future initiative\", allowing the funds to be used for accredited courses that strengthen skills, mental toughness and offer that sense of purpose that will allow us to survive in any condition.</p><p>This transforming of our mindset has to undergird the big bang measures of our Jubilee Year Budget. It will make all the difference between whether these are seen as hand-outs for which there can never be enough, or a hand-up to those who already have a vision of a better tomorrow and take them as springboards to fulfil a dream, to turn an innovative idea into reality.</p><p>I read with dismay calls for more money, more help, more hand-outs because the Government owes it to them, because the rich owes it to them, because we have reserves and it is time to break the piggy bank and use them or what else could they be otherwise? How can that be? There is help. There should be help. But how much is enough?</p><p>It has been 70 years since the horrors of Auschwitz were uncovered. Let me cite the famous Dr Viktor Frankl, a Jewish psychologist and a prisoner-of-war in World War II. He observed that some prisoners thrived despite the dire conditions of the concentration camps and the inkling of what else might befall them. He observed that physique was no guarantee of survival but a strong, determined mindset made all the difference. I quote:</p><p>\"Any attempt to restore a man's inner strength in the camp had first to succeed in showing him some future goal.\"</p><p>\"He who has a \u2018why' to live for, can bear with almost any \u2018how'.\"</p><p>\"What we really needed was a fundamental change to our attitude towards life that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. Our answer must (be) in right direction and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the answer to its problems and to fulfil the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.\"</p><p>Please allow me to ask, do we know why we are here? Why do we work hard? Only when we know \"why\" can we recreate the pioneering, frontier mentality that gave meaning to education, skills training, lifelong learning, innovation and growth and, of course, a better tomorrow that our Pioneer Generations came for.</p><p>Let me recap. I hope the Finance Minister's Jubilee package of support this year is understood in a way which the DNA of our pioneers is being passed on \u2013 investments in a better future where Singaporeans are given resources to craft a brighter path ahead for themselves, their families, businesses and the country. Without that mindset, the package can only be a perilous path to a sense of entitlement, complacency and lead to unhappy outcomes.</p><p>The spirit of resilience, initiative, grit, adaptability, innovation and excellence must be what this Budget invests into. A better tomorrow is the why we are investing into. We celebrate this in every Silver Support recipient and we want to inculcate this in every SkillsFuture and Edusave account holder. It is the genetic imprint of the Pioneer Generation that we are embedding or reinforcing in them.</p><p>Let us navigate the sea of change with mastery of seafaring skills, guided by the light of the stars and not by passing fancy ships. Only then can we continue to be that extraordinary little red dot the world envies; only then will we know that the future generations will continue to be world-beaters and make their families proud. They will look back to our Golden Jubilee and say, \"Majullah Singapura!\"</p><h6>5.13 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr David Ong (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I applaud this year's Budget which is progressive, inclusive and will provide the cornerstone for building our future. Over the years, this PAP Government has consistently placed her people at the heart of its Budget. It has helped move Singapore forward tangibly, helping those with less, recognising the contribution of its people and enabling each generation to be better than the one before.</p><p>This Budget is also a response to our changing demographic and economic landscape and to calls made by the people and the Members of this House. For instance, the deferment of the foreign workers' levy recognises that the business sector is facing a tight labour situation. While the Finance Minister has stated firmly that we will not back-pedal on our endeavours to increase productivity and reduce our over-reliance on foreign workers, the pains faced by many business enterprises does not fall on deaf ears.</p><p>Over the past Budget debates, I have made calls on improving the employment and perception of our senior citizens, especially our mature workers. I have spoken on the removal of the retirement age, provision of fair re-employment conditions, restoration of employer's CPF contribution and tackling ageism at our workplaces.</p><p>Hence, I am very thankful that CPF rates will be increased for our older workers for this year and the next. This is, indeed, in the right direction in addressing the issue of retirement adequacy. People in their 50s and even 60s today can hardly be deemed \"old\". I \u2013 and I am sure many of you \u2013 have had the experience of working or interacting with these so-called \"young seniors\", who are no less productive, energetic, colourful and enthusiastic.</p><p>So, today, Mdm Speaker, may I be so bold as to again make another pitch for our mature workers? Many still want to be socially engaged in work, be it for active ageing or for sustenance. There is still a lot left in the tank even when they are in their 60s or 70s.</p><p>I cheered when Finance Minister took the \"final step\" to fully restore CPF contribution for workers aged 50 to 55. However, I winced a little when he mentioned \"final step\". I would like to nudge the Government to do more to further narrow the gulf in CPF contribution for those above 55 years old. Even after the increase of between 1% and 0.5%, older workers aged 55 to 60 still see a 11% gap, whilst those in the 60-65 age band see a wider variance of 20.5% when compared to their younger colleagues. Employer's CPF contribution, in particular, fell from 17% for those 55 and below, to just 9% for those in the 60 to 65 age group. Those above 65 years old should not be ignored, as the job participation rate for this group is set to expand in lieu of our fast-ageing population \u2013 perhaps, another category of 66-70 age band can be considered to enhance their CPF savings.</p><p>For many of our seniors, it is a double whammy as they not only see their wages and benefits reduced at re-employment, but also their employer's CPF contribution. While I cheer the increase in CPF contributions, I believe we can definitely do more, as many older Singaporeans do not have enough in their retirement funds.</p><p>I can empathise with the employers' anxieties about rising business costs and how an increase in employer's CPF contribution will make the employment of older workers more costly and, hence, affect their employability.</p><p>Whilst the Government does help to mitigate the cost pressure with schemes, such as Temporary Employment Credits and the enhanced Special Employment Credit for workers, it is time for us to embrace a mindset change in the way we value our seniors and mature workers. Ageism or age discrimination has no place in our first-world workplace.</p><p>During my interaction with residents, several seniors lamented that while they are still healthy and want to stay socially engaged through work after retirement, they encounter tremendous difficulties in finding another job. Even though they are fit, spirited and possess the right skills, they are sidelined when prospective employers learnt of their age. One resident who has been re-employed recently told me that not only is his pay reduced, his leave entitlement has also been cut. This is, indeed, disconcerting, given the tight employment situation in Singapore.</p><p>If our senior workers are doing the same work with the same amount of effort and time, they should be paid fairly \u2013 be it in wages, benefits or even employer's CPF contribution. We should not discriminate against older workers and make them out to be cheap labour in order that they can be hired or re-employed. Profitability cannot be at the expense of our older workers.</p><p>I echo Minister Lim Swee Say's call earlier that we must value every job and value every worker. I would like to add that we must also value every worker, regardless of age, gender and race.</p><p>I call on the Government to do more to shift mindsets in how we view and value older workers and how our seniors view themselves. Rather than seeing mature workers as liabilities, they should be viewed as assets with experience and loyalty to boot. Incentives should be given to help companies re-engineer their workplace and to make our mature workers more productive and for an age-friendly working environment.</p><p>Older workers can now tap on the SkillsFuture credits to take on a new skill or for self-improvement. I am glad that there is no expiry date as this reinforces lifelong learning regardless of age. The challenge lies in the outreach and engagement of our seniors so that they can gain easy access to such courses. SkillsFuture would go a long way in boosting the strength of our workforce, but would end up as a white-elephant if the majority of our citizenry are not aware of the courses, or find it difficult to access them. Some may not utilise the credits due to a lack of time or are not motivated to invest in themselves. For SMEs and those not in the workforce, perhaps the Government may assume the national human resource role to mobilise and develop its people.</p><p>Hot on the heels of a generous Pioneer Generation Package comes the permanent Silver Support Scheme. The Silver Support Scheme will help lift a huge burden off the backs of our elderly Singaporeans. For a long time, many of those struggling with little or no savings in their banks or CPF accounts, now have another long-term scheme to help with their daily needs. This can be a crucial missing piece of the social safety net for our elderly retirees. It is a nice gesture to break away from the usual conservative approach and provide those who have little in their senior years with a lifetime pension-like allowance for this group of elderly Singaporeans, including home makers who have not worked for the most part of their lives.</p><p>I would like to urge the Ministry to consider a couple of suggestions. Can the Silver Support Scheme payout be made more flexible, given that financially-strapped seniors will have a need for more cash-in-hand to help them cope with their monthly expenses?</p><p>I understand that the scheme will take some time to implement and, thus, provisions and qualification criteria for the Silver Support Scheme are thin on details. I hope this scheme may not be cumbersome to the people who need it and that those who need it are not denied. We have done well in communicating the Pioneer Generation Package to our Pioneers. Let us draw on our past learning so that qualification for the scheme is made seamless and payouts are made in a timely and efficient manner.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I would like to caution on using household data as proxy in deciding qualifications to Government schemes, such as Silver Support and the GST Vouchers. I refer, in particular, to the Annual Value (AV) of their residence. Take, for instance, a residential unit in a private condominium may have breached the AV of $21,000 but have three generations staying under one roof. On paper, they are well-off and, thus, do not qualify for any of the social schemes but are, in fact, struggling. The elderly folks who live with their children have no property to their names and are near barren in retirement savings and receive little or no allowance from their children.</p><p>Hence, family structure needs to be considered, as families with more young and elderly dependants would need more help than a smaller family. If they have sick elderly or special needs members, they would face even more challenges. These are families with mitigating circumstances that need help but are denied by the determining qualifying criteria.</p><p>The Silver Support Scheme represents strong family values of care and support. It will go against the spirit and intent of this meaningful scheme if children take a step back, reduce or stop their support for their elderly parents because, now, they can have help from the Silver Support Scheme.</p><p>Budget 2015 saw an $11 billion rise in expenditure compared with the previous year and will set to increase in the medium and long term. As we have heard from the Budget debate thus far, several ideas were thrown up and the gaps identified by Members of this House. These require more Government spending. With future pressure to impute inflation into these schemes, the Government will need to draw on more revenue to sustain them.</p><p>We are in a fortunate position to tap on the Net Investment Returns Framework to help balance our Budgets, but we cannot take it for granted that these returns will be constant and bottomless. Singapore should never be in a position, like some of the oil-producing countries today, who had committed huge long-term social spending and subsidies when life was good and oil prices were high. The relentless collapse in oil prices over the past several months have shocked many economies, such as Russia, whose national budget revenue depended heavily on the energy sector. Hard choices and drastic economic measures will have to be undertaken to prevent the state deficit from running out of control.</p><p>Madam, the smallness of Singapore is an oft-repeated fact. While the strength of the Singapore dollar had grown in the last few years, the minuteness of our economy in the ocean of the global economy is not an exaggerated fact.</p><p>While it is important to work out the domestic concerns and introduce measures to uplift our citizens and improve our living conditions, we must always cast an eye out internationally, to make sure the shifting fortunes do not eventually affect us. We must remain prudent, spend in a sustainable way and continue to strengthen our future revenues. With this, I support the Budget.</p><h6>5.24 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Moulmein-Kallang)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, Singapore faces critical social and economic challenges as we embark on the next 50 years of our existence. These challenges, amongst others, include: (a) an ageing Population with seniors who may not have sufficient to retire in dignity; (b) a worrying declining or, at best, flat performance in productivity of local firms and workforces, pressured by increasing global competition; and (c) a deepening income gap between Singaporeans who are highly skilled, globally mobile and those who are less skilled and at risk of being chronic low-wage earners.</p><p>If unaddressed, all three challenges reduce the sustainability of our economy and our jobs; potentially causing conflicts, disunity and instability in our society, crippling our long-term survival.</p><p>I would like to first talk about changes before Budget 2015. I applaud the Government for having taken various strategic steps to address these social and economic challenges, even before Budget 2015 was announced.</p><p>The seniors of our country were granted Pioneer Generation status and special benefits. Special employment benefits were also introduced to help employers hire seniors. MediShield Life was introduced to ensure that all Singaporeans are insured for basic healthcare for life, regardless of pre-existing conditions.</p><p>For the business sector, more than any other governments elsewhere, the Singapore Government has put up a slew of measures to assist local SMEs to innovate, grow and expand.</p><p>Madam, Budget 2015 introduced more than 30 measures to strengthen the social security and build the future of Singapore. Besides deploying the familiar bag of transfer tools, such as the GST, the SC&amp;C and income tax rebates, Budget 2015 introduced three strategic and significant measures.</p><p>The first is the introduction of the new income supplement, the Silver Support, for elderly Singaporeans who had not accumulated adequate resources to retire upon.</p><p>The second is the increase of the top marginal tax rate for the top five percentile of income earners. The increase makes for a more progressive tax system to mitigate income inequality and allows for those with higher ability to pay higher taxes. This is a pleasant surprise from the resistance I faced when I proposed two years ago a higher \"Do-Good\" tax for top earners in our country to help pay for higher costs in social spending.</p><p>The third significant item in this Budget is the annual $1 billion SkillsFuture investment to empower every Singaporean to learn and develop throughout life and to deepen their skills for future work. It is this big-ticket item that I wish to caution the Government about.</p><p>Madam, having owned a training and consulting business before, I learnt one important feature about training. That is, unless training is properly designed, delivered and assessed, it will not lead to either learning, application, impact on one's performance or business outcome.</p><p>To ensure that SkillsFuture achieves its goals of deepening skills and cultivating the habit of lifelong learning for all Singaporeans, I propose we take a deeper look at the Why, What, Who and How aspects of this important scheme.</p><p>First, on why SkillsFuture is important.&nbsp;SkillsFuture is about the next phase of investment in the people of Singapore. It aims to help Singaporeans learn lifelong at every age and develop expertise in every field, creating many pathways of success. It is both about taking on better jobs and lifelong security and also about maximising one's potential in life.</p><p>Madam, although lifelong learning and developing deep skills should ultimately lead to better jobs and security, there is a risk of overly linking training to promotions and higher salaries. Cynics have already started to ask, \"What's in it for me in this SkillsFuture?\" and question if it is not a boost to the adult training industry or, worse, a chance to use public funds to develop one's hobby.</p><p>It is important not to overly promise immediate promotions and job salary increases so long as one completes a training. In fact, it is plausible that a number of us may not even get to keep our current jobs if we do not seek to constantly learn and improve.</p><p>So, my suggestion is this. As we invest the yearly $1 billion into SkillsFuture, we need also to invest in more aggressive communication to Singaporeans about Why the need to learn, to self-drive one's learning and the opportunities that lifelong learning brings and the risks if we do not.</p><p>Second, on what SkillsFuture should cover, that is, content.&nbsp;To foster deep skills and innovation, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman has announced the focus on the five growth clusters of Advanced Manufacturing, Applied Health Sciences, Urban Solutions, Logistics and Aerospace and Financial Services.</p><p>While I appreciate that we cannot achieve expertise and advanced capabilities in every area in the economy, I believe it is important to develop a robust SkillsFuture framework that also includes basic core competencies relevant to the 21st century and not only the more advanced capabilities favoured by the state.</p><p>Beyond simple digital literacy, the SkillsFuture framework should identify core 21st century competencies, such as building one's online presence, online marketing, online shops and digital videos and e-books for training one's staff in both mundane and higher order duties.</p><p>This will ensure a more inclusive outreach so that those who are not in the identified growth clusters would have access to strong foundational skills and be more future-ready, no matter what industry they belong.</p><p>Regular audits should also be conducted to ensure that content stays relevant and we must be robust and open enough to arrest future trends. Beware of what innovation guru, Dr Clayton Christensen, called \"disruptive innovations or technologies\" which can easily displace existing products or services and creating new values instead of merely adding value to existing markets.</p><p>Third, on who should be involved in SkillsFuture.&nbsp;First, on trainers. Madam, business owners in the SkillsFuture Council, to which I also belong, such as Mr George Quek of BreadTalk, have lamented how some of these past human resource development efforts in their companies yielded little impact because of incompetent trainers. And I agree with his observation.</p><p>Just as schools qualify and assess school educators, some form of standards \u2013 not too onerous \u2013 must apply to ensure the quality of those involved in SkillsFuture training.</p><p>The saying that \"those who cannot do, end up training\" is not without cause. Good trainers are hard to come by. However, the gems who have both actual work experience and the ability to train and coach effectively must be identified, recognised and deployed in each targeted industry. I, hence, support the creation of a Masterclass Trainer category and some form of recognition scheme for quality trainers in SkillsFuture.</p><p>Next, on trainees, business owners and leaders. On the same question of who, Madam, I would like to reflect the inputs that SkillsFuture should not be only for those in the worker or executive classes. It is not uncommon to hear trainees lamenting that it is their bosses who themselves need to attend trainings as well.</p><p>It is not uncommon to hear of business owners, leaders and managers who, by virtue of their positions, expect other people to take on lifelong learning but never think that the need to learn applies to themselves. Sure, they may have different learning needs and styles but, still, it is critical that those who lead or manage others must themselves lead by example and embark on lifelong learning themselves.</p><p>Special needs workforce. Still on trainees, Madam, I wish to also speak up for those who typically will need more attention and support in the workforce.&nbsp;In an increasingly tight labour market, every person who can work is an asset, part-time or full-time. There is merit in giving a boost to the non-traditional local workforce and, especially those who will need additional help, such as the elderly and those with special needs.</p><p>More must be done for the special needs adult learners by WDA, xCalibre and other related agencies, in the same progressive way that MOE has catered and funded students with special needs. Many people with special needs can work, if the proper needs assessment, training and support are provided.</p><p>I urge the state to visibly step up its resources to organisations, such as WDA, xCalibre, SG-Enable, and to employers who hire this special workforce. Members of the special needs workforce deserve to be in the main chapters of SkillsFuture \u2013 they should not appear only in the footnotes or, worse still, be left out of the SkillsFuture masterplan.</p><p>Fourth, on how effective learning and training are conducted. Madam, learning in the 21st century takes place in both physical and virtual learning spaces. Learning can be individual or in a classroom or community, it can happen face-to-face or real time at home, remote or at the workplace.</p><p>For too long, we see classrooms of teacher-controlled learning where information is presented to cohorts of students, without regard for their learning styles, pace and level of knowledge. These hallmarks of old pedagogies should not remain hallmarks in SkillsFuture.</p><p>In addition, research suggests that the training resources that yield the highest effectiveness are not the training event. It is the analysis and design that are conducted pre-training and the reinforcement that occurs after the training event that produce the higher level of results. Hence, as SkillsFuture rolls out its plans, it should seriously look at the entire training design process.</p><p>I ask that special attention be placed to ensure that the pedagogy behind SkillsFuture trainings be constantly updated to align with the 21st century and the future of work and that resources be allocated to the pre- and post-training design, not solely on the training event.</p><p>Finally, on local enterprises.&nbsp;On SMEs of our country, the Government has a vision to grow 1,000 SMEs of $1,000 million turnover each by year 2020, contributing a worth of $100 billion.</p><p>As I commented at the beginning of my speech, this Government has tried, more than any other government I know, to grow local businesses inside and outside Singapore with a slew of incentives, including setting up of regional SME centres and consultants and so forth.</p><p>I hope that more incentives will be granted for larger successful local enterprises to buddy, mentor or even start industry-based training academies in the likes of the American Motorola University, MacDonald University and Disney University.</p><p>Despite the many efforts, things do not seem to have improved as much as desired in this sector. We hear from businessmen, such as Members Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Thomas Chua, Chairman of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who lamented yesterday the low utilisation of the SME schemes that the Government has provided and called for breakthroughs to address the ground challenges of many SMEs.</p><p>Up till today, I still hear of unfair tenancy agreements where institutional landlords charge, beyond a base rental, additional rental of up to as high as 30% of the top-line revenue of retail shops/retailers, without the landlords themselves committing to bring in higher shopper traffic through better tenant mix or marketing support.</p><p>Madam, I support the principle of self-reliance and pro-activity, especially when it comes to business. But I believe that there are significant ground issues in this sector that call for more dedicated resources to study and look into.</p><p>Dedicated Minister and Team. In this regard, I would like to propose the appointment of a dedicated Minister and supporting team with the relevant track record in businesses to concentrate on this sector. A comprehensive deep review of the state of the SME sector should be conducted and recommendations made on what should start, what should stop and what should continue in order to achieve the Government's vision for this sector. Much like the Municipal Service Office (MSO), which is carved out as a separately resourced strategic unit.</p><p>Next, on Small and Micro Businesses. Finally, Madam, I wish to lend a voice to the many small and micro businesses of Singapore. Many of them employ less than 10 headcounts. They could be start-ups or old brands. Mr Kurt Wee, the CEO of Association of the Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME), told me that there are some 150,000 small and micro enterprises. He calls them the last cushion of employers to provide jobs at this level.</p><p>Although there is a school of thought that size matters in business and that small enterprises without scale should exit through natural attrition, I urge that we do not write off these small enterprises too soon. These outfits reflect a spirit of entrepreneurship, tenacity and energy we may not want to quench in our country. Not especially when the Government is advocating many pathways of success here.</p><p>I think of Adrenalin, a high-energy event management company led by a group of very diligent, enthusiastic young people; Butter Studio, known for its preservative-free cupcakes; Amino Bar, a one-stop protein drinks shop that specialises in protein drinks, fresh juices and supplements; and DIY Laundry, a coin-operated laundromat in the Whampoa heartlands. I think of the numerous neighbourhood flower shops, car mechanic workshops, hairdressing and beauty salons.</p><p>The owner-operators of these micro enterprises did not take the typical path of perhaps even finishing a degree and then working as employees. But I am very impressed by their enthusiasm and energy. Enterprises like these are not without challenges. They face manpower and cost issues, such as rental, like their larger peers, and they may not yet have the capacity or capability to improve their business model and build for their future. But there is a level of energy, enthusiasm and tenacity about these micro enterprises I observe that prompts me to ask if there is something we can do to nurture them further and not put out that spark too soon.</p><p>Granted, not all of these micro enterprises will or should succeed, but I urge the relevant Ministries to look deeper into how these small enterprises can be grown and scaled, if appropriate. Size and scale matter in business I know, but not always, especially if they are masters in their class, boutique in nature or serve a specific geographic niche.</p><p>Who knows if there will be some amongst them who will thrive and become a miracle or improbable success, as termed by ex-Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, like our very own small and beloved country, Singapore?</p><p>Madam, I hope more will be done on SkillsFuture and also for the SMEs and, especially, micro-enterprises of our country.</p><p>On that note, Madam, I thank the team which has put together such an excellent visionary Budget. I know that, whether we are going right or left, as long as we are all going forward and not backwards, it will be good for our country. I strongly support the Budget.</p><h6>5.41 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member)</strong>: Madam, thank you for the chance to participate in this debate. I also thank the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance for a Budget that, I think, takes really significant steps towards growing Singapore's desire for innovation, learning and compassion.</p><p>Our choice to embark on a more progressive tax system, like our decision to embark on universal health insurance, I know would have been fought to the death elsewhere, so I am really grateful for how peaceably we have gone about this. These are fitting decisions to make in our Jubilee Year. So, no matter what our political differences are and no matter how stupidly difficult it is to balance competing demands of limited resources, I hope we will always see Members of this House helping and not hindering each other in the common goal of making sure that, every year, we see fewer and fewer people getting left behind in this city.</p><p>I thought about what unique value I could add to the debate happening today and I figured since I am the second youngest Member of this House, I shall speak for the youth and with some informality so that they will understand.</p><p>Not many Singaporean youths will pay attention to Budget 2015 because, frankly, it is very boring stuff to them. But if I was in my classroom right now, I would tell them, \"Wake up and pay attention because this is actually more important than your examinations. Your city will grow according to where the money flows. Understand the Budget and you will understand more about the Singapore to come and your place in it.\"</p><p>Our country spent the first 50 years of our history getting rich and I would love to see us spend the next 50 years learning to become truly wealthy. I believe if the state commits itself wholeheartedly to encouraging innovation, promoting inclusivity and empowering identity, we would be on the right track to creating the kind of Singapore many of our young people would buy into \u2013 a Singapore that balances both material and immaterial needs. Budget 2015 already touches on innovation and inclusivity, not so much identity. I will just raise some concerns and suggestions with three themes.</p><p>First, encouraging innovation. The Government has long recognised how crucial it is to invest in innovation and has always followed through with a slew of policies and generous outpouring of resources every year to promote it in our schools and organisations. I think the tough question to ask ourselves is: so, what is still stopping this culture of innovation from taking root?</p><p>Please let me read an excerpt from a recent&nbsp;Fast Company&nbsp;article by cognitive scientist Prof Art Markman that explains it better than I can. He is quite blunt but he is insightful. I quote:</p><p>\"It is easy to make pronouncements about directions and vision. For people to trust what you say, though, it is important to recognise that you communicate in three ways: through what you say, what you do and what you reward. And each form of communication on this list is more important than the last.\"</p><p>\"As an example, consider what happens in many companies around innovation. Innovation has become such a tired buzzword that every organisation feels like it has to innovate to succeed. So, leaders from the C-suite on down will often talk about the importance of creating a culture of innovation in the workplace. However, the same leaders who preach the importance of innovation are often critical of new ideas. They react conservatively to new proposals. They rarely dole out resources for potential new projects. They stick to what has worked in the past. It may seem strange for leaders to downplay innovations, but that behaviour is often a result of the most important form of communication in an organisation: reward.\"</p><p>\"In many organisations, managers and executives are rewarded based on the performance of their business unit. Because many innovations fail or take a long time before they are profitable, it is almost always in the best interests of individual leaders to support incremental changes to existing products rather than to swing for the fences on a daring new initiative. When leadership does not reward innovation, then everyone in the organisation quickly realises that spending time pursuing innovations is not worthwhile. More importantly, situations like this undermine people's trust in every pronouncement by the company's leadership. Eventually, people may stop listening to what company leaders say altogether. That means that it is crucial to align the words you use with your actions and your rewards.\"</p><p>Madam, this sounds like very tough feedback for business leaders and I am a business leader and I flinched when I read this. But what he said about corporations is true for countries as well. If we say we want innovation in Singapore, then we must be courageous and consistent in rewarding it. So, practically, it may look like clearing bureaucratic red tape for the guy trying to pioneer food trucks as a new way forward for an F&amp;B industry crushed by rising rental or it may look like rewarding a diploma-holding civil servant with daring ideas more highly than a degree-holding civil servant who wants to just maintain the&nbsp;status quo.</p><p>Rewarding innovation is not easy and it is risky. Innovators sometimes look crazy and innovations do take a long time to bear fruit. But rewarding innovation makes all the difference in bolstering public confidence that we are serious about supporting innovation. It will always feel safe to reward according to old performance indicators and that is why we tend to stick to that formula. But if we continue rewarding mere performance, we will create what we hate and get exactly what we reward, which is a nation of performers who just know how to play the old game, rather than innovators who rewrite the rules and create their own game.</p><p>If we are hedging our bets on innovation as the key to securing Singapore's future, then let us re-examine and change what we measure and reward at the national level. Schools, for example, are still currently ranked and rewarded most significantly for academic performance over everything else. So, we should not be surprised if we still produce teachers, parents and young people who prize mastery of examination technique over mastery of life-skills.</p><p>We know one famous resultant effect of that. Over 10 years, one entire generation of young people was discouraged from studying English Literature because it was considered too challenging to teach and too unpredictable to ace. The humanities are notorious for having no perfect answers. So, schools did not encourage it because they were scared of risking their ranking. Parents did not encourage it because they were scared of risking their kids' perfect result slip that would place them in that perfect Junior College.</p><p>So, from 1992 to 2012, we saw an 80%-90% drop in students taking a subject that some Silicon Valley technology company CEOs are now saying is one of the most useful for training creative and thoughtful communicators that know how to navigate the ambiguity and complexity of 21st century business. Literature majors could just end up being the next great hire in the global market and we happen to be fresh out of them.</p><p>The good news is that for innovation to flourish, I do not think it is about pouring even more resources the way our schools and organisations do, although that would always be greatly appreciated. In fact, innovation sometimes thrives best in situations where there are insufficient resources. The difference is freedom. What puts people in the space of innovation is the emotion of freedom, not a destructive freedom that exists because we are indifferent, but a fruitful freedom that was given wholeheartedly in trust.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, what I am suggesting is that to jump-start a culture of innovation in Singapore, perhaps what we need to budget for are more freedoms rather than just more resources. What freedoms do our schools and SMEs really need to enjoy to become more innovative? That is the bigger question. For example, does the retail scene need freedom from REITs? Would that really help everything?</p><p>There are two wonderful opportunities for innovation that Budget 2015 opens up. One is in the decision to give every school a big sum of money to donate to an IPC of the student's choice. I would really hate to see all that money spent on projects that look great on the news but have negligible social impact. So, when schools plan in silo, too many of their Community Involvement Projects tend to go down the safe but ineffectual route of painting murals and picking litter by the beach. If schools could engage with civil society to explore what are the most impactful solutions that all that energy and money can be channelled towards, I think we could see a spark that encourages the next new social innovator to emerge.</p><p>SkillsFuture is potentially a big game-changer, in my opinion, to inject a spirit of innovation back into Singapore, if we let it be so. It could be a significant call of action for Singaporeans to unlearn the old learning habits and take their own education and future into their own hands. But SkillsFuture must not hamstring itself by only allowing us to spend our credit on a safe but limited range of pre-approved courses by pre-approved vendors representing only pre-approved industries. Outside of the WDA and MOE, there is a radical new world of learning out there, multiple platforms, crazy formats, unpredictable teachers, a diversity of skills that nobody can predict could be useful or not useful to a person's development. Who would have known that letting Steve Jobs study calligraphy in his 20s would give him the aesthetic sense that distinguished Apple from every other technology company in the world? A Singaporean would have said, \"Study calligraphy got money&nbsp;meh?\" and stopped him in his billion-dollar tracks.</p><p>So, please let us use SkillsFuture to learn whatever we want, however we want, wherever we want. Of course, put down rules like accountability and all that, but recognise that many of us were already forced to study one way in the education system, give us the freedom to study in our own way outside of it. Trust the people to decide and take a risk on us.</p><p>Next, promoting inclusivity. The Deputy Prime Minister emphasised that Budget 2015 is not based on a Robin Hood mentality that robs the rich to give to the poor, but a mentality of collective responsibility that leads to sustainable generosity. That is not a minor quibble but a key distinction I agree is important to make. The Robin Hooding is based on an exclusionary impulse that believes the rich are evil and unworthy and they deserve to be robbed for everyone else's sake.</p><p>And this sentiment, while it secretly pleases our middle-class hearts, really just promotes even more disdain among the classes. Collective responsibility is a far better impulse because it is inclusionary. It emphasises that we are all not only equally worthy of being cared for, but are equally worthy of being fellow contributors to the common good.</p><p>There is no value that speaks louder to this generation of young people than inclusivity. We all want to live in a Singapore that includes and embraces all. And, deep down, we all want a Singapore that is full of grace, that perceives every single person that shares this island as worthy and accords the same level of respect and dignity to the strong as well as the weak, because, if it were so, then it is a safe place for all of us to be. We all want to feel that no matter who I am and how far I have fallen, this country will always have my back. And that is why so many young people pay close attention to how the state talks to and treats its weakest and is so critical of any sign of inconsistency. They take it personally as a sign that, someday, that could be how the state will talk to and treat me.</p><p>So, it is important for us young Singaporeans to lay down our self-righteousness and admit that we all struggle with inconsistencies \u2013 it is not just the Government. We are all a work-in-progress in terms of living out what we value. Many of us who want inclusivity also find ourselves excluding. Some of us may speak compassionately about the poor and powerless but are filled with loathing for the rich and powerful. Some of us may fight lovingly for animals, but we talk hatefully about new migrants.</p><p>If we are honest, we would admit that we are all inconsistent. But if we are mature, we would also in the same breath say we are not satisfied with being inconsistent and we will always try to stay open to changing how we view the other and creating a place that welcomes them. Inclusivity begins in humility. The young are looking towards us adults in leadership to model what humility looks and sounds like. So, I hope all of us \u2013 the people and the state \u2013 will be honest, mature and humble enough to keep an open conversation going as we dialogue together about what it means to develop compassionate policies that include everybody \u2013 rich and poor, young and the old, strong and the weak, native and the foreigner, PAP and Opposition, the ones who got their act together, the ones who screw up. We are all worthy of being heard and being helped.</p><p>That is why the Silver Support Scheme is so welcomed in this year's Budget because to automatically include the needy elderly without needing them to go through the stigma of jumping through bureaucratic hoops, signals a new way forward for how we want in social support. Automatic inclusion is not something that those of us who are privileged think much about. But the truth is the more privileged we are, the more automatically included we are into the system and, thus, the more automatically decisions are made for our good.</p><p>For example, the middle class automatically gets their CPF Housing Grant when they purchase their flats. Paperwork is minimal. The working poor, on the other hand, if they want to get their Special and Additional CPF Housing Grants, they got to submit documents to prove they are working enough and poor enough. And making them go through all of that can be stigmatising.</p><p>Automatic inclusion, however, says to a recipient of welfare, \"I want to help you. I do not need you to keep proving to me again and again that you are worth helping. You are in a hard place and I will neither burden nor shame you any further.\" It treats the recipient as worthy and preserves their dignity. So, yes, I hope we can explore how to make even more social assistance benefits automatically inclusive.</p><p>This does not need to undermine Singapore's belief in a strong work ethic and personal responsibility as the best solution of poverty versus mere welfare. In fact, we can use automatic inclusion to reinforce the value of work, for instance, by having any low-wage worker who already qualifies for Workfare Income Supplement to be automatically included for whatever relevant public assistance scheme he would have already qualified for anyway.</p><p>There is one particular group in Singapore that I hope will be considered for automatic inclusion of some sort as well and, that is, the children of single mothers. Shortly after I was sworn in as a Nominated Member of Parliament, I became a mother. During the madness of caring for a baby, I felt very, very grateful for whoever fought for the extension of maternity leave from two months to four months. Serious props to you. And for a season, cash flow was tight in my own household. So, when I got notices in the mail about \"You got Baby Bonus, you got your first one-for-one savings top-up in your child's Child Development Account and there was subsidised infant care\", I was very, very grateful for every single one of these policies.</p><p>The news that this Budget provides even more care for a working married mother like me is great. But all this just makes me consider again and again how much more relief and gratitude a single working mother would feel if she could receive what I had received.</p><p>I admit I am unfamiliar with all the complexities behind the crafting of this policy, so forgive my ignorance, I would love an open conversation to know more about that. But what I am more familiar with is how the policy makes single mothers feel. Some feel that they are being told that they and their children are not worthy. Some feel that they are being unfairly punished for choosing to take the harder road of going through with the pregnancy rather than aborting the child when their partners chose to run out on them.</p><p>Some of us married mothers are friends with such single working mothers and we can testify to their work ethic, their refusal to make excuses and how devoted they are to raising their children well. We married mothers will look at such single mothers and just see women who have chosen to soldier alone in a very tough job meant for two and they need all the support they can get. And, moreover, the children of single mothers are Singapore's children, too. If we are a nation already struggling to replace ourselves, should we not welcome any new young life that has been given unto Singapore with equal honour? Should not all Singapore children be automatically included in the State's blessing?</p><p>Last, empowering identity. Singapore has never backed down from making dramatic investments in the tangible infrastructure of nation-building. When we see the impact it will make a decade or so down the road, we willingly pay the cost. And I like that spirit. I hope we can see an equally bold spirit \u2013 it does not need to be the same investment&nbsp;\u2013 but in our intangible infrastructure. Nations are not just built on airports, buildings and transport systems. They are also built upon the stories that we tell ourselves.</p><p>I will talk more in the COS debates about how we should invest in the creation of our local cultural goods and, in particular, protect our hawker cultural heritage. Music, fashion, graphic design, hawker food, film, brands, memories \u2013 these are not petty things at all to invest in. If we leave the fate of our local culture purely to market forces, we risk losing all the small stuff that binds and anchors us to a country when everything in the world is beckoning us to leave. Singapore must dare to invest in her own story and support her story-makers and story-tellers: the writers, artistes, creatives, film-makers, historians, all that.</p><p>A Budget debate, by nature, focuses on how to ensure everybody in our country is able to have money, make money and access their money. And rightfully so, because money lets us do really, really incredible things. But any discussion about money that leaves out meaning will have no currency. The thing about money is that we will never feel we have enough of it \u2013 not unless we become very clear about what is the meaning we wanted all that money to create for us in the first place. We cannot be so relentless in our pursuit of tangible success that we sacrifice all the intangible things that we really care about most.</p><p>Our Jubilee year Budget is a great time to take stock on a national level to discuss what Singaporeans find most meaningful to work towards. I believe, as we find our significance, the \"Why\" that Miss Penny Low referred to, more of us will find our satisfaction.</p><p>In conclusion, if Budget 2014's big win was about let us embrace the Pioneer Generation, I hope that the Budget this year and beyond is about embracing and jump-starting the Pioneering Generations that will come. Give us the freedom that allows innovation to happen. Help the needful among us to allow inclusivity to truly bloom. Support our creative efforts that ultimately solidify all our identity as Singaporeans.</p><p>Thank you, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, for a Budget that takes meaningful steps forward to a Singapore I want to believe in. I support it and I look forward to even more surprising moves in the future [<em>Applause</em>].</p><h6>5.59 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I welcome the initiatives outlined in Budget 2015 to support and invest in the development of Singaporeans, young and old, and also to help working-class Singaporeans save more for retirement.</p><p>It is also fundamental that the Government has recognised that beyond the safety net offered by the Public Assistance Scheme for the neediest in our society, there lies at the fringe a group of older Singaporeans who need help to make ends meet in retirement amidst rising costs of living.</p><p>The proposed Silver Support Scheme highlighted in the Budget is supposed to help address the issue of retirement adequacy for older Singaporeans who are asset-rich and cash-poor in retirement. The scheme, we are told, will become a permanent feature in our social security system.</p><p>The Minister has said that the scheme aims to support the bottom 20% of Singaporeans aged 65 years and above, with a smaller degree of support extended to cover up to 30% of seniors. Although these people will fall outside the public assistance schemes, the criteria to qualify for the Silver Support Scheme are no less stringent as the assistance offered under the scheme is meant to go to those with lesser means to subsist, especially for those who have retired with little or no savings and family support.</p><p>The three factors for older Singaporeans to qualify for the Silver Support Scheme are: their lifetime wages, the level of household support they have today and the type of housing they live in. Anyone who has undergone the thorough assessment and qualifies for the scheme will be deserving of assistance. The payout will be done quarterly, similar to the Workfare scheme.</p><p>Madam, a worker receiving quarterly Workfare payouts can still subsist monthly as long as he stays employed. Furthermore, Workfare payouts are contingent on a minimum period the worker must remain employed. So, a quarterly payout in this instance may not affect the worker adversely.</p><p>The proposed Silver Support Scheme has put in place clearly defined criteria which will point to only one conclusion if an elderly Singaporean qualifies for the scheme. And, that is, the person is truly in need of help. So, a monthly payout in this instance will be more appropriate. While the Government has stated that the aim of the Silver Support Scheme is to supplement incomes in a modest but meaningful way and not to substitute other sources of income, the fact of the matter is that any elderly Singaporean who fulfils the three criteria under the scheme will probably be living hand-to-mouth every month, with very little margin for life's unexpected turns and surprises.</p><p>A monthly supplement income will go some way to help these elderly Singaporeans pay their bills and lessen their money woes. I urge the Government to make the Silver Support payouts monthly rather than quarterly.</p><p>Next, I would like to talk about the CPF changes. With longer life expectancy, life no longer begins at 40. Some say life begins at 50 now. Although older unemployed workers are finding it increasingly difficult to get back into work at the same pay and position, our CPF policy should not lend weight to the stigma that older workers are supposed to be cheaper workers. Tweaking the CPF contribution rate to make older workers cheaper to hire does not prevent discrimination against these workers in their mid-40s and 50s. In fact, it does the opposite. It ingrains the notion that older workers are a liability rather than an asset to hire, so, there must be some trade-offs.</p><p>This is certainly not aiding the effort to eliminate ageism in hiring, especially in an ageing society like ours. The restoration of the CPF contribution rate for workers aged 50 to 55 is, therefore, a step in the right direction to restore the dignity of a mature workforce. While it may be a reality that older workers will get lesser salary due to a change of job scope, they should not be saving anything lesser in their CPF for retirement. For that, I support the extra 1% interest on the first $30,000 of CPF balances for workers aged 55 and above.</p><p>Madam, the ownership of our CPF savings is never in doubt. The monies in the CPF belong to each and every one of us, but this ownership assurance is cold comfort to people who cannot access their life savings due to moving targets caused by inflation, life expectancy and the intended pegging of the Draw Down Age to retirement age. There is certainly a need to provide an option for members to start their CPF Draw Down earlier. The labour force participation rate starts to come down from 80% for age group 50-54, to about 40% for age group 65-69, when the Draw Down Age for most CPF LIFE members will kick in. So, not all members will retire at age 62 or continue to work until age 65.</p><p>If a worker finds his re-employment terms after the statutory minimum retirement age not satisfactory, he will be in a fix because he will have no access to his CPF savings until three years later. I am of the opinion that the Draw Down Age for CPF LIFE must move in either direction of the statutory minimum retirement age, to cater for the uncertainties of life. We should let members decide whether the payout at a particular Draw Down Age of their choice is meaningful, because no one can foretell how this member will lead his/her life at that point in time.</p><p>Finally, I am heartened to know that the SkillsFuture Credit can be used for courses offered by our Institutes of Higher Learning. Moving forward, I urge MOE to institutionalise a Continuing Education Programme for all our Universities and Polytechnics. Such a programme should offer students of all ages an opportunity to upskill and engage in lifelong learning under the support of these established educational institutions with the course fees payable by the SkillsFuture Credit.</p><p>Continuing Education is a well-established feature of many universities and colleges in the United States. I believe we can learn a lot from their experience in this area. The classes are conducted online and on campus in the evening. An adult, regardless of age, can simply learn about any subject of interest or even earn college credits leading to a degree or professional certification over time.</p><p>Lifelong learning keeps the options open for our mature workers to find part-time work and other employment opportunities after their retirement. More importantly, it keeps their minds active.</p><p>In conclusion, Madam, there is no escaping the fact that we are an ageing society. Our Budgets over the years reflect the phenomenon as well. All the initiatives put forth by the Government to help older Singaporeans find good jobs will come to naught if we do not tackle the quiet, unstated discrimination, as what the Finance Minister has coined, against older workers in their mid-40s and 50s. We should, as a society, strive to change mindsets and battle ageism in hiring going forward.</p><h6>6.06 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, it is never easy to speak close to the end of a debate. You either think of something fresh to say, or you resign yourself to agreeing with the speakers before you.</p><p>So, let me begin by first echoing most of my hon colleagues in saying that I support this Budget and that there is certainly something for everyone&nbsp;\u2013 from workers to students to households and companies.</p><p>Before we look forward, perhaps it is also timely to look back at where Budget 2014 has taken us. I am heartened to see many of the Government's commitments to our people bearing fruit. The Pioneer Generation Package was a big initiative last year to look after those who have helped build Singapore into what it is today. Unemployment remains low, social infrastructure has increased and progress is being made in housing, healthcare and many other areas. So, we have a good foundation for Budget 2015. The fundamentals are right and the economic situation remains less challenging for now.</p><p>President George Bush was once quoted as saying: \"This is clearly a Budget. It has lots of numbers in it.\"</p><p>Indeed, there are a lot of numbers. Deputy Prime Minister Tharman has given out various&nbsp;ang pows, as mentioned in the press, to everyone in Budget 2015.</p><p>An inclusive Budget, something for everyone, a move to the left even, higher social spending: these are all by-words and oft-repeated phrases that have been bandied about since the Budget announcement. More importantly, perhaps, is that Budget 2015 builds on the foundation of Budgets in the last few years, as the Government recommits itself to a strong, resilient economy and a strong resilient people.</p><p>Our median wage has increased by 36% over the last decade and this has improved the lives of Singaporeans across all income levels. With this improvement comes a need to review current policies. I am, therefore, glad that the CPF salary ceiling has been raised to coincide with higher salaries. I also welcome the restoration of the contribution rates for older workers, something that my Labour colleagues have called for in the last few years.</p><p>As the Deputy Prime Minister has mentioned, our social security system consists of four main pillars, namely, home ownership, CPF, Healthcare and Workfare. This Budget features plans to enhance these four pillars and improve collective responsibility&nbsp;\u2013 the introduction of SkillsFuture, enhancements to Healthcare, changes to CPF, increases in social spending.</p><p>Much has been said of the various schemes. So, I shall focus my attention on just the Silver Support Scheme. To start with, we must make it clear that it is not intended to be a way to achieve \"equality in outcome\". The Silver Support Scheme will be an outstretched helping hand to those who face financial difficulties in their old age.</p><p>In principle, we should help those that need it most, but that brings another problem of identifying those who actually need it. Residents do occasionally come to me and fellow Members with appeals saying that they have no income and need help but are unable to get it because of various circumstances, including their housing type. It may be easy for us to tell them that the most logical thing to do would be to downgrade from their current house but, in reality, their flat is more than a flat. It is a home filled with memories and we want to encourage our seniors to age in place, in an environment that is comfortable and familiar to them. Other times, seniors come to us saying that the flat is their children's and although they are living together, they feel bad to ask them for money.</p><p>Although it is administratively expedient to judge eligibility by flat type, I hope the Ministries managing our social support schemes can exercise discretion and flexibility in appeals on special grounds and circumstances. That being said, the family is still an important pillar of social support that we should continue to enhance and encourage. Duty to take care of seniors should not fall solely on the shoulders of the Government, but is a collective responsibility. More importantly, our social support schemes need greater dignity for our beneficiaries \u2013 fewer hoops, more heart.</p><p>Madam, at the start of my speech, I mentioned that inclusivity comes at a cost. In his Budget Statement, the Deputy Prime Minister has set out plans to increase revenue sources. I caution; if we are going to turn left and go down this road of large social spending and investments on infrastructure, there may come a point where we are unable to turn back. It may be easy for us to promise now, while we still have the ability and avenues to increase revenue sources but, in the future, it will be hard to decrease spending. We are setting expectations that will only go up. Spending is justified, but can we sustain this kind of exponential spending for the long term?</p><p>Even as we strive to be inclusive, there will always be a cost. We have been prudent thus far in spending within our means, but I rue the day that, rather than saving for posterity, we begin to rob the trust funds and leave the dregs for future generations to pick up. Our inheritance was built up by a generation that knew and understood the value of saving for rainy days and doing away with the many trappings of luxury.</p><p>Mr Lee Kuan Yew pointed out as early as in 1984 that the Pioneer Generation provided \"a very firm, solid base for high endeavour; that generation has grown old, will continue to grow old and diminish in numbers. A younger generation has got to find its own goals, decide what it wants out of life in Singapore and what there is to put it in.\"</p><p>The memory of the hard times is disappearing rapidly. Perhaps, too, at times, people do point out that the gumption and tenacity that have brought us to where we are are also being traded for the easy path. Collective responsibility fades away through individual demands. The Budget, that annual exercise of prudent government, is suddenly being turned into an annual family gathering with the patriarch, hoping that, in his moment of generosity, he may decide to wink at you and hand you a big fat red packet. So, those who receive are happy, those who do not are decidedly unhappy that they were passed over this year.</p><p>The Budget is more than that; it is not a moment of portioning out the family fortune. The vast majority of the Budget looks at the critical services and the business of government, issues that will affect each and every one of us, even if it does not affect our bank accounts or wallets directly.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, some countries go over their Budgets very carefully every year, others just go over them. I hope that we remain in the first category for a long time to come and not fall into the slippery trap of populism. So, the idea of inclusivity must not be one where everyone eventually ends up being in equal misery, but one where consistency of ideas exists for the good of all Singaporeans.</p><p>To end off, the singer Beyonce had a hit song from 2006 called \"Irreplaceable\". I would not attempt to sing it \u2013 I do not have her voice \u2013 but I will paraphrase its opening hook. It reads, \"To the left, to the left, everything you own in a box to the left.\"</p><p>Social spending signifies our commitment to improving the lives of Singaporeans, especially those who are in need. But we must guard ourselves against any irresponsible shift too far to the left which will find ourselves out-of-pocket, out of Budget, out of home, with everything we ever owned left out the door in a box to the left.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, this is a good Budget, a Budget that tries to find that fine balance of pragmatism without stepping into populism. Notwithstanding the concerns I have raised, I support this Budget fully.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Adjournment of Debate", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OS", "content": "<p><strong>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Mdm Speaker, may I seek your consent to move, \"That the debate be now adjourned\"?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>: I give my consent.</p><p>[(proc text) Resolved, \"That the debate be now adjourned.\" \u2013 [Mr Tharman Shamugaratnam].&nbsp;&nbsp;(proc text)]</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Resumption of debate, what day?</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Tomorrow, Madam.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">So be it.</span></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Adjournment", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OS", "content": "<p>[(proc text) Resolved, \"That Parliament do now adjourn.\"&nbsp;\u2013 [Dr Ng Eng Hen].

Of these gardens, 81 are in private estates. They utilise mainly the roadside green verges, converting them into linear gardens. NParks has been encouraging the setting up of more CIB gardens in private estates by providing spaces, information, training and networking opportunities.</p><p>In terms of space, NParks prepares roadside planting verges with suitable soil. This facilitates the start-up of community garden groups within private estates.</p><p>For Neighbourhood Committees (NCs) which have larger community gardening interest groups requesting to start gardens, NParks provides community garden spaces in our Community Parks. This has enabled these CIB gardeners to grow a wider range of ornamental plants, vegetables and herbs. Currently, there are more than 20 community gardens started by NCs, located within our Community Parks.</p><p>NParks also offers horticulture information, training, workshops and networking sessions for community gardeners to build their capability to grow and sustain their gardens. For example, NParks offers horticulture advice, such as garden design and plant selection, for interested residents who are keen to start roadside community gardens. NParks also invites successful private estate CIB groups to share their experiences with other private estate residents that want to start CIB gardens, at platforms, such as the quarterly Gardener's Day Out event held in Hortpark. In addition, NParks provides free access to more than 40 online gardening resources.</p><p>To further encourage more CIB projects, NParks introduced the CIB Indoor initiative in August 2014 as an extension to the CIB programme, providing options to garden with family, friends and neighbours indoors. Through this extension, NParks provides technical advice to those who are keen to beautify and enhance the interior scapes of shared common spaces with greenery.</p><p>When garden design competitions like Gardeners' Cup are staged during the biennial Singapore Garden Festival (SGF), private estate CIB groups are teamed up with CIB groups from other sectors \u2013 public estates, schools and companies \u2013 so that there are opportunities for cross learning and the formation of self-help networks.
