2014-03-06-T-001,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee,"asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) whether the existing water agreement signed between Malaysia and Singapore allows for Malaysia to raise the price of raw water sold to Singapore at any time before its expiry in 2061; (b) if not, what is the reason for the Johor state government to make this proposal now; and (c) how will bilateral relations between Singapore and Malaysia be impacted if Singapore rejects the proposal for a price increase.",1,1,2014-03-06-T-001-S-00001
2014-03-06-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mdm Speaker, Ms Ellen Lee has asked whether Malaysia had the right to review the price of raw water sold to Singapore. We have stated our position on this issue and also conveyed it officially to the government of Malaysia on several occasions.",1,2,2014-03-06-T-001-S-00002
2014-03-06-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"As I had mentioned in my COS speech yesterday, neither Malaysia nor Singapore can unilaterally change the price of raw water sold to Singapore. Indeed, neither party can unilaterally change any of the terms of the 1962 Water Agreement. This is no ordinary agreement. It was guaranteed by both governments in the Separation Agreement in 1965, which was registered with the United Nations. Both countries have to honour the Water Agreement and the guarantee in the Separation Agreement. Any breach of the Water Agreement would also be a breach of the Separation Agreement and of international law.",2,3,2014-03-06-T-001-S-00003
2014-03-06-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Singapore's position is that Malaysia has lost its right to review the water price. The Water Agreement provided for the review after 25 years. Specifically, there was a right to review the price jointly in 1987. However, Malaysia consciously chose not to review the price.",3,4,2014-03-06-T-001-S-00004
2014-03-06-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"It had good reasons for this. Malaysia benefits greatly from the current pricing arrangement. Johor buys 16 million gallons per day of treated water back from us at 50 cents per 1,000 gallons. Fifty cents per 1,000 gallons is only a fraction of the true cost to Singapore of treating the water, which includes building and maintaining the entire infrastructure of the water purification plants.",4,5,2014-03-06-T-001-S-00005
2014-03-06-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Malaysian leaders have acknowledged that Malaysia benefits from the current arrangement and explained that, indeed, that was why Malaysia made a carefully considered decision not to review the water price in 1987.",5,6,2014-03-06-T-001-S-00006
2014-03-06-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),Then Malaysian Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad said in 2002 that Malaysia did not revise the water pricing when it was due because they thought Singapore would also revise the price of treated water supplied to Malaysia. One can refer to the Bernama report on 11 October 2002.,6,7,2014-03-06-T-001-S-00007
2014-03-06-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Then Johor State Assembly Speaker, Zainalabidin Mohd Zain, said that the Johor government had not made a mistake in not pressing for a review in 1986, and said, ""There was no point in doing so because Johor was dependent on Singapore for its treated water supply, and Singapore would have also increased its price of treated water sold to Johor."" This was from New Straits Times, 3 July 2002.",7,8,2014-03-06-T-001-S-00008
2014-03-06-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Under the agreement, after Malaysia decided not to review the water price in 1987, there is no longer any right to review the price of water. Had Malaysia exercised the right to review the water price in 1987, Singapore might then have made different investment decisions to develop Johor River, for instance, that Linggiu Dam project of 1990.",8,9,2014-03-06-T-001-S-00009
2014-03-06-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"In the event Malaysia chose not to review the water price in 1987 and, on that basis, Singapore then took several actions which also benefited Malaysia. This included building the Linggiu Dam at the cost of over $300 million, which has increased the yield of the Johor River, and enabled both Johor and Singapore to draw water from it during this dry season.",9,10,2014-03-06-T-001-S-00010
2014-03-06-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Our position on this issue is well-known to Malaysia. We have stated this publicly and also conveyed it to the Malaysian government, including at the highest levels. The Malaysian government understands the position. Foreign Minister Anifah Aman said on 17 February 2014 that, ""an agreement is an agreement. When there is an agreement, we will honour the agreement. If there is any need for review, we will forward it and if their response is positive, we will start talking"".",10,11,2014-03-06-T-001-S-00011
2014-03-06-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"We welcome the Foreign Minister's statement. It reaffirms the position Malaysia has taken previously on honouring the agreement – indeed, that cannot be in any doubt – and acknowledges that a review on the water price is possible only if Singapore agrees with such a review.",11,12,2014-03-06-T-001-S-00012
2014-03-06-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Ms Lee also asked about the Johor government's reported proposal for a price review. We have only heard of this proposal from media reports emitting from Johor, but there have been no official approaches from Malaysia on this issue. It would thus be premature to speculate on the impact of any such approach on our bilateral relations.",12,13,2014-03-06-T-001-S-00013
2014-03-06-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"We enjoy good relations with Malaysia at all levels, starting with the two Prime Ministers. But good relations also depend on both parties taking a broad approach to the relationship and honouring all agreements between the two countries. We will continue to work to enhance our cooperation and friendship with Malaysia in order to benefit both our peoples.",13,14,2014-03-06-T-001-S-00014

Mdm Chairman, our defence cooperation agreements with other ASEAN countries is an important aspect of our regional security framework. The ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting (ADMM) and the ADMM-Plus are both relatively new components of our regional security architecture, especially the ADMM-Plus which was established in 2010.

Can the Minister update the House on our contributions to the international counter piracy effort in the Gulf of Aden?",2,45,2014-03-06-T-004-S-00045
2014-03-06-T-004,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Chairman, at the Committee of Supply in 2013, the Minister for Defence made mention on the creation of additional posts for full-time safety officers in the SAF to ensure better compliance with training safety regulations. A Directorate for Safety and Systems Review (DSSR) has also been formed. The House was informed that the DSSR would also set up external review panels which will submit recommendations to the Minister for Defence.",1,46,2014-03-06-T-004-S-00046
2014-03-06-T-004,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"The SAF is the port of call and a rite of passage for a vast majority of Singaporean men.

2014-03-06-T-004,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"Thank you, Mdm Chair. The commonly held notion of ""chance favouring the prepared"" cannot be underestimated. Effective training of our NSmen is, therefore, vital if we are to have a strong defence force.",1,52,2014-03-06-T-004-S-00052
2014-03-06-T-004,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"Changes to our demography are posing new challenges to the way we train our soldiers. The influx of new immigrants, falling birth rate and a shorter NS stint mean that we have to update our training methodology to be more responsive to changing circumstances. Of particular concern is whether the operational readiness of our NSmen is affected by falling birth rates. Does this mean SAF would have to intensify its efforts to capitalise on technology to make up for less physical bodies?",2,53,2014-03-06-T-004-S-00053
2014-03-06-T-004,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),We need to keep NS going and to keep NS strong. Training enhances the fighting competence and capability of our NSmen.

How can we tailor our training to better take advantage of their abilities?,3,54,2014-03-06-T-004-S-00054
2014-03-06-T-004,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),Training safety is equally important. I am happy to note that we have had no training deaths in 2013.

2014-03-06-T-004,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"Our defence philosophy is predicated on being a strong deterrent force that is technologically advanced. Enemies know that they will have to suffer significant losses if they ever decide to take up arms against us. At the same time, they know that Singaporeans will hold nothing back in the defence of our homeland. This psychological edge is as important as having the latest and most advanced machines. To this end, how does MINDEF ensure that Singaporeans continue to remain committed to defence?",6,57,2014-03-06-T-004-S-00057
2014-03-06-T-004,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"On Total Defence, the concept of defence should really be seen at the level of Total Defence.

2014-03-06-T-004,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,"Madam, in my Budget speech, I asked if we could all remember what we were doing when we were 16. Being 16 in 1942 at the fall of Singapore was perhaps the worst of times. In the decades after, being 16 has gotten easier and much less fraught with danger and uncertainty. But perhaps for some, we have become soft, unaware of the dangers of unstable geopolitical winds. But, at the same time, NS, as a key institution, continues to play a key role in rooting our people to the defence of our nation. Yet, defence can be a vague concept. And as we mark 30 years of Total Defence, how do we plan to further strengthen this message that all of us, in and out of uniform, play a crucial role? With recent incidents in the region, including the naming of an Indonesian navy vessel, it is perhaps no better time than this to do so.",1,59,2014-03-06-T-004-S-00059
2014-03-06-T-004,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,"Being 16 in the decades to come should still be filled with carefree joy and security. Yet, we must remain cognisant of the constant need to be united.

2014-03-06-T-004,Nicholas Fang,Mr Nicholas Fang (Nominated Member),"The increasing tensions between China and Japan seem to draw in even superpowers like the United States and there are implications for smaller states within ASEAN in their relations between these two superpowers. The maritime territorial disputes in the South China Seas though not directly affecting Singapore itself as a non-claimant state, also threaten to draw in some of our partner nations within the ASEAN grouping as well, and there are pressures for ASEAN as a whole and for small countries like Singapore to take a stand potentially to align itself on one side or the other, which goes contrary to the nature of ASEAN and to Singapore's position of being a friend to all sides.",2,62,2014-03-06-T-004-S-00062
2014-03-06-T-004,Nicholas Fang,Mr Nicholas Fang (Nominated Member),"The implications for Singapore, in terms of defence, are far reaching, in terms of the changing, evolving international concerns.

2014-03-06-T-004,Nicholas Fang,Mr Nicholas Fang (Nominated Member),"As other hon Members have mentioned so far, a key question now is how do we ensure that the future generations take on the significance of everyone doing their part for Total Defence. The relevance of Usman Harun, the recent incident, the historical anecdotes of what happened during Konfrontasi, I think much of this is actually lost on the younger generation. I hope that the Ministry, as it continues to plan its budget going forward – considering the hardware that we need to acquire and to renew to ensure that we remain relevant as an international force – will also consider devoting sufficient resources to communicating the message of the need for defence.",7,67,2014-03-06-T-004-S-00067

Kissinger said that Europe, in the post-modern period, was reluctant to engage in military conflict, very eager to maintain its standard of living and quite different from the Europe that organised the world 100 years ago. A hundred years ago, because this is 100 years since the First World War. However, he continued, Asia, at present, was more like 19th century Europe, where military conflicts among each other – he mentioned between China and Japan, or other neighbours – could not be excluded. Military conflict in Asia could not be excluded.

This is not a surprise because military history is replete with unknown unknowns.

Our planning horizons are intentionally long term and we spend prudently and steadily. This steady defence spending allows us many ""opportunity buys"", for example, the refurbished Leopard Tanks from Germany. It was a good buy because this was what they termed the ""post-Cold World War dividends"" – the Berlin Wall came down, people said tanks were no longer required, so there was a huge surplus of tanks that went on the market and we picked them up at a relatively good price and refurbished them.",21,92,2014-03-06-T-004-S-00092

So, if you look at our defence spending over the last 10 years, and I think Members have asked for it – what is our thinking, what is our trend – if you look at our defence spending over the last 10 years, it reflects this steady investment in capability building where our defence budget has roughly kept pace with inflation.

Another ""test"" that validated whether our SAF is ready was our response to the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004. Members would remember that this happened on Boxing Day, so there was no prior warning, but we were able to quickly dispatch the Charlie-130 aircraft with supplies and helicopters to assist in the efforts, as well as a Landing Ship Tank (LST). The RSS Endurance carried over 400 people, more than 50 vehicles, and a large amount of relief supplies. This was, of course, to Aceh and this was before we realised also that other parts were also hit.

Let me repeat that. Whether you are a fighter pilot, sailor in the ocean, soldier on land, you will be able to see the big picture, speak to one another, jointly target threats and orchestrate responses.

The F-16s upgraded, with our F-15s, would be able to defend our airspace ably. In addition, we would have acquired our next generation fighter aircraft, which I think Mr Pritam Singh asked about, but we are not quite ready to decide yet.

The MRTT or the A330 can hold 20% more fuel than our current KC-135 and we will extend the range of our fighters through Air-to-Air Refuelling. The Airbus 330 can also double up as a cargo and troop air-lift to deploy troops and equipment to overseas sites further away as we have done in HADR operations.

Our Frigates, operating with their Sikorsky S-70B Naval Helicopters, and our new Littoral Mission Vessels, will form the mainstay of our surface fleet. The Naval helicopters have proved to be effective and versatile for a wide range of missions. When we deployed them in the Gulf of Aden, we validated their usefulness in counter-piracy missions, and therefore the SAF has decided to acquire two more Naval helicopters. The SAF has also found the multi-role Landing Ship Tank (LST) to be an effective workhorse in our relief efforts. So, whether it was the Indian Ocean Tsunami, the Northern Arabian Gulf, whether it was to relief efforts elsewhere, they were found to be effective. But if there was one limitation, it was in the carrying capacity.

In the next 10 years, the number of units that will operate on wheel or track platforms will almost double. So, whatever we have now, in 10 years they will double in numbers and this will create more mobile units. This includes more Terrex Infantry Fighting Vehicles to deal with threats in urban environments. The Terrexes will be linked to UAVs to see better, further and act more decisively. The Bionixes will also be upgraded and this will be operationalised by 2030.",37,108,2014-03-06-T-004-S-00108

Possibilities include multiple micro-UAVs for individual soldiers. Some of you may have seen them on YouTube – these gyrocopters that are swarming. It is very likely that individual soldiers will be able to use them, or robotic mules that can carry very heavy loads and follow soldiers autonomously. I know this will be every soldier's dream where a robot mule carries your rifle, but do not get ahead of yourself, this is for serious stuff. We will continue to test these capabilities in realistic terrain and scenarios. For example, we did it in Exercise Forging Sabre 2013 where we deployed the widest range of platforms and precision munitions to date, including F-15, F-16, Apache and Chinook helicopters, and our High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS).",38,109,2014-03-06-T-004-S-00109

These capabilities of the SAF, if achieved by 2030, should provide Singaporeans the confidence that Singapore can be protected. I say ""confidence"", not ""certainty"". The future is as always unpredictable. I would also remind Members of this House and Singaporeans, who have asked whether we are too far ahead or we are too well protected, that as a small country of only 700 square kilometres and about four million residents, our vulnerabilities will always exist. We cannot erase these vulnerabilities. We can mitigate them, and prepare the best we can for our defences with the resources available. But we must be resilient enough to withstand the unforeseen. But, most importantly, whether we can deter would-be aggressors for another 50 years and achieve peace depends not on advance systems or weaponry, no matter how sophisticated, but our people and their resolve to defend our island home.",39,110,2014-03-06-T-004-S-00110

When they presented these results to me, I tried very hard to poke holes in the methodology. I said these were the people that you knew would say that defence is important. The researcher was somewhat taken aback. He said ""no"", and he defended it very well. I kept probing him. And he was satisfied that his methodology was rigorous.

I think that is fair comment. The SAF takes this criticism to heart because those who gave feedback were not asking for lighter loads or less involvement. They, in fact, wanted NS to better strengthen our national identity, social cohesion and instill discipline and values, which many Members of this House have echoed. They said that there should be less time wasted and more effective training systems. I agree that these are good outcomes, even if people are committed to NS, and that we should find ways to improve the system – seriously look at the system to see if we can improve.

You would have gone through it yourselves or you may have children and relatives who have gone through it. In other words, the older batch, second year NSF train and command the first year NS batch.

There is a limit to which what a 22-year-old NSF second year can transmit to a 21-year-old. Some of them do it very well and I am very proud of them. But we have to accept that there are limits. In fact, using only full-time regular trainers is how the commandos train their recruits in basic training. They have done that for years. All their trainers are professional trainers. So, for the basic military training centre, which I think your relatives and children go to, only one in six trainers are professional regulars. Of all the trainers, five are NS full-time, and one of them is a professional regular.",44,115,2014-03-06-T-004-S-00115
2014-03-06-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"So, arising from the Committee to Strengthen National Service (CSNS), the SAF has decided to employ more regulars as full-time trainers, as a career path. We are studying the details about how many we need, but we could employ as many as 1,100 more regulars to fill this vital role. This will increase the proportion of professional regular trainers in Basic Military Training Centre from one in six, to one in three, which is a significant improvement and which I think will strengthen the training of our NSmen.",45,116,2014-03-06-T-004-S-00116
2014-03-06-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Full-time Army trainers will make the training of NSmen more effective and efficient, possibly even shorten training duration. As quickly as I said that, let me quickly dispel unrealistic expectations. The number of in-camp training that NSmen have to perform will not be reduced. Let me say that, again – will not be reduced. The reason is this  we reduced it from 13 in-camp training to 10 in-camp training cycles in 2006. As many of you have pointed out, including Mr Ong Teng Koon, demographic challenges are there, and we need these 10 in-camp training cycles and those in MINDEF reserves to maintain the strength in our standing force. This will meet our defence needs, even with falling birth rates, until 2040.",46,117,2014-03-06-T-004-S-00117
2014-03-06-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"The largest impact of employing more regular trainers will be on the training of our full-time NSmen. There can be some time savings because in the present system, some time is required for the second year NSF trainers to adapt themselves to the training environment in their units and training schools. Having regular trainers will smoothen this transition. But here, again, let me quell unrealistic expectations. The time savings will be a few weeks at most, if any. I am not making any promises here, because the Army has to study many details to ensure that we can continue to generate operationally ready units. If there are some time savings in terms of weeks, we will pass it on and we will operationalise it, but Army is under no pressure to deliver on that score.",47,118,2014-03-06-T-004-S-00118
2014-03-06-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"However, there is an area which we can improve in, arising from the feedback, and that is to reduce the waiting time before enlistment. Many of you know this problem. The reason is because Singaporeans before enlistment have different education pathways. Some go to Junior Colleges, some go to Polytechnic and some go to ITE. They have different waiting times – some are longer than others. I asked the SAF to respond to this feedback, to develop a system where we can commit to all enlistees, except for some exceptions, that all of them can start their BMT and NS within a fixed timeframe, say, within four to five months. I think this is possible. But please remember that we are dealing with nearly 20,000 enlistees every year, so the logistics are very challenging. The Army is studying this seriously and expects to complete its detailed studies on the issues raised by the CSNS in the second half of this year.",48,119,2014-03-06-T-004-S-00119
2014-03-06-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"The Committee also noted that many Singaporeans supported the idea of more women, first-generation PRs and new citizens volunteering for roles in national defence. The idea of an SAF Volunteer Corps for women, PRs and new citizens has gained wide acceptability. Mr Pritam Singh talked about his own session that he was involved in and we think that this is a very good idea that we will adopt. Second Minister Chan Chun Sing will speak more on this idea.

Last month, our two navies – the Malaysian and Singapore navies – commemorated the 30th anniversary of Exercise Malapura. My counterpart Dato' Seri Hishammuddin Hussein visited Singapore recently and we agreed to strengthen bilateral defence cooperation. With Indonesia, the warship naming episode has impacted bilateral relations and set back many years of relationship-building in defence ties.

Such outreach efforts aim to enable Singaporeans to experience first-hand the capabilities of the SAF, particularly also the competence of our NSFs and NSmen. In collaboration with MOE under the SAF-Schools Partnership Programme, we have also reached out to almost 70,000 students from 30 schools through various activities since 2010. Hopefully, these activities do give the boys a good preview of the SAF before their enlistment, thereby increasing their level of commitment when they get enlisted and, for the girls, we hope to give them a better understanding of what their friends and family members go through during NS.",7,165,2014-03-06-T-004-S-00165
2014-03-06-T-004,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Minister of State for Defence (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman),"MINDEF has continuously sought new communication and engagement initiatives to bring the SAF closer to the hearts and minds of Singaporeans. On the social media front, our cyberpioneerTV YouTube channel, and the Army, Navy and Air Force Facebook pages have attracted strong followings. It is heart-warming to read some of the personal reflections on these Facebook pages. Let me share with the House one such post made by LTA(NS) Davis Koh Han Rong, who is currently a University student, on the Army Facebook last year  ""I am grateful for the Army that has transformed me to who I am today... Ever a day the button is pressed, I will be ready to stand forth and protect this place I call home.""",8,166,2014-03-06-T-004-S-00166

According to the October 2013 survey conducted by NUS' Institute of Policy Studies, more than 98% of respondents agreed that NS is necessary for Singapore's defence. Surveys aside, we have also witnessed different members of the community expressing their support for our NSmen in their own ways, ranging from the 21 retailers who offered exclusive promotions to all SAF servicemen during SAF Day last year, to bloggers, such as Darryl Kang, who saluted online those who have contributed to national defence, and an unnamed female student who gave PTE Yang Hui a thank-you note for his service to the nation whilst on a bus earlier this month.

Mr Ong and Mr Alex Yam asked how Total Defence remains relevant and how MINDEF engages the public on Total Defence. This year marks our 30th anniversary of Total Defence. Over the last 30 years, we have seen and have been confronted with a variety of challenges, including the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008, the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the potential terrorist threats post-9/11. In all these instances, we witnessed Total Defence in action. Total Defence has stayed relevant because it has adapted to changing circumstances.

For the younger generation, their memories do not stretch to World War II and Konfrontasi, events that many could read about only in textbooks and the Internet. While these events remain vivid in the minds of our Pioneer Generation, it may not be so for our younger generation. Of course, we must not allow these memories to fizzle away. But we must also recognise that our younger generation will have their experiences and memories that will be etched in their own minds.

They have much bigger land mass than us, their economies will be projected on a growth path, their defence spending will definitely surpass Singapore's in the next few years.

I note that in the Auditor-General's Report for FY2012, they did note, under MINDEF, one case of lapse when it came to managing this logistics contractor. They stated that the basis for measuring the contractor's performance was not actually agreed while the contract was in force. In other words, there was some disagreement between MINDEF and the contractor about what needed to be done and how it was to be measured. I would like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry has actually done any review on whether there are any other such cases and whether they are tightening up on this aspect.",1,192,2014-03-06-T-004-S-00192

Only as a last resort will we go for the legal recourse because we want to develop a long-term relationship with the respective contractors.

2014-03-06-T-004,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Chairman, let me respond to the first question. Let me clarify that the increase is due to the increased command emphasis to have more incidents reported. So, there is a 60% increase in the reporting in the first half of last year, compared to the year before. But the number of training incidents, non-fatal training incidents, has remained the same between 2012 and 2013, which is between 67 and 68 respectively.",1,197,2014-03-06-T-004-S-00197

2014-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"First, are we prepared to deal with future riots and public order disturbances? The Little India incident involved a crowd of about 400 migrant workers, but not all were actively involved. It was eventually quelled by two Police Tactical Troops from the Special Operations Command (SOC). We know from the Deputy Prime Minister's statement in Parliament that the first SOC troop arrived about an hour after the incident occurred. As Ms Denise Phua so eloquently explained during the debate on the Public Order Bill, things could have turned far, far worse in that time. Over and above the questions the COI will answer, there are a number of other questions we need to ask. Do we have enough trained Police to handle a riot on a larger scale?",7,211,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00211
2014-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I understand that we presently have eight SOC troops, each comprising 20-30 men – therefore, at most, we have 240 SOC officers. Larger foreign dormitories may house thousands of men. Would the SOC be able to quell a riot breaking out in such a dormitory? And if we have two incidents at two different dormitories at the same time, what will happen? Coordinated riots are not unheard of. It has been revealed that the SOC has grown smaller over the years – from a peak of 12 troops to the present eight. In addition, they now perform other duties, such as counter-terrorism operations. Will we therefore be able to deal with such threats?",8,212,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00212
2014-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My second point has to do with the deployment of auxiliary police officers. The SPF relies on the auxiliary police in several capacities, such as to conduct patrols and to beef up enforcement on the roads. In fact, auxiliary police were involved in patrolling Little India before the riot and were also present at the incident. Is this high degree of dependence on auxiliary police desirable?",9,213,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00213
2014-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Auxiliary police are not substitutes for police officers. They have limited enforcement powers. The quality of training received by them may also be different. Therefore, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister to what extent do we depend on the auxiliary police force to supplement our Police force and what does he see as a desirable balance?",10,214,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00214
2014-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Thirdly, much more is expected today of our Police and law enforcement officers. Singaporeans hope to see a stronger Police presence, not just in areas where foreign migrants congregate, but everywhere, particularly where we live. I have lost count of the number of times my residents have requested more police patrols, even in areas where statistics show low crime rates.",11,215,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00215
2014-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"We all want to feel safe in and around our homes. And in a way, the Ministry is promising that – with its Community Policing initiatives – more boots on the ground and more bottoms on bicycle seats. We have also recently amended the Prisons Act to introduce the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme where ex-offenders will be provided with counselling, case management and supervision to support their reintegration into society. This is an excellent approach, but will require the involvement of more resources, more counsellors and more officers. Can the Ministry realistically deliver or continue to deliver on these programmes? Or do we need to temper our expectations?

A cool, experienced head on the ground may prove more effective than an entire troop of raw officers.",14,218,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00218
2014-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In this regard, I have one suggestion. The Ministry should find an enhanced role for retired Police officers. I had the pleasure of recently lunching with the Management Committee of the Singapore Police Retirees' Association. They may have thinning, greying hair and may be less fit than they once were. But what struck me most was their passion for law enforcement and their sense of duty, and most of all, a powerful call deep within them to help Singapore remain a special place. With their experience and instincts, their older and wiser heads can be a tremendous resource. They can be tapped on to train younger officers, reviewing investigation reports and other work which can accommodate their physical abilities. They told me they are ready, willing and able to serve again, if called. What a shining example they would be in our efforts to get more older Singaporeans and retirees active and involved.",15,219,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00219

2014-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,"Madam, the community plays a critical role in our efforts to keep Singapore safe and secure. Recognising this, the Ministry has made structural changes to promote community engagement. In 2012, following the launch of the Community Policing System, our Neighbourhood Police Centres were revamped to enhance their crime fighting and community liaison capabilities. More foot and bicycle patrols were introduced to allow policemen to become more familiar with residents and neighbourhoods, thereby enhancing Police engagement with the community.",1,222,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00222
2014-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,"These structural developments were complemented by a range of schemes. The Singapore Police Force (SPF) runs several volunteer schemes, including the Neighbourhood Watch Zone, which cultivates mutual assistance among residents in the community to help to prevent and detect crime. We have the Crime Prevention Ambassador project and the Volunteer Special Constabulary, which recruits, trains and supervises volunteers to work with the SPF in helping to enforce law and order in Singapore. We also have programmes like the Community Safety and Security Programme which provide an additional platform for residents and grassroots to work with the Home Team.",2,223,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00223
2014-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,"Madam, there is no doubt that these schemes are important, but there is scope for further engagement. A study published in 2012 from Ottawa, Canada, confirms that crime prevention and law enforcement are more effective where the community takes collective responsibility for them. According to the study, the reported incidents of crimes against persons or properties in three communities that adopted community-based crime prevention techniques were tracked and the results were significant. From 2006 to 2011, the rate of reported incidents in each of the three communities fell far more than the overall city average. The overall city average fell 15% and the three communities fell between 20% and 27%.",3,224,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00224
2014-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,"What was critical to each community's success was the diverse and holistic range of initiatives launched. Police conducted outreach sessions, resident-led walkabouts were organised to identify and report safety issues, such as signs of drug peddling and prostitution, and community forums were organised to bring residents together to discuss security and crime-prevention strategies. What is clear from the study is that crime prevention is not about enforcement or enforcement-type activities alone.",4,225,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00225
2014-03-06-T-005,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,"Therefore, I would like to ask the Minister what strategies MHA will adopt to continue engaging and building strong relationships with its community partners, and to continue supporting the Home Team's work in keeping Singapore safe.",5,226,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00226
2014-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Mdm Chair, in September 2013, it was reported that a young Singaporean was the fifth to be self-radicalised and was detained for two years under the Internal Security Act (ISA) for trying to join an insurgency in Thailand. According to reports, he had been influenced by what he read online to join this insurgency. I understand that, in this case, he was detained under the ISA after he had been handed over by the Thai authorities following his arrest and conviction in Thailand for immigration offences because he entered Thailand illegally.",1,227,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00227
2014-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The threat of self-radicalisation is one of particular concern because it seems that the material on the Internet that influenced this individual is readily available and continues to be readily available. In this regard, is MHA able to provide an update on the regional terrorist threat and, in particular, on any measures it plans to take to deal with the threat of self-radicalisation in Singapore?",2,228,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00228

It also fell 4.3% compared to the year before in 2012. But, Madam, these are statistics and numbers. These are not numbers that we can afford to be complacent about and we need somewhat to look into the details as well.",1,229,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00229
2014-03-06-T-005,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"The decreases were in relation to crimes against persons, housebreaking, theft and other miscellaneous crimes like vandalism, trespassing and disorderly behaviour. But what is troubling and remains troubling is that there were increases in violent and serious property crimes as well as commercial crimes, such as cheating and other related offences. Anecdotally, we have seen how the Kovan murders, the Little India riot and other such fairly high profile newsworthy incidents have dominated the headlines in the course of 2013.

There are other issues which remain pertinent to security in Singapore today and will continue to evolve. It is a threat that will continue to evolve over time and I would like to highlight a few.",3,231,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00231
2014-03-06-T-005,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"The first, cyber crimes. The usage of the Internet has grown. It has proliferated to an extent that we have an Internet penetration rate of 160% of our population having broadband access; a mobile penetration rate of 150%. Access to wireless, location-based cloud computing and other such technologies has become pervasive in daily life. That itself has led to an increased Internet usage and penetration, with a corresponding increase in the number and type of cyber crimes.",4,232,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00232
2014-03-06-T-005,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Take, for example, cheating using e-commerce. That has been the main contributor to the increase in commercial crimes. It has seen a rise from 238 cases in 2012 to 509 cases in 2013, almost more than double the number. Further, there have also been significant increases in multiple payment online purchase scams involving culprits who posed as sellers of various products and advertising them on the Internet and failing to deliver at all.",5,233,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00233
2014-03-06-T-005,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"The number of cases demonstrates that the Internet-savvy audience, typically the young, the vulnerable, had been targeted and we have to pay particular attention to how these crimes continue to evolve on the Internet. We have also seen in the last year how various high-profile prominent websites had been hacked into. This hacking into the servers and websites of entities, which are otherwise considered to be the most secure in Singapore if not the world, in a matter of days if not weeks, almost with impunity, makes for interesting news. But they highlight just how much of a threat this can be and how much this will cripple the day-to-day life which relies so much on technology.",6,234,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00234
2014-03-06-T-005,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Second, on the areas of drug enforcement, we have seen how in recent times the number of drug-related arrests has gone up. Just in the month of February 2014 alone, and based on the CNB website, we have seen that in that 28-day period, two-and-a-half kilograms of heroin and more than two kilograms of cannabis were seized, with a street value worth more than hundreds of thousands of dollars. The number of drug abusers arrested has gone up. The number of repeat abusers has gone up. The number of new abusers has gone up.",7,235,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00235
2014-03-06-T-005,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Third, counter-terrorism measures, which Mr Vikram Nair has outlined earlier, I would simply say that the recent apprehension of Masyhadi tells us that extremist terrorism remains a real and potent threat. The underlying structures, which have training camps supporting terrorism, remain in place. Self-radicalisation remains a growing phenomenon and we cannot afford to assume that no terrorist threats will materialise. To deter terrorism in Singapore, we need strong operational capabilities with a variety of different skill sets just to be commensurate with the ever-changing methods used by these small cells to evade detection.",8,236,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00236
2014-03-06-T-005,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Fourth, Madam, on civil defence readiness, a seemingly simple and straightforward issue, but one must look at the underlying numbers as well. We have seen an increase in the emergency ambulance services by 5.3% year to year. But the demand from the elderly alone, which comprises 10.5% of our population, has accounted for 36% of those requests or calls for emergency assistance. That illustrates that there already is and will continue to be, in light of our ageing population, an increased demand on the resources of the civil defence operators.",9,237,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00237
2014-03-06-T-005,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Finally, on immigration, we have seen in 2013, 203 million travellers cleared for entry into Singapore, a slight increase of about 3.6% compared to 2012. The ICA faces the constant challenge of accommodating these increasing traveller volumes while at the same time having to clear them efficiently and ensure that security is not compromised.",10,238,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00238
2014-03-06-T-005,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Madam, I raise these points because all of them require a few challenges to be met by the Home Team  one, the increase in resourcing which Mr Hri Kumar has touched on; and two, the increase in the amount of training to deal with these ever-changing and evolving threats through different means will continue to be a serious challenge to the Home Team.",11,239,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00239

2014-03-06-T-005,Arthur Fong,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"Mdm Chair, Singapore is an attractive city state that many have come to work, play and live. Our resident population has increased over the years. In this respect, our security forces, particularly the SPF, needs to keep up.

2014-03-06-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"In similar vein, Madam, I am concerned about many Home Team uniformed services turning to outsourcing as a response to increasing demand for services and manpower shortages. For example, in October 2013, the SCDF added only four more emergency ambulances to increase its fleet to 50 vehicles, but doubled the number of private ambulances to 20. Today, the number of Auxiliary Police Officers stands at 6,000 officers, compared with over 8,000 regular officers in the Singapore Police Force. At the Woodlands checkpoint, APOs make up 20% of officers. Recently, the Prisons Act was amended to expand the role of APOs to allow them to conduct inmate escort and patrols within prison premises.",1,250,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00250
2014-03-06-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Will the trend of outsourcing of police, security and emergency functions to private operators increase further? If so, where is the line to be drawn before we see the quality of functions compromised and cost-effectiveness eroded? Should the issues be dealt with not by outsourcing, but instead by allocating more resources and support for recruitment and retention to the Home Team? And instead of outsourcing with its limits, should we not focus on ""best-sourcing"" instead?",2,251,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00251
2014-03-06-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I would like to point out three problems. First, APOs do not have the same level of training as regular officers. Regular officers go through a six-month basic training course at the Home Team Academy, while auxiliary officers attend a much shorter in-house training course offered by Aetos or Certis-Cisco. Police officers also attend continuous training to keep their skill up to date with societal and criminological developments. The esprit de corps of belonging to the Home Team also instils a greater sense of purpose, pride and discipline.",3,252,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00252
2014-03-06-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Second, best-sourcing is about choosing a provider, be it a public agency or a private sector provider, who could deliver the services most efficiently and effectively. Here we have a paradox. To maintain standards, private operators have to comply with equivalent deliverables and ensure their staff are just as competent in those functions. If the public officers also have to conduct constant auditing and supervision to ensure the outsourced entity is up to mark, as in the case of emergency ambulances, would it not be more cost-effective to increase the regular services?",4,253,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00253
2014-03-06-T-005,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Third, best-sourcing is targeted at non-strategic functions of public agencies, so as not to compromise public health and safety. But what are considered non-strategic security functions to be outsourced to auxiliary officers? As the recent breach at Woodlands Checkpoint suggests, the secondary security check by the APO is very important and has implications on public safety.",5,254,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00254

Likewise, prison inmate escort within the prisons is not merely a security function but requires proper training to ensure the prisoner's rehabilitation is not compromised. Furthermore, injuries or death of an inmate resulting from improper handling can be disastrous for the services. In today's complex policing environment, every police officer requires strong situational awareness and adaptive leadership skills, and foresight in exercising discretion.",6,255,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00255

However, it is not possible that a person looks the same at ages 30 and 80, which is the average age a Singaporean man is expected to live to today, or five years longer for ladies.

For example, those in the delivery and despatch line need to exchange their ICs for visitor passes at camps, certain commercial buildings, and condominiums. They have to take out their ICs a few times every day, and these are also the people who do not have strong financial strength.

It has been around for about 30 years, since the early 1980s and it was modelled after the Koban system in Japan. We launched our first neighbourhood police post in 1983. It was these NPPs which brought the police closer to the ground, closer to the community and making them more effective as patrols were made on foot, on bicycle and the familiarity of the policemen and community was seen as an advantage. Over the years, the system has been reviewed to ensure that it is kept up to date and in tandem with the operating environment. In 1997, the NPP system was redesigned to the Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC) system. The NPCs were empowered with more resources and capabilities for community policing.",1,282,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00282

The community has also responded with various suggestions and tips. Using that, I think the Police has been able to better apprehend the criminals.",4,285,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00285

These cases were instead dealt with by a warning or no further action taken against the accused. Besides the low prosecution rate, the investigation procedures also seem long and cumbersome.

First, it is not easy to control a heavy vehicle. Heavy vehicle parking lots near the driver's home are also not easy to come by. Many have to find transport to and from home in the dead of the night or early wee hours where public transport is not available or accessible. They do not hence get to rest well and have irregular meals. There are also reports on drivers spending the night in their vehicles.

2014-03-06-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Thus far, initiatives, such as the Community Policing Scheme (COPS) and the Anti-Unlicensed Moneylending Awareness Campaign, enable the Police to tap onto the community as a potent source for surveillance and information gathering in the neighbourhoods.",5,323,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00323
2014-03-06-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Furthermore, the deployment of Police cameras at HDB blocks has assisted in allaying safety and security concerns of such loansharking activities happening in our communities. Regular reports of the arrests of unlicensed moneylenders are a testimony of the effectiveness of these initiatives.",6,324,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00324
2014-03-06-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Also, with the introduction of tough measures under the Moneylenders Act and other legislation, the Police have been successful at achieving a consistent reduction in the number of reports of unlicensed moneylending and related harassment cases in Singapore.",7,325,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00325
2014-03-06-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"But as the Police slogan goes, ""Low crime doesn't mean no crime"". Therefore, tough and robust measures must continue to be utilised to stem the spread of such activities in our community. This is particularly important as unlicensed moneylending is amongst a cluster of crimes that tend to involve large organised crime syndicates and often have a transnational aspect to them.",8,326,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00326
2014-03-06-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Therefore, I would like to ask the Minister whether existing punitive, legal and enforcement measures to reduce illegal moneylending activities continue to be relevant and effective, and whether there are further enhancements that may be required to augment the Home Teams' ability to fight against such activities, particularly in pursuing upstream offenders who are the puppeteers and masterminds of such activities.",9,327,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00327
2014-03-06-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"With the ever-evolving nature of such crimes, the Home Team and the Police must remain up-to-date with their measures and methods to reduce loansharking in our neighbourhoods, and must be able to adapt to the ever-changing and evolving criminal landscape.",10,328,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00328
2014-03-06-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mdm Chair, my second cut on remote gambling.

2014-03-06-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Remote gambling is essentially gambling either via the Internet or through a communication device like a smart phone. It was noted in 2013, that the size of the remote gambling market in Singapore was estimated at around $375 million and was expected to grow by about 6% to 7% annually.",12,330,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00330
2014-03-06-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"This spread of remote gambling in Singapore is particularly worrisome as remote gambling websites can be accessed at any time of the day, from anywhere and often without any charge. This is unlike one of Singapore's two casinos where there is a $100 levy imposed on Singaporean seeking to enter the casinos.",13,331,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00331
2014-03-06-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Therefore, Singaporeans who wanted to gamble but are reluctant to pay the $100 would choose to engage in remote gambling instead. This would allow Singaporeans to circumvent the preventive measures that had justified the implementation of the levy on Singaporeans at the two local casinos, namely to prevent the spread of problem gambling in our community.",14,332,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00332
2014-03-06-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),Another key issue with remote gambling is that remote gambling operations tend to be centred beyond the jurisdiction of Singapore and remote gambling operations may also become a source or conduit of funds for illegal activities or syndicated crimes.,15,333,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00333
2014-03-06-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Therefore, in November 2013, the Government announced that it would be introducing new laws to allow enforcement agencies to act against those who are involved in the provision or facilitation of remote gambling in Singapore.",16,334,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00334
2014-03-06-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"These new laws are expected to block Singaporeans from accessing gambling websites, prevent them from making payments to remote gambling operators online and to ban advertisements that promote remote gambling sites.",17,335,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00335
2014-03-06-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Soon after, MHA announced that it would be holding a public consultation exercise to engage with relevant stakeholders to understand how best such legislation can be crafted and implemented.",18,336,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00336
2014-03-06-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Hence, I would like to ask the Minister for Home Affairs  what feedback had been collated from the public consultations that were conducted and, moving forward, what plans does the Ministry have to operationalise the proposed measures to restrict remote gambling in Singapore.",19,337,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00337
2014-03-06-T-005,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Until and unless the Government implements tough and robust measures to curb the spread of remote gambling in Singapore, there will continue to be an avenue for Singaporeans to get caught in the vicious cycle of problem gambling.",20,338,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00338
2014-03-06-T-005,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Chair, on the drug situation, the worsening regional situation has made its impact felt even in Singapore, with the growing use of recreational or party drugs, especially among young adults. Singapore has fought hard to contain the drug menace and it is important that we do not let up on our efforts now. Given its disturbing developments, could the Minister update the House on how he perceives the current drug situation and the plan that MHA has to deal with new abuses of drugs, particularly among our youth?",1,339,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00339
2014-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair,"I have similar concerns as Mr Yeo. According to the Home Team's annual statistics on drugs for 2013 that were recently released, there was a 2% increase in the number of arrested drug users as well as repeat offenders. Altogether, some 3,574 drug abusers were arrested, of which 69% were re-offenders. The large number of repeat offenders tells the story of how serious the problem of drug abuse is. My own encounters with reforming addicts in the course of my work as a Member of Parliament leave me under no illusions about the man exposed to drugs.",1,340,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00340
2014-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair,"In this regard, I was particularly concerned because of the people who are arrested, 31% are new drug abusers and of these new drug abusers, about half were between the ages of 20 and 29 years old. This might be a long painful road ahead for these drug abusers.",2,341,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00341
2014-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair,"I also understand that about 92% of the drug arrests were for heroin and methamphetamine. But it was also notable that there was a sharp increase in the number of abusers of cannabis, a drug which some people might perceive to be less harmful.",3,342,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00342
2014-03-06-T-005,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair,"I understand that while heroin is the main drug of abuse for older addicts, younger addicts are more likely to use methamphetamine, such as Ice and cannabis. Could the Ministry provide an update on the local situation in relation to these types of drugs? Are any steps being taken to educate the youth of the risks of drugs such as these?",4,343,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00343
2014-03-06-T-005,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,"Madam, this House will agree that the ability to find a job as in financial independence and being meaningfully engaged in community will ensure offenders stay drug-free and crime-free for as long as possible after their release from the prison. Even while they were in prison, it is also reassuring and motivating for them to know that their families are not left alone to fend for themselves. These are also some of the reasons underlining the appointment of Yellow Ribbon Champions in our communities of which MacPherson is part of. As such, can the Ministry provide an update on its overall effort to work with volunteers and community partners to rehabilitate and reintegrate offenders?",1,344,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00344

First of all, let me thank all the Members for their keen interest in issues that are faced by the Home Team and also for their support for Home Team officers for the very challenging and difficult work that they do.

The overall crime rate has been falling steadily and is at its lowest in 30 years. Our crime rate is among the lowest in the world, well below major cities like New York, London, Tokyo and Hong Kong. Recidivism rates remain stable. Our fire fatality rate is also lower compared to these same four major cities. Our road fatalities and injuries continue to fall, though we want to see them decline further and there are some specific areas which we need to look at.

Many of us have seen the damage that drug abuse causes, not just to the drug abuser but also his family and the community.

Singaporeans support these tough measures because they keep our streets safe and our children safe.",7,352,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00352
2014-03-06-T-005,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"In contrast, some other countries have given up the fight in the face of rampant drug abuse. Instead of suppressing abuse itself, these countries have adopted so-called ""alternative approaches"" to reduce the collateral harmful effects of continuing drug abuse. They tolerate and even decriminalise drug abuse in order to reduce, for example, the spread of hepatitis or HIV by offering free needles to abusers to inject drugs, sometimes, as many as 100 needles per year. Such alternative approaches do not mitigate the demand for drugs but instead perpetuate drug abuse and we should not go down this route.",8,353,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00353

CNB and Prisons have recently enhanced our post-release reintegration and supervision programmes to help former drug offenders break the cycle of re-offending.

2014-03-06-T-005,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"Over the last 10 years, manpower in the Home Team has grown from about 19,000 to about 24,000 – a 25% increase. And the Police have grown from about 9,000 to about 10,300, an increase of about 15% over the last 10 years. But we have to be realistic. Can we continue to recruit good men and women of high quality, train them to do all the general-purpose work that is required, for example, in the Police Force, and then we deploy them to do very simple, mundane duties – boots on the ground?",34,379,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00379
2014-03-06-T-005,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"We have to strike a balance and, therefore, we are using auxiliary police officers and security officers, and training them to do very specific duties which they can do on a regular basis. Then we can deploy our Police officers who are generally trained for a wider range of duties to areas where their qualities are most valued and needed. This provides a good balance between having more people who are generally trained and more people who are specifically trained in order to meet our overall security needs.",35,380,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00380
2014-03-06-T-005,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"Let me describe how we deal with emerging threats, emergencies and crises. There are so many things that happened which the Home Team has to clean up after and to protect ourselves against. These can fall into two main categories, namely, situations that our officers have trained and prepared for, and situations that are difficult to anticipate. They can happen but will they happen; when will they happen?",36,381,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00381
2014-03-06-T-005,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"So, let me illustrate the first category by looking at how we deal with emergency medical response. These are things that we can anticipate, and our officers train and prepare for them. Where the type of situation can be anticipated and occur fairly often, the main variables are where, when, what, or who is involved – for example, a medical emergency.",37,382,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00382
2014-03-06-T-005,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"To improve our emergency medical response, we are growing the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance fleet. We have cross-trained some fire-fighters as Emergency Medical Technicians. And we have fitted our fire bikes and fire engines with Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs). We have also engaged private operators to augment our ambulance fleet to attend to the growing number of ambulance calls, particularly medical emergencies as compared to trauma cases.",38,383,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00383
2014-03-06-T-005,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"So, how can we respond better to emergency cases, in particular medical emergencies? If we focus solely on continually improving ambulance response times, it will require an ever increasing resource level that will ultimately reach our resource limits. But we can redefine the problem. If somebody has a medical condition that requires a fast, almost immediate response, there is no faster first responder than the person standing right next to him. So, how can we make him more able to respond and help? How can we help each other?",39,384,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00384
2014-03-06-T-005,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),We can facilitate this by leveraging on resources already available in the community. SCDF is collaborating with the Singapore Heart Foundation to set up and maintain a National AED Registry to guide members of the public to the nearest AED in an emergency. SCDF is also developing a complementary mobile app to alert volunteers trained in AED and CPR to emergencies in their immediate vicinity so they can provide first response even before the emergency ambulance arrives. This can help improve patient survival and outcomes.,40,385,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00385
2014-03-06-T-005,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"Together with MOH, we are working with stakeholders to encourage the installation of AEDs in public places with high human traffic and to train more first responders in the community. For a start, we are partnering the People's Association to install AEDs in Community Centres and conduct CPR and AED training for their staff and for the public. By marrying the accessibility and the location of AEDs, the readiness of AED-trained volunteer community partners, and the reach of mobile communications, we can supplement our emergency medical responders to achieve faster response and better outcomes in a sustainable and resource-efficient way. Similarly, we can tap on community resources to detect and report crime or traffic violations. Some of these suggestions were put up by the Members today.",41,386,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00386
2014-03-06-T-005,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"The second category comprises situations that are difficult to anticipate. They may only happen once in a very long while, but can have very serious consequences. Or they might not have even been anticipated at all. We can try to anticipate every eventuality, and plan and prepare for every one of them. But it is not possible to predict to the last detail what can happen, nor can we set aside dedicated resources at high alert for every single eventuality all of the time, and all at the same time.",42,387,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00387
2014-03-06-T-005,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"So, our approach is to organise the Home Team and train our officers to prepare them for their core work and the situations that they are most likely to face and, at the same time, our forces and our officers must have the right instincts and operational flexibility to respond and adapt to the specific requirements when the unanticipated happens.",43,388,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00388
2014-03-06-T-005,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"Let me give you an example. We have not had a kidnapping case for a very long time but when a kidnapping occurred, the Police was able to respond very, very quickly and resolve the case within 12 hours. And they had their priorities right – which was the safety and the life of the victim. They made sure that she was safe, then they arrested the suspects and then they recovered the ransom. So, victim survived, arrested the suspects, then recovered the ransom. That was a response in a very, very rapid way, in a very well coordinated way to an incident which has not happened for many, many years.",44,389,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00389
2014-03-06-T-005,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"So, we may not necessarily have specific and separate forces that are dedicated to and on high alert for each possible eventuality, but we can structure our forces to provide sufficient redundancy and resilience to adapt as necessary and respond to whatever situation arises. You may not get an optimal 100% response which comes from a dedicated high alert force that is ready to do it all the time, but you will get a very good response anyway.",45,390,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00390
2014-03-06-T-005,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"By preparing a tiered response and building in some redundancies and reserves, we can bring our forces up to the required level of alert, deployment and response according to the threat or risk assessment for each eventuality. The deployment posture for our forces will adapt according to operational needs. For example, a high profile international meeting that attracts international protest groups or terrorists will require one type of deployment; a major football game, another; a street parade, an international sporting event, a civil disaster, or possible tension among foreign groups in Singapore that might arise due to developments overseas. All these require different postures and deployments, out of the same general purpose response forces that we have.",46,391,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00391
2014-03-06-T-005,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"The approach I outlined also applies to how we prepare, train and equip our officers for riot control and other public order and security threats, which Mr Heng Chee How and several others asked about. For example, the structure, equipping and training of our forces was reviewed in preparation for the World Bank/IMF Conference in 2006 and reviewed again after the Mumbai terrorist attacks in 2008. I do not just mean the SOC forces but also our general purpose Police officers as well as the SCDF.",47,392,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00392
2014-03-06-T-005,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"One area that the Committee of Inquiry into the Little India riot is looking into is examining how the response forces managed the incident. As you would have seen from the testimonies at the COI, there are many considerations in dealing with such a fluid and fast-moving incident and all the factors should be taken into account before arriving at any conclusions. SPF, SCDF and MHA will study and consider the Committee's recommendations as part of our review of public order management and response capabilities.",48,393,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00393
2014-03-06-T-005,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"Mr Hri Kumar, Mr Arthur Fong and others asked whether the Home Team has adequate resources and manpower. The short answer is that more resources and manpower are always welcome because there are growing operational demands and calls for more enforcement presence. But there are natural limits to how much we can grow the Home Team, without compromising the standards expected of officers. As our resident workforce ages and stops growing, it will be even more challenging to recruit and retain good officers, especially given the demands of a uniformed career. I had explained earlier our approach to recruiting officers of good quality and whom we can train in a general purpose way; and employing APOs whom we can deploy effectively but for more specific domains and jobs.",49,394,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00394
2014-03-06-T-005,Teo Chee Hean,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean),"I agree with Mr Hri Kumar that it is important to retain a core of experienced officers within the Home Team. That is why in October 2013, we extended the retirement age of Home Team officers. These experienced officers can help to guide younger officers, and share the experience and expertise that they have built up over the years.",50,395,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00395

Our Home Team officers work round the clock, 365 days a year – investigating and solving crimes, manning our immigration checkpoints, responding to medical and fire emergency calls and more. They bring justice to victims, protect the vulnerable from harm and steer people who have broken the law back onto the right path.

If they act professionally and discharge their duties properly and to the best of their abilities, while the outcome does not turn out as well as expected, I will still support them publicly – for this is the difficult and challenging work that they do in the Home Team. And they need our support and encouragement. So, do give them your support and encouragement too when the outcome is not as good as one might have expected.

To strengthen this system, I have decided to set up an Independent Review Panel. When directed by the Minister, the Panel will review the findings of internal investigations into cases of serious alleged misconduct by an officer in his official capacity. Examples include cases which have resulted in death or serious injury, cases which obstruct, prevent, pervert or defeat the course of justice, or where it is in the public interest to do so.",57,402,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00402

2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Christopher de Souza had asked for an update on the public consultation exercise on the proposed framework to restrict remote gambling. MHA had earlier announced that we were developing a regulatory framework that would include blocking measures, and laws for enforcement against facilitators, intermediaries and providers of remote gambling services.",26,433,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00433
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"MHA conducted the public consultation on the proposed framework from 29 November 2013 to 10 January 2014.

2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The majority of respondents supported the move to restrict remote gambling and for Government to implement blocking measures. However, there were mixed views on whether a limited form of remote gambling should be permitted. Some called for a complete ban on remote gambling. Others felt that there was a need for a tightly regulated authorised entity that could divert demand away from illegal and unregulated operators – somewhat akin to Hong Kong, where a locally-based, not-for-profit operator is allowed to offer a limited range of non-casino style products on online platforms. The Ministry will take the next few months to further study these issues and the experience of other jurisdictions before arriving at an appropriate set of actions, including legislation.",28,435,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00435
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, I now turn to road safety, raised by Dr Janil Puthucheary, Mr Baey Yam Keng and Mr Alvin Yeo. As Members have noted, there was an 11% reduction in the number of accidents with fatalities or injuries, from 7,188 cases in 2012 to 6,426 cases in 2013. The number of injured road users also decreased, by almost 12%, and the number of fatalities declined by 5%.",29,436,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00436
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Notwithstanding this decrease, the fact is that such accident-related casualties can and should be prevented. We must therefore persist and persevere with our efforts to improve road safety. This was the impetus for the launch of the Safer Roads Singapore (SRS) action plan last year. Through Safer Roads Singapore, we aim to foster a culture of safe and courteous road use, with a three-pronged strategy of enforcement, education and engagement.",30,437,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00437
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On enforcement, we have deployed Auxiliary Police Officers and an additional 70 Traffic Police officers on our roads. The objective is to remind road users to continue to use our roads safely and responsibly, and to deter poor behaviour. Enforcement operations in 2013 resulted in a 10% increase in the number of traffic violations detected, compared to 2012.",31,438,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00438
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"We have also begun rolling out new digital red light and speed cameras around the island. This will complement the efforts of officers on the ground, and enhance our ability to detect and identify vehicles that speed or run red lights. The first five digital red light cameras began operations earlier this month. By the first half of 2015, a total of almost 260 additional digital red light and speed cameras would have been installed.",32,439,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00439
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"To complement enforcement efforts, Traffic Police (TP) have also strengthened road safety education for various groups of road users, in particular the more vulnerable. One such group is the motorcyclists who constitute nearly half of all injuries and fatalities on our roads.",33,440,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00440
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Since June 2013, almost 3,000 learner motorcycle riders have undergone the new compulsory Expressway Familiarisation Ride (EFR) course. It aims to help new motorcyclists become more familiar with riding on expressways, and to pick up useful tips for safer riding. Riders who have gone through the EFR course are much less likely to cause, or be involved in, accidents on the expressways. This was based on the pilot study that was done by TP previously.",34,441,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00441

2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"For example, the Singapore Road Safety Council has launched the annual Singapore Road Safety Award (SRSA), to recognise industry fleet owners that are committed to improving road safety within their companies. The inaugural Award was presented to PSA Corporation Ltd in December 2013 for putting in place a comprehensive framework to instil a strong road safety culture among its drivers.",36,443,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00443
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"This is not just confined to large companies. For example, LTH Logistics, a chemical logistics and distribution company with about 80 drivers, has taken a proactive approach to ensure the safety of its drivers and also our roads. All their vehicles are equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) devices that allow the company to monitor the drivers' speed. Those who adopt good driving habits are rewarded. These are good examples well worth emulating by all other companies with respect to ensuring the safety of their employees.",37,444,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00444
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,The Traffic Police will also be launching a new one-stop online portal on 15 March. This portal will allow members of the public to report traffic violations as well as examples of courteous and considerate driving. Members of the public will thus be able to play a part in improving our road use norms by providing feedback on both positive and negative road conduct.,38,445,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00445
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mdm Chair, even though the overall road safety situation has improved, some specific groups of drivers warrant closer attention. Mr Alvin Yeo and Mr Baey Yam Keng have identified heavy vehicle drivers and, more generally, vocational drivers as one such group. As Mr Baey has pointed out, vocational drivers do spend long hours on the road, often in large vehicles, and they also tend to ferry passengers or goods in the course of their work. It is important to ensure that these drivers have the requisite driving competencies and safety mindset.",39,446,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00446
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"One part of this is enforcement. Traffic Police have stepped up enforcement efforts against heavy vehicles. Last year, Traffic Police mounted significantly more operations against heavy vehicles as compared to 2012. We have also tightened the inspection requirements for heavy vehicles caught speeding. Since the implementation of this measure in November 2013, more than 190 vehicles that were caught for speeding were required to go for additional inspections. This enhanced inspection regime, which does disrupt operations for companies, coupled with the demerit points and fines imposed for speeding offences, will serve to emphasise the importance of safe driving habits among heavy vehicle drivers and, importantly, their employers.",40,447,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00447
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In addition, we are working with key industry players as well as Government agencies, like MOT and MOM, on a comprehensive study of the causes of such accidents and to identify specific initiatives which can help improve road safety amongst vocational drivers. These could include vehicular technological solutions, such as the in-vehicle cameras that Mr Baey suggested. This collaboration is spearheaded by the Safer Roads Industry Taskforce, which is co-chaired by Senior Minister of State Mr Masagos Zulkifli and Parliamentary Secretary Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim. The Taskforce will, certainly, take on board the Member's suggestions.",41,448,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00448
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Finally, let me address some Members' comments on the role of auxiliary police officers (APOs) and private operators. As Deputy Prime Minister Teo has highlighted, our operational demands have grown over the years and will continue to do so. In response, we have been strengthening our Home Team agencies with more officers. Over the past five years, the number of Home Team officers has grown by an annual average of about 2%.",42,449,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00449
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But there are limits to how much we can grow the Home Team, not least because we need to balance the increasing operational demands with the high standards that we expect of our Home Team officers. This, in turn, translates into selection criteria in recruiting. Hence, apart from harnessing technology, APOs and private operators play an important complementary role in supporting the work of the Home Team.",43,450,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00450
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Today, auxiliary police forces (APFs) and other private operators support us in performing specific functions in various areas such as facilities protection, checkpoints security, inmate escort and the provision of emergency ambulance services. This allows Home Team officers to focus on duties and situations requiring more specialised skills, or a higher level of judgement and decision making.",44,451,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00451
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"We have to be clear – APOs are not a substitute for regular Home Team officers. They are a complement to our Home Team effort. Ms Sylvia Lim had said that we should look at best-sourcing rather than outsourcing. I agree with her. By advocating best-sourcing, she already admits the requirement that there is a need to look at some external augmentation of the Home Team resources. Secondly, APFs are appointed under the powers of the Police Force Act. This is not a general tender exercise where we go for the lowest bidding entity. This is a strategic calibrated move as a result of the recognition of the need to find a continuum of capabilities in our system to meet rising operation needs. The APFs are formed and officers are appointed as a result of that.",45,452,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00452
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I would also add that the number of APOs as a proportion of Home Team officers has remained relatively modest and stable over the past five years. The Member cited the example of Woodlands Checkpoint being 20%. When you look at the operational environment in Woodlands, you will see why there is a need for more supplementation from APOs. But if I give you an aggregate picture, MHA collectively contracts about 1,700 APOs, and this is about 9% of the 18,000 of the Home Team uniformed officers. When the Member said that we should have a limit, I agree with her. Yes, there should be a limit, but I think at this current level, the agencies are, in fact, exercising their discretion to use APOs in a very responsible and calibrated way.",46,453,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00453
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Singh asked about the nationalities of the APOs. If you look at the ratio of APOs between foreigners and locals, it is not dissimilar to the general involvement of foreigners in our workforce. About two-thirds are locals – Singaporeans and PRs, and the rest are foreigners, specifically Malaysians.",47,454,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00454
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Even as we work closely with the APFs and private operators, the Home Team agencies have to ensure that the APOs and private operators perform to the required standards in support of the Home Team's mission. This is critical. APOs are therefore typically deployed under the supervision of Home Team officers and operate in accordance with procedures stipulated by the Home Team. Ultimately, the Home Team agencies and their officers maintain overall responsibility and accountability for the outcomes.",48,455,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00455
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Hence, it is in our interests to ensure that APOs receive the necessary training to effectively perform their duties. Today, APOs receive both basic and specialised training. All APOs are required to pass a basic training course. In addition to this, they also undergo specialised training for the type of duties that are assigned.",49,456,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00456
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"For example, APOs who are deployed to patrol foreign worker congregation grounds are briefed on the operating terrain and given training to deal with the common scenarios that they may encounter in the course of their duties. I want to assure Mr Pritam Singh that a structured training programme is in place to ensure that APOs are able to meet operational needs. This training is targeted at their special duties or duties they are assigned, and reviewed on an ongoing basis by Home Team agencies to ensure that APOs continue to be able to support our officers as the operating environment evolves.",50,457,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00457
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"A question was raised whether there is a scope for APOs to tap into some of the Home Team training. The answer is yes, a lot of it is focused on training the trainers, or commanders of the APOs, so that they in turn are able to create the right culture and mindset amongst their officers.",51,458,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00458
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The APFs also conduct regular audits and inspections on the ground to ensure that their own officers meet the required standards of performance in their duties. Drills, exercises and red-teaming are also conducted to improve APOs' operational effectiveness. The Police independently conducts its own audits and inspections of APFs and their operations.",52,459,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00459
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Ms Sylvia Lim asked about the role of APOs in road traffic accident investigations. APOs do not conduct road traffic investigations; only Traffic Police officers conduct investigations. LTA engages APOs as traffic marshals to manage traffic accident scenes. This initiative was started in late 2007 between LTA and Traffic Police in order to expedite the clearance of accident scenes and promote faster restoration of smooth traffic flow. Even then, APOs are not activated by LTA in all accident cases; they are mainly deployed for incidents, such as those in expressways and tunnels, which can affect traffic efficiency substantially. That is really the context.",53,460,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00460
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"When the LTA APOs arrive at the scene, they help to cordon off the affected lanes, direct traffic to ease congestion and, where necessary, preserve evidence for Traffic Police's investigations. Traffic Police will usually not conduct investigations into minor accidents where there is no injury caused to the parties. The parties will be advised to report the accident to their respective insurers promptly.",54,461,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00461
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Traffic Police investigate accidents where injury or fatality is caused. For such cases, LTA traffic marshals may facilitate the investigation process by noting down basic preliminary details, such as sketching of the accident scene and vehicle damage. In these cases where an investigation by Traffic Police is required, the traffic marshals are to relay any information that they have gathered to the Traffic Police officer in-charge of the case as soon as possible. This includes the contact information of involved parties and potential witnesses such as Ms Lim.",55,462,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00462
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"As part of the investigations, Traffic Police may contact – I stress may contact – the involved parties or potential witnesses for further information. However, if the facts are clear or where sufficient evidence has been obtained, TP can take the appropriate action against the parties involved without necessarily contacting all the potential witnesses for input.",56,463,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00463
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Traffic Police train and assess these APOs in their roles as traffic marshals, prior to their deployment. There are also established operating protocols to guide the traffic marshals in executing their tasks professionally. Traffic Police take the delegation of its functions very seriously and these processes are reviewed regularly to ensure that they remain relevant and robust.",57,464,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00464
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, I have taken some time to elaborate on this regime which we have with respect to APOs. First, I understand and share the intent behind Members' comments on APOs and private operators. But it is also important to understand, as Mr Hri Kumar has pointed out, that we need to strike a balance between the use of APOs and private operators to complement the Home Team in meeting operational demands, whilst upholding the high standards expected of the Home Team and its officers. It is a dynamic environment that we are in, and the Home Team agencies work with the auxiliary police officers and other complementary entities in order to ensure they can achieve the best outcome in terms of safety and security. We will regularly review the regulation, deployment and training of APOs to ensure that they have the skills and training to be able to support the Home Team effectively.",58,465,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00465
2014-03-06-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mdm Chair, MHA will continue to strengthen our operational capabilities, maintain a tough enforcement stance against crime and continue with our efforts to keep our roads safe.

When discussing the local drug situation, it is important to first set the context. The regional drug situation is expected to worsen, with reports of higher production, trafficking and consumption of heroin and amphetamine derivatives. International drug syndicates are also targeting the region. The attack by the suppliers has been relentless.",2,469,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00469

This is evident from local drug seizures. In 2013, CNB seized 72 kg of heroin. What does this amount to? What does this mean? This amount is sizeable because it can potentially feed the drug habit of around 8,000 abusers for 30 days. That is more people than those detained in our Prisons today for drug abuse. This is also a 150% increase from five years ago. There have been similar increases in cannabis and methamphetamine seizures in recent years.",3,470,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00470

Arrests of methamphetamine and cannabis abusers increased in 2013 when compared to the year before. Between them, they account for 73% of new abusers arrested in 2013 and nearly 64% of new abusers arrested were below the age of 30. This is a serious concern.",4,471,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00471
2014-03-06-T-005,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"We are studying the reasons for this increase. One reason could be misperception that young persons have about drugs. When arrested, many Ice and cannabis users say they took these drugs because they assumed they could control their addiction. They can try it just once and then they can stop thereafter. Please let me make this clear. There is no such thing as ""lifestyle"" drugs. One cannot experiment with drugs and not expect to get hooked. Ice and cannabis are no less addictive and dangerous than the drugs we have seen in the past. They can lead to a lifetime of drug dependency, damage our bodies and, in some cases, result in death.",5,472,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00472

Every time this happens is an opportunity for the media and the entertainment industry to step up and rally against drug taking and its harmful and potentially deadly consequences. Indeed, what has been happening is that we mourn their death and, worse, sometimes continued to produce materials that promote drug taking. For ourselves, we should send a clear message to the young to always to say ""no"" to drugs.",6,473,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00473

The Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) prepares offenders for employment by providing them with training that is accredited by the Workforce Development Agency (WDA), and other market-relevant skills before their release. SCORE has steadily built up a network of over 3,800 employers from various fields, such as logistics, manufacturing and food and beverage industries, who are all willing to offer ex-offenders a second chance. In 2013, SCORE helped more than 2,000 offenders secure employment before their release. This was a 23% increase from 2012. The support from employers to help ex-offenders stay in a job is an important part of our strategy to help ex-offenders rehabilitate and reintegrate into society.",15,482,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00482

In this regard, the Yellow Ribbon Community Project (YRCP) plays a crucial role in helping families of incarcerated offenders during their term of imprisonment. Piloted in 2010 in just seven grassroots divisions, the YRCP helps these families link up with relevant Government agencies for social assistance and support. They conduct house visits and help to ensure that the bonds between the families and the incarcerated offenders remain intact and that the ex-offender then has a home and family to return to upon release. As of today, the YRCP has expanded to 60 grassroots divisions all over Singapore, involving more than 500 volunteers. Over 1,600 families have benefited from this initiative. In 2014, we will broaden its coverage and extend the YRCP to more divisions.",16,483,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00483

The YRP has helped raise awareness about the challenges of reintegration, increase the acceptance of ex-offenders and inspire action in the community. Since inception, more than 420,000 members of the community have participated in various Yellow Ribbon activities, such as the Yellow Ribbon Prison Run and Yellow Ribbon Concert. The YRP has also partnered close to 1,000 community agencies and schools to organise and run activities for ex-offenders.",17,484,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00484

We are fortunate that the Home Team can rely on the partnership and involvement of people from all walks of life to keep Singapore safe and secure. They complement our work and are critical in rallying the community quickly when crisis strikes. Our philosophy is that a community comprising individuals committed to the well-being of society, equipped with training and skills, is best placed to take ownership of local issues and assist each other in times of need.",18,485,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00485

There are two aspects to our work with the community. First, equipping and engaging. As a starting point, it is important that we equip the community with the relevant information, skills and tools. I am glad to note that many students are coming on board to be equipped with emergency preparedness skills and help share what they have learnt with their fellow schoolmates through the SCDF's Junior Lionhearters' Programme. This was launched in April 2013 to cultivate young ambassadors who generate interest and awareness among their schoolmates, friends and families on the importance of emergency preparedness and the need to take individual ownership.",19,486,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00486

A very good example of this is the Delta League. Since 2011, the National Crime Prevention Council and Police have organised this community football programme where youths are engaged in sports and other meaningful activities. But off the pitch, the youths interact with Police officers and life coaches, as well as take part in community activities. To date, close to 4,000 youths have participated and benefited from the Delta League.",20,487,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00487

Residents play a vital role in helping to keep their neighbourhoods safe and secure. Grassroots leaders, volunteers and residents have also taken the initiative to assist police in the forming of Neighbourhood Watch Groups (NWGs) and Citizens-on-Patrol (COP) groups. To date, more than 7,000 NWGs and 600 COPs have been formed island-wide, helping to watch over their communities and keep them safe and secure. There are also members of the community who do more and regularly serve alongside us in the Civil Defence Auxiliary Unit, Volunteer Special Constabulary and Community Emergency Response Teams.",21,488,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00488

These community partnerships create a multiplier effect that amplifies the Home Team's ability to keep Singapore safe and secure. Having the right mindset is important. Today, you may be doing your part to help a neighbour in need. Tomorrow, someone else may be doing likewise for you. The Home Team will continue to deepen our engagement with the community, expand the scale and scope of some of the programmes I have just mentioned, and explore new areas of collaboration. I hope that many more will step forward and join us in this endeavour.",22,489,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00489

These officers are then only allowed to access data that is required for their specific operational need. Our servers are also protected by physical and software measures which are on par with international security standards. These measures are able to quickly detect hacking and raise alerts such that remedial action can be taken immediately. For all the processes I have mentioned, we conduct regular audits and reviews to ensure compliance.",25,492,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00492

We note Mr Low's comments and we will continually review our security policies to ensure that the integrity of personal data is safeguarded. Nevertheless, it is also important for individuals to be alert and careful about sharing personal information and details in cyberspace.",26,493,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00493
2014-03-06-T-005,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Mr Baey Yam Keng suggested that we replace NRICs at intervals of 20 years for security and other functional reasons. The current practice for Singapore residents is to register for an NRIC at 15 years old, and undergo a re-registration at the age of 30 where they will provide an updated photograph. Since the introduction of the current type of NRIC in 1991, the vast majority of them have remained in good condition after more than 20 years of use. Nevertheless, Mr Baey's suggestion is a valid one. ICA will study the viability of introducing another NRIC re-registration after the age of 30, so that the information captured will be up-to-date. This is especially relevant with longer life expectancy. ICA will also consider a waiver of the NRIC replacement fees for those who face financial difficulties or if their NRICs were damaged due to situations beyond their control, such as accidents or fires.",27,494,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00494

Could I ask for comment on retaining experience within departments? What I mean is that within each department, be it Prisons, border security, SOC, CAD, SCDF, they all call for different skillsets and different experiences and, if there is a regular transfer of officers at the mid or senior levels between these departments, then that sufficient amount of experience would not be built up as well. Will there be any thought towards trying to keep officers within the same department for longer periods so that experience can be built up?",1,497,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00497

So, the SCDF officers remain within SCDF, by and large. Prisons officers remain within the Prisons service. We sometimes have Police officers who cross over to, say, the Prisons service. But officers do come together at various times in their career, for example, in MHA Headquarters in, say, the Policy or Operations departments. That is where they will bring their collective knowledge and experience together to help the Ministry manage various cross-cutting issues.",1,498,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00498

2014-03-06-T-005,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"But we do post officers around within each service. The Police, for example, gives its officers a mix of experience between community policing, investigations and also work at the Headquarters to help them understand the broader policy issues that the Police faces. The experience that we gain from keeping officers longer is something which we value, as long as officers continue to be fit and able to contribute.

How society responds in the aftermath of discovering a terrorist plot, or worse, after a successful attack, is what really matters, not so much as the discovery of the terrorist plot or the terrorist attack itself. I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether more can be done to deal with the perception that terrorism is solely an issue that concerns only the Malay/Muslim community.",1,501,2014-03-06-T-005-S-00501

2014-03-06-T-005,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"My own sense is that the community spirit between communities became stronger after that. There are a number of reasons, one of which is that the Muslim community in Singapore took ownership of the issue. The RRG was a very important element in that because they said, ""Look, that is the problem – violent extremism. Let us deal with it. We will deal with it.""

The EU is now in the process of negotiating with Vietnam and Malaysia. This approach of EU negotiating with individual ASEAN countries and then, later, putting it together into a regional agreement is very similar to the process that Japan undertook in negotiating with ASEAN.

2014-03-06-T-006,Lim Hng Kiang,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"The prospects for our manufacturing sector remain bright. Singapore is plugged into the regional manufacturing supply chain and our companies stand to benefit from the growth of manufacturing in China, India and ASEAN. This is only possible because we are continually moving existing clusters up the value chain and have established a competitive niche at the higher end of this value chain.",20,601,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00601
2014-03-06-T-006,Lim Hng Kiang,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"To maintain our competitive advantage in manufacturing, we will continue to sharpen our industry development strategies. First, we will leverage on the strengths that we have built up in traditional sectors, like Precision Engineering, to upgrade and move into adjacent industries, such as Aerospace and Medical Technology (Medtech). In a similar way, in the petrochemicals sector, we have moved into specialty chemicals; in the biomedical sciences sector, into biologics; and in the electronics semiconductor sector, into the fabless segment.",21,602,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00602
2014-03-06-T-006,Lim Hng Kiang,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"Second, we will invest in R&D to deepen our manufacturing capabilities. We are already tapping on cutting-edge technologies to upgrade existing activities and open up new growth opportunities in manufacturing. Through the $500 million Future of Manufacturing initiative, EDB and A*STAR are helping businesses to develop and adopt such technologies. For example, EDB has worked with GlaxoSmithKline to pilot new technologies like enzymatic and continuous processing techniques. These have enabled the company to reduce its resource requirements, lower its physical footprint and shorten its manufacturing lead time.",22,603,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00603
2014-03-06-T-006,Lim Hng Kiang,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"Third, we will build up industry capabilities by leveraging on our Institutes of Higher Learning. For example, EDB is supporting the Nanyang Additive Manufacturing Centre, which is a $30 million research facility at NTU equipped with the latest 3D printers capable of printing metal objects and even human tissue. The centre will work closely with businesses through R&D projects to develop new commercial applications for additive manufacturing.",23,604,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00604
2014-03-06-T-006,Lim Hng Kiang,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"SPRING is also supporting our SMEs to adopt new technologies. Take Lintech Engineering, for example, it has implemented a robotic welding system to automate its oil and gas repair jobs. The effect has been quite dramatic – Lintech has increased its productivity by up to three times and is now better equipped to expand its business. MTI will develop more of such partnerships to build up industry capabilities and expand our talent pool.",24,605,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00605

This will help the industry recognise and reward craftsmen who build up their skills and experience.",25,606,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00606
2014-03-06-T-006,Lim Hng Kiang,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"Mdm Chairperson, the profile and nature of jobs in manufacturing will change as we restructure and upgrade. Future manufacturing jobs will be highly skilled, multidisciplinary and have high potential for career growth. They will be different from the jobs today. There will be a need for data analytics professionals, supply chain experts, industrial engineers, designers, business managers, and software programmers. In addition, future jobs will require individuals who can integrate multiple skillsets, such as technical knowledge, systems thinking and industry application. Therefore, I strongly urge Singaporeans to look at the prospects of our manufacturing scene. Good jobs are being created and they should take full advantage of these jobs.",26,607,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00607

So far, about 60 of our hotels have expressed interest. With such technology, hotels can better anticipate the arrival timings and check-in habits of business travellers and other guests. They can then tailor their services and stagger their staffing to provide the best check-in experience for their valued guests, every time. It will also allow hotels to re-deploy manpower to other high-touch customer-facing functions. In other words, they can focus on services that would really matter to their customers.",28,658,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00658

In the past decade, only one other large travel agency closed abruptly and that was in 2006. To some extent, this is unavoidable because travel agencies, like any other business, are subject to risk and business failure. Under such circumstances, customers can usually make claims under travel insurance, or seek redress through the Small Claims Tribunal.",31,661,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00661

Mr Lim has suggested various other ideas to protect consumers' deposits, including compulsory insurance and a compensation fund. STB will study these proposals, as well as the consumer protection practices in other countries, to assess what more can be done in our context. In doing so, I think it is important that we remember that there is a need to balance the protection of consumers' legitimate interests against any additional regulation, and its impact on business cost and, ultimately, the cost to consumers.",32,662,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00662

However, some small business owners told me that the Government assistance schemes mainly benefit profitable companies and of a certain size. The requirements for most of these assistance schemes are unattainable by micro-enterprises. Moreover, their most pressing needs remain unsolved, especially with regard to escalating rentals and manpower shortage. These are problems mostly encountered by traditional businesses, neighbourhood shops, hawker centres, food processing, timber, glass, F&B and the services sector in general.",2,705,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00705

To this very day, the Government has been the prime mover of Singapore's economic development, steering Singapore towards the path of industrial upgrading and transformation. Some high value-added and high-technology industries would be well taken care of – receiving all kinds of preferential treatment for land allocation, tax holidays, financing and application of high-tech solutions. On the contrary, assistance provided to the SMEs and traditional businesses is very peripheral and many assistance schemes come with a slew of conditions, making them almost impossible for SMEs, especially micro-enterprises, to enjoy.",3,706,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00706

Thus, I would like to understand how MTI determines that a particular industry belongs to the high value-added category, or how the productivity of a particular industry is evaluated. Based on current calculations, some high value-added industries will have very preferential treatment in doing business, but those deemed low value-added, especially those belonging to traditional businesses, would never become high value-added no matter how hard they try to upgrade and innovate. A slab of bean curd, a bowl of bak kut teh, one plate of char kway teow and one ang ku kueh can never be equated to a computer chip in terms of value.

Many old and established businesses have helped to raise two or three generations of Singaporeans; they can be said to symbolise the original flavours of Singapore, and have become an integral part of Singapore culture. They are still struggling to survive. Thus, I feel that MTI should look after the needs of the SMEs and micro-enterprises when they draw up industrial policies.

PIC has a prerequisite where companies need to have at least three local CPF-paying employees. Some family-operated businesses are unable to qualify and they are unable to recruit workers. Because of their low profit margins, they are also unable to fully enjoy the cap of 400% for enhanced tax deductions. Most SMEs are strapped for cash.

SMEs also provide a wide range of services and help Singapore to gain its stature of being a liveable city. The services sector accounts for a large number of these SMEs. According to the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014, out of 148 countries and regions, Singapore ranked number two for three consecutive years; but in the area of Business Sophistication, the ranking dropped from number 14 to number 17 this year, and the Innovation level also went down one notch from number eight to number nine. Business sophistication and innovation levels have dipped, reminding us that we ought to pay more attention to SMEs' survival and growth.",8,711,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00711

If SMEs and micro-enterprises have the prospects of growth, young people can be attracted to join them and the call to improve productivity becomes more of a reality than a theoretical notion.

If they are hung up too high, the SMEs cannot consume them. I mentioned this again in November 2012 and the problem was raised for a third time during the 2013 Budget Debate. Later, the Minister said that there are carrots everywhere on the ground for SMEs to pick up and eat, and even provided a telephone number for SMEs to call if the rabbits are keen to eat the carrots. We called this telephone number and the receptionist took down the contact, promising that a consultant would contact us. Actually, the Government does provide many carrots; however, they are not strewn on the ground but hung on trees. Big rabbits have no problem accessing the carrots, but the small rabbits that are jumping around still cannot eat a single carrot.",10,713,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00713

Currently, the SME Centre@SCCCI is putting all its efforts into promoting the Government assistance schemes. However, we keep running into problems during the implementation process because of the need to coordinate with multiple agencies. Moreover, dealing with one Government agency would not be effective because Government departments need to work within their own boundaries.

It was specifically covering the issues businesses face in the restructuring efforts that we are putting in place. If we listened to the tone of debate in this House and the speeches that have been made, many of the Members of Parliament, whether elected or nominated, who come from the business world have one tone, which is quite different from some of the Members of Parliament who may not have the business experience. The tone is that the rate of restructuring that we desire is hurting many companies.",1,725,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00725

There is no doubt that we need to make productivity improvements and future growth needs to be productivity-driven. But the rate at which we are doing is going to hurt many companies that could have made it in a bit of a longer term. They can be hurt so badly that they would not even cross the hurdle and end up folding. As I mentioned during my speech, we are going to end up in a situation where companies fold and jobs would be lost, and I think the situation could be very serious.",2,726,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00726

Immediately after I made the speech about the cost of doing business and cost of living, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) report came out and Singapore was ranked as the most expensive city in the world. If there is a measure of cost of doing business, I think we would also end up as one of the highest cost in the world right now.",3,727,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00727

If we can address the cost issue, I think we would have worried less about the types of payment that we have to make in PIC and many other grants that we are making. In fact, if you look at the rate of productivity improvement that companies have made, it is not so impressive in the last three years, simply because any improvements that they made have been lost in the cost increases that came about in the last couple of years. Let us say, if we failed to address the issue of cost, the productivity drive that we are trying to achieve will be a lost cause.",4,728,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00728
2014-03-06-T-006,Inderjit Singh,Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio),"Many Members have also raised issues about JTC and the Government's land divestment policies. I urge the Minister, this time, to rethink about JTC's share drop of 18% to 3% of the rental market. It has been a big change and I think, at 18% to 20% share, we could have some influence on the rentals – I am not saying that you set low prices – we could maybe put in controls like having companies to graduate from a JTC rented factory that has a lower cost after a certain number of years. But if we do not even have an opportunity for companies to start in low-cost facilities, they will never get started. So, I hope that we can reverse the policy that we have already made in this area.",5,729,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00729

I think the companies which are tapping on it are benefiting. Many small companies, as we heard from Members, cannot access this; they have problems. In addition to the six areas, innovation is key. And I think innovation does not have to be innovation in a product or service. Innovation can come also in a business model or business process improvement. If we can add this as one of the initiatives that companies take to be eligible for grants, I think that will help many companies. In fact, many of the small companies that Mr Teo talked about need business process re-engineering for them to be able to survive in this environment. If we can tweak the system a bit, I hope that we can include this as one of the measures that companies are eligible for.",6,730,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00730

I was fortunate to have the benefit of being involved in some of the dialogues. I found it a valuable process where we not only get to share with the SMEs, but also to make them better aware of the scope of the various schemes. This is useful for those harder-to-reach groups, as I have mentioned in my Budget speech, to look into how they can adopt the PIC or PIC+. During the Budget debate, I had also covered at length how the smaller SMEs may be an insulated group, and why we may need to take a more hands-on approach to try to aggregate demand and drive productivity collectively across groupings or supply chains. The SME dialogues, therefore, offer an opportunity to reach out to the small business communities and this will complement the SME satellites that were established across Singapore to reach out to the SMEs.

2014-03-06-T-006,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Many other Members have spoken at length about this. However, the challenging business environment has also meant that there is concern whether the micro-SMEs and traditional businesses will go out of business in this new transformed economy that we are going for. In fact, overall, the challenging environment of slow economic growth and rising business costs remains a concern for many SMEs. Labour tightening has meant higher wage expectations to attract local talent while increased foreign worker levies and rising rentals have impacted the competitiveness of many businesses. Personally, I support the increase in CPF contributions for our workers, especially the seniors, but this would also add to the cost factors.",4,736,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00736

We have done well in keeping corporate taxes and higher-tier income taxes low, but there are also many cost levers that have also gone up in recent years which the Government needs to do better to keep in check. My Budget Debate speech touched on the setting up of a Cost Competitiveness Review Committee, as was proposed by the Member, Mr Inderjit Singh. I hope that the Ministry can seriously consider this in an effort to improve our cost competitiveness as a Business Hub and address many Singaporeans' concerns on cost of living and affordability. We need more concrete strategies and initiatives to manage our high-cost environment. More needs to be done to also address public fears that they will not be able to retire comfortably or whether they can still afford to live in Singapore. Thus, it is about time we do a holistic view of all direct and indirect contributions to business and living costs in Singapore. I hope we can take a consultative approach, with inputs from business associations and consumers, and make these findings and recommendations public and have a review panel that is inclusive.",5,737,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00737

2014-03-06-T-006,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"But specific to the retail sector, many have raised concerns that a number of landlords charge a percentage of revenue income, in addition to base rent. This percentage is set based on the ability to access a company's point of sale system to maximise rent charges depending on how successful your business is. This practice dampens entrepreneurship because the entrepreneur is effectively working for the landlord, especially when landlords take the share of revenue without having invested into the business. There is also a lack of transparency on what percentage each retailer is charged, even within the same location. I would like to propose that we establish a more transparent rental benchmark for the retail sector. For such a benchmark to be useful, it should include what various landlords charge, in terms of base rent, plus the percentage range of the revenue income wherever this is practised. What I hope is for businesses to be given a fairer, more transparent view of the rental landscape here in Singapore, and I believe that transparencies should go both ways between retailers and the landlords, and not just one way, as it is today.",7,739,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00739

I am going to reiterate more or less the same points. Rental is today one of the biggest cost items. Rental has risen at rates which no industry has grown over the past decade. JTC offers affordable property for rentals which help the businesses. But with the JTC and other landlords moving their assets to REITs, whose sole motive is to enhance the returns for REIT holders, the increase in rental has been their only objective. With the limited land supply, rents have been soaring, making businesses unviable over the decade. Every business has grown and given almost all or more of their gains from growth to their landlords as rent, literally working for the landlords. I would like to question if it is worthy to emulate the practice of REITs in a land-scare country like ours. Are REITs sustainable? Or should I ask, should businesses be sustainable if REITs are, indeed, a necessity?",1,740,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00740
2014-03-06-T-006,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Another issue is regarding landlords. With no check on unfair practices by landlords, and complete access to tenants' sales by landlords, we are providing the landlords an infinite ability to increase the rents, thereby making the tenants work for the profitability of the landlords only. As an example, food retail space rents have a variable component linked to traffic. With the closing of the Budget Terminal, and the traffic moving to Terminal 2, rents have increased suddenly. Is it fair to equate the Budget Terminal passenger purchasing power with other terminals and seeking higher rentals? Is there a mechanism to rationalise or put a check on what yield a landlord is justified to ask?",2,741,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00741

We have already lost the ability to manage rental costs, having ceded buildings that the Government once controlled to REITS, which now dominate the market. In commercial retail, REITS, with their huge collective hold on the market, can force up prices, sometimes steeply, with each renewal. I call on the Government to look at intervention measures, including having more industrial space of its own, to set desired rental benchmarks and to provide checks on the rental practices of REITs in the malls, as some Members have mentioned earlier.",3,744,2014-03-06-T-006-S-00744

As the reality of curbs on foreign manpower, tight local labour market and rising operational cost sets in, businesses can only look to innovation and increases in productivity for a way out. I would agree with the hon Member Mr Teo Siong Seng about small and micro businesses. These businesses, especially those owned or run by people who tend to be older and have little education, are most squeezed and they are very much in need of help. Many of them work from dawn to dusk and because they had low education, they do not have the free time, the energy and the know-how to transform, and they are also not clear how the Government can help them.

Perhaps, the Ministry could consider measures targeting seniors to raise their awareness about the entrepreneurship option, about available business opportunities, such as those in the silver industries, and to redress the deterrence posed by age-specific factors. For instance, the Government may consider special Medisave top-ups and free ICT training in the first three years of business operation for older entrepreneurs.

More often than not, these customers will fall victim to another scam and end up poorer instead. Some of these errant companies move part of their operations overseas which makes local scrutiny and enforcement difficult.

At the same time, our competitors will not stop innovating and moving up the value chain. If we continue with a business-as-usual mindset, these competitors will overtake us.

And the PIC scheme is not just meant for larger companies. Micro-enterprises qualify for the tax deduction. Only the cash payout option requires businesses to have at least three local employees. So, over 16,000 micro-enterprises have claimed for PIC. And, in fact, micro-enterprises have shown the greatest rate of increase amongst these claimants, increasing by over 40% since 2011.

These micro businesses need to better understand the information so that they can make changes. Most importantly, they must be determined, for determination is required for change to happen. Only then will they have a chance to survive. So, everyone must allow these small rabbits to develop slowly. We want to give these micro businesses a chance to grow and provide them with assistance.

That helps the SMEs and we make sure that it is customised for their needs. For some, it may also mean a change in their process in order to fit into some of these factories.

Entrepreneurs are such that they see opportunities but many of them come in and may not last long, particularly in the F&B and the retail sector. Many of our entrepreneurs try in that area.

It can allow, for example, higher allowances for smaller M&A transactions. It can also cover purchase of operations and businesses of SMEs rather than outright share sales, as some acquirers are wary of the potential liability associated with the acquired businesses.

2014-03-06-T-007,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Thank you, Sir. Singapore embarked on a restructuring path since 2010. Our Deputy Prime Minister rightly called this a multi-year task. Many likened it to a marathon rather than a sprint. Without a doubt, the extension of the PIC schemes was welcomed, but allow me to comment on the take-up rate, the type of firms that benefited, the potential for abuse and the trade-offs between short-term cost-cutting versus long-term innovation. I will end with some suggestions on ways to relook the real measurements of productivity gains.",1,951,2014-03-06-T-007-S-00951
2014-03-06-T-007,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"First, the take-up rate. Surveys done by SBF showed that 89% of respondents were aware of the PIC schemes; 68% used it. That is quite a high figure. Amongst the over 1,000 respondents, the largest part of these claims was on automating processes and staff training, though some companies found the claims onerous and did not use it.",2,952,2014-03-06-T-007-S-00952
2014-03-06-T-007,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Second, size matters. The size of the companies matters. The take-up rate for the PIC for smaller companies is low, compared to bigger ones. In 2012, the take-up rate for companies with a turnover of less than $1 million was 24%, those between $1 million and $10 million was 59%, and those above $100 million was 81%. But it is precisely these smaller companies, with fewer resources, that need the most help.",3,953,2014-03-06-T-007-S-00953
2014-03-06-T-007,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Third, administration of these claims. Some 44,000 SMEs tapped the PIC scheme. That is up 21% year-on-year. Most of these claims were for purchases of IT equipment and since IRAS depended on the checklist approach for some of these claims, these were quite easily approved. But claims for investments in mechanical automation are based on a case-by-case basis. These claims need to be wrapped up by a rather onerous set of information to prove that the new machinery does improve productivity. Some companies have found these claims too onerous and did not use it. One suggestion is to simplify the process, have an independent expert body set up to decide what claims can qualify.",4,954,2014-03-06-T-007-S-00954
2014-03-06-T-007,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Meanwhile, on the flipside, there is some evidence of abuse and cheating relating to inflating and falsification of such claims. IRAS has singled out consultants and vendors as culprits behind these fraudulent claims. One suggestion here is to have a list of accredited consultants, similar to a list maintained by SPRING Singapore, that can help SMEs make these claims in an honest and efficient manner.",5,955,2014-03-06-T-007-S-00955
2014-03-06-T-007,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Businesses also welcome the move to extend deduction on qualifying R&D expenditure for another 10 years. However, we must have some clarity on how many companies and in what sectors have benefited from such schemes. A*STAR's yearly survey reveals that growth in business expenditure on R&D remains low at 1.33% in 2012. IRAS' statistics also showed that such R&D tax claims accounted for less than 3% of such PIC claims last year.",6,956,2014-03-06-T-007-S-00956
2014-03-06-T-007,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Again, the experience of some companies in claiming these benefits has been less than satisfactory. Anecdotal feedback is that the qualification processes of such projects seem to be fairly opaque as are the approval processes. Indeed, it is not easy to verify if a new R&D project has novelty value or can become commercial. It is also difficult to understand fully the technical risks involved.",7,957,2014-03-06-T-007-S-00957
2014-03-06-T-007,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"The outcome is never certain and some may fail, but if we do not try and we do not encourage them to try, we will never know. Hence, in order to encourage some take-up of these R&D schemes, an independent expert body can be set up to evaluate and approve such projects in a timely and efficient manner whilst acknowledging that, in many cases, it will be a bit of a bet. It is important to allow for an environment where decision-makers feel it is okay to make the wrong bets sometimes as long as it is not fraud. After all, when it comes to R&D, we have to make a few mistakes to get to where we want to get to.",8,958,2014-03-06-T-007-S-00958
2014-03-06-T-007,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Fourth, cost-cutting versus game-changing innovation. As most of the PIC claims so far were in training and computer acquisition or replacement, this may not lead to long-term productivity gains the way innovation does. A recent KPMG survey revealed that while 65% of businesses said these schemes did help, many or more than half said measures had no impact on innovation. So, where is the ""I"" or the ""innovation"" agenda in our PIC scheme? The fact is that most SMEs have gone for a low-hanging fruit of just getting help for cost-cutting.",9,959,2014-03-06-T-007-S-00959
2014-03-06-T-007,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"While the good news is that many SMEs are learning to rely less on foreign labour, the bad news is that most of them are not optimistic about growth. According to DP Information, nearly half expect no discernible growth. In another survey by KPMG, local firms were lamenting that the speed of restructuring was too fast. So, the question here is  are businesses still too preoccupied with survivability in the short term to think about long-term growth opportunities? According to SBF, we had the least number of growing companies amongst SMEs last year, and the credit-worthiness of these companies has gone towards the high risk side.",10,960,2014-03-06-T-007-S-00960
2014-03-06-T-007,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"More access to education might help. It is interesting to note that while Singapore as a country is an overall global leader in adopting ICT, business usage of ICT is still weak. In the Network Readiness Index 2013, our lowest score was in the sub-index for business usage, with Singapore doing badly in the indicator for business-consumer Internet use, at number 13 in the world.",11,961,2014-03-06-T-007-S-00961
2014-03-06-T-007,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Here is an insight on why, and I have checked with A*STAR. According to a recent study, one in five Singapore SMEs have no current plans to adopt big data technologies. The big obstacles cited were budget and corporate culture. This tells us smaller firms need a better eco-system. On the cost front, the reality is that tools are available on cloud platforms. However, the analytical tools are not very easy to use unless one is an experienced data scientist. Thus, one solution is to provide SMEs access to a managed service resource where they can lease expertise to use these tools and access common industry insights, thereby removing any upfront costs in investing in such infrastructure.",12,962,2014-03-06-T-007-S-00962
2014-03-06-T-007,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Whilst the Budget's proposal to subsidise broadband subscription will help, business sector-specific infocomm solutions could be even more transformational. Put simply, some SMEs were just not aware of the plethora of good schemes available. For example, 40% said they were not aware of SPRING's intra-industry collaboration schemes to help SMEs grow, nor were they aware of A*STAR's programmes.",13,963,2014-03-06-T-007-S-00963
2014-03-06-T-007,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Lastly, as discussed, perhaps we should look at a better measurement for productivity gains. The headline news we read on productivity gains have not looked promising. According to the Department of Statistics, labour productivity shrank by 2.6% in 2012, but, as we all know, our measurement on productivity, which is defined by value-add of GDP per worker, is subject to global economic cycles and has little to do with efficiency of our workforce. One suggestion is to focus more on Total Factor Productivity. This is the part of output growth not accounted for by an increase in the input of capital or labour. This is where innovation and competitiveness are key. Unfortunately, this figure, too, has been low in Singapore, accounting for only 15.2% of growth here from 2000 to 2010.",14,964,2014-03-06-T-007-S-00964

Here, I think the industry groups could take the lead in developing their own productivity measures, perhaps, with some support from SBF, ACE or SPRING.
