2014-02-18-T-001,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak,asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs what is the Government's position on reports that the Indonesian Navy has named one of its new warships after the two Indonesian marines who were convicted and executed for the bombing of MacDonald House in Singapore in 1965 which killed three persons and wounded at least 33 others.,1,1,2014-02-18-T-001-S-00001
2014-02-18-T-001,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mdm Speaker, with your permission, I will take Question No 1 and then Minister for Defence will take Question No 2, and then we could answer the hon Members' questions.",1,2,2014-02-18-T-001-S-00002
2014-02-18-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Yes, please.",1,3,2014-02-18-T-001-S-00003
2014-02-18-T-001,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Thank you. Mdm Speaker, the hon Members want to know the position taken by Singapore and by Indonesia on this matter over the last two weeks. We have taken a principled stand. We have expressed our concerns directly and clearly to the Indonesian government. We have heard their response. I recently spoke at some length to the Singapore media about why we feel this way and why we take the position we are taking. Allow me to briefly set out the main points.",1,4,2014-02-18-T-001-S-00004
2014-02-18-T-001,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We were surprised and disturbed to learn that the Indonesian Navy was naming a warship after the two marines, Usman and Harun. I was, in fact, in Jakarta when the news came out in the media, and spoke immediately to the Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa to convey our concerns.",2,5,2014-02-18-T-001-S-00005
2014-02-18-T-001,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean and Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen also called and spoke to their Indonesian counterparts. We respectfully requested that Indonesia takes our concerns into account and reconsiders its decision to name the warship Usman Harun. Later, we followed up with a Third Person Note (TPN), which is a formal diplomatic note, to the Indonesian government to register our regret.",3,6,2014-02-18-T-001-S-00006
2014-02-18-T-001,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We asked Indonesia to undertake constructive steps to minimise the damage to our relationship. In particular, we noted that both countries had considered the episode closed in May 1973 when then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew visited Indonesia and scattered flowers on the graves of the two marines. That was a gesture to close a painful chapter in bilateral relationships. The naming of the ship now reopens this issue.",4,7,2014-02-18-T-001-S-00007
2014-02-18-T-001,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Why are we concerned about the naming of the warship? We have to look at what happened in 1965 and what it meant then; and what does the naming of the warship mean to us now. The facts of the MacDonald House bombing are not in dispute. The two Indonesian marines, Usman and Harun, in civilian disguise, planted a bomb in MacDonald House. It was part of a campaign of terror targeted at civilians. This action was quite contrary to international law. The two marines had committed a serious crime. They were tried in the Courts in a fair trial. Their appeal went all the way up to the Privy Council in London and they were found guilty and hanged in 1968.",5,8,2014-02-18-T-001-S-00008
2014-02-18-T-001,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Not many remember that Usman and Harun were not the only Indonesian saboteurs whom we arrested during the Konfrontasi. Two other marines, Stanislaus Krofan and Andres Andea, were caught and sentenced to death for the crime of carrying a bomb which exploded. Indonesia also appealed for their release. We pardoned them, because there were no deaths. In total, 45 Indonesian saboteurs were released and returned to Indonesia. But we could not pardon Usman and Harun because their crime was very serious and civilians had been killed and injured.",6,9,2014-02-18-T-001-S-00009
2014-02-18-T-001,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Not pardoning Usman and Harun was a defining moment for Singapore. Had we agreed to release them, it would have set the precedent for our relationships with all bigger countries. That precedent would be that we will – or we should – do what a bigger country asks and pressures us to do, even when we have been grievously hurt. That is a different concept of sovereignty that is not good for us and which we cannot accept.",7,10,2014-02-18-T-001-S-00010
2014-02-18-T-001,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Indonesians consider Usman and Harun heroes. But for Singaporeans, in particular the victims and their families, their action was criminal, not heroic. We do not quarrel with Indonesia's sovereign right to choose their heroes. But it is quite another thing to name a warship after these two marines. The warship will travel to different places, bringing painful memories wherever it goes. This is something that Singaporeans quite justifiably will find hurtful. I am sure that many Indonesians would feel the same way if they were in our position.",8,11,2014-02-18-T-001-S-00011
2014-02-18-T-001,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa has said that Jakarta takes this issue ""very seriously"" and that there is no ""ill-will"" or ""malice"". We welcome his comments. That is a step in the right direction. I agree fully with Minister Marty's remarks that there is a need for mutual respect between Singapore and Indonesia.",9,12,2014-02-18-T-001-S-00012
2014-02-18-T-001,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As we go forward, it is important for us to know that the marines are not being honoured for killing Singaporeans. It is also important that it is understood and acknowledged that the naming of the ship impacts on Singapore, especially the families of those killed and injured.",10,13,2014-02-18-T-001-S-00013
2014-02-18-T-001,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"A fundamental tenet of our foreign policy is that we deal with other countries – irrespective of size – as sovereign equals, based on mutual respect. Just as Indonesia expects others, including Singapore, to show sensitivity to its concerns, we too expect the same of Indonesia.",11,14,2014-02-18-T-001-S-00014
2014-02-18-T-001,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We see Indonesia as an important partner of Singapore and we value their friendship and support. We have a strong bilateral partnership and also cooperate closely in ASEAN where our interests converge on many issues. We, therefore, hope that it will be possible for us to maintain and strengthen this friendship and cooperation. The naming of the ship has caused an impact. And we have stated what our position is on that issue.",12,15,2014-02-18-T-001-S-00015
2014-02-18-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,asked the Minister for Defence what is the response of the Ministry and SAF to the Indonesian Navy's decision to name one of its new warships after the two Indonesian marines responsible for the bombing of MacDonald House in Singapore in 1965.,1,16,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00016
2014-02-18-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Mdm Speaker, in reply to Question No 2, for MINDEF and the SAF, the Konfrontasi was a violent and wrenching chapter in Singapore's history. The Indonesian armed forces, known as ABRI then, targeted non-military installations and defenceless civilians in Singapore from 1963 to 1965. In all, at least 58 people were killed or injured by the 37 bombs set off. Great suffering was inflicted on the victims and their families. The MacDonald House bomb blast killed three civilians and injured at least 33 more. They still bear the physical and psychological scars of that tragedy to this day. Just take the families of those killed  Elizabeth Choo's six children became orphans, Juliet Goh's parents lost their only child, and Encik Yasin left behind a widow and eight children.",1,17,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00017
2014-02-18-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"The naming of an Indonesian Navy ship after Usman and Harun now, nearly 50 years later, would undo the conciliatory actions from both sides that had lain to rest this dark historical episode. It would, as we have said, reopen old wounds. The Singapore Government was therefore deeply concerned when we received news of the naming and reacted immediately, instinctively.",2,18,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00018
2014-02-18-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Three Ministers, including Deputy Prime Minister Teo, telephoned our counterparts. My counterpart, the Indonesian Defence Minister was in Europe on an official visit and it was 8.00 am there when I called him. I would not have disturbed his trip unless it was an important matter and the Indonesian Defence Minister knew it. I stated the Government's position, and followed up with a written note, so that there would be no misunderstanding about our deep concern. All three Ministers respectfully asked our counterparts, on behalf of the Singapore Government, that Indonesia reconsider the name of the ship. We knew the harm it would cause to bilateral relations.",3,19,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00019
2014-02-18-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"We want good defence ties with Indonesia and have worked hard to develop our friendship and military cooperation. Deputy Prime Minister Teo related to me how he had taken part in the first ever naval exercise with the Indonesians in 1974 – it was called Exercise Eagle – after President Suharto's visit to Singapore. And since then, military-to-military relations have improved considerably. In fact, two years ago, the SAF celebrated the 20th Anniversary of the Indonesia-Singapore Coordinated Patrols to jointly protect the waters of both countries from sea robbery.",4,20,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00020
2014-02-18-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"In times of need, Members will remember that both militaries have also quickly stepped up to help each other. When SilkAir Flight MI185 crashed near Palembang in December 1997, Indonesia spared no effort in the search and rescue operations; when the Indian Ocean tsunami struck Aceh in 2004, the SAF was the first on the ground to assist Indonesia with its largest disaster assistance relief effort ever.",5,21,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00021
2014-02-18-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Such reciprocal support and close cooperation based on mutual respect strengthen defence ties when Indonesia and Singapore treat each other as sovereign equals. With closer ties, the TNI and the SAF have been able to discuss sensitive matters, sometimes behind closed doors, to find amicable solutions that meet each others' concerns. Where there are disagreements, we find ways to put them on hold until conditions improve to settle them. But the naming of the ship came as an utter surprise. MINDEF and the SAF were disappointed and dismayed over this inexplicable move. Even without ill intent, how can the naming of the ship after the two bombers build good ties, or enhance mutual respect and regard with both our countries?",6,22,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00022
2014-02-18-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"On the contrary, a ship named ""Usman Harun"" sailing on the high seas would unearth all the pain and sorrow caused by the MacDonald House bomb blast, which had been buried and put to rest. It would be a bête noire, unleashing resentful feelings and spirits from the past, a constant reminder of the military aggression and atrocious crimes committed by Indonesian marines who killed or irreparably damaged the lives of innocent civilians and their families in Singapore. For Singaporeans, this is the weight of the dark history of Konfrontasi – of lives tragically cut short in vain, the suffering and blighted futures of hapless victims – that this ship will always carry with her.",7,23,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00023
2014-02-18-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Singapore will not allow this military ship named ""Usman Harun"" to call at our ports and naval bases. It would not be possible for the SAF, as protectors of this nation, to sail alongside or exercise with this ship.",8,24,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00024
2014-02-18-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"As Deputy Prime Minister Teo, Minister for Foreign Affairs and I have said to our counterparts, the naming of the ship will have consequences on bilateral relations. Already suspicions and resentments have heightened on both sides, setting back many decades of relationship building in defence ties.",9,25,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00025
2014-02-18-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"We want good bilateral defence ties and close military-to-military relationships with Indonesia. But strong defence ties can only be built on mutual trust and respect, expressed through appropriate acts that underscore friendship and amity.",10,26,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00026
2014-02-18-T-002,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Nee Soon),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank both Ministers for the reply. I have one supplementary question for the Foreign Minister. There have been reports to say they are going to put up statues now of the two ""heros"" in the nearby island, next to Singapore. The question now is what can we do to prevent further of such occurrences? What other confidence-building measures can we engage at the government-to-government level in order to prevent such things from happening? The decision to name this ship  who decided at which level to name the ship ultimately? Do we know that?",1,27,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00027
2014-02-18-T-002,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I thank the hon Member for the question. There are some press reports about potentially some statues being put up but they remain as press reports. From our perspective, the question is this  looking at some of the comments that have come up from Indonesia – where they have said there is no ill will, there is no malice – it almost appears there is no reason to think otherwise. They had proceeded without really considering the impact on Singapore or how Singapore might view it. The fact that we have now registered our point, we have taken it up, we have said exactly how we felt, we have issued a Third Person Note, their Defence Minister has outlined what is and is not doable with the Indonesian Navy in the context of this ship, I think we have made it crystal clear where we stand, and that is achieved. The objective of making sure that it is at least in the consciousness of Indonesia that there is a certain mutuality to that relationship. Our responses have been calibrated. We take it one step at a time. We wait to see what happens as regards to the statues.",1,28,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00028
2014-02-18-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Speaker, I thank both Ministers for their replies and I will have supplementary questions for both Ministers. I will start with the Minister for Defence. The ""inexplicable move"", as the Minister has put it, rubs salt into old wounds as it was a painful past for Singaporeans. My heart goes out to the families of the victims who have to relive history again today and each time the warship goes out to open seas. Does the SAF see this as a renewed threat, especially when there are parties who are fully supportive of this act and this shows a more nationalistic and militaristic front of Indonesia? Is the SAF also concerned that the warship could be made into a certain national symbol each time there is disagreement, conflict or difference in positions between our two countries?",1,29,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00029
2014-02-18-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),I also believe that mutual peace and prosperity should be the way forward for both countries. What plans do the Ministry and the SAF have to find common ground with the Indonesian military and government to come to a position that is a compromise and how we can put this episode behind us?,2,30,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00030
2014-02-18-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"For the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I see a future trend looming as our larger neighbours prosper, they may take a more nationalistic or an abang-adik view to Singapore as well. Singapore's rational diplomatic position and our value to trade in this region also make us a very nice guy. When Minister Marty says, ""We have no ill intent"" —",3,31,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00031
2014-02-18-T-002,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Mr Zaqy, can you put your questions forth?",1,32,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00032
2014-02-18-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"In the Minister's view, how is MFA prepared to deal with such tests, or potential provocations from bigger countries willing to test Singapore as a young and small nation?",1,33,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00033
2014-02-18-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mdm Speaker, the SAF and MINDEF will not over-read or jump at shadows from this act. We have stated our view very clearly. I do not want to add to that. As to how we can move forward, this has happened and I think the task before us, as I said, we want good bilateral military relations and we have to take it from there and to rebuild mutual regard, mutual respect that we have taken 40 years to reach. It has set us back. And I would say that, over the next period, we will see what we can do to rebuild the ties. But it also depends on what both parties do.",1,34,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00034
2014-02-18-T-002,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. The point about bigger and smaller countries is never going to change for us. It is not a new issue. It was always there from the time we became independent. The size of others was used as a bargaining chip with us. We withstood that. In international relations and international diplomatic exchanges, the weight and the might of the participants are usually the most important factor.",1,35,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00035
2014-02-18-T-002,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"We have been able to hold our own, punch well above our weight simply because we have been faster, skilful and successful. If we were not successful, we would not be having this debate here.",2,36,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00036
2014-02-18-T-002,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As we go forward, we must fully expect that others will progress, will indeed seek to move us and move our policies towards their direction. It is not just the region. It is beyond the region. Everyone. And to deal with that, we need to look at it at three levels. One, at the core, our defence has to be top rate. If we cannot protect ourselves, nothing else matters. Two, beyond that, we need to make sure that our regional relationships, both bilaterally as well as multilaterally through organisations like ASEAN, are strong so that we can deal with issues, diplomatically, bilaterally as well as through regional platforms which help move everyone along. Three, at the larger level, we do need, therefore, a very strong network of international partners beyond the region. We have to be successful economically, socially, in defence, all of it. That is the requirement for Singapore to survive.",3,37,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00037
2014-02-18-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the two Ministers for their response. We can all agree that the robustness of our response to the Indonesians is important. I have two supplementary questions for the Minister for Defence.",1,38,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00038
2014-02-18-T-002,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"First, I would like to ask whether the withdrawal of our formal invitation to the TNI-AL chief to our Air Show has any significant impact on our relations as well as on the Air Show itself. Secondly, the Minister has spoken about our stance on bilateral military exercises. However, our two navies are involved in a significant number of multilateral exercises, such as Exercise CARAT, and our ADMM-Plus arrangements. If the TNI-AL should send this warship to these multilateral exercises, what would be our stance?",2,39,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00039
2014-02-18-T-002,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Mdm Speaker, I do not propose to go into a litany of what we are going to do and what we have done or what we are not going to do. I do not think that is productive. We have stated our concerns. I would suggest that it is more productive to focus on what and why we are deeply concerned about the naming of the ship, what it meant to us. I have stated explicitly in terms of not allowing the ship to enter our port and that SAF would not be associated with or exercise with the ship. I think that is abundantly clear. I do not choose to add to that.",1,40,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00040
2014-02-18-T-002,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Madam, I welcome the Government's position on this matter. I think it is important for us to state our position clearly. I would just like to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether the Government actually accepts the Indonesian government's explanation that the marines are not being honoured for killing Singaporeans. I do not see how these marines would have had been accorded such honours had they not been hanged for their acts in Singapore. So, I would appreciate the Minister's clarification.",1,41,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00041
2014-02-18-T-002,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"I think what the Indonesian government, through its Foreign Minister, has said is that there was no ill will or malice. I do not think there has been an expressed statement in terms that they are not being honoured for killing Singaporeans.",1,42,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00042
2014-02-18-T-002,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),"Madam, I welcome the Government's strong stand on this matter. There have been some who said that the episode is being drummed up at this time because of elections in Indonesia, with politicians finding it to their favour to gain popularity through nationalistic sentiments. Can I ask the Minister whether he agrees with this point of view and whether Singapore should stand firm against being used as a convenient election tool just to satisfy domestic gains?",1,43,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00043
2014-02-18-T-002,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines),"My second question has to do with the abang-adik relationship that seems to be recurrent in the relationship between Indonesia and Singapore. Can I ask the Minister whether he agrees that the KRI Usman Harun episode is yet another reminder of the mindset of Indonesia towards Singapore, seeing itself as the big brother in this abang-adik relationship, rather than one where neighbouring states are viewed as equal sovereign entities where sensitivity is a two-way street?",2,44,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00044

2014-02-18-T-002,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"As regards the first question on whether the naming was a calculated act of internal politics, I think we have to take the Foreign Minister of Indonesia at his word that there was no ill will and there was no malice, which means that it was a decision taken at a professional level. What it also makes clear is that there was not enough consideration or perhaps even a substantial degree of thought given to how Singapore might perceive it, and therein lies the rub. So, I would not want to speculate on whether there were broader reasons. I will take the Foreign Minister at his word, as to what he has said.",2,46,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00046
2014-02-18-T-002,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"On the Member's second question whether it is an abang-adik relationship  without characterising it in those terms, I think it is not just in this region, in every part of the world, an inalienable fact of international diplomatic relationships is that every country will use every advantage it has to pursue its interests. And obviously, their size, economic weight, military might, all of these are factors that are often used in negotiations and discussions.",3,47,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00047
2014-02-18-T-002,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"By definition, we will always be at a disadvantage because of size. And we have overcome that disadvantage. What the episode shows in this particular instance is that since 1973/1974, as the Minister for Defence pointed out, we have built a very strong relationship with Indonesia at various levels, including the military-to-military relationship, and we have helped each other on many occasions. A strong bond and mutual trust have been built up. What this episode has shown is that, nevertheless, there was not, at the minimum, due consideration for how we might feel. As Singaporeans, we have to remember that and note that.",4,48,2014-02-18-T-002-S-00048

2014-02-18-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Singapore Sports School (SSP) has largely succeeded in its aim of combining an excellent sports programme with a quality academic education. Within a decade, the school has produced several Olympians and world champions. At the recent Southeast Asian Games in Myanmar, SSP student-athletes and alumni accounted for almost half of Team Singapore's gold medal haul, or 15 out of 34 gold medals. The school has also done well in supporting the academic needs of its student-athletes.

2014-02-18-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"This could mean, for example, a more flexible curriculum for those with the potential to excel at the international level. As it is – and Members would be aware of this – the Sports School has already been piloting a customised academic curriculum which wraps around the student-athlete's training schedule, or what is known as the School-Within-a-School (SWS) programme. The review will examine how we can further enhance this programme, and also explore partnerships with more tertiary institutions, including local and overseas Universities, to extend and expand the range of through-train programmes, as suggested by Er Dr Lee.",4,56,2014-02-18-T-003-S-00056
2014-02-18-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We are mindful that the needs of the different sports are different. So, rather than taking a one-size-fits-all approach, the review will consider how the sports and academic programmes can be better customised to each sport. We will also see how the Sports School can partner more effectively with the National Sports Associations (NSA), the Junior Sports Academies which MOE runs, and the Singapore Sports Institute (SSI) to attract top-tier student-athletes in each field, and provide them with an attractive pathway to pursue their sporting aspirations.",5,57,2014-02-18-T-003-S-00057

Is there an intention to specify minimum PSLE score? Because it is quite unfair to other students as well because they take in players without specifying their PSLE scores so long as they are good in games.",2,59,2014-02-18-T-003-S-00059
2014-02-18-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the first question  indeed, the direction of the review is to look at, as I said earlier, how we can customise the curriculum better for talented student-athletes. For that particular group of athletes with the potential, the ability to excel at the international level, and also the commitment to do so, our sense at this stage is that we can have a better balance between sports and academics and, in particular, give a bit more weightage to the sports. So, lighten their academic curriculum so that they can focus on their training but we still need to assure them of quality education so that they can progress to the next level. That is the intent.",1,60,2014-02-18-T-003-S-00060
2014-02-18-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We are studying other international models and we are looking at what we can do in terms of tying up through-train programmes so that when these student-athletes complete their education with the Sports School, they have assurance of a good education and also assurance to progress to the next level. So, indeed, that is what we are doing for the SWS programme.",2,61,2014-02-18-T-003-S-00061
2014-02-18-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the second question  that merits a completely separate Parliamentary Question (PQ) in its own right. Whether or not we are going to review DSA admissions is something that will also require MOE's inputs. I would not be in a position to answer this today. I know where the Member is coming from in terms of DSA admissions with schools. It is something that MCCY has noted and we will continue to look at this with MOE. If the Member would like to file a separate question, we can address that separately.",3,62,2014-02-18-T-003-S-00062
2014-02-18-T-003,Nicholas Fang,Mr Nicholas Fang (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, one supplementary question for the Acting Minister. Having travelled and trained in a variety of sports institutions around the world, this concept of trying to balance academics and sport is something that Singaporeans hold very dear. It seems to be ethos of the Sports School. Would we ever come to a stage and acknowledge the fact that at the top level of global sport now, it is almost impossible to reach Olympic champions level, trying to balance academics in sport the way that we try to do in Singapore?",1,63,2014-02-18-T-003-S-00063

That is exactly the motivation behind the review that we are doing.",1,64,2014-02-18-T-003-S-00064
2014-02-18-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I would caution going the other extreme which some countries have done, which is to hothouse students from a very early age and focus only on sports training without any education. I think actually it ends up to the detriment of the student especially for the very many who are unable to excel at that level and the attrition rate is significant. Many end up with not very much of a sound education to fall back on, and they have difficulties finding a good job and progressing on in their careers.",2,65,2014-02-18-T-003-S-00065
2014-02-18-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"I note that the balance being asked for in terms of trying to skew a bit more towards sports, but I know parents have also voiced concern that if they send their kids to the non-sports schools, for example, would they get disadvantaged. Would MCCY take into consideration the principle that kids should also have a choice?",1,66,2014-02-18-T-003-S-00066
2014-02-18-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Firstly, the parents and the students have a choice. We would have a diversity of options for them to choose from, whether or not they want to do more and focus more intensively in sports training, or they want a more balanced approach. Secondly, I would say even for the Sports School, as we do this curriculum, we are also mindful of thinking about how the Sports School can extend beyond what it is doing with its own students and reach out to students from other schools who have the potential to excel and to be part of the Juniors National Team or to be part of the National Team, to see how that training can extend to them. In that sense, while the review is for the Sports School, we are also looking beyond the Sports School.",1,67,2014-02-18-T-003-S-00067
2014-02-18-T-003,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Madam, while I welcome the partnership between NSAs and the Singapore Sports School, I hope the Acting Minister can give the assurance that for athletes who choose not to go to the Sports School, the National Sports Associations will not discriminate against them. If we go on the basis that ""Oh, you can't train so many hours"", I think that is very unfair. We should look at the performance and I think that is all that matters because after all, we are a meritocratic society.",1,68,2014-02-18-T-003-S-00068
2014-02-18-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Again, we are deviating quite a bit from the original question of what the Sports School review is supposed to be. This is a matter of selection of athletes which is the purview of National Sports Associations (NSAs) and the SNOC, and these are people-based organisations.

It provides an invaluable opportunity for arts groups to partner with MDA to contribute towards an arts scene that is both vibrant and socially responsible.",5,112,2014-02-18-T-007-S-00112

2014-02-18-T-007,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Ms Koh also asked about the challenges to implementing the TLS and the revised ACF. We envisage that term licensees and their content assessors will need time to familiarise themselves to self-classifying their performance using the ACF. Therefore, in addition to the training which MDA will be providing to all content assessors, MDA will be conducting a pilot of the scheme in the second quarter of 2014 to test the processes and allow arts groups to clarify issues before it is formally launched.",7,114,2014-02-18-T-007-S-00114

2014-02-18-T-007,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Minister. I just have two sets of supplementary questions. The first is  classifying content, even with a set of recommended guidelines, relies on some degree of subjective judgement. How does MDA intend to deal with disagreements with an arts group on the appropriate rating for a show? And in the spirit of co-regulation, will the arts groups be given a wider berth to make those judgement calls since they would be the ones who know their audience best?",1,116,2014-02-18-T-007-S-00116
2014-02-18-T-007,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Secondly, in the event of adverse feedback or a complaint from the public, how will MDA assess whether or not a complaint is warranted and assess whether or not there has actually been a breach in guidelines? What will be the punitive measures and will there be an appeals process or recourse for the arts group in the event there is a difference in opinion?",2,117,2014-02-18-T-007-S-00117
2014-02-18-T-007,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,I thank the Member for those very important questions because these are the sort of questions that I am sure the arts groups are also thinking about.,1,118,2014-02-18-T-007-S-00118

2014-02-18-T-007,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Even after we have formally launched the scheme, our doors are not closed. Both the term licensees and the content assessors can continue to consult MDA if they are not confident about classifying their performances. The most important thing is that when there is disagreement over misclassification or wrong classification, I think we will be reasonable and fair in assessing that decision, because, at the end of the day, we want to allow the industry to move forward rather than to hold it back. So, I will give the assurance to the Member that we will be flexible and understand the context by which the misclassification took place.",4,121,2014-02-18-T-007-S-00121

As the Member knows, we have the consultative panel that we can fall back on. In any of the performances that we have come across whereby there could be differences of opinion, we consult widely. We are prepared to even consult the arts group because they may have a different point of view. But, finally, we have to make the decision as to whether or not misclassification has taken place or not, and what are the measures that we have to put in place.",5,122,2014-02-18-T-007-S-00122

Within the Bill, there will be discussions about what sort of punitive measures are being considered. It is not the intention of MDA to try and penalise every arts group out there. But, as I mentioned in my reply, we want the arts groups to work together with us to ensure a vibrant arts scene, yet at the same time meeting the societal norms and standards. We have to be socially responsible because, at the end of the day, we want to ensure that parents feel comfortable that their children of whatever age, when they attend a performance, the classification that we have given, or given by the arts group, meets the contents standards and the societal norms that we see prevailing in our society.",6,123,2014-02-18-T-007-S-00123

First of all, I would like to clarify that I support the DSA scheme in general because it provides the students with more options to choose a Secondary school without the PSLE scores. However, I am concerned about the DSA scheme. One of the concerns that I have is that it has unintended consequences. For example, some top schools not only manage to pick and choose the top students with the best academic results, these schools also manage to absorb students who excel in the area of sports but are less academically inclined, as revealed by the Minister of State. Ten percent of them have 30 points below the cut-off points. Perhaps these students could be better absorbed by the Sports School as they have this unique programme to develop both their academic as well as their sport talents. In my view, could MOE review whether some of the top schools could stop accepting sport students with PSLE scores 15 points below the cut-off points of the respective schools?",1,139,2014-02-18-T-009-S-00139

Also, efforts are also made to support students throughout their journey in school to ensure that they are able to cope in the school and that they are able to learn.

This is in part due to the fact that the economy is relatively healthy. We are generating many jobs and opportunities. In fact, we are generating more than there are Singaporean job seekers. Among local PMETs, the non-seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was even lower at 2.6% in June 2013. Foreign manpower will continue to complement and augment our local workers because our economy plays a regional and global role. As a result of that, companies do invest and come to Singapore. Local companies continue to remain here and thrive and, in turn, they all create opportunities and jobs for our people. The Government's aim is to help Singaporeans have access to these opportunities. Part of it is to make sure that Singaporeans are also job ready and competitive so that they are able to take on the jobs that our economy creates. We also expect firms to consider Singaporean citizens fairly and objectively for PMET jobs. But it is ultimately the decision of employers to determine the best candidate for the job based on their evaluation of the applicants' credentials and experience. I think it is neither practical nor desirable for MOM to monitor or intervene in companies' hiring decisions, unless there have been discriminatory practices.",1,151,2014-02-18-T-010-S-00151

First, we have to discourage firms from systematically favouring foreign PMETs based on cost reasons. This is addressed by our foreign worker framework.

These are done through the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF). With effect from August this year, employers who submit new EP applications will be required to first advertise the job vacancy on the new jobs bank administered by the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) for at least 14 days.

Or it may also be due to internal restructuring where functions the locals are in are moved offshore leading to retrenchment, and new functions are added where there are not enough experienced locals.

The considerations then against raising employer contributions were to keep our wage costs competitive, and importantly, because we will price ourselves out of the competition. The considerations remain valid today.",1,164,2014-02-18-T-012-S-00164
2014-02-18-T-012,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Ensuring retirement adequacy is important, especially as Singaporeans require more savings for retirement and healthcare because, obviously, we are living for a longer period of time. Raising overall CPF contribution rates further beyond the current 36% will make a difference and would certainly be one way of providing that adequacy. But, importantly, I think we also need to understand what that impact would be when we raise the contribution rate. It will have an impact on business costs and, importantly, a knock-on effect on employment opportunities. It is really about balancing the tensions between these two conflicting requirements.",2,165,2014-02-18-T-012-S-00165
2014-02-18-T-012,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Further increases in our CPF contribution rates will have to be carefully considered, together with our tripartite partners, and we need to do it in a calibrated and gradual manner – both wanting to address retirement adequacy, which is a valid concern, but at the same time, to make sure that employment opportunities are not denied as a result of the decreased competitive nature of our businesses.",3,166,2014-02-18-T-012-S-00166
2014-02-18-T-012,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Other than raising CPF contributions, there are different ways that we can address the issue of retirement adequacy. For example, in recent years, we have helped CPF members grow their savings. Since 2008, an extra interest of 1% is paid on the first $60,000 of a member's combined CPF balances. Workers earning lower incomes also enjoy a boost to their CPF savings via Workfare. We have also gradually been increasing the contribution rates for older workers, which are currently set below the 36% rate for workers aged 50 and below, while bearing in mind the need to maintain their employability. Again, it is the issue of employability that is at stake – we balance that off with increases in CPF contributions. The Government also makes top-ups to members' CPF accounts from time to time. We are continuing to explore with MOF other ways to enhance the system while at the same time keeping it sustainable.",4,167,2014-02-18-T-012-S-00167
2014-02-18-T-012,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Lastly, I would add that as we live longer, one of the issues at hand that we need to address is the ability of Singaporeans to continue to work longer if they choose to and if they need to. This is where we also need to bear in mind how we facilitate that because as we continue to work, that would also add to our CPF contributions and also would help our retirement adequacy. So, addressing retirement adequacy spans across a few different approaches, of which raising contribution rates is one.",5,168,2014-02-18-T-012-S-00168
2014-02-18-T-012,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,"Mdm Speaker, I do not think there is ever a good time to raise employer's CPF contribution rates. I would like to ask the Minister whether he would consider an incremental – bit by bit – increase. The alternative, perhaps, is to manage expectations by saying that we are never going to increase the employer's contribution rates. I think it has been quite a while since the rates were equalised. While I agree that there are other ways to provide for our retirement adequacy, I think the Minister would agree that it is the CPF contributions from both the employee and the employer who are the main contributors.",1,169,2014-02-18-T-012-S-00169
2014-02-18-T-012,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mdm Speaker, as employees, all of us, prefer to have a higher employer's contribution. That goes without question. But the issue at hand really is not about that part alone. It is about the impact on business costs. Again, it is not just concern about business costs but the knock-on impact on employability.",1,170,2014-02-18-T-012-S-00170
2014-02-18-T-012,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The considerations, as raised by then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, remain valid today. We need to watch our competitive advantage. That is something that was of concern then. It remains a concern now. If anything, I think the competition has become more acute, especially with globalisation. The world has become a lot smaller. Competition is right at the door step even though it may not physically be so. We do need to watch that.",2,171,2014-02-18-T-012-S-00171
2014-02-18-T-012,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"As explained, I think we will continue to review how we should look at the CPF contribution rates but, importantly, it is to look at retirement adequacy as a whole entity. Some of the measures highlighted earlier are areas that we can look at to improve to make sure that retirement adequacy is to be addressed in other ways as well. Addressing it purely by raising employer's contribution to CPF is one way but it has a very real impact on employability which is a big concern of ours as well.",3,172,2014-02-18-T-012-S-00172

The first is  is the Minister able to give an estimated spending each year on promoting and profiling our arts and cultural assets overseas?

Is there room to consider establishing a cultural secretariat in certain key cultural capitals like Tokyo, New York, Shanghai and London, for instance?",1,185,2014-02-18-T-014-S-00185

We will work with the ambassador and the mission overseas to think about how they can best utilise or make use of the opportunity of having Singaporean artists showcase their works in that country, how the ambassador and his team can then make use of that opportunity to also project Singapore and to make use of that opportunity to extend our cultural diplomacy efforts.

For example, a range of enforcement actions, from fines to suspension or revocation of licence, can be taken against a business that has a valid liquor licence but violates its conditions. Yet, a commensurate range of enforcement powers is not available, under the Customs Act, for actions against an errant business which sells alcohol without a valid liquor licence.

2014-02-18-T-015,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mdm Speaker, the 8 December riot was a rude shock for all Singaporeans. We never imagined witnessing acts of violence and destruction we usually watch or read about happening in other countries. It was a timely reminder that we are not immune from, and cannot be complacent about, such matters.",1,248,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00248
2014-02-18-T-015,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"But, as Deputy Prime Minister Teo said in his Ministerial Statement last month, the incident is also noteworthy for what did not happen. No shots were fired, no one was killed or even seriously injured on account of the riot itself. And while a small minority of the foreign workers involved clearly broke the law, we have seen videos, pictures and heard accounts of some who helped people to safety and tried to restore calm. But all that was not by design. It could so easily have been far, far worse. And if there had been large numbers of casualties, if Singaporeans had been killed, if properties and homes were damaged, I wonder if those objecting to this Bill would be so enthusiastic.",2,249,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00249
2014-02-18-T-015,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The real question is where do we go from here. This Bill gives the Police a wider array of powers so that they can calibrate their responses to different situations. Some charged that this Bill is an over-reaction and premature, and that we should first wait for the findings of the COI. However, that process may take some months. And more importantly, if the incident has identified gaps in our legislative framework to prevent and more effectively deal with such risks, then it would be wrong and irresponsible of us not to act now. Nonetheless, I hope the Minister will confirm that the legislation will be reviewed when the COI releases its findings and, if necessary, amend it. And this would ensure that the measures that this House ultimately enacts will be effective and deal with the real, as opposed to perceived, risks.",3,250,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00250
2014-02-18-T-015,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"But having said that, I wish to make a few points about the Bill. First, it is important that we avoid speculating on the causes of the riot, as it risks us training our scopes on the wrong issues. The COI has been convened to look into the incident, including what caused it and provide recommendations. Hence, may I ask the Minister for the rationale behind the significant emphasis of this Bill on alcohol consumption in the subject area? Clauses making expressed reference to alcohol consumption include clause 3, and this appears to pre-determine that alcohol consumption was the main cause of the riot.",4,251,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00251
2014-02-18-T-015,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mdm Speaker, while it is indeed possible that alcohol consumption had a role to play in the rapid escalation of events, as well as the behaviour of the crowd, we should wait for the findings of the COI before passing judgement. I accept the necessity for decisive steps to be taken now to safeguard the peace, but I think the language of the Bill could have been more neutral.",5,252,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00252
2014-02-18-T-015,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Second, some will express discomfort with the significant discretionary powers this Bill gives our Police officers. But as the Minister has explained, these powers are not unprecedented. And I think it is an easy criticism to make of the Bill. It is telling that no one, at least to my knowledge, has been able to offer a viable and practical alternative. And the reason is simple. Police officers on the ground will encounter a variety of circumstances and situations, and it is impossible to legislate what they should or should not do in any given situation. They have to be given discretion so that they can properly carry out their duties to preserve public order. And if they abuse those powers, they should be taken to task.",6,253,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00253
2014-02-18-T-015,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Nonetheless, the Bill can and should ensure that with such wide discretionary powers, there must be a commensurate level of oversight and supervision. In this regard, the Bill does state that the discretion conferred is not unfettered – standards, such as a reasonable level of suspicion, have to be met before measures like search and seizure can be carried out. Moreover, it is important to note that judicial review is available. And even though clauses 5(6) and 13(8) express finality against appeal, the option of judicial review is not precluded.",7,254,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00254
2014-02-18-T-015,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Likewise, clause 19(3) grants the authorities immunity, but only when acting with good faith and reasonable care when exercising their powers under the Bill. Again, some may argue this is being overly generous to the Police, but again, what is the alternative? That the Police can be sued even if they acted in good faith and reasonably? How are they expected to do their jobs?",8,255,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00255
2014-02-18-T-015,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"But there are important things we can and I think we should do outside this Bill. And as part of its oversight, I urge the Ministry to look carefully at implementation issues. Giving officers discretion is clearly necessary. However, in matters like these, a good outcome will depend on a sensible exercise of that discretion. For that, there is no substitute for experience, good judgment and temperament. It is vital that we deploy experienced Police officers in the subject area. They will, in the main, be dealing with persons from different countries of different cultures, who may have limited understanding of English and, more importantly, with different perceptions of law enforcement, based on experiences in their home countries. A cool, experienced officer, who is able to communicate effectively, will be more effective in defusing a situation than well crafted pieces of legislation. I would like to ask the Minister what assurances we have that experienced and properly trained officers will be deployed in the designated zones. Furthermore, as auxiliary police officers are given the same powers under the Bill, I would like to ask the Minister if there are adequate steps to ensure that these officers from external sources are properly qualified and trained to wield these additional powers.",9,256,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00256
2014-02-18-T-015,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I have two further specific queries. First, clause 3(2)(b) provides that the Minister may ""declare as part of a special zone, any additional area in Singapore that is adjacent to any area described in the Schedule"". An incremental approach in widening the boundaries of the special zone has merits. However, should incidents arise in areas separate from, and not adjacent to, the proposed special zone, what recourse would the Minister have to deal with those situations? And is there a need to pass further legislation?",10,257,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00257
2014-02-18-T-015,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Second, clause 1(2) provides that this Bill, if passed, would continue in force until the end of 12 months after its commencement. It does not expressly provide for any renewal mechanism. Could the Minister clarify whether this Bill, if passed, will require the approval of the House at the end of 12 months for renewal?",11,258,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00258
2014-02-18-T-015,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Finally, just one other argument I have read. It has been argued outside this House that this Bill is discriminatory towards the communities living in the gazetted zone. I find that surprising but, on that issue, I look forward to hearing from my colleague, Ms Denise Phua, on the concerns of her residents, and she, no doubt, could have spoken to them. And those views are certainly important and should be given some weight. With that, Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.",12,259,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00259

Some of the more infamous ones, which I think we will all remember, were the riots in England in August 2011, the Gujarat riots in 2002 where many Hindus and Muslims were killed, and even further back, the Chicago riots in 1968, sparked by the assassination of Martin Luther King Junior. These riots were similar in that they caused either significant damages to properties or loss of lives.",10,269,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00269
2014-02-18-T-015,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),"The invocation of the memories of these riots here is deliberate. It is perhaps easy to say that the England riots of 2011 were caused by the shooting of Mark Duggan, a local who was shot dead by the Police two days prior to the start of the riots; that the Gujarat riots were because of the Godhra Train Incident and that the killing of Martin Luther King started the Chicago riots. Yet, as any study of the riots will tell you, these were just triggers. There were underlying causes which would have contributed to the outbreak of violence, be it socio-economic, marginalisation or underlying tensions. Perhaps, it is prescient that Martin Luther King Junior spoke about rioting just a month before his assassination. And I quote him here",11,270,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00270

On this note, I would like to ask the Minister on the measures taken to look into the welfare of these foreign workers and the provision of recreational facilities for them, besides their living conditions in their dormitories.

However, it is always a fine line when we ask if the provision of services follows the congregation of people or vice versa. For me, I would believe that these grow hand-in-hand, and that services grow alongside the growth in population. Thus, Little India has become busier and busier, and we see the evolution of more and more types of services to cater to the needs of these workers.",15,274,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00274

On the other hand, there is skepticism on the enactment of this Bill as it is being perceived as draconian and disproportionate, curtailing the basic privileges and rights of citizens and non-citizens. The timing of the Bill, before the conclusion of the COI and criminal proceedings, has also been questioned as being presumptive and reactive.

What then is going to stop foreign workers from congregating at other areas and consuming alcohol there? There are also other areas where foreign workers congregate in large numbers, for instance, the Thais at Golden Mile and the Burmese at Peninsula Plaza.

2014-02-18-T-015,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),"At the same time, while we turn our attention to these foreign workers, let us remember that business owners and the provision of services have also been hard hit by the riot and the subsequent measures, especially those small businesses that depend on the sale of alcohol. These are small businesses, owned by Singaporeans who are just making their livelihood. I would thus like to ask the Minister if the impact on business in Little India is being monitored and, if so, are there measures being taken to help these small businesses.",20,279,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00279

My concern is that with so much discretionary powers conferred on Police officers, some of them who can be relatively junior and inexperienced, even if he is above the rank of sergeant, how will the officer be adequately trained to ascertain that an offence is likely to be committed? What measures will be put in place to ensure that our officers will not be put in a difficult situation to exercise reasonable judgement and that over-zealous officers will not abuse the power vested on them?",21,280,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00280

2014-02-18-T-015,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West),"Mdm Speaker, I speak with concern because my constituency in Sengkang West is in close proximity to foreign worker dormitories along Jalan Kayu. I have received much feedback from residents that they have witnessed many foreign workers sitting in void decks and along the pavements, drinking beer and ""staring"" at passers-by. Some of my residents expressed concerns and worry over the safety of their family members, especially in the night when they return home from work and need to walk along the quiet streets back to their flat. While I have no objection to foreign workers visiting the nearby shops and making use of amenities in the estate, I am concerned about the effect of alcohol intoxication on the human faculty and behaviour, especially in public areas, such as streets, parks and HDB void decks.",23,282,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00282

There have been numerous recorded events of riots associated with drinking in public in many countries, many resulting in massive damage to properties and loss of innocent lives. Countries that prohibit drinking in public places include Australia, Canada, Finland, Hungary, Norway, Poland, Russia, Spain and the United States.

POPA provides that if, in the opinion of the Minister charged with the responsibility for internal security, public order in any area in Singapore is seriously disturbed or is seriously threatened and he considers it to be necessary for the purpose of maintaining or restoring public order in that area to do so, the Minister may proclaim the existence in that area of a state of danger to public order.",8,293,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00293

Hence, there is a need for this Bill. Save for the curfew and some other provisions, however, this Bill has incorporated most of the hard-hitting provisions of POPA.

It appears that the series of measures implemented to restore calm and maintain public order in Little India are working.

Madam, the Minister has explained that this Bill is scoped more tightly compared to POPA's ""wide-ranging powers"" to deal more effectively with the local issues within Little India.

For example, clause 12 provides for the police to stop, enter, search, remove any vehicle, vessel or aircraft whether or not it is within the special zone of Little India. Vehicles in and outside of the special zone I can understand, but vessels and aircraft? This wholesale porting of powers over from POPA strikes me as manifesting the Government's abiding desire to retain emergency-type laws and powers when we are far from experiencing an emergency situation.

I am prepared for such powers to be given to a police officer if he reasonably suspects an offence has been or is being committed. However, to exercise such powers without a warrant and, particularly, on the suspicion that an offence is likely to be committed, strikes me as affording too much discretion and pre-emptive power to the Police. Additionally, clause 12(2)(a) provides for search and seizure powers to be exercised ""on a random basis"" for the detection of an offence. This strikes me as being incompatible with reasonable suspicion. This might give licence to the Police to engage in fishing expeditions.",19,304,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00304

It can be stripped to its bare essentials, primarily providing ancillary support for the maintenance of law and order such as those in clauses 18 and 19 on the Liquor Licensing Board's powers during the freeze period, and clause 20 for the swift cancellation or suspension of any business licence of a licensee who commits or is reasonably suspected of contravening the law.",46,331,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00331
2014-02-18-T-015,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),But this Bill is designed for much more than that and will be implemented as a substantial law. It will be the primary legal tool for the special zone of Little India during the freeze period. I regard the Bill as a coercive tool that is not justified by the circumstances. It is hard to quarrel with the individual provisions of the Bill given that the priority is to maintain law and order.,47,332,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00332
2014-02-18-T-015,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"However, they are not stand-alone provisions, and when the provisions are collectively considered, which this House must, then a different narrative is played out. When it comes into force, this Bill will probably pass muster any legal challenge to its constitutionality. But it is a loaded legislation; it carries far too many connotations. And we must be very careful of the unintended consequences that this Bill elicits. Mdm Speaker, for the above reasons, I do not support the Bill.",48,333,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00333
2014-02-18-T-015,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak on this Bill, which I believe is in response to an unfortunate incident in Singapore's short history.",1,334,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00334
2014-02-18-T-015,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"The riot that took place last December came as a shock to all of us, and elicited all sorts of responses from Singaporeans – from empathy to rage. The response from Government leaders, authorities and workers' groups was extremely important and necessary to calm down the situation and emotions. In this respect, I wish to commend the initial measures taken in Little India to ensure that the matter did not escalate or spill over to the days after.",2,335,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00335
2014-02-18-T-015,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"The Public Order (Preservation) Act or POPA rolled out then alongside the ban on alcohol sales and consumption in the immediate week after, helped to bring calm and stability to Little India.",3,336,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00336
2014-02-18-T-015,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"We can all agree that that move was necessary then. The Bill we are discussing today addresses how the Little India area will be characterised moving forward – one which is deemed as a high-risk security area and, therefore, this Bill is designed to deal with that threat. In fact, the rationale given in the Explanatory Note explains that Little India poses a security risk and that more powers are needed for the officers to maintain public order.",4,337,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00337
2014-02-18-T-015,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"However, in reality, the Little India area is just like any other area in Singapore where members of Singapore's South Asian community shop, dine and do business.

2014-02-18-T-015,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"I think it is fair to say that the riot in December was an unfortunate but isolated incident. The people who were responsible for that and who participated in it, whether actively or passively, have been taken to task and dealt with. The swift actions taken by our police force in handling the investigations and arresting the suspects, did send a strong signal to others that such incidents will not be tolerated in Singapore. Mdm Speaker, just because of one incident, it does not mean that people who visit Little India, be they foreigners or Singaporeans, pose a high risk.",6,339,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00339
2014-02-18-T-015,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, I am afraid that the situation could worsen because of some of the ambiguity in this Bill and the powers it accords to the Police. For instance, the Bill gives the police the powers of strip-search anyone based entirely on the suspicion of the police officer. These are violations of the privacy of a person and not to mention a blow to his self-respect and dignity.",7,340,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00340
2014-02-18-T-015,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"I fail to see how giving Police officers such powers would help cool things down and mitigate risks in this area. Further, the Bill also empowers Auxiliary Police Force, indirectly, to perform random and judgemental searches as per sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Bill. With the delegation of powers all the way to Auxiliary forces on matters which require caution and informed judgement, it may cause emotions to influence judgements across a wide variety of people who visit this area and have nothing else but looks common. This may also affect genuine tourists who come to visit or stay in this special zone. An inadvertent action on a tourist with no bad intent will also result in loss of collective goodwill for Singapore.",8,341,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00341

Mdm Speaker, I declare my interest as a businessman as well as the Vice President of Singapore Retailers Association. I am concerned about the businesses in this area. I have consulted the Little India Shopkeepers Association (LISHA) and they have shared their concerns and sentiments with me. Allow me to share with you some of their thoughts.",9,342,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00342
2014-02-18-T-015,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"The Little India Precinct in Singapore has been catering to the foreign workers for the past 30 years with regular visitorship of about 100,000 workers over the weekends. Of these numbers, only a fraction, about 1%, of the foreign workers consumes alcohol there. The remaining 99% are there to visit relatives and friends, run errands and also purchase their necessities. Little India is considered their home away from home. Approximately 95% of businesses in Little India cater to the foreign workers market which takes place during the weekends on Saturdays and Sundays. Apart from the liquor shops, which only form about less than 5% of these businesses in Little India, there are provision shops, remittance centres, prepaid cards and mobile shops, barbers, restaurants, eating outlets, medicine shops, ayurvedic treatments, homeopathy centres and so on, all of which depend solely on foreign workers as their customers. All these businesses are very dependent on revenue from the foreign workers on Saturdays and Sundays. Almost 70% of the revenue during the weekend is generated from 8.30 pm to 11.30 pm from the sales to the foreign workers.",10,343,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00343
2014-02-18-T-015,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"These businesses pay very high rentals and are affected due to liquor sales and consumption ban and also limited timing of the transport arrangement from Little India back to the respective dormitories of the workers. The current transport timing ends at 9.00 pm to encourage the foreign workers to return to their dormitories earlier. However, the foreign workers prefer to work on weekends due to extra revenue from overtime on weekends and public holidays. Thus, they are most likely to visit Little India after 7.00 pm. They do not have enough time to run their errands and shop within such a short span of time, also bearing in mind that it takes about 30 minutes to queue for the transport. Therefore, the foreign workers leaving Little India by 9.00 pm has affected 95% of Little India's businesses drastically these days.",11,344,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00344
2014-02-18-T-015,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Further, the ban on sales of liquor from 8.00 pm to 6.00 am within the Little India boundary seems to be a double whammy to the liquor businesses as there is already a ban on consumption of liquor in public areas within Little India Zone. It affects residents who prefer to buy liquor and consume it within their premises. They are unable to do so now. The restriction of sales should be lifted as the patrons purchasing liquor automatically have to consume within their residences or outside the Little India boundary. Without the ban on sales of liquor, customers will still be able to buy alcohol but the consumption of liquor must be outside Little India or within the restaurants or coffee shops with permits. The ban will affect the businesses in the precinct and will lead to severe financial losses and loss of jobs which is currently unwelcome for all the parties involved.",12,345,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00345
2014-02-18-T-015,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Madam, I fully agree with the principle of having the ban on alcohol sales and alcohol consumption in public areas in Little India, in the weeks after the riot as it was a necessary step, to calm things down. But at this point, I am not sure if it is the best decision to continue with the ban on the sale of alcohol.",13,346,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00346
2014-02-18-T-015,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"First and foremost, while alcohol may be a contributing factor to the riot in December, whether it was the most important factor remains to be seen. We have vested that responsibility with the Committee of Inquiry (COI) to determine the root causes for the riot. Are we not literally jumping the gun by taking such strong measures that will hurt businesses there and even perhaps tourism in the Little India area? After all, we should not punish everyone else, including businesses, for the folly of some.",14,347,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00347
2014-02-18-T-015,R Dhinakaran,Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member),"Secondly, if it is determined that alcohol is, indeed, the main threat to security in the area, then it should be asked if the bans are the best way to handle alcohol consumption in the localised area. There are other ways – investing in public education, partnerships with groups and governance over the issuance of licences to sell alcohol. To maintain calm and order in the area, a longer term and more sustainable approach would be more appropriate and perhaps more effective.",15,348,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00348

2014-02-18-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Over the years, the overcrowding worsened and made it impossible to drive through roads at weekends and public holidays.

2014-02-18-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The hasty introduction of this Bill in the aftermath of the 8 December riot is, to me, a knee-jerk reaction. Though the Government's desire to act is understandable, this Bill will instead stigmatise Little India as a ""special zone"" requiring special legislation from Parliament.",6,361,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00361
2014-02-18-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"This Bill is unnecessary at this time, especially when the Committee of Inquiry (COI) set up to investigate the causes of the riot is set to release its recommendations by June. There are already sufficient powers under our laws and administrative regimes to manage the situation until the COI findings can be acted upon. I also have some particular concerns about the Bill. Let me elaborate on these points.",7,362,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00362
2014-02-18-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, COI findings out soon. The COI was appointed on 13 December and has six months to complete its report, which will take us to a deadline of 13 June. Assuming this Bill is passed today and comes into force in March, it will be effective for 12 months, from March this year to March next year. It will be in force for about three months before the COI report is out. After the findings are out, the Bill will continue thereafter for another nine months, regardless of what the COI findings are.",8,363,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00363
2014-02-18-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The Bill provides for draconian and resource intensive measures, including needing special permits to serve alcohol at hotel weddings – clause 5; Police searches for alcohol containers on persons and vehicles – clauses 9 and 12; questioning persons who wish to enter the area – clause 10; and refusing entry and banning individuals from the zone – clauses 11 and 13. What if the COI findings are such that all these measures are barking up the wrong tree? How much wastage of taxpayers' money and inconvenience to the public will be caused with continuing the measures for the remaining nine months?",9,364,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00364
2014-02-18-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"In my view, the Government has taken decisive steps to calm the situation post-riot. There is no need to rush to pass a special law when the COI findings will be out soon. The Government can continue to calibrate its actions within the existing framework of national legislation and administrative powers until the COI findings can be acted upon.",10,365,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00365
2014-02-18-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, Madam, why the existing laws and the administrative arrangements are adequate in the interim. In the immediate aftermath of the riot, the Government used the existing Public Order (Preservation) Act (POPA) to designate Little India a proclaimed area. For every weekend and public holiday since then, the Minister has issued such proclamations. This has facilitated a ban on the consumption of alcohol in public on those days. Businesses selling alcohol for off-premise consumption were also directed to do so within shorter hours.",11,366,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00366
2014-02-18-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"As Deputy Prime Minister Teo said in his Statement to Parliament on 20 January, the authorities were able to calibrate the extent to which they utilised powers under the POPA. Earlier, the Minister said that the powers under POPA were excessive and not appropriate for the situation at hand. While it is true that POPA contains wide powers and the fit is not ideal, the Government has shown that it can calibrate its approach to the application of POPA to use only the provisions which are appropriate. In any case, this is just for a few more weekends until the COI findings can be acted upon.",12,367,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00367
2014-02-18-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, there are actually some aspects of this Bill which are wider than how POPA has been applied. For instance, in applying the POPA, the Government has calibrated its approach to Little India, gazetting a proclamation only during public holidays and weekends. The Bill before us will make Little India a special zone every day of the week for 12 months. This is a stark indication of how the Bill is more onerous than the POPA in application.",13,368,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00368
2014-02-18-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The current legal framework already provides the Government vast powers to meet law and order problems. POPA stipulates that if any one commits the offences on unlawful assembly or rioting in a proclaimed area, he will be subject to double the imprisonment. In the case of rioting, this means 14 years' jail. Besides POPA, there are also many other laws at the Government's disposal. The Penal Code criminalises acts of violence and gatherings of persons intending to use violence; conspiracy, abetment and attempts of such offences are also crimes. Under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, drunkenness in public and disorderly behaviour are specific offences. Suspects can be arrested by police without a warrant on the spot. The carrying of prohibited items such as weapons and corrosive substances are already criminalised everywhere in Singapore under the Arms and Explosives Act, the Corrosive and Explosives Substances and Offensive Weapons Act, the Dangerous Fireworks Act and others. In 2009, Parliament passed the controversial Public Order Act with provisions allowing the Police to issue ""move on"" orders to persons it suspects may disrupt or disturb others in a public place. Are the existing laws not enough until the COI findings are out?",14,369,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00369
2014-02-18-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Besides legal measures, administrative measures are also available to manage the situation at Little India. As indicated in Parliament on 20 January, policing arrangements have been enhanced post-riot by way of 20 to 30 police officers as well as Special Operations Command troops, complementing the 81 existing auxiliary police and private security officers. Other measures initiated included more CCTV surveillance and building stronger community partnership programmes. Foreign worker management has also been reviewed. Employers and dormitory operators have provided alternative recreational activities, while the transport for workers to and from Little India has been adjusted with drop-off and pick-up arrangements improved. LTA is also involved in relooking at road access and traffic management. These positive moves have been very helpful to manage the situation in the interim.",15,370,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00370
2014-02-18-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, I have three other concerns about the Bill. First, stigmatisation. Is it good for the residents of Little India to be singled out as living in a special zone where a dedicated security law has to be passed by Parliament? The current arrangement of using POPA is more palatable as it is a law that can be used for any part of Singapore facing a temporary law and order situation. Passing this Bill will mean that for 12 months at least, residents can only drink alcohol outside their homes under a class permit and their friends and guests will need to be extra careful when visiting them on any day of the week. Civil defence paramedics and pharmacists in the zone who carry alcohol products for medical emergencies need to refer to clause 4(3) to confirm that they can do so. They are joined by priests serving communion for church services. Under clause 12, even driving through Serangoon Road in transit with a bottle of wine may attract searches and questions. Have we gone too far?",16,371,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00371
2014-02-18-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Secondly, a resource question. The provisions of the Bill are onerous to implement. Vast policing resources appear to be required to question persons entering into or remaining within the special zone to search for and destroy alcohol containers, to search vehicles whether inside or outside the special zone, to issue banning orders to suspects and so on. During the Ministerial Statement on the Little India riot on 20 January, the Government already expressed concerns as to whether the additional deployment rates at Little India were sustainable. How much more resources would be needed to do what is envisaged under the Bill, every day of the week? Related to this, the role of auxiliary police is going to be enhanced. My colleague Pritam Singh will speak on this point. Are they suitable for the tasks under the Bill?",17,372,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00372
2014-02-18-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Finally, displacement effects. Designating the special zone may lead to displacement effects for the duration of the Bill. Persons who would otherwise frequent Little India may go to the neighbouring areas outside the zone, for example, across Jalan Besar. While the Minister can expand the special zone to cover adjacent areas under clause 3, how this will change the landscape and living environment of adjacent areas for the next 12 months remains to be seen.",18,373,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00373
2014-02-18-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),I have spoken of my concerns about the hasty manner in which this Bill is presented and the wisdom of jumping the gun when the COI is to complete its work by June. I have also elaborated on why I believe the existing legal and administrative framework can be used in the interim to manage the situation until the COI findings can be dealt with. My colleagues will further elaborate on the reasons why the Workers' Party has grave reservations about the need and the wisdom of this Bill.,19,374,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00374
2014-02-18-T-015,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"As I said at the beginning of my speech, we are aware of the plight of the long-suffering residents in the area, who have put up with social disamenities for decades. The incident of 8 December suggests that the authorities will need to make some changes.

Undoubtedly, we have become accustomed to the safe living environment for many years, and have taken good public order for granted, thinking that the situation would never change.

Can our foreign workers really be expected only to be confined to their living quarters?

2014-02-18-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"It is important that the images we first saw on social media and then on mainstream media are not revived in any part of Singapore.

2014-02-18-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Our approach has been to integrate foreign workers into our communities. Therefore, these spaces will have to be managed on a sustainable basis. The workers have travelled far from home to work here, attracted by higher pay and also our reputation for law and order. The riot on 8 December could have easily escalated and spiralled out of control, and casualties could have come from any ethnic group and nationality. Despite the chaos, we are all very grateful that there were no fatalities. All the more then, while we have the opportunity, we should take steps to minimise the possibility of a similar event until we can establish with more certainty its causes and the appropriate long-term measures.",3,438,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00438
2014-02-18-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Nonetheless, because this Bill involves an area where visitors are predominantly of one ethnic group, it has to be managed and handled carefully, with sensitivity. I have received feedback expressing concerns over this. I have trust in the competence of our enforcement teams. Nonetheless, I seek assurances and clarifications from the Minister that sufficient provisions are in place to prevent the extended powers, albeit temporary, from being subject to abuse. I think it would be helpful to have some form of checks hardwired into the legislation.",4,439,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00439
2014-02-18-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"With the enactment of this Bill, Police and Auxiliary Police Officers (APOs) will have additional powers to deal with potential threats to public order. For example, they can question and search anyone in the area for alcohol or prohibited items. Will there be clear guidelines and protocol for enforcement officers to adhere to in identifying such individuals and the way they perform the checks? How will the Government ensure consistency of judgement and action by the enforcement officers, given that the training of Auxiliary Police Officers is different from the Singapore Police Force, and that they are employees of a private company? Would foreign employees of auxiliary companies be accorded the same power? By reducing subjectivity inherent in such situations due to different interpretations of the regulations by different teams, we can then avoid situations of misunderstanding and stress.",5,440,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00440
2014-02-18-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Madam, I would also like to address the issue of higher rates of interaction between enforcement teams and the visitors to the zone. Presumably, enforcement members will mostly be of ethnic groups and nationality different from the majority of the visitors to the zone. Will customised training be provided to ensure that enforcement officers are equipped with the basic linguistic skills and cultural knowledge to deal with the tasks at hand? In the event of miscommunications or when some persons being checked are being uncooperative, such incidents could lead to heightened tension between people of different racial groups or even escalate into racial riots or diplomatic rows. How can we guard against these?",6,441,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00441
2014-02-18-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"While we await the results of the COI, we can at most speculate that the influence of alcohol could be a contributing factor to the riot on 8 December. This explains clause 4 which prohibits the public consumption and sale of alcohol within the special zone. Does this point the direction that the Ministry is heading? Would all areas where big crowds can be expected to be intoxicated be subjected to similar rules and enforcement in future? Or will there be a general restriction on public consumption of alcohol? If not, this Bill could be misinterpreted to be racially discriminatory. I look forward to the Minister's view on this.",7,442,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00442
2014-02-18-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Lastly, the enhanced powers will allow the authorities to quickly cancel or suspend business licences which flout the rules in the special zone and this may be as short as three days as stated in the Bill. My concern is  within such a short period of time, how can we ensure that proper investigations are conducted in order to be fair to the business owners? In the event that mistakes in the investigative process were made, is there recourse for compensation for the business owners?",8,443,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00443
2014-02-18-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Madam, similar to the alcohol-related provisions, the effect of the other measures seems to be more pre-emptive. I do not think that the additional powers accorded to the police would have done much to bring the situation under control on that fateful night. In addition, it would probably require a lot more enforcement resources on the ground to prevent the same scenario from repeating itself. Usually after a major incident, it is highly unlikely that history would repeat itself in the short and medium term at the same place. The most dangerous place becomes the safest place. I would like to ask the Minister, how would the effectiveness of this Bill be assessed at the end of 12 months? Would the provisions be expanded to cover other areas, or would there be another Bill to give the law a set of ""permanent teeth""? How could we be sure that just because there are no further riots in the next 12 months, the Bill has served its intended purpose?",9,444,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00444
2014-02-18-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Madam, Little India has been an iconic spot in Singapore, not just a place of attraction for tourists, but also an area which has developed its own unique character organically. I drove past the area last Sunday night and I am happy to see that the usual vibrancy and rusticity of the place still exists.",10,445,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00445
2014-02-18-T-015,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Mdm Speaker, this is probably not what the Minister could answer. While Little India has attracted many more foreign workers roaming the streets than there are local people living there, it has ironically preserved a part of Singapore and our heritage that is fast disappearing.

2014-02-18-T-015,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"While it is commendable that the Government is serious in its efforts to ensure the safety and security of residents and the public in the aftermath of the riot, I would like to raise a number of concerns regarding this Bill.",2,462,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00462
2014-02-18-T-015,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"First, regarding the necessity for this Bill. I would like to seek clarification from the Minister as to why this new legislative framework is necessary, when there are sufficient legal powers already present in existing statutes like POPA. The Minister had explained that police powers in this Bill are far less than in POPA. And, similarly, in a recent televised dialogue on MediaCorp's Vasantham channel, Law Minister Mr Shanmugam reiterated that this new provision is limited in scope and that ""the Government already has more power than this"". Referring to POPA, he mentioned that ""the Police do not need all such powers"" and that ""the new law reduces such powers"".",3,463,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00463
2014-02-18-T-015,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"If we currently have sufficient levers under POPA to contain a situation like a riot, and given the short 12-month temporary timeframe for this Bill, why then is there a need to rush through new legislation instead of waiting until the Committee of Inquiry (COI) has completed its investigations and for criminal proceedings to be over? After all, before the 8 December riot occurred, migrant workers have been gathering in Little India for many years without a similar incident. And after curbs and measures were introduced to bring the situation under control, the area has remained calm ever since.",4,464,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00464
2014-02-18-T-015,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Second, regarding the timing of this Bill. The terms of reference of the COI include establishing the factors and circumstances that led to the riot, and recommending measures to improve the management of similar incidents in areas where foreign workers congregate. Given that the COI has yet to present its findings, there is a lack of research to support the initiatives under this Bill. I am concerned that the measures presented here, many of which deal with alcohol restrictions and regulation, while proactive, are not substantiated by data, and may, in fact, pre-empt the recommendations of the Committee.",5,465,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00465
2014-02-18-T-015,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Madam, even as we raised questions on the Little India riot last month in this House, we were reminded to be careful about speculating on the various causes of the riot and to let the COI do its work. It was acknowledged then that while ""alcohol was a contributory factor"", it was probably ""not the only factor"". Without the evidence establishing all the key factors contributing to the riot, why then is so much attention specifically given to the regulation of alcohol sale, supply and consumption in this Bill?",6,466,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00466
2014-02-18-T-015,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Tabling this Bill before the COI investigations and criminal proceedings are concluded raises doubts as to whether this piece of legislation, temporary as it may be, is a substantiated and reasoned response to the riot. This pre-emptive strike gives the impression that the Government has already concluded that alcohol was a major factor, and distracts from other possible causes that could have led to the riot.",7,467,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00467
2014-02-18-T-015,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Additionally, the passing of this Bill before the COI presents its report risks influencing the outcome of its deliberations and potentially undermining the integrity of the COI findings.",8,468,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00468
2014-02-18-T-015,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Thirdly, Madam, the over-focus on alcohol gives rise to other problems, including the risk of racial stereotyping and racial profiling. Public drinking goes on in many areas in Singapore, from the clubs and bars in Clark Quay to the street-side food stalls and coffee shops of Geylang and Joo Chiat, where many foreigners and foreign workers also congregate. These places, too, experience their fair share of fights, brawls and incidents now and again. If alcoholic inebriation is believed to have led to the riot, then based on this line of reasoning, riot-prevention must surely call for similar alcohol bans elsewhere.",9,469,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00469
2014-02-18-T-015,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Lest I be misconstrued, I am not asking for similar bans to be established in other public areas, necessarily. I can see that alcoholic intoxication, particularly in hotspot areas where it occurs on a regular basis, causes great inconvenience to residents and other members of the public. However, in this Bill, the targeted approach of curbing alcohol in Little India as a response to the riot, without the support of the COI's findings, without a fuller understanding of all the other factors at play, runs the risk of racially stereotyping and profiling people of South Asian descent and migrant workers in particular, as being prone to public disorder when they drink. This is potentially damaging to building good inter-racial and community relations between our South Asian migrant workers and Singaporeans as well as undermines the respect and dignity we should accord our guest workers.",10,470,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00470
2014-02-18-T-015,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Fourthly, Madam, the general lack of judicial oversight over how the discretionary powers conferred on the police will be exercised makes this Bill problematic. Without the mechanisms for external oversight, such as the Courts, the adjudication of reasonableness is left in the hands of the Executive, where these powers are potentially subject to abuse. Even if the powers are always fairly and objectively exercised, the Government and Police officers may be vulnerable to accusations of arbitrariness.",11,471,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00471
2014-02-18-T-015,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Clause 9, for instance, provides extensive powers to the Police and auxiliary police to stop and search, and even strip-search any person within the special zone to inspect for prohibited items and alcohol. Even though the officer must ""reasonably consider it necessary"" to make such a request, what is considered ""reasonable"" or ""necessary"" is not spelt out in the Bill, and may lead to an officer exercising section 9 without having to explain his reasons for doing so.",12,472,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00472
2014-02-18-T-015,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Discretionary police powers should always meet the test of ""reasonableness"", which the authorities are required to exercise when operating the Act. However, the Bill precludes any adjudication of its operation through the Courts or other bodies, other than an appeals process on certain actions, which may be made to the Minister. Without an external adjudicator, and in the event where the police officer and the suspected individual have different perceptions of what is ""reasonable"", then the reasonableness of police action can never be settled. If, say, a person is wrongly accused and suffers reputational loss or other loss, he or she would have no recourse, even if the officer or officers in question might have exercised their powers maliciously.",13,473,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00473
2014-02-18-T-015,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"As such, I would like to seek the Minister's clarification as to whether measures for external oversight and safeguards on the exercise of power will be put in place, and if these can be included into the Act.",14,474,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00474
2014-02-18-T-015,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"Madam, my fifth concern touches on auxiliary police and standards of police professionalism. Given that the enhanced powers under clauses 9, 10 and 11 are extended to not only Singapore police officers, but also to ""approved persons"" such as auxiliary police personnel, how do we ensure that those from external security agencies possess the same sense of public service and duty, and the same standards of professionalism as our own police force?",15,475,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00475
2014-02-18-T-015,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"The officers exercising these powers, for instance, must guard against any form of racial stereotyping and profiling, even as they continue to maintain law and order through inspections and controls. If persons of South Asian descent, be they Singaporeans, tourists or migrant workers, begin to feel that they are being singled out for inspection and checks in Little India, this could potentially increase racial sensitivities and tension not only in the area, but in other parts of Singapore as well. As such, situations must be handled with cultural sensitivity and care in maintaining the dignity of individuals. If these jobs are outsourced to external agencies, will there be specific criteria in selecting auxiliary police personnel best suited to exercising these powers? For instance, should only Singapore citizens, with the minimum number of years of training and experience, be appointed to these roles?",16,476,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00476
2014-02-18-T-015,Janice Koh,Ms Janice Koh (Nominated Member),"There is also a question of whether the police officers and auxiliary police personnel will have the appropriate language abilities to communicate with the people whom they seek to exercise power over, namely, foreign migrant workers in Little India. Given that the penalties for contravening the new laws are high, would the officers have the capabilities to communicate their requests or instructions clearly and effectively to the foreign workers? If not, it is easy to see how a miscommunication could spark another conflagration.",17,477,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00477

And while, in recent years, it has become more crowded on weekends due to the growing numbers of foreign workers in Singapore, it has always been a bustling and colourful place, with a unique vibe and character of its own – an important centre of festivities and celebrations for our Singapore Indian residents, as well as a key cultural destination point for many tourists visiting Singapore.",18,478,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00478

However, the hasty enactment of this Bill, with its enhanced powers to stop and search, and to control and restrict entry and movement in Little India, may inadvertently choke, not only the businesses and retailers there, but the very life and vibrancy of the area. The over-focus on alcohol may lead to racial profiling of South Asian migrants, and possibly worsen relations between the foreign migrant community and our police officers over time.",19,479,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00479

There has not been any indication of a potential for such an event to repeat itself since it happened in December and until this has been shown, the exceptional powers such as those granted by section 9 cannot be justified.",7,488,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00488
2014-02-18-T-015,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member),"Strip searches. The hardest hitting provision of this Bill is clause 9, which provides for the Police officers and auxiliary police to order any person who is about to enter or who happens to be within the special zone to remove pieces of their clothing. The clause does not specify a limit to which the enforcement officers can go and based on its plain wording, the clause allows for officers to order the removal of all of a person's clothing. Such searches are humiliating, especially to innocent people. The Bill does not provide any safeguards to the dignity of the person, allowing officers to make these orders in public. Nor does the particular provision provide any protection for women who may be subjected to the search. Furthermore, the section also empowers auxiliary officers to make these orders.",8,489,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00489
2014-02-18-T-015,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member),"I note an interview on the Public Service website, Challenge, with Mr Roy Quek, Deputy Secretary (Operations & Development) of MHA. On this Bill, Mr Quek says, and I quote  ""Let me clarify  when we say for a policeman to be able to search your articles of clothing, it means, for example, you're wearing a jacket, I say, 'Can I have a look at your jacket?' and you give me your jacket, as opposed to my patting you down and frisking you.""",9,490,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00490
2014-02-18-T-015,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member),"The wording of section 9(b) in this Bill clearly gives enforcement officers the power to order the removal of garments worn by persons for inspection of any container of alcohol or prohibited items. Allowing for this is, in principle, no different from allowing the police to frisk a person, since by ordering for the removal of a person's clothing, frisking would of course be unnecessary.",10,491,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00491
2014-02-18-T-015,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member),"I think this shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the powers of the Bill provides enforcement officers with, especially in this clause. Could the Minister therefore clarify the Deputy Secretary's comments?",11,492,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00492
2014-02-18-T-015,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member),This is highly troubling since auxiliary officers are privately hired by companies whose main concern is not the law enforcement but with profits earned from providing a service. Auxiliary officers are not properly trained or equipped with the right policing techniques for them to be entrusted with such exceptional powers.,12,493,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00493
2014-02-18-T-015,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member),"However, what is most disturbing is that this provision is pre-emptive and not reactive. This means an officer does not need to suspect anyone of committing a crime before the powers can be exercised. The Bill does state that the power can only be used if it is considered to be ""reasonably necessary"". What constitutes ""reasonable necessity"", however, is not defined at all. This effectively means that the officers will have absolute discretion over when a person can be strip-searched. To allow enforcement officers such wide powers goes too far.",13,494,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00494
2014-02-18-T-015,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member),"These problems extend to each and every person who attempts to enter or are within a special zone, whether they are Singaporeans or foreigners. Any person entering the zone stands the chance of being harassed by the auxiliary officers, on the most whimsical of grounds. This includes residents, employees and business owners whose daily life and daily activities require them to be put at risk of being subject to these procedures every single time they enter the zone. My point is not that the powers should be targeted at any specific community, but that the blunderbuss approach that has been taken could and probably would result in untold anxiety and distress to the majority of innocent people who enter the zone.",14,495,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00495
2014-02-18-T-015,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member),"It would be important that appropriate measures must be taken to ensure migrant workers understand the offences proscribed in this Bill. If laypersons have trouble understanding and interpreting legislations, what about migrant workers with a low command of the English Language?",15,496,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00496
2014-02-18-T-015,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member),I am also concerned about the manner in which police and auxiliary officers would approach migrant workers whom they suspect may have committed a crime within the special zone. It is foreseeable that a situation could arise where a language barrier between the officer and the worker impedes effective communication and thereby leads to misunderstanding between both parties. This could lead the officer to view the worker as suspect and to then charge the worker under the respective provisions under the Bill.,16,497,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00497
2014-02-18-T-015,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member),"In this regard, it is highly worrying too that any offences under this Act can be compounded on the spot. I think this opens the way for potential abuse. From the point of view of the people affected, I can imagine that what then happens on the ground will not be very much different from extortion.",17,498,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00498
2014-02-18-T-015,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member),"I would also like to highlight the fact that aggressive and intrusive policing by auxiliary officers towards migrant workers in Little India has been documented by the NGO, Transient Workers Count Too. Not only was it observed that auxiliary officers were rather hostile and belligerent in their interaction with migrant workers, it also appears that migrant workers have been disproportionately targeted with fines for offences such as littering and smoking. As a result, it may have the unintentional impact of causing a migrant worker to feel disproportionately discriminated against. To allow such feelings of alienation to fester within the migrant worker community would only aggravate the tensions between migrant workers and Singaporeans, possibly sparking off a worse riot. It is certainly not in Singapore's interest to do so.",18,499,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00499
2014-02-18-T-015,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member),"Why is it then that this Bill deals with a special zone that encompasses the whole of Little India, where the riot actually took place along Race Course Road? What is the rationale behind turning such a vast gazetted area which includes many other roads and streets into a risk-prone zone?",19,500,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00500
2014-02-18-T-015,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member),"I note that clause 1(2) of the Bill indicates that the provisions here will be in force for one year from the date of commencement. May I ask the Minister what will the Government intend to do thereafter? And what will the Government do if a similar incident were to happen again within this year, and it is found not to be the result of alcohol consumption?",20,501,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00501
2014-02-18-T-015,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member),I am calling for a Motion to commit this Bill to a Select Committee for further scrutiny and until the findings and recommendations of the COI have been established.

2014-02-18-T-015,Lina Chiam,Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member),"In conclusion, Mdm Speaker, I believe our citizens are as serious as the Government in the desire to enforce public order, to safeguard our country from further incidents of this nature. But we hope that this will not be done in a way that destroys the soul of Little India – which is not merely a tourist attraction, but a neighbourhood that holds special historical and cultural significance in the hearts of many Singaporeans.",23,504,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00504
2014-02-18-T-015,Laurence Lien,Mr Laurence Lien (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to begin by acknowledging the difficulties of the Government in deciding how to calibrate its response in the aftermath of the Race Course Road riot. It is understandably facing pressure to prevent such a riot from happening again. And the authorities have a duty to protect citizens, and our image as a country. I once worked in the Joint Operations Division in MHA more than 15 years ago, and even back then, handling the Sunday crowds in Little India was already an issue. So, I understand the issues.",1,505,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00505
2014-02-18-T-015,Laurence Lien,Mr Laurence Lien (Nominated Member),"Obviously, nobody disagrees with the intent to act to maintain public order. What some Members of this House have questions about is how we are going about it. Assoc Prof Tan has mentioned this. People in this House and outside have expressed their questions and concerns. Let me add mine.",2,506,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00506
2014-02-18-T-015,Laurence Lien,Mr Laurence Lien (Nominated Member),"Let me first point out that having legal powers and using those powers are two very different things. An example is section 377A of the Penal Code. Hence, even if we invoke a wider law, such as proclaiming an area to be in a state of danger to public order under POPA, it does not mean that every provision of that Act is to be triggered. I would imagine that the SOPs for the officers on the ground would be more tightly scoped, which I presume is the case in Little India now as we speak. Hence, as some speakers have already asked, can we not use current laws rather than rush through this new one?",3,507,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00507
2014-02-18-T-015,Laurence Lien,Mr Laurence Lien (Nominated Member),"A related concern is this  if we enact this new Act, are we then creating the expectation that the majority of the provisions will be used and this is a precursor for more permanent legislation? The irony might be that officers, with these additional powers, might become even less restrained in using these powers precisely because they have been specially tailored for the current situation. The scope of powers in the Bill are very wide still, even if they are more tightly scoped than POPA.",4,508,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00508
2014-02-18-T-015,Laurence Lien,Mr Laurence Lien (Nominated Member),"The question then is whether the handling on the ground would lead to an overkill. You may ask, what is the downside of an overkill when it concerns public safety and security? I think the downside may be increased distrust and suspicion between the authorities and the groups targeted, especially if there is perceived damage to the dignity of the human person. This may result, ironically, in increasing the security risk in the future, where even more force is required to keep peace.",5,509,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00509
2014-02-18-T-015,Laurence Lien,Mr Laurence Lien (Nominated Member),"While the COI deliberates, I think we can readily agree on a few key points. One, the Race Course Road riot was unplanned. No one entered Little India that evening expecting a riot. For many, including professionals serving migrant workers, it was a freak event. What is the risk of such an event reoccurring? This type of risk is considered idiosyncratic risk, not systemic risk like deliberate terrorist acts. In fact, the immediate likelihood of another such riot happening, say over the next 12 months, is probably at an all-time low now. As Mr Baey said, the most dangerous place becomes the safest place. Of course, we must remain vigilant of longer term risks, which we need to approach with care and caution.",6,510,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00510
2014-02-18-T-015,Laurence Lien,Mr Laurence Lien (Nominated Member),"Two, migrant workers are not in Singapore to cause trouble. Almost every foreign worker in Singapore is here for economic reasons. They have higher aspirations for their families, and the will to uproot from their home and families and transplant themselves to an unfamiliar place. Many come with huge debts that may take up to 12 months to repay, before they can even start saving money to send home. They want to be able to work hard and make enough money quickly, so that they can return to their families.",7,511,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00511

2014-02-18-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"At the time it happened, people were so shocked, so moved that there was a very strong desire that such a thing should never happened again. That is probably universal in this House.",3,541,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00541
2014-02-18-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"After the Little India riot happened, there was a difficult question of what should be done and views were so divergent. I remembered when I was in camp at that time, people were looking at some of the videos of officers running away, and they said, ""These guys should have opened fire, why are they running away from the riots?"" But obviously, if they had opened fire, it would have been a very different situation. There was certainly a very strong desire that more should be done, and that more could have been done as well.",4,542,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00542
2014-02-18-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The debate in this House turns on a couple of issues. Everyone agrees that there is a need for more security, for tough measures. There are a couple of points that people disagree on. The first is given the Committee of Inquiry has not completed its job, is it right to take measures, dealing with alcohol specifically, given that this has not been officially ruled as a cause? The second broad issue is  are the powers too broad and will they be abused? I had both of these concerns and maybe I will share how I dealt with them.",5,543,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00543
2014-02-18-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The first concern  was alcohol really the cause of this? The Committee of Inquiry is still out looking into this and I do not wish to give my views directly on what exactly happened in that riot. But after the event, there were at least two stories I can share. The first was that I had the chance to accompany Deputy Prime Minister Teo to visit some of the first responders at the scene. These were the firemen and Police officers. These were the people who were actually face-to-face with the rioters; the people who were hit by projectiles, which included alcohol bottles. Certainly, the stories from them made it quite clear that they felt that some of the people who were attacking them were inebriated and had been pushed by alcohol.",6,544,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00544
2014-02-18-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The second experience that was quite illuminating for me was a visit to a foreign workers' dormitory together with Minister Shanmugam, Mr Dhinakaran and some senior union leaders. At the time I visited this dormitory in Kranji, I did not really know what to expect. I was not sure if the workers were going to say they had been really unhappy with living in Singapore, they were being abused and, therefore, they were rioting; or they were going to give some other story for what happened.",7,545,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00545
2014-02-18-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Now, these were not the workers involved in the riot but these were other foreign workers who would have been in the area, would have gone to Little India many times, and would have known what happened there. What was interesting was they were asked a number of questions. First, they were asked whether they had any issues with their employers. The almost-immediate, unanimous answer was ""no"" and some of them even said, ""If we have any issue, we can bring it up with MOM"". When they were asked what they thought might have caused this, they volunteered themselves, ""Alcohol"". It was not just one worker but it was echoed by a number of others. Some of the other workers said, ""These were probably young people, new in Singapore and they were drunk"".",8,546,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00546
2014-02-18-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In response to that, we asked whether they thought restrictions on alcohol would be something that would be useful, and, almost without pausing for breath, their answer was ""yes"". This was actually quite illuminating because, obviously, these foreign workers who were not involved in the riots, were concerned that their reputation might be tarnished by other people who did get drunk and were involved.",9,547,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00547
2014-02-18-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"If we step back, on a broader level, prohibitions on public consumption of alcohol are actually quite common in many countries. Dr Lam Pin Min has run through a very long list of them, and they include Australia, Russia, a good number of Scandinavian countries and probably countries that have had some experience with drinking and unruly public behaviour. The prohibition on the public consumption of alcohol is something I would support even if we did not have the riot, because it looks like there is a very strong correlation between unruly behaviour and public consumption of alcohol. I do not think it is an unnecessary restriction on people's rights because people can still consume alcohol in their own homes, within establishments and so on. The only place they cannot do so is on the street and also in other public places.",10,548,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00548
2014-02-18-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Broadly speaking, I would support prohibition on the public consumption of alcohol. Now, correlated to that, of course, are the restrictions on the sale of alcohol. If you are buying alcohol to consume on your own, you could definitely buy within reasonable hours; you do not have to buy it at 3.00 am or 4.00 am in the morning and so on. So, I do not think that is unreasonable either. I think those two prohibitions go together.",11,549,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00549
2014-02-18-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In that respect, the broad objectives of the Bill to prohibit the public consumption of alcohol and to limit the sale of alcohol are measures that I would support.",12,550,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00550
2014-02-18-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The second area, I think is probably a little more troubling. And this is the major concern with the breadth of powers this Bill might confer. The main comfort I draw in this is that it is very clear, at least from the Minister's reading of the Bill, that the intention is not to expand present powers but to limit it. What that means is that any seemingly broad powers in this Bill will be read in that context. Maybe just for the record, I will highlight some of the powers that I have concerns with as well.",13,551,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00551
2014-02-18-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"These largely stem from sections 9 and 10. I remembered there was a very strong reaction about the powers that were enacted by this Bill because newspaper headlines read ""Police powers include being stripped and searched for alcohol"". Suddenly, a lot of people panicked, and people thought, ""So, if I go and buy alcohol in Little India, will I be stripped searched?"" If you look at the strict reading of the Bill, Articles 9(b), 9(c) seem to suggest that – ""you can remove all articles from entrant's clothing"" to search for ""any prohibited item or alcohol"".",14,552,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00552
2014-02-18-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Now, the search for prohibited items – no one would object to – because those are basically weapons, explosives, corrosive substances. But does this power really extend to strip-searching a person for alcohol? I would suggest that it does not. I would suggest the powers in section 9 have to be read together with the limitations in section 4. That is, these powers will only be deployed if someone is consuming alcohol, say, someone is drinking alcohol and then decides to hide it when the Police comes. I would suggest that that is the only situation in which such powers would be deployed. There is no general rule that prohibits the possession of alcohol and, therefore, I do not think that powers of strip-searching someone would be used simply because of possession of alcohol.",15,553,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00553
2014-02-18-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I would also suggest the same thing applies to the powers to search vehicles. I do not think it would be applied randomly to any vehicle, not least because other sections, such as section 7, permit the delivery of alcohol by a vehicle. I do not think the powers in section 9 mean it necessarily becomes an offence in and of itself just to, say, possess alcohol or to have alcohol in your vehicle. If someone is going to Little India to go shopping at Mustafa's, to buy alcohol and he is driving out of Little India, I do not think that would be an offence just because the powers of search technically allow the vehicle to be searched. But I think it would be helpful to clarify that it is clearly the legislative intent that the powers should not be read expansively.",16,554,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00554
2014-02-18-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Maybe a few other powers as well  the powers in section 10, for example, to require reasons for entry. I do not think that means that anyone who enters the zone will be asked, ""Why are you here?"" I think it will only be used if the Police have reasonable suspicion that an offence has been committed somewhere else.",17,555,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00555
2014-02-18-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"One last power which I think Assoc Prof Eugene Tan highlighted earlier on. He was also saying the powers of search and seizure extend to ships and aircrafts in section 12, which means if an aircraft flies over Little India and someone consumes alcohol inside, technically you could search that aircraft once it lands in Changi Airport. But I do not think that is the legislative intent either.",18,556,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00556
2014-02-18-T-015,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Some of the powers may have been broadly drafted, but I think the powers will be read in line with legislative intent. Legislative intent is clearly to prohibit the public consumption of alcohol and to limit the sale of alcohol. The powers will only be used insofar as it is necessary to get evidence of those offences being committed. For that reason, I would support this Bill.",19,557,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00557

Like the rest of us, they have physical, social, recreational and other living needs that must be met. Treating them with dignity and respect is the right thing to do. I am very pleased that more has been done and more will be done to look into the building of purpose-built facilities, dedicated recreation centres and provision of services that they need, such as remittances, shopping, sports and so forth.

Although many had enjoyed years of very good runs by catering to the high number of visitors, both local and foreign, we know a number of them have suffered a decline in business. This is the time to re-balance and find creative win-win solutions that, hopefully, will not cripple the businesses further.

Sprawls, fights, jaywalking and sleeping at staircase landings were not uncommon.

2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, let me start first with the need for the powers in this Bill, which many have queried. Madam, the riot in Little India was the most serious public order incident in Singapore in over four decades. And, lest we forget, it occurred just over nine weeks ago. There was one fatality, several injuries, and extensive damage to property. It might seem distant, even remote, from the calm of this Chamber, but it remains a stark reality for the residents and stakeholders in Little India, our officers who were involved in the incident and who continue with their duties there, and, indeed, for many Singaporeans and foreign workers, and Ms Denise Phua has portrayed this vividly.",2,607,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00607
2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In the immediate aftermath of this incident, the Government and our enforcement agencies took several steps to address various factors that could have contributed, or aggravated, the incident. Indeed, many in this House have welcomed those initial responses. We needed specific powers under the Public Order (Preservation) Act (or POPA) and other legislation to implement those measures.",3,608,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00608
2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"And that need remains valid today. There is a heightened security environment in Little India; we continue to have large gatherings in the area on weekends and public holidays; residents and stakeholders remain concerned that an untoward incident may recur. So, we need a specific and limited set of powers under this Public Order (Additional Temporary Measures) Bill to maintain public order and calm effectively in Little India.",4,609,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00609
2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Several Members – too many for me to list, I hope and I think you know who they are – have asked why can we not just continue with the present arrangement?

2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, many Members have advocated that we adopt a proportionate and appropriate response to the situation in Little India. We agree fully and, indeed, that has been the key reason for this Bill. So, it is ironic that some Members have taken issue with the powers in this Bill which are limited and significantly reduced, compared to those already available today under POPA.",6,611,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00611
2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The powers under POPA are extensive, some would say even draconian, as it is a law conceived to deal with a far graver set of circumstances, such as a State of Emergency. It has the powers, as I said earlier, to impose curfews and even use lethal force. This is not a case of moving the Bill because we have insufficient powers, as Mr Chen Show Mao has suggested. It is a case where the powers are grossly disproportionate to the current situation in Little India, especially as the situation has stabilised and the focus is now on maintaining public order. Therefore, the status quo of relying on the powers under POPA is neither necessary nor desirable.",7,612,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00612
2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Indeed, Madam, the logic offered by several Members is quite elusive – that we welcome the measures that have been taken; we are concerned that you exercise powers and have powers with proportionality; we want to make sure that there are adequate safeguards; but why do we not just continue using POPA, which has extensive powers and will not invite this level of scrutiny?",8,613,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00613
2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"If you are prepared to accord the authorities the powers under POPA, then why are you reluctant to accord the powers which are significantly reduced, compared to POPA as reflected in the Bill? If you are concerned about the exercise of power that is enumerated in this Bill, then why are you not even more exercised by that concern in the context of the powers under POPA? And if you are concerned that somehow this Bill will tarnish the image of Little India, then what do you think the proclamation of a state of danger in Little India every week would do?",9,614,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00614
2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Other Members have suggested, why not defer the Bill till after the COI? The suggestion here is that the COI will finish its work in a few months and we can just get on with whatever we need to do then. As Ms Denise Phua and others have noted, the COI will take some time to finish its work. It has been given six months and, thereafter, whatever the recommendations, they have to be deliberated upon and, then, appropriate measures put in place. So, there is considerable time still ahead, and who would be answerable to Singaporeans and to the residents in Little India if another incident were to occur? It is incumbent on the Government and our agencies to take reasonable steps and measures to ensure that such an incident does not recur. This Bill provides for calibrated powers, far less than in POPA, to continue with the measures to maintain law and order in Little India.",10,615,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00615
2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Assoc Prof Eugene Tan has asked whether it could have been possible to amend the existing laws. Madam, we did consider this option. However, the intent and provisions in the existing laws are worded generally to deal with broad law-and-order situations. In the end, we felt it was preferable to propose a dedicated temporary piece of legislation to meet the specific policing needs of Little India, and adapting provisions in other legislation where relevant.",11,616,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00616
2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Some Members have asked about the timing of this Bill. Why can we not wait for the COI? Some have characterised it as a knee-jerk, hurried response.

2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mdm Speaker, it seems to me that we have three choices  one, we continue with the current arrangements with all its powers under POPA. The question that we have to ask ourselves is  what precedent does it set to use such pieces of legislation with extreme powers for a situation like this, and what sort of risks does that pose? Another alternative is to revert to status quo ex ante, that is, what we had before the riot. I think Members would agree that that is not satisfactory. The third option is in the form of the current Bill  to have a specific set of powers, scoped for the situation, for a limited period of time so that the Police can continue to maintain law and order in Little India.",13,618,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00618
2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Are the Police powers provided for in this Bill unprecedented? All powers, specifically police powers, in this Bill are already available under POPA, which has been invoked on a weekly basis since 8 December 2013. In drafting the Bill, the specific powers of search and seizure, for example, take reference from similar provisions in the Public Order Act governing special, large scale events like National Day Parades.",14,619,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00619
2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I agree with the Members that in vesting such powers in our officers, we must ensure that they exercise them with sensitivity, prudence and care. That is the training and the culture in the Police force and our other enforcement agencies, but it is a point that is worth repeating and emphasising.",15,620,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00620
2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The main exception, in these powers, pertains to the provisions with respect to alcohol-related measures. There has been a comment that this appears to be a Bill that is focused on alcohol-related measures or that appears to be alcohol-centric, and there is a good reason for it. This is because we do not have provisions in our laws for such measures. Some have asked if we are jumping the gun  where is the evidence or causality that directly links alcohol consumption to this incident?",16,621,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00621
2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, our Police officers on the ground do not have the luxury of contemplating a variety of options when there is a clear and present danger and need on the ground. They have to make a reasonable, operational assessment of the situation; what could be the range of contributory factors and these then have to be acted upon. And one of them, in this instance, was the assessment that alcohol could have been a contributory factor. This is not to say that this is the primary cause or that somehow we have committed to a specific attribution for this incident. Indeed, the operational assessment of the Police is not unique.",17,622,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00622
2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Members have heard other Members of this House speak on the matter and it is a view shared by residents and other stakeholders and businesses in the area. So, this Bill introduces, out of necessity, targeted and temporary powers to restrict the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol. Many of the provisions provide clarity on the operation of this framework. It may have created the impression that this Bill is alcohol-centric, but that should not be the case because this Bill also serves other public order imperatives. This includes dealing with non-alcohol related threats, such as prohibited items and disorderly conduct.",18,623,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00623
2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Several Members have also asked whether this Bill and the way it is designed and its geographic limitation to Little India, is somehow discriminatory or targets a particular community. Madam, first, to be clear, these measures are specifically put up to maintain public order in Little India in the aftermath of a serious incident. We have not imposed similar restrictions in other areas of Singapore, or sought to do so, because we want to be targeted and proportionate in our response.",19,624,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00624
2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I want to assure several Members, like Ms Foo Mee Har and Mr R Dhinakaran, that our enforcement agencies, like the Police and NEA, continue to keep a watchful eye on other areas, and they have also increased their surveillance and monitoring to manage any disamenities and enforce law and order, where necessary. So, whilst this Bill focuses on the situation in Little India, other efforts are afoot.",20,625,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00625
2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"But is this targeting a particular community or does it have a discriminatory impact? I understand the sentiments that are expressed by some, but I want to assure all Members that these concerns are wholly unfounded, as, indeed, this was a point that was made by Ms Ellen Lee. The Bill is focused on Little India because that is where the riot occurred on 8 December 2013, with inevitable lingering security concerns. And, in fact, we continue to have large gatherings there on the weekends. So, we need measures to ensure that public order and calm are maintained at that location. And I would venture that if, in fact, this Bill had been cast more widely, reaching into other parts of Singapore, as some Members have suggested, it would have elicited a counter-criticism or accusation that it is over-reaching – and where is the justification?",21,626,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00626
2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Moreover, the provisions in the Bill are targeted at behaviour that threatens public order, and not at specific individuals, communities or businesses. The measures in the Bill apply equally to all persons, and business operators within the special zone without exception, whatever their ethnicity or nationality. Neither is the Bill a comment on the conduct of foreign workers or how they behave in Little India per se. The vast majority of foreign workers are law-abiding. We have said this, and I have said this many times they are here to earn an honest living and build a better life for their families back home. The measures being taken to maintain law and order in Little India will, in fact, serve their interest as much as the interest of any others who visit the area.",22,627,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00627
2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I now come to the specific powers. Mr Vikram Nair asked for a clarification on the intended purpose of the inspections under clause 9. Clause 9 is adopted from the special event provisions in the Public Order Act and has the following uses. First, it is used to ascertain whether a person has attempted to bring in a prohibited item into the special zone. Second, where the subject is suspected of consuming alcohol in breach of the prohibition and has hidden the alcohol, the officer may examine him and his property for any incriminating evidence. In other words, the officer is acting on reasonable suspicion. Third, where the subject is not suspected of consuming alcohol but an inspection reveals him to be in possession of alcohol after the permitted hours of sale, the officer can ask the person to reveal who sold the alcohol to him for the purposes of investigation as to whether the sale was unlawful.",23,628,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00628
2014-02-18-T-015,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Clause 9 does not, and is not intended to, penalise mere possession of alcohol. I do not think that it would be reasonably necessary for an ordinary shopper doing his weekend shopping at Mustafa – although I am told Mustafa does not sell anything alcoholic – and carrying his purchase of alcohol, to be made subject to such an inspection if there are no other accompanying circumstances indicating a possible contravention of the Bill.",24,629,2014-02-18-T-015-S-00629

Some Members have also highlighted this particular aspect of the more intrusive search provisions and I think the term used was ""strip searches"". I want to clarify and put this in context. The Bill allows for full searches to be conducted, as is the case for all events under the Public Order Act. The Police do not take this lightly and they have well-established protocols to assess when such searches are necessary and how they are to be administered, based on operational experience with various special events, including the National Day Parade each year. As with all such events, Police will calibrate the level of searches, depending on ground assessment of risks posed to the law-and-order situation at that time.",1,632,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00632
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Baey Yam Keng asked about the considerations in deciding whether to cancel or suspend the licence of a business operator. The objective of this provision is to deter businesses from committing egregious or recalcitrant violations of the alcohol restrictions. In extremis, we want to prevent them from continuing their operations while investigations and prosecution are ongoing. In particular, there will now be a measure of parity and proportionality in the treatment of errant business operators, whether or not they hold liquor licences.",2,633,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00633
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Nevertheless, I recognise that the ability to order these powers is a strong one and the Police will carry out, in answer to Mr Baey Yam Keng's question, thorough investigations to ensure there is sufficient basis that an offence had been committed and is of sufficient severity before any action is taken with respect to the licences. Due process mechanisms are also in place to provide adequate avenues for aggrieved parties to seek redress, including an avenue of appeal to the relevant Minister in charge of the licences.",3,634,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00634
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, several Members have spoken on the need for safeguards against arbitrary exercise of powers. I touched on this earlier, but perhaps the most significant safeguard in this regard is the fact that this Bill seeks to curtail the powers available to the Police, compared to the present situation. If Members can accept, and Ms Sylvia Lim in fact said so, that the extensive powers under POPA will be exercised with due restraint and safeguard by the Police and the Ministry – and many others are implying that by advocating the continued use of POPA – then, surely, you should be assured that the exercise of the limited powers under this Bill would be similarly restrained.",4,635,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00635
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Let me also assure Members that significant safeguards are in place for each power. First, the provisions themselves prescribe specific thresholds or considerations to guide the officer in his assessment. As an example, to conduct searches under clause 12, the Police must, first, have reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence under the law has been committed or is about to be committed, and that the effect and act of searching a particular person, vehicle or item would aid in detecting or stopping the offence. As an added precaution, the search power under clause 12 can only be exercised by a Police officer of or above the rank of Sergeant. No such power has been conferred on an Auxiliary Police Officer.",5,636,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00636
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Similarly, clause 11 prescribes that a Police officer or an approved auxiliary police officer may only ask a person to leave the special zone if he has reasonable grounds to suspect – from the person's demeanour or conduct – that the person is likely to breach or has breached the prohibitions, or if the person's presence or actions are likely to threaten or prejudice the maintenance of public order. In short, this power cannot be used to exclude persons without a good basis.",6,637,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00637
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Assoc Prof Eugene Tan and some others have asked if police action is warranted on the basis of reasonable suspicion or likelihood, as opposed to a higher evidentiary threshold. The intent of these provisions is to identify and defuse potential public order threats, before they escalate. That purpose will be defeated if we are to allow these threats to substantially materialise or crystallise before intervening. Nevertheless, there still has to be, I repeat, a good basis for the actions. Ultimately, Police officers have doctrine and training to ensure that they carry out these tasks responsibly and exercise sound professional judgement to take action, as appropriate, to deal with the situation before them.",7,638,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00638
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"There is also recourse to judicial review. All actions taken under this Bill are subject to judicial review and the Court will have to assess whether decisions taken by the officers/authorities are reasonable, in accordance with principles of natural justice and whether due process has been observed.",8,639,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00639
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Several Members have touched on the empowerment of Auxiliary Police Officers (APOs) under this Bill and measures to ensure they are properly equipped to exercise the powers and what are the safeguards. Firstly, only selected APOs who are authorised by the Commissioner of Police in writing can exercise the powers under the Bill. The Commissioner will only do so if he is fully satisfied that the APO being authorised is well trained and competent enough to do the job. This is the most important safeguard. Next, APOs can only exercise certain powers under the Bill, as I have explained. They do not have powers of arrest, except to remove a person, nor do they have powers of search and seizure, which are only available to Police officers of or above the rank of Sergeant.",9,640,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00640
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"There is also clear accountability and oversight by the Police on APO matters. As part of the established protocol, APOs can refer and seek advice from the Police where required. And, importantly, in difficult situations, Police will also step in to take control.",10,641,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00641
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"We have had significant experience; there has been questions raised about the training and the preparation of APOs. In the interest of time, I will keep this short. In this House, we enacted the Police Force Act expressly allowing the formation of auxiliary police forces to assist the Singapore Police Force. This was done in 2004. The APOs have been involved with the Police in a range of activities on a routine basis, including conducting spot checks during special events and policing anti-social behaviour in known congregation areas.",11,642,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00642
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"All APOs are required to undergo training for these purposes before they can be deployed, to ensure they have the requisite competencies. So, there is no reason to suggest ex ante that APOs are incompetent or incapable of performing roles under the Bill. You may have individual cases, but the system and processes are in place to ensure that they are well trained and prepared for the job. And, secondly, the specific powers in this Bill will be accorded to them, only after the Commissioner of Police has done so, specifically.",12,643,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00643
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Ms Foo Mee Har sought clarification on the immunity provision in clause 19(3), and several other Members mentioned this as well. This provision allows officers to exercise their powers to deal with various public order threats and concerns without fear that their actions will expose themselves or the Government to consequent liability to compensate for any loss incurred. This is a common provision found in many of our laws, and it is necessary where coercive or intrusive powers are provided. The immunity is only available, however, where the act is done in good faith, with reasonable care, and in the furtherance of duty. It does not exempt actions outside of these parameters. The Government and its officers remain liable for negligent acts or for acts in excess of legal powers.",13,644,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00644
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,Let me now touch on the some other points that the Members have raised.,14,645,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00645
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Several have asked whether the Government has pre-judged the causes of the riot and influenced the Committee of Inquiry process, especially with the moving of this Bill. Mdm Speaker, the stability that was restored to Little India did not come about by chance. It was the result of deliberate measures taken by the Government.",15,646,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00646
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In the aftermath of the riot, we identified several risk factors, based on operational assessments and other inputs, that could further aggravate the public order situation in Little India. These included, as I have mentioned before, large congregations and, of course, the access to alcohol. In fact, as several Members have pointed out, these were some concerns that had been there even before, and were part of the impetus behind the wider review of liquor licences and alcohol consumption that commenced before the riot.",16,647,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00647
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Given the volatile situation following the riot, the Government and other agencies adopted a proactive and prudent stance to do what was needed and sensible to restore order quickly and prevent a recurrence of civil disorder. Collectively, these measures have been accepted as useful and necessary by many stakeholders, and it has helped to restore confidence and calm. I am sure that many Singaporeans, and Members of this House, will agree that it would have been remiss of the Government, if we had reverted to business as usual and waited several months for the COI to complete its work and establish the approximate causes before taking action.",17,648,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00648
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, taking proactive and prudent measures does not amount to pre-judging the issue. This is the duty of the Government and our agencies. Let me emphasise that these measures do not in any way intend to be definitive on the actual causes of the riot or its etymology. That is for the COI to study and ascertain. The COI is a fully independent process and has been given full latitude to gather the facts in order to ascertain the causes of the riot, and, among other terms of reference, it also is assessing the agencies' response to the situation. In the interim, to protect the peace that was restored, this Bill provides for the continued implementation of the measures.",18,649,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00649
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Hri Kumar and Dr Lam Pin Min have queried the 12-month duration of the proposed Bill. Our aim is to develop a long-term solution, informed by the COI's findings and the Government consultation process on measures to restrict the consumption of alcohol in public. Twelve months should be sufficient for this purpose. This Bill will allow the Police to maintain law and order in Little India in the interim period. The law can be extended only by passage of another Bill in Parliament.",19,650,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00650
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Some have asked if the Bill is or should be a precursor to an eventual island-wide regime. This is not the case. The objectives of the Bill are distinct from the wider review of the liquor licensing regime. That review will take into consideration the views of stakeholders, as well as any findings and recommendations of the COI. We will also draw on the experience with the measures taken in Little India in considering what is sustainable in the long term. I urge Members to let the process run its course. The full set of liquor control measures will be announced when they are ready, and where new legislation is deemed necessary, it will be brought to this House for debate.",20,651,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00651
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Dr Lam Pin Min and Ms Denise Phua have asked about the broader management of foreign workers. There is an inter-agency effort under MOM's leadership. It has been at work even before this incident. They have addressed a range of issues, not just about social disamenities, or concerns about foreign workers and their welfare, but also on security matters, and on what else can be done to educate the workers, and implementing appropriate measures in their neighbourhoods. The committee will certainly consider the feedback that is being provided after the riot, and put forth and execute appropriate measures as needed.",21,652,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00652
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I also want to add that in the aftermath of the riot, Mr Shanmugam, myself, Mr Dhinakaran, Mr Vikram Nair and several of us went to the dormitories and other areas. There is work afoot to enhance some of the facilities and services for the workers who reside in these dormitories, or visit the recreation centres. These include remittance services and other recreational facilities.",22,653,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00653
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,Ms Ellen Lee's point on making employers more responsible for educating their workers on our laws is an important one. I assure Ms Lee that the relevant Government agencies will continue to work on this effort.,23,654,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00654
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"There were some concerns about the impact of the measures on foreign worker congregation and on Little India. Since the implementation of the measures, our agencies have not noted any significant displacement effect on foreign workers to other areas. Police will continue to monitor the situation and adjust their resources as necessary.",24,655,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00655
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Assoc Prof Eugene Tan has argued that the Bill casts a chilling effect on Little India. I would offer a different perspective – if another incident were to occur in Little India, the effect would not be chilling; it would be disastrous. Little India is, and continues to be, a place of interest and enjoyment for residents, business operators, foreign workers and tourists alike. Drinking continues to be permitted in licensed premises during weekends, and most activities can continue unencumbered. By providing a safer law and order environment, the measures we have taken, in fact, serve to preserve and enhance the colour and vibrancy of Little India, not detract from it.",25,656,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00656
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In this regard, I want to state that we are very heartened that stakeholders in Little India, including business entities, have come forward to support the measures taken despite the fact that some of them have been affected adversely by some of the restrictions imposed. Many have, in fact, welcomed the measures and saw them as an improvement over the pre-riot conditions.",26,657,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00657
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Nevertheless, we are mindful of the potential impact on residents and businesses, and will seek to minimise them wherever possible. For instance, many of the measures imposed in the immediate aftermath, such as the restrictions on alcohol and bus services, have subsequently been relaxed. The Bill also provides for discretion to vary or tweak the measures over this period. Much will depend on the ground situation, which the Police will carefully monitor and assess. And we will continue to engage our stakeholders and take into account their feedback as we look at the longer-term solutions.",27,658,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00658
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, Ms Lina Chiam has suggested that we commit this Bill to a Select Committee. I would argue against that. First, there is no need to put this Bill through a Select Committee because, as I have repeatedly stressed, the powers in the Bill are, in fact, far less than what is available in the POPA and there are no new powers. The POPA is far too powerful for our needs in Little India. There is also, secondly, an immediate need for the law to allow our ground agencies to continue to implement the measures effectively.",28,659,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00659
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I believe all the substantive issues raised by Members have been well-debated. There is a range of views, and I think we have addressed them substantively. In the absence of any exceptional circumstances that one can point to, we should not delay the implementation of this Bill. Therefore, we should not consider committing it to a Select Committee.",29,660,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00660
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, I think I have substantively covered the points that have been made. I want to stress again that the riot on 8 December 2013 was a very serious one, and it is important that all of us, Members of this House and Singaporeans, recognise that we cannot afford to take our safety and security for granted. We must be ready to prevent the occurrence of a similar incident. This means taking proactive steps where they are necessary, and ensuring that our law enforcement agencies possess sufficient and effective means to deal with and defuse situations that can threaten public order. This Bill that is before the House today is a very important part of this effort. We have sought to balance the powers that are needed against the impact on the community. This Bill provides for a limited set of powers, far less than that presently available, to be applied to a limited location, for a limited duration.",30,661,2014-02-18-T-017-S-00661
2014-02-18-T-017,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Until the Committee of Inquiry's recommendations and the longer-term measures are ready, this Bill will serve to maintain peace and public order in Little India for the safety and security of all.

2014-02-18-T-019,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The SAF embarked on its 3rd Generation transformation in the early 2000s, to build a more capable force that could address a wider range of threats. The new SAF would use technology to have better command and control, strike with more precision and use more unmanned systems. The SAF has succeeded in this transformation and stands ready to respond to foreseeable threats. These include the threats of terrorism, piracy, natural disasters and cyber-threats.",1,670,2014-02-18-T-019-S-00670
2014-02-18-T-019,Ng Eng Hen,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"The SAF has also re-organised itself to be more responsive and potent. This includes the set up of the Island Defence Task Force, Maritime Security Task Force and Special Operations Task Force. We will work closely with Homefront and other Government agencies like the Maritime and Port Authority and Singapore Customs, to help to keep Singapore safe. Most recently, we have also set up the National Maritime Security System to protect the sea lines of communication and territorial waters around Singapore.

2014-02-18-T-020,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"asked the Minister for Transport given the low supply of COEs for the period from February to April 2014, whether the Ministry will consider suspending the claw-back of COEs due to past over-projections until the number of de-registered cars increases substantially in 2015/2016.",1,672,2014-02-18-T-020-S-00672

These professionals are experienced examiners as well as university academics from reputable institutions of higher learning, and they specialise in a wide range of subjects.

2014-02-18-T-022,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong (for the Prime Minister),MAS monitors the level of household leverage in Singapore closely. The focus is on banks as bank lending accounts for more than 98% of household credit granted by commercial entities.

2014-02-18-T-022,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong (for the Prime Minister),"MAS also works closely with these Government agencies to implement policies to encourage financial prudence among Singapore households. For example, the maximum amount of unsecured borrowings by any individual is generally capped at four months' income per lender. This is regardless of whether he borrows from a financial institution regulated by MAS, or a moneylender regulated by MinLaw. Likewise, a single set of rules on loan tenures and loan-to-value ratios for motor vehicle loans applies to borrowers, regardless of whether the loans are granted by financial institutions, hire-purchase companies or moneylenders. For housing loans, MAS' rules require financial institutions to take into account borrowers' total outstanding debt obligations, including housing loans from the HDB, motor vehicle loans under hire-purchase arrangements and loans extended by moneylenders.",3,681,2014-02-18-T-022-S-00681

The admission decisions for the DAS take into account the overall strengths of a candidate by considering the applicant's achievements and an interview by the faculty.",1,697,2014-02-18-T-026-S-00697
