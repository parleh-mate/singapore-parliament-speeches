2017-03-08-T-001,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked	 the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider setting up a drone port to accommodate the rising transport of goods via drones.,1,1,2017-03-08-T-001-S-00001
2017-03-08-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Madam, today is International Women's Day. Let me wish you, the Leader of our House and all the women in this House a great day ahead. [",1,2,2017-03-08-T-001-S-00002
2017-03-08-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"I agree wholeheartedly, Minister.",1,3,2017-03-08-T-001-S-00003
2017-03-08-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Let me do my part. We recognise the potential for drones to be deployed for a large variety of uses both in the public and private sectors. We have been facilitating this while making sure that associated aviation safety, public safety and security risks are addressed.",1,4,2017-03-08-T-001-S-00004
2017-03-08-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"On the use of drones to transport goods within Singapore, the technology is not yet mature for safe, widespread deployment in a densely populated, urban environment. We have been facilitating trials to better understand the technologies and the implementation and safety issues. One example is the Skyways Project between CAAS and Airbus Helicopters on the use of drones for last-mile parcel delivery at the NUS campus. We will be initiating other trials.",2,5,2017-03-08-T-001-S-00005
2017-03-08-T-001,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Minister for his answer. Just a few supplementary questions. Firstly, is the Ministry monitoring the progress of drone port projects that appear to have started elsewhere, I believe in Rwanda and Nevada, USA, to see if there is something that we can learn from that?",1,6,2017-03-08-T-001-S-00006
2017-03-08-T-001,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Secondly, is the Ministry considering any kind of central infrastructure in the future, when the technology is more mature, that could enable us to harness the economic benefits from the forthcoming drone industry for instance, maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO), charging and other functions of that nature?",2,7,2017-03-08-T-001-S-00007
2017-03-08-T-001,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Thirdly, could the Minister share an update on the regulatory framework, whether the Ministry is forward planning the regulatory framework for a future where, maybe a few years down the road, drones may be widely used in the logistics industry?",3,8,2017-03-08-T-001-S-00008
2017-03-08-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Indeed, we are not alone in trying out these various technologies and their applications. Yes, I am familiar with the Rwanda project. Last year, at the Venice Biennale, the British architect Norman Foster set up a pilot drone port. His idea was to set up one, preferably using recyclable materials. Out of that drone port, you can deliver drugs, medicine and so on to different parts of Africa. That was just an idea. Someone sort of picked up the idea and decided to do it in Rwanda. It is very early days.",1,9,2017-03-08-T-001-S-00009
2017-03-08-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Elsewhere in the US, UK and Europe, there are many such experiments being tested out. UPS is trying out mobile drone ports by using the roof of their UPS vans so that you can move around and launch your drones off the roof-top of your van.",2,10,2017-03-08-T-001-S-00010
2017-03-08-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Everybody is learning from one another. Singapore, ourselves, should be at the forefront of all these and that explains our proof-of-concept project with Airbus. Very soon, we will be launching a Request for Proposal for similar bright ideas. Do not forget that to run a trial is not cheap. As there are many such ideas, our job is to take a good look, select the better ones, especially those which can bring benefits for Singaporeans or help build capabilities among our companies.",3,11,2017-03-08-T-001-S-00011
2017-03-08-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The second question about whether there is any coordination or centralisation, the answer is yes, there is. My Ministry leads in this drone project. There is a multi-agency committee, led by us, to explore how else we can make use of drones and also to see how we can tap on scale, especially when we want to purchase either equipment, drones or solutions.",4,12,2017-03-08-T-001-S-00012
2017-03-08-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The third part about regulations, the answer is also yes. Out of that inter-agency committee, we worked on the first draft for the regulation of drones. As I have said, it has impact on safety, security and so on. My predecessor brought the Bill to this House. The Member was not in this House then, so he was not aware. We were among the first in the world to have a regulatory framework governing drones. As technology makes progress, we have to keep on tweaking the regulations.",5,13,2017-03-08-T-001-S-00013
2017-03-08-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Last year, when I was in Montreal for the ICAO meeting, our regulatory framework was a subject of great interest from many countries, because everyone is facing the same problem. Problem in the sense of the downside impact of the technology; but the upside potential is huge. The key is how to tap upside potential, while minimising downside effect.",6,14,2017-03-08-T-001-S-00014
2017-03-08-T-001,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,Sorry for this long-winded reply.,7,15,2017-03-08-T-001-S-00015
2017-03-08-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Mr Perera, your second question.",1,16,2017-03-08-T-001-S-00016
2017-03-08-T-002,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked	 the Prime Minister (a) over the past two terms of Parliament, how many times has the Presidential Council for Minority Rights suggested changes to, or withheld assent to, a Bill passed in Parliament; (b) when have these actions taken place; and (c) over what issues have the Council proposed changes or withheld its assent.",1,17,2017-03-08-T-002-S-00017

2017-03-08-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,"The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister)","First, under Article 77 of the Constitution, the function of the Presidential Council for Minority Rights (PCMR) is to draw attention to any legislation that it considers to be disadvantageous to persons of any racial or religious community. The Council's function is not to suggest changes to, or withhold assent to, legislation.",2,19,2017-03-08-T-002-S-00019
2017-03-08-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,"The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister)","Second, the Member should be aware that the Council's opinion is publicly available. May I draw the Member's attention to Parliament's website, or National Archives Online at www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/government_records/highlights.",3,20,2017-03-08-T-002-S-00020
2017-03-08-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,"The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister)","Since Independence, the PAP Government has made equality of races and religions fundamental to its vision of a multi-racial, multi-religious Singapore. Therefore, it is most unlikely that any legislation from the Government will disadvantage any racial or religious group and cause the Council to raise any objection. Nevertheless, the PAP Government created the PCMR as a unique institution that will help to protect the rights of minorities and reassure minority communities of their place in Singapore. The PCMR, as an institution and process, is valuable, in case any legislation passed inadvertently disadvantages any party, or there comes a day when a different government in Singapore operates on a different basis.",4,21,2017-03-08-T-002-S-00021
2017-03-08-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,"The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister)","In addition, before a Bill is introduced in Parliament, it goes through legal and legal policy oversight. Ministries seek the Attorney-General's Chambers' (AGC) legal advice on the legality of their actions before implementing policies by way of new legislation or legislative amendment. MinLaw examines draft legislation to ensure that it is consistent with the Constitution and other legal policies. These include, for instance, whether the Bill might directly or indirectly be disadvantageous to persons from particular racial or religious communities. By the time a Bill reaches the PCMR, it would have been subject to three layers of checks  first, reviews by the AGC; second, MinLaw; and third, by Parliament. Former Chief Justice, Mr Chan Sek Keong, now Senior Judge, had previously observed that it is for similar reasons that the volume of judicial review in Singapore is relatively low.",5,22,2017-03-08-T-002-S-00022
2017-03-08-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,"The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister)","Over the past two terms of Parliament, no legislation passed by Parliament has received an adverse report by the PCMR. The fact that there has not been any adverse reports bears testament to the robustness of the system of checks that we have and the commitment of the PAP Government to racial and religious equality.",6,23,2017-03-08-T-002-S-00023
2017-03-08-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,"The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister)","The Member would be familiar with the Bills passed in the past few years. If the Member believes that the PCMR should have drawn attention to a certain Bill, we would be happy to invite him to indicate the Bills which he is referring to.",7,24,2017-03-08-T-002-S-00024
2017-03-08-T-002,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Minister for his response. Just one supplementary question. Would the Minister be able to share if the PCMR in the past, at anytime in the course of its deliberations, has requested to interview any public servants or experts, or requested any data from the Government in order to assess the economic, social or other impact of any legislation?",1,25,2017-03-08-T-002-S-00025
2017-03-08-T-002,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Madam, as I have said, before any Bill is presented to the PCMR, it would have gone through three layers of checks. At any point in time, if the PCMR feels that it needs other resources or references, it would be at its own prerogative and it has the privilege to call on anybody to give his necessary input. But at any one point in time, before the Bill is presented to the PCMR, it would have gone through three layers of checks  the AGC, the MinLaw and Parliament.",1,26,2017-03-08-T-002-S-00026

2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Madam, there are many who say that we live in an era where fast-developing technologies are disrupting businesses and industries at an extremely fast pace.",2,31,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00031
2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"This is, however, not historically unprecedented. Trains reigned supreme until the emergence of automobiles and airplanes. Electricity replaced kerosene as our energy source for light. Steel outmuscled iron, bricks and mortar to allow us to build superstructures such as skyscrapers and bridges over large bodies of water.",3,32,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00032
2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Each and every time this happened, incumbent industries suffered and new ones boomed. This is the cycle of technology and business.",4,33,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00033
2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Just the other day, I read of Netflix's US$105 million purchase of Martin Scorsese's new gangster film starring Robert De Niro named ""The Irishman"". I must confess that I did not know what Netflix was. As usual, when it comes to technology, my daughters had to educate their father about how I can now watch award-winning TV shows, movies and documentaries, on-demand, via streaming through the Internet for a reasonably small subscription fee.",5,34,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00034
2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Through large volume subscriptions, Netflix now has the resources to compete with traditional movie production houses and even begin production of movies and shows of their own.",6,35,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00035
2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Locally, I understand that Netflix is fast gaining popularity amongst Singaporeans. What does this mean for cable television providers, such as StarHub and Singtel? How about movie theatres? Netflix has the latest content, with easy on-demand access, at a cost lower than cable television or movie theatres. While it is too early to tell what will happen next in the movie/TV entertainment industry, what we do know is that business can no longer be conducted ""as usual"" in the industry.",7,36,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00036
2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),Netflix's entry into the movie/TV entertainment industry is not unlike the entry of private hire cars into the point-to-point transportation industry.,8,37,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00037
2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Private hire car companies made their foray into Singapore in 2013. Of these, Uber and Grab now constitute the largest market share. A key reason for the rapid growth of private hire car services in Singapore is their ability to address the perennial complaint of Singapore commuters − the difficulty of getting taxis during peak hours, in remote areas and during inclement weather. This is despite Singapore having one of the highest taxis-to-population ratios in the world.",9,38,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00038
2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Private hire car companies are able to plug this service gap through their mobile apps which provide a platform to efficiently match private hire car drivers and passengers directly in real time and space. Acting as a marginal supplier, private hire car drivers come onto the road readily to soak up latent demand as and when required. This significantly shrinks transaction costs, giving passengers greater choices and value.",10,39,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00039
2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),Taxi drivers facing increased competition were naturally displeased. They argue that taxis have to adhere to a fixed schedule of charges and comply with availability requirements. There was a daily minimum mileage that taxi drivers needed to clock and a specified number of taxis need to ply the streets during peak periods. This makes them inflexible in pricing and uncompetitive against private hire cars.,11,40,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00040
2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"There were, initially, also no regulatory requirements for anyone to be an Uber or Grab driver. All you needed was a driving licence and a car. No mandatory background checks were required. Private hire car drivers were not required to apply for or take any tests to obtain a vocational licence.",12,41,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00041
2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),Uber and Grab used technology as leverage to match demand with supply and reduced transaction costs considerably to capture a significant portion of the point-to-point transportation market.,13,42,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00042
2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Private hire cars tripled its numbers on our roads in as many years. Private hire car drivers, on the other hand, point to exclusive advantages that taxis enjoy. Taxis are allowed to pick up passengers who hail them on the streets. Taxis also enjoy exemption from the child seat rule, which mandates that all children under 1.35 metres in height are required to be in a child seat when travelling in a car.",14,43,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00043
2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),All the above issues have been well-aired in the mass media.,15,44,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00044
2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Madam, perhaps the pertinent question to ask is this  what is the Government's stand on this? Should the Government support the plea from some taxi drivers to ban private hire cars in Singapore? Or should the Government adopt a laissez-faire approach and allow the free market to regulate itself?",16,45,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00045
2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"The Government picked an answer somewhere in between. Private hire car drivers are now subject to regulatory requirements. They, too, need to apply for a vocational licence which subjects them to screening and training. This not only levelled the playing field with taxi drivers but, more importantly, addressed the safety and competency concerns of commuters.",17,46,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00046
2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"However, the Government did not step in nor interfered directly with the disruption that technology has caused in the point-to-point transportation industry. Uber and Grab were filling a demand and consumers were, ultimately, benefiting from wider choices at better value.",18,47,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00047
2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"In fact, recent trends suggest that the industry, on the whole, may have benefited from the disruption. Minister Khaw had, in his reply to a Parliamentary Question on 20 February 2017, revealed that the total number of taxi trips remained relatively stable, with only a slight drop from 967,000 trips in 2013 to 954,000 trips in 2016.",19,48,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00048
2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"With private hire cars tripling in numbers since 2013, the statistics suggest that the ""pie"" for point-to-point transport has grown larger. A larger ""pie"" means that the industry can sustain both taxis and private hire cars, while consumers continue to enjoy the best of both worlds at better value. Everybody wins.",20,49,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00049
2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"The competition provided by private hire cars has now forced traditional taxi operators, who have been slow to change without competition, to consider revamping their pricing models in order to remain competitive and relevant. There was news last week that several taxi operators, including ComfortDelgro, Trans Cab and Premier Taxi, were all considering implementing the surge pricing model used by private hire cars. This is a positive sign for commuters and the industry.",21,50,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00050
2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"New technologies will always disrupt stable, entrenched industries. This is clear from past and present examples. No industry will remain relevant in perpetuity. Stifling new innovative technology can only end in a negative outcome for the overall Singapore economy.",22,51,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00051
2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Madam, however, as I had raised in my Budget Debate speech, it is extremely important that we do not lose sight of the perspective of the individual Singaporean; the issues and difficulties that each Singaporean and their families face in their day-to-day lives.",23,52,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00052
2017-03-08-T-004,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"I use a simple example. I had said in my Budget Debate speech that I empathised with taxi drivers. Why did I say that?

2017-03-08-T-004,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),I would like to ask the Ministry  what are its plans to improve maintenance and expedite the replacement of old trains? May I ask whether LTA is considering employing a regime of predictive maintenance instead of waiting until something goes wrong? This will help us enhance the reliability of trains and tracks from contributing to breakdowns.,2,60,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00060
2017-03-08-T-004,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"One other issue that concerns estates, such as the new BTOs of Keat Hong Pride and Crest in my constituency, is that they are not covered by noise barriers today. Trains on the North-South line increase in frequency due to signalling enhancements and, quite often, you can also hear trains travelling towards depots past midnight. Many residents are impacted by the level of noise from the tracks and trains. Residents have complained that the noise from concrete sleepers is much louder, compared to the old wooden ones.",3,61,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00061
2017-03-08-T-004,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"NEA has set acceptable noise levels in decibels. Can I ask if this is a determining factor and what is the acceptable decibel level for LTA to put in place noise barriers? In our current situation, it does seem that LTA has put the responsibility on HDB to put in place noise mitigation measures, and we seem to be going in circles. If, indeed, the decibel levels are equivalent or higher compared to the areas that have benefited from noise barriers, such as those that are being implemented just 100 metres to 200 meters along the current track, then the decision to implement noise barriers should be quite clear-cut. LTA needs to be transparent in the criteria to implement noise barriers which, currently, is not clear to the public.",4,62,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00062

In recent years, MOT has done a significant job in reducing MRT breakdowns. The Minister has set a very bold target of increasing the Mean Kilometre before Failure (MKBF) to 400 kilometres, a standard comparable to Hong Kong and Taiwan's sub-way, and this is laudable.",1,63,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00063
2017-03-08-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"However, the recent MRT breakdowns that concentrate between Jurong East and Joo Koon stations have greatly inconvenienced Jurong residents. There were at least three major breakdowns between these two stations in January alone and there are numerous incidents where the residents had to add tens of minutes of travelling time between the two stations. These unfortunate incidents often occurred during the peak hours, affecting thousands of Jurong residents.",2,64,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00064
2017-03-08-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),May I know whether LTA has identified the problems that caused the frequent breakdowns and delays specifically between the Jurong East and Joo Koon MRT stations? Are there plans to improve the train reliability between these two stations? Or would it be helpful to increase the engineering hours to fix the problems? I hope the Minister can look at this seriously.,3,65,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00065
2017-03-08-T-004,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Madam, at the Committee of Supply (COS) in 2016, I highlighted the alarming regularity of train faults, breakdowns and disruptions, and asked for the Ministry's plans to abate these unacceptable occurrences.",1,66,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00066
2017-03-08-T-004,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Unfortunately, I have to repeat the cut again this year. Contrary to recent survey findings, train breakdowns and delays have been happening so frequently that commuters are getting increasingly frustrated. For example, half a dozen track circuit-related delays on the Clementi-Joo Koon stretch of the line have occurred in the past one and a half months, while a quick search on The Straits Times and TODAY from May to December 2016 brought up at least 18 times a train breakdown was reported. So, there are at least two breakdowns or more a month and these do not include the train faults and delays that were not reported.",2,67,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00067

2017-03-08-T-004,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"As I have said at the COS last year, Singaporeans should not have to get used to this regularity of disruptions. We should expect our system to have far fewer disruptions. We should also be greatly concerned with the loss of productivity to all our workers and our economy arising from the man-hours lost to all delays.",4,69,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00069
2017-03-08-T-004,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"So, I would like to ask the Minister what is the Ministry's assessment of the recent breakdowns?

Despite the presence of the Downtown Line's Hillview station, these Hume residents are caught in a long 2.6 km unserved span between Hillview and Beauty World MRT stations. This stretch is more than double the average 1.1 km distance found between most MRT stations. So, Hume residents have little choice but to make their way to Hillview or Beauty World MRT stations via a detour and crowded buses.",4,75,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00075
2017-03-08-T-004,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),I sincerely appeal to MOT and LTA to review the merits of opening Hume MRT station. The Hillview and Hume resident population is set to increase further with the addition of more condominium projects to the current 20 over condominiums present in that belt.,5,76,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00076

2017-03-08-T-004,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"We appreciate the recent addition of bus number 973 last month. It is connecting the areas between Bukit Panjang, Hillview Avenue and Hume Avenue. We are grateful for City Direct bus number 653 that has made it easier for Hillview and Hume residents to get to and from the CBD area at peak hours. Many residents have told me that because of the convenience and comfortable ride on bus number 653, they now leave their cars at home on weekdays.",12,83,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00083
2017-03-08-T-004,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"These improvements are moving us nearer the vision of a green and car-lite Singapore. With new train lines and more public buses, more Singapore residents are taking public transport to work. According to the last General Household Survey in 2015, 59% of residents aged 15 years and above took the MRT and/or public bus to work or school. This is a rise of 4% from the year 2010.",13,84,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00084
2017-03-08-T-004,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"We certainly want to encourage such commuter behaviour. However, we still face some bus connectivity challenges in Bukit Gombak. For instance, to get to Hillview MRT station, our Hume residents need to backtrack in their bus routes, and buses are always packed during peak hours. Those going to the city via the Beauty World MRT station are often subject to a long wait because most buses plying Upper Bukit Timah Road are full by the time they reach Bukit Gombak. Many residents report waiting 15 minutes or even more before boarding a bus. In addition, the new bus 973 can only stop 200 metres ahead of Hillview MRT Station instead of the bus stop just outside the Hillview MRT station, because of the bus route. I want to reaffirm my thanks and gratitude to the LTA team for working hand-in-hand with us. There has been much progress but in terms of offering a good ""first-and-last-mile"" experience, we do still have room for improvement.",14,85,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00085

Currently, the location is under-served in terms of access to the MRT stations of Hillview, Bukit Gombak and Beauty World. We estimate about half of residents in the constituency do not have public transport connections to the Community Club, which is scheduled to open later this year.",15,86,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00086

The worst bus services in Nee Soon South are bus Nos 860 and 811 which pick up residents from new BTOs, like Acacia Breeze, Palm Breeze, Oleander Breeze, Angsana Breeze and Saraca Breeze, to Khatib MRT and Yishun MRT stations respectively. It is common to hear residents feedback that they must miss three or four buses before they can board as they are often over-packed − not so much of a ""breeze"" at all.",2,90,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00090

I have put up requests for two condominiums, The Estuary and Forest Hill, and I hope this Budget will have good news for my residents. In fact, previously, it was offered to The Estuary but, at that time, they did not take it up because LTA had one caveat  they must build a covered linkway from the nearest block to their back gate, then LTA will continue from the back gate to the bus stop.

Under this programme, we have seen an injection of more buses over the past years. However, the current infrastructure, particularly the older bus interchanges, were not expanded to cope with the increase in buses. Bus captains now need to wait longer for available bus parking lots, which affect their already-short layover time.

I would like to urge the tripartite partners to collaborate with the union to do more to protect our bus captains. On the union's part, we will work with the public bus operators to make a police report for every case of assault against our bus captains. I hope investigations of such cases by the Police would be handled promptly and there should be strict prosecution of offenders.

With a smaller quota, the COE would be driven up, and the impact would be acutely felt by those who depend on motorcycles for their livelihood. The Singapore Motor Cycle Trade Association provided this feedback to Land Transport Authority, and SCCCI also helped to lobby by adding our views.",3,118,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00118

Motorcyles are the lifeblood for many of our working class. The recent effort to remove motorcycles from contributing to the Open Category COE is a good move, because it will mean more motorcycle COEs available than otherwise. Despite that, however, the recent motorcycle COE auction price continued to edge up.

2017-03-08-T-004,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"First, would MOT consider delaying the implementation of Euro 6 diesel standards by one year, from the current 1 January 2018, so as to give key LGV vendors time to ready the full range of vehicles, which includes more vehicles with manual transmission drive? Why is this necessary? At the Traffic Police department, foreign worker drivers need to prove that they have a manual Class 3 driving licence, which is a near impossibility, given the countries they come from. Otherwise, they will be issued automatic Class 3 driving licence. So, not having many manual transmission vehicles available for purchase is going to create real operational challenges for many companies.",3,123,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00123
2017-03-08-T-004,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Second, would MOT consider allowing LGV owners to renew their COEs with tenures equivalent to their remaining statutory lifespan, versus the current five-year mark, so as to reduce the cost and cash flow associated with the extended COEs?",4,124,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00124

When in full operation, the entire Downtown Line should serve a daily ridership of more than half a million commuters. A recent study found that one out of six rides on the Downtown Line was made using new EZ-Link cards. So, these are new travellers.

This year, we will replace the old third rail system which had been causing some problems to the East-West Line recently. We will soon complete the upgrading of the signalling system for the North-South Line, which will bring a lot of benefits to many residents, including the residents of my favourite Member of Parliament, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah. Next year, we will do the same for the East-West Line. But let me sound an alert. Re-signalling is a complex engineering operation. Er Dr Lee Bee Wah knows that. Getting it done perfectly, flawlessly, is almost impossible. That has been the painful experience of London, Hong Kong and Taipei. They warned us that we should expect many teething problems when we cut over the signalling system to the new one this year. So, I am all mentally prepared for criticisms from Er Dr Lee Bee Wah.

We have very old signalling components there which need replacement. We are planning to replace them. But, sometimes, maintenance and replacement works cannot be completed during the limited engineering hours. That is why train service for that stretch was occasionally impacted when planned works extended into revenue hours.

Indeed, predictive maintenance is the way to go. We are acquiring the necessary tools and capabilities for this purpose. These include new generation automatic track inspection systems and condition monitoring tools for real-time data collection and analysis. I also hear Mr Zaqy's concern about the noise generated from passing trains. We are aligned with the NEA on what is the acceptable level of noise. We are closely monitoring the situation and are implementing system-wide noise mitigation measures. Our trains have noise-dampening wheels and our operators are servicing the train wheels and tracks more frequently. Where necessary, we will install noise barriers. This is, however, a major multi-year programme, as we have to coordinate it closely with so many other maintenance, improvement and upgrading works that compete for precious engineering hours.",27,154,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00154

I appreciate Mayor Low Yen Ling's feedback on new bus services in Bukit Gombak. But I know that we can never do enough. I have heard her call for better connectivity to the upcoming Community Club in Bukit Gombak. She is a very good Member of Parliament and I have a soft spot for good Members. Another good Member is Er Dr Lee Bee Wah. I have also heard her feedback on Services 811 and 860, and for more covered linkways. We will see what else we can do. But let me also plead and seek Members' understanding that, for financial prudence, bus service provisions require a minimum ridership. If ridership goes down as commuters switch to rail, we will have to remove or amend existing bus services.

This is another major transformation in the transport sector and for the bus industry. Next month, we will be awarding the tender for the third bus package at Seletar. The tender has now been closed. I was looking at the bids and it has attracted very competitive bids, with lower prices, on average, compared to the previous two tenders. This is good for taxpayers. Later this year, we will call the tender for our fourth package at Bukit Merah. With competition, bus operators are working harder to improve their service.

2017-03-08-T-004,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"As Mr Melvin Yong pointed out, our bus captains are the key to delivering higher service levels. Our bus captains strive to improve bus arrival regularity and reduce bunching − a very big complaint from the ground. LTA has set fair but ambitious standards, and our bus captains are working closely with their service controllers to manage bus arrivals real-time. That is why, sometimes, some buses on certain routes have to be driven very slowly. That is because they want to arrive punctually, as scheduled, because road conditions can vary during the day. And this is the only way to solve the bunching problem. If you want the bus drivers to drive as fast as the roads can take, then sometimes they may arrive too early and there will be complaints about bunching. But I accept that this is still a new system, both for regulators as well as the regulatee, and we shall see how else we can calibrate the system to make it work better for us. But it has worked very well elsewhere − London, Australian cities − and I see no reason why it cannot work here, too.",30,157,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00157

Going car-lite is, however, a journey. Meanwhile, the various vehicle control policies, like COE and ERP, remain relevant. But from time to time, we refine them as circumstances change. And one big move we made this year is to stop the contribution of motorcycle COEs to the Open Category. Very few motorcycles have been registered under Category E COEs due to the high Category E premiums. This recent move will stabilise the motorcycle population.

They are now trying to reverse the trend. Paris, Madrid, Athens and Mexico City have all announced that they will ban diesel vehicles from their city centres, latest by 2030. I think we, too, should nudge down the population of diesel vehicles and work towards becoming a diesel-free city.

In the earlier years, I remember, as a young officer in the Civil Service, our objective was to split the responsibility in transport by having taxpayers pay for the construction of the infrastructure, in other words, capital expenditure (capex) − the Government and the taxpayers pay for it. But commuters must bear the operating costs through transport fares. In other words, transport fares must be able to cover the operating costs. But over the years, as fares have not kept up with rising costs, taxpayers have to subsidise more and more of the operating costs, especially as we have been raising service standards significantly.",41,168,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00168

2017-03-08-T-004,Khaw Boon Wan,The Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Fares are regulated by the independent Public Transport Council (PTC), through a multi-year fare formula. The current fare formula will expire after this year's fare exercise. The PTC will be reviewing the formula. They will consult widely. I am confident that they will decide wisely. Last year, they took a big step to standardise the train fares across all MRT lines and no longer make a distinction between above-ground and underground lines. This was a major step. They slayed a sacred cow!",43,170,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00170

The private hire car industry has set themselves up to fill the gaps in availability of the traditional taxi companies. Now that taxi companies are moving in the same direction, many Singaporeans are concerned that there is no longer fare certainty if both the taxi firms and private car hires all adopt surge pricing. Also, many asked if they will be hit with a double whammy now that LTA has just relaxed earlier this year the requirements for taxi availability.

2017-03-08-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, the space available on buses for wheelchairs. The Minister previously confirmed that 92% of public buses today are wheelchair-accessible and the goal is to make this 100% by 2020. While certainly welcome, the fact is that the number of wheelchairs that a bus can accommodate is very limited. According to the operators' websites, SMRT buses can accommodate two wheelchairs, while some SBS Transit buses can only accommodate one.",2,190,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00190
2017-03-08-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I have received feedback from disabled persons living in a charitable home about the difficulties posed when a few wheelchair-bound persons need to travel at the same time. Due to the limited space on board, they would need to board the buses in turn and wait at their destinations for subsequent buses carrying their friends to arrive, greatly increasing their travelling time.",3,191,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00191
2017-03-08-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Besides their personal situation, they also rightly point out that as the general population ages, we can expect that a few wheelchair-bound persons may need to be on board the same bus at the same time.

2017-03-08-T-004,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Secondly, while we may have made good infrastructural improvements and removed physical barriers, it is vital that our public transport emergency plans provide for the safety and safe evacuation of persons with disabilities. Should a contingency arise, say, in the MRT system that requires evacuation or diversion of passengers, do our emergency plans spell out how we will communicate and protect those who are physically or mentally impaired, including the wheelchair-bound or those impaired in vision or hearing? To what extent have such plans been exercised?",5,193,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00193
2017-03-08-T-004,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Madam, LTA said last December that the Silver Zone initiative will be rolled out to many parts of Singapore by 2023.

2017-03-08-T-004,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"First, the implementation of the Silver Zone programme must go hand-in-hand with the widening of the pedestrian footpaths in the area. This is because the roads in the Silver Zone will be narrowed substantially to slow down traffic in the area. This will leave very little room for cyclists to manoeuvre. As some pinch points along Hougang Avenue 5 are designated Silver Zones, there is virtually no room for cyclists and buses to co-exist. Due to safety concerns, cyclists may take to the footpath and this will create another set of problems. The elderly, expectant mothers and young children are all at risk when cyclists are forced to share footpaths that are not designed to be shared in the first place. Without the widening of the pedestrian footpath for Silver Zone, it is an accident waiting to happen, either on the narrow road or on the narrow footpath.",2,195,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00195
2017-03-08-T-004,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Second, the courtesy crossing is probably one of the most misunderstood features of the Silver Zone initiative. Some courtesy crossings are designed to look like zebra crossings without the white stripes and light poles. In fact, when the Silver Zone was done up in Hougang, a few residents told me the contractors forgot to pain the white stripes and left.",3,196,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00196
2017-03-08-T-004,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Who is supposed to show courtesy at such crossing − the pedestrian or the motorist? According to LTA, it is the responsibility of the pedestrian to keep a look-out for on-coming vehicles at such crossings. Madam, here lies the confusion. I have seen motorists stopping for pedestrians to cross, while others did not. It is made more confusing when motorists have to slow down at such crossings due to the pinch points and the elevated crossing, but they may not have the intention to stop for pedestrians to cross. Furthermore, motorists may show courtesy on one side of the road while, on the other side, they may not. How would the pedestrians know who will stop for them? There is too much second-guessing at courtesy crossings, and that is a recipe for accidents to happen.",4,197,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00197
2017-03-08-T-004,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The term ""courtesy crossing"" is a misnomer to begin with because there is no change to the way pedestrians are supposed to cross the road. We look left, look right and look left again before we make a judgement call to cross the road. The pedestrians still have to stop for vehicles to pass. So, what is this added courtesy all about?",5,198,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00198
2017-03-08-T-004,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The Silver Zone is a good initiative. The safety concerns for cyclists and pedestrians over the narrow footpaths can be easily addressed. The confusion over the courtesy crossing, however, needs to be addressed sooner rather than later.

Without adequate enforcement, there is a real risk that riders may simply ignore the LTA rules and ride recklessly. In the process, they endanger other road or footpath users.

So, I used the Obike app to unlock the bicycle and tried riding it. It was very easy to use. I was even given a $3 credit when I registered online. From the Obike app, I could see that the yellow rental bicycles were in abundance in availability in the nearby blocks as well as at the Lakeside MRT station. It was so convenient. Ofo and Obike have indicated that they will push out a few thousand bicycles over the next few months without the need for fixed docking stations.

2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"Let me first share how we will leverage big data, mobile technology and automation, to make our transport system better and smarter.",3,230,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00230
2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),We will use big data and analytics to improve train reliability. We will be deploying condition monitoring tools on our trains and equipment to collect data more extensively and on a real-time basis. All 66 new trains that the Minister mentioned for the North-South East-West Lines and our new power supply system will be equipped with monitoring sensors across all these.,4,231,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00231
2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"We will also be deploying a new-generation Automatic Track Inspection System for the Downtown Line. Imaging sensors and lasers will be installed on revenue trains to scan the tracks of the entire Downtown Line to detect anomalies, so that we can arrest any faults early.",5,232,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00232
2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"With such data, we will be able to improve the maintenance of our train system. We will adopt a more proactive, predictive approach to maintenance, away from the current model of preventive maintenance. To enable this transition, we will need to build an integrated asset management database, so that we can better monitor and predict the health of the entire rail network and all its components.",6,233,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00233
2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"Data analytics are also helping us improve other aspects of our transport system. For instance, the public bus operators track the location of all their buses, and they are applying analytics so that they can instruct their bus captains to either slow down or speed up to avoid bunching with other buses, all in real time. This will, in part, answer Mr Melvin Yong's concerns.",7,234,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00234
2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"And this is only the beginning. LTA is building an analytics system which will fuse data from various sources, such as fare cards, wifi and CCTV systems, and also cellular data from the telcos. This will enable LTA to better model commuter flows in our public transport network and improve its overall planning capabilities. We can then also respond more effectively to ground developments, such as by injecting additional bus and rail capacity, to cope with unexpected crowd surges or even train delays.",8,235,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00235
2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"In time to come, we will be able to integrate private transport data as well. Using Global Navigation Satellite System technology and through the in-vehicle units that are installed in all vehicles in Singapore, we can get aggregated, comprehensive and real-time data on road traffic. We can use it to improve traffic flows, for instance, by providing motorists with access to real-time traffic data to decide on the fastest or least congested routes, and enable even our traffic light system to respond more intelligently and optimally to different real-time road conditions.",9,236,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00236

2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"In particular, just-in-time, demand-responsive transport has become more pervasive. For example, all of us know, just until a few years ago, if we wanted to book a taxi, we had to speak to an operator on the phone, and had access only to the taxis of that one company and this is not including all the holding time. This was clearly not convenient nor efficient. But today, we use an app, like GrabTaxi, to book taxis almost instantaneously from any taxi company. Commuters are better served because there are now more taxis that are reachable, literally at our fingertips.",11,238,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00238
2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"But the greater disruptive change by far, enabled by mobile technology, has been private hire car services. PTC's recent survey suggests that almost one in two point-to-point trips are now served by private hire cars. At the same time, it seems that many more commuters are taking point-to-point transportation, both on taxis and in private hire cars.",12,239,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00239

2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"Mr Zaqy Mohamad and Miss Cheng Li Hui expressed concerns about dynamic pricing. I am glad that taxi companies and drivers are rising to the competition. Taxi drivers, as I said, have improved their services. Customer satisfaction has improved from a year ago. And taxi companies are rethinking their business models. Some have lowered rental rates and introduced innovative rental schemes. More recently, I know that they have proposed dynamic pricing as one more option for booked trips. This is similar to the way fares for private hire car services are determined. The PTC is currently discussing the details with the taxi companies. Meanwhile, my view is that we should let the taxi industry innovate and adapt to the new market conditions and competition. Our taxi drivers have to make a living, too, and we should not restrict their ability to compete effectively.",14,241,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00241
2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"On the other hand, I understand some commuters' concerns about dynamic pricing. Fares, indeed, will likely vary according to demand and supply, sometimes higher and sometimes lower during peak hours or off-peak periods. But importantly, before any journey begins, commuters will know exactly how much their fare would be. They can then choose to accept or decline the offer.",15,242,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00242
2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"For commuters who prefer more familiarity, they will have the traditional option to book a taxi. The taxi companies, I understand, intend to retain the traditional metered fare system even as they introduce dynamic pricing. But ultimately, taxi companies should ensure that dynamic pricing improves and not worsens the matching of demand and supply.",16,243,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00243
2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"I thank Mr Zaqy Mohamad for his comments on our approach to managing the changes in this evolving industry. Our light-touch approach has served commuters well so far. The new regulations for private hire drivers and vehicles are aimed at protecting commuters' interests, especially safety. From July 2017, private hire car drivers must obtain a vocational licence. To get the licence, they must undergo relevant training and pass requisite tests on road and passenger safety and be subject to background and medical checks.",17,244,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00244
2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"We intend to maintain some differentiation in privileges and regulations between taxi and private hire car services for now, given their different roles. For instance, we intend to continue to allow only taxis to serve the street-hail market. Taxis also enjoy COE concessions. They pay the Category A Prevailing Quota Premium even though many taxis are larger Category B models. So, while we try to ensure that competition is fair, it is not always possible and desirable to impose the exact same regulations on both sectors.",18,245,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00245
2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"There are likely to be further disruptions afield. The recent trend is ride-sharing among unrelated commuters. UberPool and GrabShare offer commuters the possibility of sharing a private hire car trip if they are headed in the same direction, which is cheaper than taking a ride on your own.",19,246,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00246
2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"We also have SWAT, a local start-up that aims to provide on-demand bus services. The company uses a routing algorithm to pick up and drop off passengers on demand, while dynamically optimising the route real-time so that the bus can manage passengers most efficiently. This could potentially transform how bus services are operated in the future, including public bus services in areas where there is low ridership and maybe during low-demand hours.",20,247,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00247
2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"Mobile technology is also re-shaping bicycle-sharing. A few years back, we studied the schemes in cities like London, Paris and New York. These are the traditional ones with docking stations. We thought they could potentially work in Singapore. But, they were however not sustainable commercially and required some Government subsidy. So, we took some time to work out how to fund this and, eventually, LTA put out a tender last year for a bicycle sharing service, starting small in the Jurong Lake District.",21,248,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00248
2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"However, as Mr Ang Wei Neng has observed, in recent months, this has been disrupted almost. We have seen the emergence of dockless bicycle sharing systems here in Singapore. These dockless systems allow users to hire and return a shared bicycle at any location. There are obvious advantages  lower infrastructure costs, more convenience. The downside, however, is potential indiscriminate parking. It is still not clear whether these new systems or the traditional ones will work better for Singapore.",22,249,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00249
2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"LTA will study both the docked and dockless systems.

2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"Let me move on to the topic of automation. We are focusing on self-driving technology in a big way because they have the potential to dramatically improve public transport. For instance, we could have a fleet of self-driving pods or shuttles that can be called on demand to bring us from our doorstep to an MRT station. Self-driving buses, on the other hand, could address our shortage of bus drivers.",24,251,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00251

This will encourage buyers to choose models that are not only more fuel-efficient, but also emit less air pollutants, and thus further improve the ambient air quality and public health. Our colleagues from MEWR will elaborate on the enhancements to the scheme.",36,263,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00263
2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"We will also make a shift towards a greener public bus fleet. By procuring buses which meet more stringent emission standards, we have already been greening most of our diesel-powered fleet. But no emissions is better than low emissions. That is why we have been trialling an electric bus on Service 17 and now Service 119. Assoc Prof Daniel Goh asked about the results of this trial. The initial feedback has been encouraging; while more costly, commuters enjoyed the quieter ride and the bus has been fairly reliable.",37,264,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00264
2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"LTA intends to expand the trial and will be calling tenders to procure 50 hybrid buses and 60 electric buses this year. We will have three bus services which are fully served by electric buses. However, a problem with pure-electric technology is that it is not fully proven yet for tropical climates, in part because vehicles operating here consume a lot of energy for air-conditioning. The electric car sharing and electric taxi trials that LTA launched recently will also help us better understand the application of this technology in our climate.",38,265,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00265

2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,The Second Minister for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng),"I know it is challenging to have to fold up strollers before boarding public buses. On the other hand, LTA and the bus operators have genuine concerns for the safety of children in open strollers. For example, if the bus, for whatever reason, has to brake suddenly or swerve suddenly, we are concerned for the child's safety. But, on balance, we think we can move on this. Starting from 2 April, we will allow families to board public buses with open strollers. We hope this will make travelling with young children on public transport more convenient.",46,273,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00273

We have also introduced a new code of conduct to guide cyclists on how to share paths safely. But more than infrastructure upgrades and rules and regulations, we need the cooperation of all users in order to have shared spaces, to make them safe. We need to develop a culture of gracious sharing through education efforts, amongst others.",54,281,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00281

In other words, cargo that is either coming out from your own port city or going into your port city. Here we do transhipment, where we do connections for shippers, and the vessel calls involve mind-boggling permutations of synchronised unloading and reloading.

2017-03-08-T-004,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Take, for example, Ascenz Solutions which started in 2008 as a two-person show. With co-funding from MPA's Maritime Innovation and Technology Fund, Ascenz created a system called Shipulse that collates data from sensors installed on board ships and transmits it back to shore. Shipulse allows shipowners to remotely analyse a ship's speed and fuel efficiency in real-time and then instruct the crew to adjust the ship's route or carry out energy efficiency measures to save fuel and improve vessel performance. Shipulse has been installed on over 400 vessels and thousands more could use it. Having expanded to a team of more than 30 with operations in nine countries, Ascenz is now eyeing the European market.",35,343,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00343
2017-03-08-T-004,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo),"A likely shift towards digitalisation in the aviation and maritime sectors can give more start-ups like Ascenz their big breaks. You know, this is serious stuff, when even an established giant like AP Moller-Maersk decides to nominate as its new Chairman someone with a track record as ""Mr Digitalisation"". This is going to be a harbinger of major industry transformation.",36,344,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00344
2017-03-08-T-004,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Interestingly, the maritime sector is not usually thought of as a beacon of innovation. But I am bullish about the prospects for Singapore because the market here for innovative products and services is significant and quickly evolving. As their innovations gain market acceptance in Singapore, start-ups will be in a stronger position to internationalise. PSA has already taken the lead by launching PSA unboXed last year. And what PSA unboXed does is to invite start-ups and potential partners to propose technology solutions for the port, in which PSA unboXed may then decide to take an equity stake and try to make a success of them. I have asked MPA to work with SPRING to see how best to expose more local start-ups to opportunities in maritime businesses.",37,345,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00345
2017-03-08-T-004,Josephine Teo,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo),"To give a further boost to innovation, MPA will set up the ""MPA Living Lab"" at our port by the end of this year. The MPA Living Lab will provide the essential ""live"" operating conditions that will facilitate the test-bedding of potential innovations. Because this is critical − you can have a great idea, but if you are not able to prove the concept in ""live"" operating conditions, that would be a gap in the innovation journey. Areas being explored include autonomous vessels, multi-purpose drones and next-generation vessel traffic management systems. We believe this could be a game-changer for Singapore, bringing together technology developers and industry players to anchor their innovation activities in Singapore and help our sea hub stay ahead.",38,346,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00346

The increasing deployment of smart technologies means that new jobs will be more knowledge-intensive. At the port, more data scientists and operations research analysts will be needed to optimise shipping routes, port operations and vessel traffic management. At the airport, we will require data scientists skilled in air traffic operations research and analysis, to optimise our runway and airspace capacities through modelling and simulation.",40,348,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00348

For instance, port equipment engineers today are responsible for maintaining and repairing the port's equipment and facilities. With the introduction of AGVs, they will also plan and design operations to segregate manned and unmanned activities and to synchronise the AGVs' operations with other automated equipment. We are also investing in baggage and cargo robotics systems at the airport that will leave the more repetitive tasks of lifting and loading to the machines, freeing up our workers to oversee other parts of the operations.",41,349,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00349

2017-03-08-T-004,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,The slow bus-driving. Is the service level determined by LTA or the service provider? Why are these buses driving slowly? Could they be adjusted based on commuters' experience?,1,385,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00385
2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"It is always a collective effort that we want to ensure the best service to commuters. When we involve this technology, it is still dependent on real-time traffic conditions. You can imagine in peak hours, I have got three buses that start from the depot. From the very start, the first bus collects more passengers, it actually slows down along the whole route; whereas the second bus coming through, where there are less passengers, let us say a headway of five, 10 minutes, the second bus actually catches up. You can imagine if we have more than three buses and you have a peak-hour period of two hours of this bunching and relaxing. So, the real-time data is needed for them to adjust and this will be a real-time operator responsibility. But LTA will see what we can do to facilitate this use of technology, as I have said.",1,386,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00386

2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"I thank the Member for that clarification. The short answer is yes because they are similar. In the new standards that we have imposed on buying new buses, there will be two spaces available either for wheelchairs or strollers. In the current wheelchair-accessible buses that we have, more than 5,000 of them, there is at least one available space for wheelchair or stroller.",1,389,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00389

I suppose he was referring to the Bus Service Reliability Framework which is really a good intention by LTA to keep the bus to the timings and to arrive punctually and so on. But what happens on the ground, sometimes, is that the bus may arrive too early and then, therefore, they stop at the bus stop for a while or they slow down the speed of the travelling and so on.

2017-03-08-T-004,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"I thank the Member for the clarification. Where the bus may have to slow down, it may inconvenience some. But in terms of the overall system of buses plying the whole three-hour route, the overall service to more passengers is better. Indeed, some commuters may notice that this bus is slowing down but it gives proper spacing between buses. In a long route, it prevents bunching of buses that if you miss the two buses, you have to wait a long, long time for the third bus to come.",1,395,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00395

CAI does not, in particular, hold intellectual property rights with regards to, say, technology. What they do have is great operational insights. When it was set up, the idea was that, as part of Singapore enterprises internationalising, there was also benefit in having CAI offer their expertise to airports elsewhere that would like to tap into this expertise.

2017-03-08-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mdm Chairman, the Member asked a very interesting question. The China-UK freight train has started off in Yiwu and it has traversed across China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland, Germany, Belgium, France and then to the UK, to London. Twelve thousand kilometres. It took them 18 days, which is about half of what it would take if the same set of containers were to have to travel by ship.",1,402,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00402
2017-03-08-T-004,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"So, there is obviously some value in that because there may be some types of cargo which will be too expensive to transport by air. But, if you transport it by sea, then it takes twice as long. So, items could include things like prototypes that you want to deliver to the market very quickly. But this type of transportation − rail transportation − is constrained by the scale. This particular voyage that was undertaken, if I remember correctly, involved 40-foot containers − bigger boxes − but there were just 344 of them. If you compare that to what one of the mega-vessels would take these days, that is, closer to 18,000 to 19,000 TEUs, the scale that can be transported is completely different.",2,403,2017-03-08-T-004-S-00403

Has the Ministry explored other initiatives, considering the level of carbon emitted in our day-to-day life may have compounded the problem? Perhaps, the Ministry can consider further reviewing the following. One, creating greater awareness of the importance of addressing climate change and its implication on Singapore and its people. This can be done through schools, at workplaces and in public places with educational posters and documentary films, extensively promoting recycling, reducing or replacing the usage of plastics. This can be done by providing greater access and incentives for one to exchange empty bottles for coins − a practice found in Sweden. Pushing for consumers to bring their recyclable bags and not providing the alternative of plastic carrier bags could also be considered.

I, myself, have attended and carried out my own engagement with my residents and fellow Singaporeans. I realised that we need a lot of explanation, sometimes argument, and, finally, most importantly, many get the accurate picture. And there were a few comments made by them after the engagement. For example, one person I met, who after speaking to him for a while, told me, ""Why didn't you tell me this earlier?"" Another one I met, who was very concerned about needy Singaporeans, shared with me and said that, ""Fortunately, I met you this morning. I have a better perspective about the issue now.

For the first time in 17 years, our water price will increase, with the first 15% in July this year and another 15% in July next year. Many residents that I have spoken with understand and do support the rationale for this increase, considering the enormous sums of money that we have to continue spending on our water infrastructure in order to achieve water self-sufficiency in the long term. However, many of them have made suggestions. First, is it possible to perhaps stagger the increase even further, perhaps, say, 10% over three years, instead of 15% over two years? Another question is  what are the Ministry's plans to mitigate future increases in the price of water down the road?",1,484,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00484

After subsidies, households in 1-room and 2-room flats will hardly see any increase in their bills, and 75% of our HDB households can expect less than a $12 increment in their bills per month. Nonetheless, I am still concerned about some financially vulnerable households which may still be coping or struggling with utilities arrears, despite the subsidies.

This is not a small amount for our size. According to a 2013 article published in the journal, Waste Management, 500 million computers became obsolete in the United States between 1997 and 2007. China generated 1.11 million tonnes of e-waste annually. While I should point out that precise comparisons are difficult because of differences in definitions and time period considered, we should not delay making strong moves to address what will certainly turn out to be a growing problem for our environment.",1,511,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00511

Also, the scale of the e-waste challenge in Asia is unclear but, by all accounts, growing, adding to the concern. The lack of a visible nature of e-waste at present appears to suggest that the problem is obscure. As e-waste accumulates, without a comprehensive management scheme, the problem, including the requirements for specialised methods of dealing with toxic materials, will grow.

This system, as I understand it, is already installed at around 30 hotels, restaurants and schools and at the Ang Mo Kio market. Each digester can process about one tonne of waste per day.

2017-03-08-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"Mdm Chairman, the public may not know this but we generate a tremendous amount of waste each year. As I understand from the Ministry, in 2015, an estimated 785,500 tonnes of food waste were generated, a 40% increase from the amount generated in 2005. So, a 40% increase over 10 years. Besides efforts to reduce waste, we should also look at how we could better recycle waste.",1,520,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00520
2017-03-08-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"I understand that NEA has already worked with the private sector to treat food waste, for example, in hawker centres. Many large F&B operators have also installed their own on-site food waste digesters. May I seek an update on the progress of these initiatives?",2,521,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00521
2017-03-08-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"While these are commendable, these premises only treat the waste they generate. There are benefits to adopt a district-level approach to treat food waste from various premises, such as economies of scale and avoiding the need for individual premises to set aside space for their own digester. Last year, the Ministry announced a project to collect food waste from various premises in Clementi for treatment at a centralised facility. Can the Minister provide an update on the project?",3,522,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00522

From this, we are able to derive approximately 100 kg of fertilizer, 1,000 litres of non-portable water and 600 litres of liquid nutrients. The water is used for general cleaning of the Eco-digester centre and the nutrients are used for landscapes in our hub.",2,525,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00525
2017-03-08-T-005,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui,"In 2016, the Ministry announced its plans for a district-level food waste recycling pilot.

And will we involve more children in these programmes to raise their awareness of food wastage?",3,526,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00526
2017-03-08-T-005,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui,The domestic recycling rates in Singapore have stagnated at around 19% to 20% for many years and our contamination rate is high. This is possibly because the rubbish chutes in our housing estates are so convenient. What is the plan to tackle this problem going forward and how can we encourage more people to recycle?,4,527,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00527
2017-03-08-T-005,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui,"There is much potential to improve waste collection in Singapore. I frequently see cleaners manually moving garbage from the chutes to the bin centre. Sometimes, we get complaints from residents about the smell and the pests when these activities are not properly carried out. What is the Ministry's plan to improve waste collection?",5,528,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00528
2017-03-08-T-005,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui,"As Singapore becomes more affluent and as our population grows, we also generate more waste.

Our Meteorological Service recorded 2016 as the hottest year since 1929, when we started keeping temperature records. In recent years, our water managers, too, have had a foretaste of the looming challenge of coping with extended dry spells on the one hand and higher intensity rainfall on the other.

The in-use emission standard for diesel vehicles was already tightened in January 2014. We will now introduce new in-use emission standards for petrol vehicles and motorcycles, similar to those already in place in Europe and Japan. These standards are designed to be easily met by properly maintained vehicles.

To incentivise this, we will revise the Early Turnover Scheme (ETS). The ETS has been successful, with over 27,000 older diesel vehicles being replaced by newer ones, resulting in significant reductions in NOx and PM. We will extend the scheme for Euro II and III diesel commercial vehicles that switch over to Euro 6 and equivalent models, for two years from August 2017.",23,564,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00564

Can Members see the man standing there, below the marker which says 7.8 metres below sea level? This marker shows that people in Zuidplas live 7.8 metres below sea level and are actually hardly aware of it. Even so, people all over the Netherlands are always reminded that the rivers could overflow anytime, inundating their homes and destroying their livelihoods. Thus, to adapt, the Dutch, over time, built a complex system of dykes, pumps and water storage capabilities across the country.",33,574,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00574
2017-03-08-T-005,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"This was possible because each household contributed its share of water taxes, establishing the world's first and only water bank which could finance large investments. In fact, this bank was instrumental in the recovery and the aftermath of the 1953 floods. Today, the Dutch continue to pour over EUR$400 million into flood protection each year. Climate change threatens catastrophes if they do not. This capability has turned into a great advantage. They have attracted water-intensive industries to invest and their expertise is exported globally.

This is even more critical in the face of looming challenges of climate change to water security, and this applies around the world. We have only to look at Linggiu Reservoir, which is about a third full now and can dry up if current extractions continue and prolonged dry weather returns, unpredicted.",37,578,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00578
2017-03-08-T-005,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"It has always worried us because a dry Linggiu Reservoir will be disastrous for both Singapore and Johor in many ways. The Dutch will recall they did not pay heed to the 1928 and 1934 studies, which repeatedly warned that their dykes were inadequate. Even when high water in 1943 reached the dykes, only simple repairs were made, because they were distracted even after World War II was over. The fact is nobody felt like spending a vast amount of money on raising the dykes. After all, there were no floods for years. So, when the storm surge of 1953 happened, water broke through the dykes and claimed 1,800 lives.",38,579,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00579
2017-03-08-T-005,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"For us, because we were adequately prepared in 2014, the prolonged dry weather in Singapore did not cost us dearly.

Last year, PUB completed its latest review of the Water Master Plan, a strategic blueprint for our water till 2060. The plan provides for development of NEWater and desalination plants to meet up to 85% of our water demand by 2060, as well as new pipelines for drinking water and used water. We are making good progress on the plans. Singapore's fifth NEWater plant, located at Changi, officially opened in January this year.",41,582,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00582

2017-03-08-T-005,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We also need to maintain and upgrade our existing water assets, as the Dutch have done with their dykes. As our infrastructure ages, PUB will accelerate renewal plans to minimise pipe leakages and supply interruptions. Our unaccounted-for water losses, which include leakages from our supply network, are around 5%. This is among the lowest worldwide. In London, leakage is about one-fifth of water demand. We cannot afford that. It equates to losing all the water produced by two or three desalination plants.",44,585,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00585

For large users, PUB has, since 2015, required the submission of Water Efficiency Management Plans (WEMP), which help companies better understand to manage their water consumption. At a recent consultation, some companies, including SSMC, a wafer fabrication facility, said that they invest in water-saving measures as a matter of principle, even though water formed only a small part of their costs. I am heartened that, for these companies, they are driven as much by water conservation DNA as company profit and loss (P&L).

Many of us are familiar with the Singapore Water Story. Perhaps there is a risk of over-familiarity, a certain jadedness from one too many social studies lessons. Just like water flowing from taps everywhere, it can become invisible, overlooked, undervalued, just like the people in Zuidplas who are not aware that they live 7.8 metres below sea level.",57,598,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00598

Let me first outline my Ministry's overall strategy and priorities in managing waste. There are three key waste streams of greatest concern to us.,3,607,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00607
2017-03-08-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The first is electrical and electronic waste, or e-waste for short. As Assoc Prof Randolph Tan and Mr Louis Ng have highlighted, about 60,000 tonnes of e-waste are generated annually. Currently, consumers can participate in e-waste recycling programmes which industry stakeholders voluntarily provide. For example, StarHub provides e-waste recycling bins at almost 280 convenient locations, such as shopping malls and community centres, through its RENEW programme. The e-waste collected is sent to recyclers, such as Tes-Amm, where resources, such as copper, aluminium and gold are extracted for reuse.",4,608,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00608
2017-03-08-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We are currently consulting industry stakeholders on an enhanced national e-waste management system, which would cover both the collection and disposal of e-waste. Some countries, such as Germany and South Korea, have implemented similar systems. We will take into account our local context, such as product coverage and the physical and financial responsibilities of key stakeholders, when developing the system. More details will be released later this year.",5,609,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00609
2017-03-08-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Mr Louis Ng spoke about HCFCs. Singapore is a party to the Montreal Protocol and will phase out the use of HCFCs by 2030. We have put in place measures to help us achieve this, such as controls on the import of HCFCs for local use. Apart from regulatory control, we encourage the recycling of refrigerants recovered from refrigeration and air-conditioning systems. Local recycling facilities, such as Vemac Services Pte Ltd, recover refrigerants from decommissioned industrial and commercial systems. We will monitor developments in this area and assess the feasibility of implementing a management framework for HCFCs, taking into consideration the risk to human health, technical limitations and the potential compliance costs which businesses would have to bear.",6,610,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00610
2017-03-08-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The second concern is packaging waste, which makes up around one-third of our domestic waste. Since the launch of our voluntary Singapore Packaging Agreement in 2007, we have achieved a cumulative reduction of more than 32,000 tonnes of packaging waste, but more can be done. We are exploring possible regulations for businesses, such as mandatory reporting of packaging placed on the local market and the submission of packaging waste reduction plans, over the next two to four years. We will study the issues and announce the details when ready.",7,611,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00611

Since the end of last year, source-segregated food waste from nine sites, including schools, army camps and a food court, has been transported to a demonstration facility in the Ulu Pandan Water Reclamation Plant. About three tonnes of food waste are collected daily, but we aim to increase this to 15 tonnes a day. If successful, this process will allow us to recover energy from food waste more efficiently.",10,614,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00614

Over the last few years, our overall recycling rate has been around 60%. The non-domestic sector comprising industries and commercial premises have achieved a recycling rate of 77%. However, our domestic recycling rates have stagnated at around 20% in recent years. More needs to be done to put recycling at the heart of our culture.",12,616,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00616

We hope this will bring us closer to our domestic recycling rate of 30% by 2030. Since January 2014, all new HDB Build-to-Order (BTO) flats have installed recycling chutes adjacent to centralised refuse chutes at every level. Studies have shown that households living in apartments with dual chute systems recycle up to three times more than those in apartments which do not have such facilities.

The feedback from both hawkers and patrons of these centres has been largely positive. NFC, in particular, is an established socially-conscious operator and has been managing the existing Bedok Interchange Hawker Centre since 2014. Rentals at these centres have remained unchanged and food prices have been kept largely stable. Besides monitoring food prices for affordability and ensuring that any price revision is justified, these operators have put in place initiatives like offering bulk purchase of ingredients to help hawkers reduce their cost, or putting in place productivity measures, such as centralised dish washing, to help hawkers address their manpower constraints.",29,633,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00633
2017-03-08-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Given the encouraging outcomes of these initial efforts, we have extended this approach to other hawker centres. We have appointed NFC to manage a group of five existing centres with incumbent stallholders and two new centres. Allowing NFC to manage a bundle of hawker centres will enable them to have the necessary scale to enhance the vibrancy and hygiene standards across more hawker centres, as well as the flexibility to experiment with new ideas and processes, to benefit patrons and hawkers. This is the first expanded pilot and we would need to evaluate the results of this approach before we decide on the next steps.",30,634,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00634

Some hawkers were also allowed to operate stalls at subsidised rents under the previous hardship scheme, which was discontinued in 1990. Since then, all new hawkers are required to pay rental at market rate. Hence, there are no subsidised rents in all our new centres.",32,636,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00636

For a start, we are working with the People's Association to develop a ""Hawker Fare"" series of culinary classes, starting in May. Members of the public can learn how to cook hawker dishes, like chicken rice, yong tau foo and mee goreng from the veteran hawkers themselves. While not all trainees will eventually become hawkers, such courses will also help to generate interest in hawker food and culture among Singaporeans and contribute to sustaining the hawker trade in the long run.",36,640,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00640

More details will be released later in the year. We welcome other interested parties, such as training providers, to work with us to provide appropriate training to aspiring hawkers.",37,641,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00641

Hence, as noted earlier, to alleviate these cost concerns, the Government will set aside about $90 million to facilitate the adoption of productivity initiatives in hawker centres. The funding will support the progressive reconfiguration of up to 25 existing centres over the next few years to facilitate the rolling out of centre-level productivity initiatives, such as centralised dishwashing integrated with tray return, and cashless payment solutions similar to those seen at the hawker centre in Our Tampines Hub or Ci Yuan Hawker Centre. We will also co-fund up to 70% of the operating cost of such initiatives for hawkers in these centres for a period of time.

The tray-return rates vary, with the highest tray-return rates at Tiong Bahru Market, Blk 157 Tampines Street 11 and Our Tampines Hub. We have also been working on making tray-return stations more visible, prominent and accessible, as seen in the newer hawker centres.",48,652,2017-03-08-T-005-S-00652

2017-03-08-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"In recent years, I have been heartened by the changes made to ensure that all child-specific benefits are given to all Singaporean children, including children of unwed parents. This is precious help for the latter group. However, children of complex families and single-parent families still risk falling behind. Amongst other disadvantages, they may lack proper guidance, good role models and a conducive home environment that allows them to focus on positive development. They risk developing restrictive world views, a distorted sense of how things work and habits detrimental to their future. As such, when KidSTART was announced last year, I was very heartened as it supports the provision of a conducive environment for low-income and vulnerable children in their early years so as to give them a good start. Hence, could the Ministry provide an update on the implementation and observations made so far of the KidSTART programme?",6,694,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00694
2017-03-08-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"When we speak of a conducive environment for children of more vulnerable backgrounds, I cannot help but also think about children of unwed parents. These children, typically, are raised by one parent, usually the mother, who is the sole caregiver and sole breadwinner, and can only rely on the resources of this single parent. The unwed parent may often suffer strained relationships with his or her immediate family members and may be pressured to move out with the child, feeling unwanted. Prolonged absence of the other parent, pressures and the stigma of a child born out of wedlock and the risk of not having a proper, safe home all have an adverse impact on the child's development. As such, how does the Ministry help children in such situations? For example, will there be interim arrangements to home unwed parents and their children till they are eligible to purchase a flat of their own? How can we help to ensure that these children will not feel unwanted, but that they are just as precious as any Singaporean child?",7,695,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00695

Mother cannot work because her third daughter and two granddaughters are young children who need her care. Elder sister did not complete her education, could not hold down a job but does try to pay the bills, whilst waiting for her husband, who is a serial offender, to be released from prison. We gave financial assistance wherever possible. Younger sister refuses to complete her education despite offers of bursaries, as her career ""aspiration"" is to make a quick buck exploiting her youth.

But despite the very trying circumstances, her daughter Atiqa, who is now in Primary 2, aced her examinations and topped her class. I have known this family for years and I have witnessed how the mother cared for her children. She is not well educated but she made sure she is a very responsible mother.

These enrichment classes I am referring to are not only those for the children, but for the parents, too, like parenting skills or courses that will help them develop their children's potential. If they are not able to invest in these classes, their children may, in the long run, lose out because of the stiff competition in the world today.

The Kindergarten Fee Assistance Scheme (KiFAS), which provides assistance to some of these families, currently requires, a minimum school attendance of one day a month.

It does seem odd to provide more financial subsidies for working mothers who have an income and provide less financial subsidies for stay-at-home mothers who do not have an income. The quantum of subsidies for full-time or part-time care should be based solely on family income or per capita income instead.

These are parents who have family members or caregivers from their neighbourhoods who can help to look after their babies and children.

The apps are to be linked to intelligent sensors and gadgets that are installed at home or worn on the elderly to indicate their conditions, for example, in cases of falls, or for them to provide reminders for medication. These notifications can be sent to the caregivers. Will the Ministry work with MOH to provide the caregivers with free essential basic training?

His theory was that it was not the different versions of self-harm themselves that people were getting addicted to. He discovered that what people were addicted to were the specific changes in brain chemistry that were induced by these actions. And their harmful behaviours of choice were linked to their preferred coping mechanisms of dealing with stress. Those who preferred to numb their stress away would choose solutions like heroin, sedatives or alcohol. And those who preferred to actively confront their stress would use solutions like stimulant drugs or online gambling.",7,766,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00766

The amazing social innovation here was this. The programme did not tell the teenagers, ""You're going to come in for treatment."" It simply told them, ""We are here to teach you anything you want to learn − music, art, dance, martial arts, hip-hop."" And these classes were deliberately curated to provide youths a wide variety of alterations in brain chemistry and give them alternative solutions to cope better with life's stresses. Those who liked to numb their stress could go for experiences that reduced anxiety, like painting or yoga, and those who liked to confront their stress could go for experiences that provided a sudden rush, like karate or hip hop.",8,767,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00767

Based on the cases I have encountered, there seems to be a rule or guideline that, after a number of months, the quantum of help is reduced and then help is refused altogether.

Having a pipeline of quality manpower in this sector is critical. Can the Ministry update on the progress in attracting, retaining and deepening competencies of manpower in the childcare and social services sector? Mid-career candidates have shared that they can take 1.5 to two years to be qualified to work in these sectors.

Families, we all know, form the foundation of any society and, definitely, in our society, and they should be the first line of support. Family bonds help us get through tough times. Fostering strong families is a key imperative. Imagine a society where, when there are troubles, the first thing people ask is not so much what are the families doing, what is the individual doing, but what is the community doing about it. I think it would represent something that we should be worried about. But I think these are values that many of us continue to hold true today.",26,925,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00925
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Lastly, community support. The wider community plays a part, which is all of us here, as leaders in our own respective spaces. I think different players − some of you have suggested about how volunteers can play a part − and, certainly, different players like VWOs, grassroots, philanthropists and volunteers from all walks of life – can and should come together to provide care and support in big and small ways and they, definitely, augment the support provided by the Government.",27,926,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00926
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"So, we need to prepare for the future. While the underlying values and principles that guide us do not change, we do need to redesign assistance to meet changing and diverse needs. At the same time, we still have to pay attention to sustainability, to ensure that resources are going to where they are most needed.",28,927,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00927
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),My Parliamentary Secretary and I will be elaborating on the Ministry's work in three key areas.,29,928,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00928
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Firstly, to Build an Inclusive Society. An inclusive society is one where each Singaporean is enabled to lead a fulfilling life, regardless of their starting point. Developing this sense of inclusiveness is and has to be a whole-of-society effort. Beyond initiatives and programmes, we need a mindset shift in the way we support the needs of fellow Singaporeans, the way we look at them, especially those with more disadvantaged circumstances and different abilities.",30,929,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00929
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Secondly, it is about Strengthening Families. The family plays a critical role in preserving a closely-knit society and in serving as a pillar of support for individuals. We want to ensure that Singapore remains a great place to raise children and give them a good start in life. We want to establish stable family units, while supporting families that do face difficulties.",31,930,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00930
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"A strong family goes a long way in helping individuals overcome challenges. I am talking not just about immediate family, but also the extended family. As individual family units come under strain, such as through difficult life events like illness, extended family members can play an important role in providing support, especially when family units are becoming smaller. However, there will be families whose ties have been weakened and help from within is not immediately available. It will happen. And that is where the Government and community partners, neighbours, can help them to resolve their issues and rebuild their ties.",32,931,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00931
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"My Parliamentary Secretary will speak on how we will strengthen and support families through better childcare and infant care services, as well as early intervention measures for young families. He will also outline how we will help families to mend fractured ties, and how we should deal with domestic violence.",33,932,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00932
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Thirdly, we will enrich our social assets by Strengthening the People Sector. Our community partners are doing very, very good work and I urge them to continue. Given the nature and complexity of needs, all of us need to play our part to provide holistic help to those in need. This way, we can achieve greater impact and we can scale what we do. When you scale, you can begin to go upstream and look at preventing problems and not just dealing with problems when they happen. So, developing our social service organisations, as well as enabling and empowering caring communities, continues to be an important priority for MSF.",34,933,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00933

2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Individuals who are disadvantaged and have complex needs will feel the challenges of livelihood most acutely. If displaced from their jobs, they might not have sufficient savings or other sources of income to tide them through these rough patches. Those without family support will require greater support from the community and the Government.",37,936,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00936
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"It is not only about extending more help. We need to be innovative to help them more holistically and try to break the cycle of disadvantage. Just providing and disbursing help is the easy part in some sense, but helping them to break out of the circumstances so that they can fundamentally change their circumstances, that is where the important work lies.",38,937,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00937
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Another group that we will strengthen support for are persons with disabilities. They face different challenges and, invariably, have less options than the rest of us. In the past few years, we have made good progress in areas, such as early intervention, education, employment and in raising awareness and recognition of persons with disabilities. The recommendations in the third Enabling Master Plan set out quite a few areas where we can further strengthen support over the next five years.",39,938,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00938
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"I will elaborate more on our plans, starting with how we intend to support those who need financial help.",40,939,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00939
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"In recent years, we have progressively strengthened our social safety nets. Let me provide an update on the Social Service Offices (SSOs), as requested by Mr Faisal Manap.",41,940,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00940
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"The SSOs are the cornerstone of our social assistance framework. In 2013, we started rolling out a network of SSOs to bring more accessible and coordinated social assistance to Singaporeans. By 2015, we had set up the full network of 24 physical offices across the island. Today, 95% of SSO clients live or work within two kilometres of an SSO. For seniors who may require social assistance but are unable to travel to the office, our officers can conduct the assessment at their homes. For immobile seniors who are already on our schemes, our officers can also directly credit the payment to agencies for their household bills if there is such a request or when officers assess that doing so will be helpful to the seniors. Ms Sylvia Lim asked about some of these possible arrangements. We have those options available.",42,941,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00941
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Being forward deployed, SSOs develop a good sense of the local community's needs and enjoy better collaboration. The SSOs are not the only players in the community. There are various stakeholders, VWOs, FSCs, so the partnership with them also enables the SSOs to get a better feel of the situation on the ground.",43,942,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00942
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"What are some of the products as a result of these partnerships? For instance, one of the SSOs has partnered North East CDC to pay for pest control services to assist rental flat residents deal with their bed bugs. In Bukit Merah, for example, our SSO initiated a Spooner Road POW WOW platform where all partners could coordinate their action plan for vulnerable families in the area. This enabled clients to be better served in a holistic manner and avoided duplication of effort among the agencies. The various partner agencies continue to meet through this platform to share best practices and resolve complex cases.",44,943,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00943
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"This is something that we want to encourage, we want to see it happening on a wider basis. Some of us, as advisors, are playing an active role trying to pull together the different stakeholders. It is important for the stakeholders to get together because when they talk, they build relationships, they exchange information, that is when there is real coordination and the real coordinated work happens on the ground. It is much more effective that way.",45,944,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00944
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Mr Faisal Manap also asked about the training received by SSO officers. One out of six officers have social work training. Officers also undergo training in areas pertinent to their work, such as engagement and interviewing skills, the assessment of needs and financial literacy. It is also important to realise, as I mentioned earlier, that the SSO does not exist on its own. It works very closely with the local Family Service Centre where the social workers will then follow up with the individual clients. There are also other players, such as the SAC and other stakeholders where the partnership is established. So, the social work community that exists on the ground comprises SSOs and the key partners who work together to try and address some of the needs that our residents face.",46,945,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00945
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Mr Faisal Manap and Ms Sylvia Lim asked about the ComCare Scheme. We have extended the coverage to more families. Since 2014, we have increased the monthly household income cap for families seeking Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance from $1,700 to $1,900, and the cap on income per person was raised from $550 to $650. So, basically, we have extended the coverage in terms of those who may need ComCare assistance. We have also increased the quantum of Long-Term Assistance. The most recent enhancement was last year, where financial support for one-person households on Long-Term Assistance was increased from $450 to $500 a month. The rates were also increased for larger households. Households may also receive additional support to meet other needs, such as medical consumables, adult diapers and one-off items like commodes and wheelchairs for their frail elderly. So, these are some of the ad hoc needs that may sometimes arise and assistance can be provided.",47,946,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00946
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"These are system-level improvements and scheme enhancements. At the individual-level, SSO officers are empowered to exercise flexibility when providing social assistance to low-income families under the ComCare scheme. That is something that is important. It is important for officers not to just follow a rule rigidly. But the space is accorded to them to make some of these discretionary calls.",48,947,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00947
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Our officers will then calibrate both the amount and the duration of Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance according to the different needs of families. For one-off and ad-hoc expenses, as mentioned by Mr Faisal Manap, they also exercise flexibility and also tap on community resources to assist. I think many of us are familiar, at the CDC level, initiatives are initiated by us, working with the various stakeholders − the local merchants, the local VWOs. Collectively, we also help to provide some of these means to assist individuals on a need basis. We do want to help families get back on their feet, but some will progress faster than others.",49,948,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00948
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Ms Sylvia Lim asked, ""How do you measure?"" The honest truth is that it is actually quite difficult. Is it about the numbers we are talking about? By extending the coverage, we do have more numbers of those we are assisting. Is it about how long they remain on help? But the reality is that it really depends. Some are temporary because they have lost their jobs, so they need something to tide them over. Others have more chronic family problems, but they are not work-capable; some have health issues and that is a bit more long-drawn. But the key thing is  when they need help, are we able to provide help? And even though it may be short or medium-term, it does not mean that after a few months, we will cut it off. We do have the capacity and we do actually extend it when they continue to have those issues. Of course, those on long-term assistance are very different. We will review them from time to time. For those on Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance, we will adjust accordingly and will not cut off the assistance prematurely. And if you do meet individuals who seem to have some of these challenges, do flag it to us and let us know because we will be quite happy to adjust as we do make those accommodations. As we all know, on the ground, the stories that we receive are not always necessarily complete. But, when in doubt, surface it and we will be more than happy to assess it. So, we do look at it from a needs-based approach and we consider all sources of income.",50,949,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00949
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Ms Sylvia Lim also asked about Silver Support. For those on Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance, there will be some that are not receiving Silver Support. Some of those who receive Silver Support do not need Short-to-Medium Term Assistance. But for those who are on Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance but are also eligible for Silver Support, in these cases, we do compute the Silver Support quantum into the overall assistance. Because, otherwise, the quantum increases quite significantly. We are also quite mindful as to how to calibrate the amount. So, Silver Support is factored in for the Short-to-Medium-Term assistance recipients.",51,950,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00950
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Ms Denise Phua asked about families facing problems with debt and arrears. In fact, I was just having a discussion on this recently with an expert from overseas. These families can approach their nearest SSO. The SSOs will work with relevant agencies, such as Singapore Power, HDB, Town Councils, to see if the debt can be restructured. That is a very simple step, but it goes a very long way and, for many, it makes a lot of difference. For example, it allows these families to go on instalment plans. Concurrently, our officers will assess the family's situation and they will look at ComCare to support their basic living expenses, if necessary. And these efforts will resolve some of the pressing issues for many of them.",52,951,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00951
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"However, ComCare cannot be used for the repayment of debts, to ensure we also do not erode the values of personal responsibility. Can you imagine a scenario where, if you are in debt and, therefore, public monies are then re-directed to service your debt? Invariably, you can imagine the kind of behaviours that this can create. But we are also aware that, for some families − and I do face them, I think many of us in this House face them − where for whatever reason, the mistakes that they made, wrong decisions in life, they end up mired in quite serious debt and it seems almost impossible to break out of that cycle. So, in these instances, we would refer them to VWOs who are looking at these issues from a more specialised perspective where they provide debt-related support and advice, or refer them to organisations like the Institute of Financial Literacy and Credit Counselling Singapore. Basically, exploring different ideas to see how best to equip our social workers with the ability to integrate financial advice into their intervention plans for vulnerable families. So, we welcome partners who are keen to explore such solutions. I am aware that Methodist Welfare Services provides some of these. I think it is early days yet. I think it is too early to conclude. And for those who are operating in that space, they would realise it is not quite so straightforward either.",53,952,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00952
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"But we are mindful that, for a number of families, this is a serious issue, and we are looking at whether there are better ways to support them. The ideal way is to prevent them from getting into that position in the first place. That is where providing better financial planning advice and education early would be important. It is also important for us to surface problems earlier so that we are able to step in, because a range of assistance schemes is available to help families, rather than let them try and figure out solutions on their own, incurring more debt and, thereby, creating much more complex problems for themselves. So, this is where the community needs to step in to support them, surface the problems, so that we can step in and see what we can do, early on.",54,953,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00953
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"We do need to be forward-thinking. We need to try new methods because social safety nets also need to evolve with changing conditions. So, I am keen for us to be as proactive as we can to go upstream to pre-empt issues. At the same time, it is also important to reiterate that we have to strike a balance in terms of being resilient and preventing a sense of entitlement. Because by being so proactive, before you surface a problem, you come in and help somebody. I am not sure that is always a wise thing to do either. So, it is a balance that we need to strike, but I am very mindful that I would like to look at prevention as far as I can.",55,954,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00954
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Prof Michael Sherradan, a distinguished professor of social development at the Washington University in St Louis in the US, described Singapore as ""a relatively young and very tiny nation, but it has some of the most innovative social policies in the world"". He has also said that ""social policies can never be perfect − trade-offs are always involved − but overall Singapore has made thoughtful and effective choices.""",56,955,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00955
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"I actually believe we can do better, especially in the way we provide more seamless and holistic help to individuals and families. When you meet individuals, they have a range of different problems and it is multi-dimensional. They do not organise their lives according to the way we organise ourselves in the Ministries and agencies. So, we, at the backend, need to see how to wrap around services to support them.",57,956,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00956
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"For those with multi-faceted needs and challenges, clearly, financial assistance is just one part of the solution. It does not solve everything. There are other difficulties − family problems, relationship problems at home, challenges in finding and holding down stable employment, health concerns, mental health issues and so on. Therefore, our SSO officers need to work with them on an action plan to achieve financial and job stability, link them up with other agencies and community partners that can help them address their other challenges, such as childcare placement. So, as mentioned earlier, I think we can do better in trying to make this as seamless as possible. If you have one individual who is able to do everything, it will be challenging, because I do not think he will have that level of competency. So, you do need to leverage on the experts that are providing those services within the community. But what we can do is to link them up much better. Basically, it is a team attending to the individual − but how do you help them navigate and how do you hand them over from one individual to the other and, collectively, try to address these issues? I think that can go a very long way and that is something we can do better.",58,957,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00957
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"We recognise that it is very taxing. These individuals and families are already having a lot of emotional stress, a lot of concerns on their minds and then they have to approach multiple agencies for help, and to repeat their stories. So, having technology to help streamline that so that there is a common database will help to go a very long way to prevent social workers from asking the individuals to repeat some of these instances. These experiences, we know, can be demoralising and can diminish their will to follow through with their action plans. In the first place, for many, I would suggest do have a great deal of dignity and self-reliance, which is why sometimes they actually come to us rather late. But because of that, it is also very painful to keep repeating why you are needing help. That is something that we recognise and, through SS Net, we are trying to address some of these issues. Also, the processes at the backend, I think we can do better and we will.",59,958,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00958
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"So, we will constantly explore better ways to be more client-centric. One area of focus, to illustrate, is employment assistance to enable job stability. Some of our SSOs are co-located with WSG or e2i Career Centres, and clients can immediately follow up with WSG or e2i for employment assistance. Two SSOs − Taman Jurong and Kreta Ayer − have social assistance, family services and employment services all under one roof. At these two SSOs, the same SSO officer provides both social and employment assistance, an arrangement that clients have found helpful. At the other SSOs, separate appointments for employment assistance are made for clients to see the WSG or e2i officers who come to the SSOs once a week.",60,959,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00959
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"This year, we will extend the pilot delivery of both social and employment assistance by the same SSO officer, to three more SSOs. For clients who are unemployed but able to work, this will provide easier and quicker access to employment assistance. They can also get more holistic help with employment goals tied closely to social assistance. Much as we want to help, individuals must walk that last mile themselves. Many of us who have been in this field, working with individuals, we will also meet individuals that, for one reason or other, somehow, are not prepared to embark on that. How do we nudge them on that journey, especially when they are work-capable? So, we will train our officers to provide employment assistance.",61,960,2017-03-08-T-006-S-00960
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"This is just one example, amongst various others, that we will need to continue to pursue to make sure that we can provide help as effectively as possible but also in a manner that helps the individual retain his dignity and, at the same time, not to erode the importance of self-reliance and also to include the families because family support remains important and, again, the community, which is where we are in. We have also a responsibility in our local community to look out for our neighbours and our residents.

They seek to improve the quality of lives of persons with disabilities, importantly, to support caregivers and also to build up the community's capabilities and chart the way forward in building a more inclusive society. The third Masterplan builds on the progress of earlier Masterplans. Focus group discussions were carried out with many stakeholders − persons with disabilities, caregivers, VWOs providing disability services, employers and members of the public.

We will work with MOH to see how to better train these personnel to pick up signs of developmental delay and also to raise awareness and to deliberately look out for some of these indicators so that the children can be noticed at the early stage.

It makes them retreat into their own shell. They dare not come out; they are reluctant to come out. How do they then draw on support? But the more we are able to actively involve them on a day-to-day basis in our community activities, let us deliberately plan for it, bring them out.

Early findings showed that youths engaged under the Youth GO! Programme displayed a positive change in attitude towards their parents, studies and career plans.",60,1064,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01064

While the number of reported family violence cases is low and stable, every case is of concern to us. Furthermore, family violence is often a hidden problem and cases may go unreported. We have completed a study to understand public perceptions on family violence. Findings showed that awareness about family violence remains low. Four in 10 respondents were unsure what family violence meant. In addition, children were less likely to seek help compared to adults. What does this mean for us?",61,1065,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01065

2017-03-08-T-006,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"There are two key principles under the Vulnerable Adults Act. Firstly, family remains as a first line of care and protection, and the community plays a critical role to support families. Secondly, a vulnerable adult who does not lack mental capacity is best placed to decide how he wishes to live and whether or not to accept any assistance. If the vulnerable adult has to be removed from the place where he is staying, MSF will explore if he or she can be placed with any suitable relatives. We will also work with community agencies, such as Social Service Offices and Family Service Centres, to provide additional support. If community and family options are not feasible, MSF will be empowered to place the vulnerable adult at gazetted places of temporary care and protection and places of safety.",67,1071,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01071

2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"First, developing manpower pipelines. We expanded these, for example, by starting the UniSIM full-time Social Worker degree programme last year.

2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Third, improving career prospects. We enhanced career development opportunities in the sector. And this helps retain our professionals and attract more to join the sector. Assoc Prof Daniel Goh asked about improving wages for social workers. NCSS publishes salary guidelines for the social service sector and these are updated every year to ensure salaries keep pace with wage movements in the market. Every three years, there is a major review of salary benchmarks for the different professions. The last major review was in 2015 and the recommended salary increases for social service professionals ranged from 3% to 19%. In between the major reviews, there are salary guidelines that incorporate a recommended salary increment. In 2016, this was about 4%.",5,1086,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01086
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"To ensure that the salaries remain competitive, the benchmarks are pegged to professions in the main competing markets, for example, the healthcare and public sectors. The salary guidelines for social workers take reference from those in the Civil Service.",6,1087,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01087
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"As we all know, beyond salaries, other factors contribute to retention.

2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In 2015, 2,590 companies participated in SHARE. Last year, around 300 new companies came on board, which is an increase of about 11% from 2015. In addition, more than 630 companies have increased their SHARE donations. These are improvements but, frankly, we really can and should do more. Many companies are not on board but more of them can be. Please do encourage them to come on board and we will do our part as well.",44,1125,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01125

Values, such as care and compassion, resilience, as well as strong and supportive families and communities, these will stand us in good stead as we face the various and many challenges that are looming ahead on the horizon. We need the concerted effort and commitment of the people, private and public sectors to come together, to work hand-in-hand, to overcome these challenges.",46,1127,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01127

2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Together, we will build a more inclusive and caring society. It is really about enabling us to be not just compassionate, but to look at ourselves as a community. To not just look at ""my own interests alone"", but to look at ""us"" as a community, not just for the present but for the long term. That is where, perhaps, you deal with the issues of self-entitlement; that is also where we deal with the issues of sacrifice, where we deal with the issues of community. Where there is a sense of that, that is where we can truly see that we have an inclusive society. That is when we can begin to build the best home possible for all Singaporeans.

2017-03-08-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,"Thank you. I have two questions. Firstly, I am heartened to hear the Minister say that it will be helpful to surface more of the Singaporean households or families who may be in need of assistance, especially in this uncertain climate. I would like to ask, how does the Ministry plan to do so? On one hand, the community can definitely play a role but, sometimes, the community cannot comprehensively identify these families whereas the Government, as a whole, may be able to identify them in a more effective manner, such as escalating arrears in HDB rent, utilities and, perhaps, even S&CC. May I know what is the Ministry intending to do in terms of looking at these indicators and coordinating the assistance that is available?",1,1131,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01131
2017-03-08-T-006,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling,"The second question would be, I am heartened to also hear that MSF is going to introduce the allied infant educarer programme. I would like to know whether introducing this will compromise the quality of care in infant care.",2,1132,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01132
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,Let me take the first question. I will leave it to my Parliamentary Secretary to take the second question on allied infant educarers.,1,1133,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01133
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In terms of identifying problems early, there are many indicators in society. For example, we will arrears not just in Town Council, but arrears in terms of utility bills. You also sometimes pick up indicators from the local kindergartens, where we note certain families are having issues paying fees.",2,1134,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01134
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"This is something that we are looking at, how best to tap on information and data. Partly, there is also information protection that we need to deal with across the different agencies. But we are also very mindful, as I mentioned earlier, if we are too proactive, because from time to time, individuals may have cash flow problems, they can deal with it. Do we step in at that stage? We are quite clear that our agencies need to collaborate better at the backend. For example, we are picking indicators as one agency; another agency might be picking up another indictor within their realms of responsibility. When you put it all together, the picture begins to surface that certain families might be facing financial duress, for example. That is something that we are looking at, in terms of how do we facilitate the sharing of information that can better address some of these problems earlier.",3,1135,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01135
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The other issue to me is the community which is why I think there are efforts that we can put in at the local level to pull in the different stakeholders. We are living there, we are encountering the individuals in different capacities − whether they will be going to the local mosque, to the local church or the marketplace, at the hawker centres, or the GPs. Sometimes, conversations may arise when the individuals are facing some stress. One, is to make sure that the information is available. They know where to go − they can look for the Advisor, they can look for the ComCare hotline or the SSO. The increase in numbers is not just because we have increased our coverage, but because it has become more accessible, a lot more awareness is beginning to arise amongst the public. More are coming forward. We see residents surfacing to us that their neighbours or their friends may be having some of these issues.",4,1136,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01136
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The key is, when problems arise, individuals must know what is available. We encourage them to step forward where they can. But that is where the community can also play a big part. At the backend, at the agencies, as I have said, what we can do better is between the agencies – watching that space, could we share the information a lot better? This is something that we are working on.",5,1137,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01137
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We are mindful of confidentiality issues but we are trying to deal with that as well. But as I have said, as we are dealing with this, I am very mindful that we need to strike that balance − how intrusive you want us to be. We can be very, very intrusive but I am not sure that is necessarily a wise way to deal with it. But the main thing is make sure information is available, people know where to go. Please come forward to see us when help is needed.",6,1138,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01138

First, on the youth surveys, there is a very distinct difference between the questions that are currently asked in youth surveys and the kind of questions that the Icelandic researchers did. So, I will request that the Ministry take a look at it. But, anyway, I am thankful that you mentioned all those surveys. Could I request that the National Youth Council compile any youth-oriented surveys and share it on an annual basis with the youth development ecosystem so that we can all be on the same page about what we should be looking out for?",1,1144,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01144
2017-03-08-T-006,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin,"My second request is about the single unwed mothers issue. I understand the desire to protect the principle of encouraging childbirth in the context of marriage. I personally stand by this principle and I believe it serves society well. However, the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned just now that responsibility to the family is a critical guiding principle to protect in Singapore. So, in the case of unwed mums, are they not demonstrating responsibility to the family in their choice to keep and raise their child? And if we say, ""Yes, they are exercising responsibility to family"", then are we not —",2,1145,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01145

2017-03-08-T-006,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin,"Right. So, are we saying then that we actually do define the unwed mother and child as family? Based on that, I would request, could we still reconsider including them sometime down the road as part of family?",1,1147,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01147

On the second question, as I have said, if we look at how our society has evolved, we have been making progress on this front. Nevertheless, we will help, wherever possible, whoever we can, every Singaporean. I want to assure Members of this. I mentioned earlier that there are policies that cannot cover everything but we will look at issues on a case-by-case basis. I, personally, have seen my residents who may not come under certain policies, but they are being helped.

I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether the Ministry is going to review with HDB on the childcare provision for new BTOs, for future projects. The current provision is clearly not adequate because our residents have to send their children elsewhere. The 90-100 places per BTO is grossly inadequate.",1,1149,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01149

2017-03-08-T-006,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Sir, in my speech, I mentioned more than 300 children have been reached out to. We have three components  one is the home visitation; second, the KidSTART groups; the third is the KidSTART enhanced support to preschools. The actual number is more than 300 − which is 389. For home visitation, it involved 89 infants; for the KidSTART group, it involved 50 children and 45 parents; for the KidSTART enhanced support to preschools, it involved about 250 children across the selected preschools receiving enhanced support.",1,1152,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01152

And so, here, I hope you also would agree that the word ""illegitimate"" is actually quite negative. When you were saying that if we do away with the ""illegitimate"" issues on tax relief and inheritance issue, that would have a far-reaching impact. I would like to know what that far-reaching impact would be. We must be able to justify this impact or else these kids are going to bear this stigma for the rest of their lives. So, we need to see how we justify that.",1,1154,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01154

So, as I have said earlier, it is something that we have to consider carefully. It is not an overnight issue. We hear the different groups of people and we want to make sure that we journey on this together with our society. About the question on foreign spouses, as I have said, even though policies may not allow as such but, more importantly, if you know of anyone facing such an issue, ask them to see their Members of Parliament and we will see how we can facilitate that.",1,1156,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01156

I have raised in my question just now about the need to improve on the community engagement programmes for our students because they do spend a substantial number of hours contributing to community today. But I have also seen many cases because of the ineffective management of the programmes, we have kind of lost the interest of all these youths and, eventually, we could not bring them towards active volunteerism.

Some, you know, connect emotionally with the children and you can see that even though children may do it compulsorily because they have to – they have got to clock up the hours, they want to enhance their CV – but, as a result of the experience, it changes them. Which is why volunteering is not just about doing the thing, it is about changing lives.

Well, I am sure it is difficult to get everyone to be converted that way. But I think it is possible because they are still in school, you have a captive audience. You can run and curate structured programmes where you are able to enable such learning to take place. It is not about forcing it down their throats but by making sure that their journey is meaningful. The school plays a very big part; I think how the school appoints the teachers. It is not just being arrowed to do that, but putting heart and mind into how do you educate the child in the process.",3,1160,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01160

Your KPI cannot be just about people coming in, helping you and, therefore, doing the thing that you need to do to service your clients and to look after those you are looking after. But your responsibility is also to make sure that every volunteer that joins you believes in your cause and wants to come back.

They do very much believe that values can be inculcated. The very term ""Values-in-Action"", I think it is a very apt term for the programme because values are realised in action. We are working with them to see how to curate some of these experiences. We know some schools have done a fantastic job − very good outcomes – and we would like to see more of this happening.

The second question is, have you considered shared services for certain operational admin services which VWOs, about 400 of them, require in commonality? These shared services can bring down the so-called operational costs. And the third question is  have we considered forming an association in the social sector for VWOs so that they can learn the best practices and even complement each other with the resources and exchange views?",1,1163,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01163
2017-03-08-T-006,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Sir, with regard to the last point, it has been done via sharing in the community of practices. We have gatherings of the leaders and the various VWOs coming together; sometimes,there are focus areas of discussion. I have participated in some of these and they have been quite energising sessions. It serves to re-motivate many of them as well. They establish relationships and friendships, renew them and establish new ones which are very important in terms of collaboration work and, importantly, the exchange of good practices. We can do more and we aim to work with the social work fraternity to grow this.",1,1164,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01164

So, the scale is really not quite so ideal in terms of your own resourcing, in terms of your HR system, financial system. We are supportive of them trying to develop more shared services. That is the direction that we would like to see it going so that some of these services can, indeed, be shared and allow the social workers and the set-ups to really focus on the social work.",2,1165,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01165

Well, SS Net, which I have mentioned, and some Members will be familiar with, is a database that we have made available not just for SSOs but, eventually, to push down to the Family Service Centres as well. What it means is that the social workers can also tap onto the same base where we look at the individual. It is not just the SSO. We are not only linking up at the backend but at the front end as well so that at least there is a common database.

The Parliamentary Secretary rightly pointed out that working mothers usually need full-day childcare and stay-at-home mothers usually need the half-day childcare. Can we just base the level of subsidy on that, on whether one is full-day or half-day? This is so that we do not make it seem like we are penalising stay-at-home mothers, especially at a time when we are urging parents to spend more time with their children.",1,1172,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01172

If we are not careful, we enter a danger zone where our future generations will start to monetise all aspects of personal relationships. This is something we are watching. We want to make sure that it is affordable and we want to support family and child development but we do not want to go that line of monetising personal relationships, and go into the deep end.",1,1174,2017-03-08-T-006-S-01174
