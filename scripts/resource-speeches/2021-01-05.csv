2021-01-05-T-001,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development arising from the Study on the Inter-generational Effects of Divorce on Children in Singapore (a) whether there were significant differences in the outcomes of the children based on the age of the child when the parents got divorced; and (b) what are the Ministry’s next steps in further examining the issue of a ""divorce penalty"" on our children and studying the efficacy of our interventions to reduce the effect of this penalty.",1,1,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00001
2021-01-05-T-001,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Social and Family Development (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"Mr Speaker, Sir, divorce is never easy but some couples have had to make such a decision. Raising children poses its own challenges, and divorced parents, just like any other parent, want the best for their children and try their best to raise their children well.",1,2,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00002
2021-01-05-T-001,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Social and Family Development (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"The MSF study on the inter-generational effects of divorce covered more than 100,000 children and of these, about 8,800 of them were children whose parents divorced when they were below 21 years old. The study did not attempt to determine causality, that is, it did not seek to determine if the divorce itself caused certain outcomes in children.",2,3,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00003
2021-01-05-T-001,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Social and Family Development (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"Rather, the study examined the children’s outcomes in the following five areas and its co-occurrence with parental divorce  one, whether they obtained a university degree; two, their annual income, three, their balances in CPF MediSave and Special Accounts; four, whether they got married; and five, whether they divorced among those who got married.",3,4,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00004
2021-01-05-T-001,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Social and Family Development (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),There was no clear finding suggesting a relationship between the child’s age when the parents divorced and the child’s outcomes at age 35. MSF will continue to look deeper into various aspects of divorce so as to understand the factors that are associated with positive or negative child outcomes post-divorce.,4,5,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00005
2021-01-05-T-001,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Social and Family Development (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"The study findings show a significant negative association between parental divorce and children outcomes based on the five factors analysed. In other words, in general, children whose parents were divorced were more likely to not fare as well as those whose parents remained married based on the five factors analysed. But it is not a deterministic cause and effect relationship. In fact, the findings also indicated that amongst children whose parents were divorced, there were some who did as well and even better than many children whose parents remained married.",5,6,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00006
2021-01-05-T-001,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Social and Family Development (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"Hence, in cases of parental divorce, it is important to focus more efforts on early intervention for the children, not only to mitigate the potential negative effects but also to enhance their positive development. This intervention effort should be based on rigorous evidence from the social and behavioural sciences, and for it to work we will need good policies and the help from experts but also the support from families, communities and indeed a whole-of-society approach.",6,7,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00007
2021-01-05-T-001,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Social and Family Development (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"Today, couples who are undergoing divorce go through parenting programmes. Under the Women’s Charter, those who cannot agree on the divorce or its ancillary matters must attend a mandatory parenting programme before they can file for divorce. For those who agree on the divorce and its ancillary matters, they can go for the Parenting PACT programme after the divorce is concluded. Muslim couples considering divorce attend the Syariah Court’s mandatory Marriage Counselling Programme, as well as parenting programmes as part of the divorce process. All these initiatives for civil as well as Muslim divorces aim to raise parents’ awareness of their children’s needs and the importance of co-parenting in a respectful and collaborative manner. We will continually review both the process and the content of these initiatives to enhance their efficacy.",7,8,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00008
2021-01-05-T-001,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Social and Family Development (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"For couples experiencing marital stress or contemplating divorce, we have started a new online counselling pilot with the Community Psychology Hub in April 2020. Couples or their children can also alternatively approach any of our six Divorce Support Specialist Agencies (DSSAs) if they require counselling support. We will also be introducing a new pre-divorce online portal in late 2021. In this regard, MSF has just completed an engagement session with more than 120 citizens, many of whom were divorcees. I thank them for stepping forward as it is not easy for them. They have given us valuable inputs on how we can better provide information that parents need to consider when contemplating divorce, ranging from the emotional well-being of their children to bread and butter issues that impact their children, particularly housing and financial stability. MCCY will also be conducting a similar engagement with a focus on Muslim divorce issues.",8,9,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00009
2021-01-05-T-001,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Social and Family Development (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"MSF provides an evidence-based programme for parents and children between six and 15 years of age. This programme is called “Children in Between” and is run by counsellors from the DSSAs. It equips children with skills to manage their feelings and develop resilience. Although there are about 6,500 children a year whose parents get divorced, only about 100 children attend “Children in Between”. We are looking into how we can encourage more divorced parents to enrol themselves and their children for this important programme.",9,10,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00010
2021-01-05-T-001,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Social and Family Development (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"Our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) provide support to all students who are facing personal challenges. I encourage parents who would like such support for their children to approach the network of teachers, counsellors and Education and Career Guidance counsellors. I also encourage the older students, especially those who are teenagers, to seek help from this extensive network. If you are facing issues arising from your parents’ divorce, you need not handle it on your own. Please turn to this network of care and support.",10,11,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00011
2021-01-05-T-001,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Social and Family Development (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"Earlier, I mentioned that we had engaged more than 120 citizens on the pre-divorce support portal, and that many of them were divorcees. While they appreciated what we were trying to do, many strongly urged us to also try to save marriages. Indeed, it is as important, if not more, that we increase our upstream efforts to strengthen marriages.",11,12,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00012
2021-01-05-T-001,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Social and Family Development (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"We will also step up our efforts to encourage couples to undergo marriage preparation programmes such as the evidence-based Prevention and Relationship Education Programme (PREP) workshops run by our Social Service Agencies, which equips them with the skills to build a strong foundation for marriage. MSF offers a rebate of $140 for the PREP workshop, or $70 for other approved programmes conducted by Social Service Agencies. For Muslim couples, we provide Cinta Abadi marriage preparation programme which is now offered online to make it even more accessible.",12,13,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00013
2021-01-05-T-001,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Social and Family Development (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"Solemnisers can also play an important role to support newlyweds. A group of Kadis/Naib Kadis from the Registry of Muslim Marriages initiated the ground-up effort, Bersamamu or “With You”, to inspire strong and stable marriages. The Bersamamu has two components namely, face-to-face (F2F) interaction with soon to-wed couples and the Kadis/Naib Kadis remain connected with the newlyweds for up to two years after their solemnisation. Since Bersamamu started in July 2019, about 6,000 couples have attended the F2F Bersamamu with their Kadis/Naib Kadis. We will be engaging solemnisers from ROM and hope that we can find champions among them who would develop similar initiatives.",13,14,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00014
2021-01-05-T-001,Sun Xueling,The Minister of State for Social and Family Development (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"Since March 2019, we have trained 215 community leaders, religious and lay leaders as well as marriage solemnisers as Marital First Responders (MFRs). They will provide basic marriage support to couples facing marital issues, especially in its early stages before matters turn for the worse. We will continue to train more MFRs to support more couples in need. We are also working with social service agencies, community and religious organisations to offer more marriage enrichment programmes so that couples can nurture and deepen their relationships through life’s ups and downs, and find fulfilment in their marriage.",14,15,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00015

2021-01-05-T-001,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister of State for her reply. Divorce can be messy affairs and the children in these cases often suffer the consequences. Just last night, I had two divorce-related conflict cases at my Meet-the-People Session (MPS).",1,18,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00018
2021-01-05-T-001,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Our children need stability and security to grow into healthy adults and experts have said that it is important for divorced parents to remain amicable and be able to effectively co-parent, in order to mitigate what the experts term as ""divorce penalty"".",2,19,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00019
2021-01-05-T-001,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"I would like to ask the Minister of State, on average, how many percent of divorce cases are high-conflict cases, where the parents are unable to co-parent well; and whether MSF's social workers are able to step in earlier to help the children in such divorce cases, rather than having to wait until the Court orders a supervised exchange and visitation programme?",3,20,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00020
2021-01-05-T-001,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for his question. As a rough gauge, there were 249 Court Orders for supervised exchange or supervised visitation in 2019 – I guess you could consider that these are high-conflict situations – out of 7,620 divorces. This translates to about 3% of all divorces. I take the point that, indeed, we need to intervene earlier. I recognise the point that children may suffer the consequences of divorces if they are not handled properly and amicably. And that is why in my earlier reply, I had gone to some extent to talk about the marriage counselling programmes that we have.",1,21,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00021
2021-01-05-T-001,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Just to give an example. The marriage parenting programme I mentioned earlier for civil divorces is a consultation session for parents with minor children before they file for divorce and it is compulsory. It is designed to encourage divorcing couples to make improved decisions that prioritises the well-being of their children. For instance, the areas that they look at are to discuss the financial challenges they may face post-divorce, their living arrangements, child custody and access, as well as the co-parenting and parenting plan.",2,22,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00022
2021-01-05-T-001,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,We have various counselling sessions before the finalisation of a divorce to exactly achieve what the Member had shared with us  that we want to achieve the best available outcomes for children to mitigate the impact of divorces on them.,3,23,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00023
2021-01-05-T-001,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"I thank the Minister of State for her response and for sharing with us the programmes related to support, post-divorce, and also, pre-marital counselling. I would like to highlight that when couples go through divorce, unfortunately, despite all the efforts in pre-marital counselling and support that has already happened, it is a very difficult journey.",1,24,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00024
2021-01-05-T-001,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"I would like to ask what exactly was the Ministry's intention and motivation for this study? And what was the motivation for publishing the results of this study in a manner that, unfortunately, I think, creates the unintended further stigmatising of divorcees, achieving the effect of maybe potentially guilt-tripping them, and also the unfortunate labelling of children from divorced families. Are there any measures within the Ministry to look into better planning such communications in future, where it can be accompanied by further and deeper insights into the factors that account for the outcomes that were shared? I understand the spirit of data sharing and observations, but the timing of this publication and the limited scope or insights that it provided, unfortunately, created a certain effect amongst divorcees.",2,25,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00025
2021-01-05-T-001,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"I went through a broken marriage before. I was quite saddened when I saw this and I questioned myself. Does this make it harder for couples who are already considering divorce due to very difficult circumstances in their marriage? Because then, they would worry about these outcomes, which they already do worry about. It does not help them in their consideration process.",3,26,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00026
2021-01-05-T-001,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for her observation and her sharing. We fully recognise that divorce is a difficult process and also, a deeply personal one. That is why when I started my response, I had said that it is never easy. The intent of MSF to publish this research study is not to guilt trip anyone. But we have data, administrative data, and we think that there are important observations that can be made from this data. And we wanted to share it with practitioners and families, so that they understand what the data presents.",1,27,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00027
2021-01-05-T-001,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"MSF undertook the study to understand the potential impact of divorce. Like I have said, we looked at divorce and its co-occurrence with the five factors that I have shared earlier. But it is not about cause and effect. We are not talking about causation. We are talking about co-occurrence. That was how the study was conducted. Now that we have this information, the next step we want to look at is how we can further strengthen marriages, how we can help to prevent divorce where it is possible. But we fully recognise that, in some instances, for certain family dynamics, divorce may jolly well be the best way out for everyone. And if that is the case, and if there are young minor children involved, how best do we mitigate the impact of divorces on these children? That is the intent and the spirit of this study. But I fully acknowledge and take the Member's point about the importance of communications and that is why I really appreciate the opportunity to share about MSF's motivations at this occasion today.",2,28,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00028

2021-01-05-T-001,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Sir. I think the ""Children in Between"" programme is an important one. But as the Minister of State has just shared, the problem really is that the take-up rate is so low. So, I am just wondering whether MSF will consider making this programme mandatory, just like how we make the parenting programme mandatory as well.",1,30,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00030
2021-01-05-T-001,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for the suggestion. We will look into it. I guess, in any situation, we also have to consider the family dynamics. But I think it is a worthy suggestion the Member has made and MSF will study it. Thank you.",1,31,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00031

2021-01-05-T-001,Carrie Tan,Ms Carrie Tan,"Thank you, Minister of State. I would like to find out whether there are current plans and timelines for further studies around the various factors contributing to these outcomes that children from divorced families present. I think that will contribute to certain mitigation measures and specific programmes to address those factors. Are there any plans right now for this kind of research to further pursue the factors contributing to these outcomes?",1,33,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00033
2021-01-05-T-001,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for her supplementary question. I think with the data we have on hand, the next step we will look at is to explore what causes divorces and how we can better protect and strengthen marriages and also to mitigate the impact of divorce. If we were to attempt to try to explain causality, the way we would approach the study would be very different from how we have done so for this particular study because we would have to track the experience of the child from when the divorce takes place and we have to be able to isolate specific factors and, over time, see how the child has grown and developed and what eventually the outcome of the child is. It is different from how we have conducted the survey as it is now, which is based on administrative data and looks at where the child is, how they have performed at specific points in time.",1,34,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00034
2021-01-05-T-001,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"So, for us to undertake that kind of longitudinal study to determine causation will require a lot of resources. I think, for the time being, we will focus efforts on how we can better strengthen marriages, help the process when couples are contemplating divorce. I had talked about the pre-divorce support portal. So, those would be the immediate next steps that we will be taking.",2,35,2021-01-05-T-001-S-00035

Attendees will adhere to prevailing public health requirements and safe management measures. These include a rigorous testing regime, including pre-departure and on-arrival testing, as well as strict safe management measures during the Meeting itself. To minimise the risk of seeding local transmissions, we will also put in place measures to manage the interactions between the local community and the event attendees. The specific public health requirements and contingency plans are currently being worked out and will take into consideration the latest COVID-19 situations here in Singapore and also globally. The health requirements developed for this event could also serve as an important reference for subsequent events that are going to be held in Singapore.",1,38,2021-01-05-T-002-S-00038

So, we are looking forward to the opportunity for Singapore to contribute to the programme and discussions at the Meeting. In addition, we have also been introducing interested local companies and local service providers to the WEF and their contracted event organiser, PublicisLive, to explore potential partnerships between our local companies and service providers as well as PublicistLive and the event organiser.

Natural gas currently accounts for 95% of the electricity produced in Singapore and I think all Members here in this House would appreciate the fact that we lack alternative energy sources. We do not have the natural resources, land area as well as climatic conditions necessary for the large-scale deployment of renewable energy sources, such as hydro and wind. Natural gas will continue to be the mainstay and main source of energy for power generation to serve our households and industry reliably in the medium term, and this is as we continue to develop the other three switches.",3,53,2021-01-05-T-003-S-00053
2021-01-05-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Our second switch, which is solar energy, is currently the most viable source of renewable energy within Singapore. Over the last 10 years, installed solar capacity has increased more than a hundred fold, from 3.8 megawatt-peak in 2010, to around 400 megawatt-peak last year, in mid-2020. We are accelerating our efforts and will almost quadruple our solar capacity to 1.5 gigawatt-peak by 2025 – five years from now – and, by the end of 2030, we hope to achieve 2 gigawatt-peak. So, by 2030, we expect our second switch to supply around 3% of our total electricity consumption. And, of course, depending on the state of technology at that point in time and cost, we hope to be able to do more.",4,54,2021-01-05-T-003-S-00054
2021-01-05-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Our local companies partner the Government in the deployment of solar photovoltaic systems. For example, the Sunseap Group is a major participant in the SolarNova programme, which deploys solar panels in public sector buildings and spaces. When these companies invest in overseas renewable companies and projects, they can bring valuable insights and capabilities back home here in Singapore. These projects may, some day, also export electricity to Singapore as well. This brings me, therefore, to the third switch, and that is on regional power grids.",5,55,2021-01-05-T-003-S-00055
2021-01-05-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Regional power grids, or electricity imports, is our third switch. Today, some Southeast Asian countries have an abundance of hydroelectric power and other renewable energies. If we can connect the regional grid well, it will provide greater resilience and sustainability for the entire system. For a start, we are trialling imports of up to 100 megawatts from Peninsular Malaysia. One hundred megawatts would be about 1.5% of our peak electricity demand. So, there will be minimal impact on the reliability as well as cost of our electricity supply. Our preference, of course, is to import electricity from renewable energy sources. Hence, the “cleanliness” of the generation source will be a consideration in selecting the importer. The Energy Market Authority (EMA) will select the importer through an open and competitive selection process, and it is expected to sell electricity via the Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market (SWEM) to interested buyers.",6,56,2021-01-05-T-003-S-00056
2021-01-05-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Other companies, like Sun Cable, have also approached EMA to import electricity to Singapore. We welcome these interests, but we have to also be mindful to pace these imports to ensure that they complement and do not undermine the reliability of our electricity supply as well as the stability of our electricity market. Sir, discussions on Sun Cable's proposal to supply solar power from Australia’s Northern Territory to Singapore are on-going. At this particular point in time, EMA is unable to share details, given the commercial sensitivities – a point that I believe everyone in the House would appreciate.",7,57,2021-01-05-T-003-S-00057
2021-01-05-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Last but not least, for our fourth switch, we are also working intensively with the industry and research community to study emerging low-carbon technologies, such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage. We will facilitate the development of these technologies through various research, development and demonstration funding initiatives, including a Low-Carbon Energy Research Funding Initiative. This initiative will see around $50 million being used to explore areas such as the supply, storage and downstream uses of hydrogen, as well as carbon capture and storage for use in building materials or fuels.",8,58,2021-01-05-T-003-S-00058
2021-01-05-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"By tapping on all four switches, Singapore will be able to diversify our energy sources. This will enhance our access to secure and competitively priced energy supplies and this will reduce our energy security risks. The future energy mix will depend on technological advances in the four switches. This will need to be complemented by efforts to enhance energy efficiency across all sectors and consumers. The Government will work hand-in-hand with our workforce, researchers, industries and consumers, to achieve our vision of a cleaner, a more efficient and a more secure energy future.",9,59,2021-01-05-T-003-S-00059

2021-01-05-T-003,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I thank the Minister for the answers. I have two supplementary questions. The first question is in relation to energy resilience, and I would like to point out that the Minister had shared and answered some of the questions that I had in mind for my supplementary question. But the question I have now is, the Minister mentioned that the energy mix would be dependent on the technology improvements over time, but can you roughly share the percentages target for some of these switches at this point in time. Because if you look at the electricity reliance now, we are relying a lot on natural gas. I think more than 95% of the electricity generated in Singapore is via imported natural gas and it is largely from Malaysia and Indonesia. So, there is a concentration effect, by country, on Malaysia and Indonesia. The mix by country, for one, if you can share, going forward over the medium to long term, and also in terms of the switches, if you can share.",1,61,2021-01-05-T-003-S-00061
2021-01-05-T-003,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My second question is, as we proceed to these four switches, going forward – over the next five, 10, 20, 30 and 50 years – for example, in Malaysia's case where we are trying to get the electricity imports from Malaysia into 2021, we have the electricity connector infrastructure with Malaysia. Going forward if the Sun Cable project does materialise, how do we get some of this direct electricity connectivity to Singapore, when we have these switches exposing us to various countries as far afield as Australia, if the Sun Cable project does happen and as far afield as Indochina, going forward?",2,62,2021-01-05-T-003-S-00062
2021-01-05-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"I thank Mr Saktiandi for his questions. With regard to the percentage breakdown of the four switches, at this particular point in time, it is 95% natural gas. The natural fossil fuels which we, as I have alluded to earlier is the cleanest fossil fuel today.",1,63,2021-01-05-T-003-S-00063
2021-01-05-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"It is difficult to give a percentage breakdown but suffice to say that by 2030, we expect to peak in terms of carbon emission at about 65 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emission. Our target is to halve that by 2050. So, from 65 million tonnes, we will halve it to 33 million tonnes by 2050. By the latter half of this century, we will achieve a net zero carbon emission. That is the target that we have set for ourselves.",2,64,2021-01-05-T-003-S-00064
2021-01-05-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"Depending on the technology development over the next 10,15 to 20 years, we should see an increased migration towards renewable energy, of which solar is one of them, and a higher degree, depending on the trial import of this 100 megawatt from Peninsular Malaysia, a higher reliance on drawing from the regional power grid as well. In fact, just last year, declared our intent to procure another 100 megawatt from the Lao PDR via the Lao, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore grid network.",3,65,2021-01-05-T-003-S-00065
2021-01-05-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"We hope that in time, we can also, through this, reach out to more ASEAN countries to tap on this regional grid. That is another one of our diversification strategies.",4,66,2021-01-05-T-003-S-00066
2021-01-05-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"To the extent that we are able to draw from the regional power grid, we certainly would. The Sun Cable project, as I have alluded to, is also something which we are in active negotiations. Obviously, we are not at liberty at this particular point in time to communicate the details of it because of the commercial sensitivities.",5,67,2021-01-05-T-003-S-00067
2021-01-05-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"To the Member's last point about the concentration risk, today, a significant amount of the natural gas that we are using to burn comes from Malaysia and Indonesia through the PNG. But we have also now diversified the sources of the procurement via LNG, the liquefied natural gas, from other countries further afield and that includes the Middle East, UAE and so on. The exact breakdown of that, at this particular point in time, I cannot provide to the hon Member.",6,68,2021-01-05-T-003-S-00068
2021-01-05-T-003,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"I thank the Minister for the detailed explanation. I have got two supplementary questions. The first is in relation to the setting off targets. I note the Minister's speech that we are expected to employ two gigawatt peaks of solar energy by 2030 which we expect to contribute to 3% of our electricity generation needs, and also, that we are going to have an emissions target for 2030 and 2050. And in relation to these, if I may ask, if the Ministry would consider setting a target mix for the amount of electricity that is going to be generated from renewable energy sources as a target that we can strive for together as a nation?",1,69,2021-01-05-T-003-S-00069
2021-01-05-T-003,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"If we look at the IEA estimates, at present, globally, about 30% of the electricity generation is really from renewable sources. I recognise that we have geographical constraints but is that perhaps a goal that we can strive towards, especially when we are already considering new green energy sources such as hydrogen, which I recognise that the EMA is already studying.",2,70,2021-01-05-T-003-S-00070
2021-01-05-T-003,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"The second is in relation to the calculation of electrical tariffs. Right now, given that 95% of the energy mix is derived from natural gas, I think the fuel cost component is pretty much based on average natural gas prices, especially if future transmission from regional grids are involved. How then would the fuel costs as well as network costs component be calculated, and how would that be passed on to consumers at the end of the day?",3,71,2021-01-05-T-003-S-00071

To the first point, in terms of working on the target, indeed, we are and we have been looking at the different technologies that are available at this particular point in time. Also, through working with the research institutions, the universities and so on, to see how we can also take on some of these initiatives with regard to carbon capture utilisation to see how we can set that target. In due time we would be able to share that, once a more definitive landing on some of these technologies are available.",1,72,2021-01-05-T-003-S-00072

2021-01-05-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"With regard to the electricity tariffs, it is, at this particular point in time, still a fairly commercial venture.

There will be an open transparent bidding process and this electricity will then be sold into the Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market.",3,74,2021-01-05-T-003-S-00074
2021-01-05-T-003,Tan See Leng,Dr Tan See Leng,"When we work out the arithmetic behind it, from the import of the 100 megawatt from the regional power grid, the pricing should not be significantly higher than what we are already getting today in terms of the electricity tariffs.

Was it essentially due false reporting on the part of residents? If that is the case, then was it because that they were misled in the kind of criteria they needed to submit for the applications?",2,113,2021-01-05-T-005-S-00113
2021-01-05-T-005,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"And then, relatedly, my second question is whether there are actions to ameliorate this kind of false positives. So, for instance, if someone faced clawback, would they be able to then pay back the amount in instalments, for example?",3,114,2021-01-05-T-005-S-00114
2021-01-05-T-005,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, the Member has described some cases as false positives. I take that to mean that they were actually the intended recipients of SIRS but they are not going to get it. Actually, what we are discussing in this Parliamentary Question that has been filed is that they are not the intended recipients of SIRS but because of the way in which they had declared their incomes, they appeared to be eligible and the payout was given to them. So, steps are being taken now to ask these individuals to refund the amount.",1,115,2021-01-05-T-005-S-00115
2021-01-05-T-005,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"It is perhaps useful to describe the whole situation here. SIRS had a very large group of recipients that were auto-included. We had used past data to ascertain their eligibility based on the criteria that was set out. And without asking these individuals to submit further information, the payout was processed, it was disbursed to them. This was one group.",2,116,2021-01-05-T-005-S-00116
2021-01-05-T-005,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"But we also know that basing our disbursement on past information would potentially exclude a group of intended recipients whose data, whose information, have been updated but which we were not in possession of. That is why a category was opened up for applications.",3,117,2021-01-05-T-005-S-00117
2021-01-05-T-005,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In this period where the Government was actually processing and disbursing a very large number of grant and support schemes to households, to businesses, each of these had very tight timelines to follow. As a result, in order to meet the timelines, there were many occasions where we decided that we should take the individuals' declarations in good faith and process the payments.",4,118,2021-01-05-T-005-S-00118
2021-01-05-T-005,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"However, as stewards of public funds, we do have the duty to audit. In this situation, one good outcome is that the audit showed that most of the successful applicants had actually valid reasons to have applied and they met the eligibility criteria. But there was a very small number, for whatever reasons, they may have been mistaken in their own understanding of their circumstances, it is sometimes possible that a person did not quite know what he was earning and he made a declaration based on a mistaken understanding. So, we will reach out to them and try to sort these things out.",5,119,2021-01-05-T-005-S-00119
2021-01-05-T-005,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Pritam Singh.,1,120,2021-01-05-T-005-S-00120
2021-01-05-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thank you, Speaker. I am following up on the answer by the Minister for Manpower. Minister for Manpower alluded earlier in her reply to cases that have been referred to the Police. Can the Minister share how many cases, in absolute number, have been referred to the Police?",1,121,2021-01-05-T-005-S-00121
2021-01-05-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Secondly, the Minister spoke of erroneous declarations – 0.5% were erroneous. Again, the absolute number would be appreciated.",2,122,2021-01-05-T-005-S-00122
2021-01-05-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To that end, I had a resident who approached me at my MPS who declared openly that he earned $10,000 a month but he had certain circumstances which he reported accordingly, and he was given the SIRS payout. Now, it is being clawed back.",3,123,2021-01-05-T-005-S-00123
2021-01-05-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"My point is not so much about this case but how many cases were there where it was NTUC or MOM which actually approved a SIRS payout, even though it was well outside the qualifying criteria, and now, it is calling for a clawback? How many cases involved, I would not call it a mistake but actions that were taken by NTUC or SIRS, resulting in a clawback?",4,124,2021-01-05-T-005-S-00124
2021-01-05-T-005,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, I think Mr Singh's second and third questions are basically asking for the same information. What is the number of cases where we have approached the individuals for refunds of the SIRS payouts? I mentioned in my reply that it was about 0.5% of the successful applicants. The number of successful applicants is something in the order of 200,000. There are still some that are pending processing, but 0.5% would come to about 1,000. I think that is the number that applies it to both his second and his third questions.",1,125,2021-01-05-T-005-S-00125
2021-01-05-T-005,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"To the first question, how many cases have been referred to the Police? I do not have the number offhand, perhaps if the Member were to file a Parliamentary Question, we could address it appropriately. However, I should add that the investigations are still on-going and it would be inappropriate for me to comment too much on it right now.",2,126,2021-01-05-T-005-S-00126
2021-01-05-T-005,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Pritam Singh.,1,127,2021-01-05-T-005-S-00127
2021-01-05-T-005,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"I thank the Minister. Let me just parse my second and third supplementary questions a bit more finely. I apologise if I did not make it clear. In her reply, Minister spoke of erroneous declarations, the suggestion being that it was the applicant who made the erroneous declaration. And the third supplementary question really was looking at the number of cases where NTUC or MOM acknowledged that a person fell outside the qualifying criteria and then decided actually, no, this should not have been approved in the first place and hence is now clawing the SIRS payout back. How many cases are we referring to in that regard?",1,128,2021-01-05-T-005-S-00128
2021-01-05-T-005,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, Mr Singh mentioned one case. I myself have not come across another but I believe that there may have been a few. I do not have the number that I can share with him right now.",1,129,2021-01-05-T-005-S-00129
2021-01-05-T-006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,asked the Minister for Manpower with regard to the Jobs Growth Incentive scheme (a) how does the Ministry derive the support threshold of 50% for mature local hires aged 40 and above; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider increasing this support threshold to 75% to incentivise more employers to hire mature local workers instead of foreign workers.,1,130,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00130
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Mr Speaker, Members have filed a number of questions on employment support for different groups of jobseekers. I will respond to these related questions together for a fuller treatment.",1,131,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00131
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"The SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package was launched in April 2020 with the goal of curating 100,000 jobs and skills opportunities for Singaporean workers. From April to October, the National Jobs Council or NJC, working in partnership with employers and unions, placed nearly 60,000 jobseekers into various opportunities. As at end-October, there are more than 123,000 jobs and skills opportunities still available.",2,132,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00132
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Assoc Prof Jamus Lim was interested to know about the nature of these opportunities. For the purposes of statistical comparison across countries, the International Labour Organization or ILO defines ""standard employment"" as work that is full-time, continuous, with a direct relationship between employer and employee. This would exclude employment on fixed term contracts, temporary employment, part-time employment, multi-party employment and gig work; all of which are commonly found in modern job markets. This is why the ILO recognises that non-standard employment can provide meaningful opportunities for workers to enter the labour market or to switch sectors. For the same reason, the NJC does not narrowly	focus on opportunities that meet the definition of ""standard employment"". Instead, the NJC's aim is to open up pathways for jobseekers to make inroads into the workforce despite global weakness in labour demand.",3,133,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00133
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),Company-hosted traineeships and attachments as well as curated training courses will help jobseekers who are unable to secure a job acquire industry-relevant skills and exposure. This will improve their employability and position them better for eventual economic recovery.,4,134,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00134
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"It is encouraging that amongst the SGUnited Jobs and Skills placements, about half were into long-term jobs. One in three were into short-term jobs of less than 12-month duration. The remaining were for company-hosted traineeships and attachments or course-based training. Of the available SGUnited Jobs and Skills opportunities, nearly six in 10 were for long-term jobs, two in 10 were for short-term jobs, and the remainder for company-hosted traineeships and attachments, or course-based training.",5,135,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00135
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Gerald Giam asked about support for mature workers to find jobs and make career transitions. Jobseekers aged 40 and above are well-represented among those placed into opportunities under the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package, comprising around 50% of job placements and 35% of traineeships and attachments, and training opportunities.",6,136,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00136
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"We have consistently provided more support to help mature workers make career transitions. In the Unity Budget, we introduced the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package for locals in their 40s and 50s, to help them stay employable and enter new jobs or new industries. This provides enhanced support of up to 90% of the cost for employers to reskill mature new employees, as compared to generally up to 70% for other new employees.",7,137,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00137
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),The Government provided an additional $500 SkillsFuture Credit for those aged 40 to 60 in 2020 to empower them to refresh their skills and enhance their employability. We also built up a pool of volunteer Career Advisors to provide sector and occupation-specific career advice and outline career options.,8,138,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00138
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Mature individuals have valuable skills and bring with them a wealth of work experience. However, some mature jobseekers may still face difficulties in finding permanent jobs in the current job market.",9,139,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00139
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"In September 2020, the Jobs Growth Incentive or JGI was launched to support firms in accelerating the hiring of their local workforce. To encourage employers to consider hiring more mature jobseekers, the Government will underwrite 50% of their salaries, up to the first $5,000, for 12 months. This is double the wage support for younger new local hires.",10,140,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00140
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"The Jobs Growth Incentive should be seen in conjunction with other measures in the overall package. For example, an employer that meets the eligibility criteria for the Jobs Growth Incentive and hires a mature local worker via a Professional Conversion Programme will not only receive the 50% JGI, but also additional salary support and course fee subsidies, as well as further salary support under the Jobs Support Scheme if they are eligible. This approach has the advantage of tilting more support towards jobseekers that are harder to be matched to available openings.",11,141,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00141
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Having said that, the JGI scheme is still very new, having only started in September 2020. We are constantly monitoring the situation and will continue to make adjustments as and when necessary. For example, in October last year, we extended the higher tier of JGI support to persons with disabilities as well as ex-offenders. This was in response to points raised by Mayor Denise Phua and Mr Murali Pillai.",12,142,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00142
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Mr de Souza asked about the Jobs Support Scheme for the aviation and tourism-related industries. The Government has put in substantial effort and committed close to $100 billion in support measures to help companies and workers deal with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our economic measures are estimated to have offset some of the rise in resident unemployment rate by about 1.7 percentage points this year. MOF extended the Jobs Support Scheme to cover wages up to March 2021 for sectors that continue to be impacted by COVID-19, such as the aviation and tourism sectors, and are reviewing if a further extension is needed.",13,143,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00143
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"MOT and MTI have also provided targeted support to prepare our businesses and workers to emerge stronger. For the aviation sector, MOT introduced the Enhanced Aviation Support Package to preserve core capabilities and to support our local carriers to regain air connectivity to the world. For the tourism sector, MTI worked with industry stakeholders to pilot MICE events and formulate an Event Industry Resilience Roadmap to provide guidance on safe and gradual resumption of business events. STB also launched a domestic tourism campaign and the SingapoRediscovers Vouchers to drive local tourism and stimulate sectoral activity.",14,144,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00144
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"While the aviation and tourism sectors have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, its medium to long-term prospects remain positive.",15,145,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00145
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"However, unlike in a cyclical downturn, some jobs may not return in their previous forms. Therefore, in addition to the Jobs Support Scheme, we are supporting employers to make use of the downtime to redesign jobs and reskill their employees to take on new job roles. For example, WSG has rolled out the Job Redesign Reskilling Programme and the Digital Marketing Reskilling Programme to retrain and redeploy workers in hotel and tourism companies.",16,146,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00146
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"For affected workers who are looking to switch to new careers, we will help them to access jobs and skills opportunities. WSG has set up the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Centres in all HDB towns and deployed Careers Connect On-the-Go to bring career matching and coaching services closer to jobseekers. This is in addition to physical touchpoints such as WSG Careers Connect, NTUC-e2i's career centres and WSG-appointed Career Matching Providers, Ingeus and MAXIMUS. Jobseekers can also use WSG's MyCareersFuture.gov.sg, to search for job opportunities that suit their skills and competencies.",17,147,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00147
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo),"The Jobs Growth Incentive will enable firms that continue to do well in the current climate to bring forward their hiring plans. The Government will press on with our efforts to provide employment facilitation support to different groups of jobseekers in different industries, to help them emerge stronger for eventual economic recovery.",18,148,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00148
2021-01-05-T-006,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Gerald Giam.,1,149,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00149
2021-01-05-T-006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"I thank the Minister for her reply. According to MOM's Third Quarter Labour Market Report, unemployment rate among residents aged between 40 and 59 was higher and rose more steeply compared to all other age groups except those below 30, so I am hopeful that the JGI will help this group.",1,150,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00150
2021-01-05-T-006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),My questions are  how many individuals aged 40 and above have secured jobs as a result of the JGI since the scheme was introduced in August; what is the Ministry's target figure for the number of secure jobs for mature workers under the JGI; and what will they count as a success for this scheme?,2,151,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00151
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Speaker, the Member has asked for an update of the JGI which I am also keen to provide to Members as soon as the data is available.",1,152,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00152
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,Let me explain why it takes a bit of time for us to understand how well the JGI has been taken up by companies.,2,153,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00153
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The objective of the JGI is to encourage firms to bring forward their hiring and to expand the number of locals in their workforce. In order to reduce the administrative burden to these companies, we will look at their CPF data and compute the incentive that they are eligible for so that we can automatically disburse it to them.",3,154,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00154
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"For every person that is eligible for JGI support, the administrator will have to look at the CPF submissions of the employer in order to compute the incentive that is being paid out to the company. For every employer that has a local employee, for which he has CPF employer obligations, the employer is actually given two months in order to make the CPF payments. So, for someone who was employed, brought onboard at the start of the programme in September 2020, the employer actually has up till the end of November in order to make those payments. [Please refer to ""Clarification by Minister for Manpower"", Official Report, 1 February 2021, Vol 95, Issue No 16.]",4,155,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00155
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"So, the data is still very new, we have to wait for it to come in, in order to make a proper analysis for it. But I assure the Member that we ourselves are very keen to have a sense of it. And like him, we are particularly interested in who has been on the receiving end of this support as far as the jobseekers are concerned.",5,156,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00156
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"I would also want to add one more point. The Member has pointed to the unemployment rate of different age groups. Here, I think I wanted to make a general point to all Members and not to Mr Giam, specifically.",6,157,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00157
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"We always have to look at data, especially on labour statistics, in a holistic manner. Looking at unemployment is one important indicator but it is also important to look at employment. In the case of Singapore, what we have found is that by the end of the third quarter, the employment levels have returned almost to pre-COVID-19 levels. The employment levels in September 2020, if we compared it to a year ago, was off by just about 0.4%.",7,158,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00158
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"That does not mean that we are not concerned about the unemployment numbers and, of course, of the groups that still face more serious issues when it comes to unemployment.",8,159,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00159
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"But we look at it in totality, it does paint a different picture. It does tell us that notwithstanding the difficulties, the jobseekers are still invested in the search. They have not exited from the workforce. And if they had exited from the workforce, we would have a very different problem because over the medium to longer term, we still have to address the challenges of a contracting workforce and we also do want to be able to enable people to stay in the workforce, especially those that are older.",9,160,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00160
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr Giam has asked about what would constitute a good target. I would say that at this point in time, we would have to look at the entire pool of jobseekers in totality. Every single one of them is important. Every single one of them that we can get back into our workforce is a family that is more able to make progress. So, whilst being concerned about specific segments of jobseekers, I would say that everyone benefiting from the JGI is still a good thing for us.",10,161,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00161
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The Government has set aside a budget of $1 billion for the JGI and we will look at the take-up rate and make adjustments if it is necessary to do so, as we have done for all schemes in the past.",11,162,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00162

Having said that, I really want to understand whether the JGI has a target that it wants to achieve.",1,164,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00164
2021-01-05-T-006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"This is related to my Parliamentary Question in which I asked about whether the 75% threshold would be considered because if there is no target that is set, how would the Ministry know whether or not it has achieved what it needs to achieve, and how would it know whether it needs to make adjustments, for example, increasing the salary support threshold?",2,165,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00165
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Mr S peaker, I would be cautious about expecting any one single scheme to deliver on our objectives when it comes to employment. Overall, as a Government, our aim must be to try and expand employment and bring down unemployment.",1,166,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00166
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"To do so, many factors will have to be aligned. For example, the overall economic conditions and business confidence must be there. If the overall economic conditions are not favourable and businesses do not have the confidence, then no matter how much we set aside for the JGI, no matter how lofty the goals we set out as targets, it will not produce the intended results.",2,167,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00167
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"I should also say that in terms of our ability to create the right economic conditions and to boost business confidence, a lot of it has to do with how we are going to continue managing the public health risk.",3,168,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00168
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"So, yesterday, we had a very extensive exchange in Parliament following the Ministerial Statements by my colleagues, Ministers Gan Kim Yong and Lawrence Wong. Everything that we are doing in the Multi-Ministry Task Force to manage the public health risk is to enable the economy to get back to some normalcy, at the same time recognising that things will not be identical to what they were before and the adjustments that businesses are going to have to make.",4,169,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00169
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"It is also with that context in mind that when we examine the range of schemes and tools that we have at our disposal, it has to be, in terms of how they complement one another. So, the JGI tries to encourage the employers to expand hiring. But we know that for the positions that require higher skills demands from the jobseekers, we know that JGI alone will not do the trick. Because you can put the incentive in front of the employer, but from the employer's perspective, there is no point in whether it is bearing 25%, 50% or 75% of the wage cost if this person that is brought on board is not able to perform as part of the team and deliver and help the business advance, which is why the JGI has to work in concert with other schemes.",5,170,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00170
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"So, it is not a good idea for us to overly depend on any single scheme. It is a more holistic approach that we have to employ in order to ensure that we are able to boost employment and bring down unemployment.",6,171,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00171
2021-01-05-T-006,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"But the commitment is certainly there and we are putting all the effort that can be conceived of, and if there are other interventions that are needed, we will certainly also consider the need and the timeliness to do so.",7,172,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00172

2021-01-05-T-006,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"And the reason why I draw this distinction is because while I appreciate that non-standard jobs are still jobs, but for workers, these are quite different things if they were to lose their jobs.

If people, for some reason, are not able to get into a meaningful position, whether it is company hosted traineeships or attachments or whether it is training programmes that are course based, I think the risk to them is not so much that they do not have standard employment now; the risk to them is that they will never have standard employment in future.",2,178,2021-01-05-T-006-S-00178

2021-01-05-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"There are several types of 3D printers currently available on the market, catering to a wide range of customers – from action figure enthusiasts, to start-ups doing rapid prototyping, to aeroplane manufacturers. These 3D printers can use a wide variety of “raw ingredients”, from plastics, to metal, to carbon fibre. Perhaps, the Ministry could consider imposing a licensing requirement on those who import industrial-grade 3D printers, as such devices have the potential to 3D-print a fully functioning gun. Examples would include the Stereolithography printer, the Direct Metal Laser Sintering printer, and the Electron Beam Melting printer.",7,202,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00202
2021-01-05-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Mr Speaker, the Bill’s proposal to criminalise the act of loading drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles with weapons and explosives is both timely and crucial. As the Minister of State mentioned in his speech yesterday, drones loaded with weapons can pose a serious threat to safety and security. As early as 2015, there were news reports of a teenager in the United States who had already figured out a way to mount a handgun onto a drone and fire it remotely. To make things more worrying, instructional videos on how to do this, which is to replicate this remote firing process, can easily be found online. As technology progresses and the effective range for drones increases exponentially, it is likely that drones can be controlled beyond an operator’s visual line of sight, and foreign sources can use their drones to enter our airspace with malicious intent.",8,203,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00203
2021-01-05-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"I would like to ask the Minister of State what will be our defences and countermeasures against such drone attacks, in particular, if the drone is operated remotely by an operator based outside of Singapore? Are there plans to develop our own anti-drone radar and jamming systems? Many Members of this House would recall the drone disruptions that happened at Changi Airport in June 2019, which shows that malicious actors need not necessarily load a drone with a weapon to cause damage in Singapore. The drone itself can be the weapon.",9,204,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00204
2021-01-05-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Mr Speaker, another key provision of the Bill is to allow for the outsourcing of compliance checks for low-risk guns, explosives and weapons (GEWs). According to the Minister of State, this is to allow our Licensing Officers to focus their attention on high-risk GEWs. While I can understand the intent and need to optimise our resources, we must ensure that the third parties that are contracted are able to maintain the high standards of the MHA and SPF. I would, therefore, like to ask what will be the training, if any, that will be provided to these third-party licensing officers, what are the standards that will be imposed on them, and how does the Ministry intend to ensure that they adhere to these standards.",10,205,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00205
2021-01-05-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Mr Speaker, as we review our existing regulatory regime governing weapons and firearms, we need to also bear in mind that there exists a small but sizable number of replica gun hobbyists in Singapore, who have an interest in collecting gun replicas.",11,206,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00206
2021-01-05-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"While gun replicas are harmless on its own, the high resemblance to real guns can cause a lot of undue fear and alarm, especially to vulnerable people such as the elderly and children. Many replica gun hobbyists are deeply private and most pursue their passion quietly. However, just as 3D printing technology gives criminals the ability to produce their own guns, it would also allow these hobbyists to 3D-print their own gun replicas.",12,207,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00207
2021-01-05-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"I would like to ask if the Bill would criminalise the possession of digital blueprints for gun replicas, such as BB guns and Water BB guns.

As we move into the new decade, drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles will increasingly become a security threat, and we will need to step up on our anti-drone capabilities. I also hope that the Ministry could do more to engage hobbyists, who often keep their hobbies in the dark, for fear of running afoul of the law, as they, too, can use the same additive manufacturing technology to 3D-print replica guns, and even functional ones.

2021-01-05-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Nevertheless, I would like to seek some clarifications on the provisions relating to security clearances and licensing and on the appointment of Compliance Officers.",2,213,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00213
2021-01-05-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, on the issuing of licences. Clause 43 of the Bill provides that licences may be issued to individuals as well as non-individuals, such as corporate entities. For individuals' licence to possess firearms, I believe there was a historical practice where wealthy individuals and/or their security personnel were permitted to carry firearms for protection. This was because they were considered to be at risk of being kidnapped for ransom. Could the Ministry clarify whether such considerations still apply today and, if so, how many licences have been issued to individuals for this purpose of private defence?",3,214,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00214
2021-01-05-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"As for licences issued to organisations, clause 43 states that security clearances must first be obtained for all individuals who are responsible executives as well as at least one close associate of the entity. While it is quite logical that responsible executives, such as the CEO, president or general manager, would need security clearances, the additional requirement for the close associates to also have security clearance needs further explanation. A close associate of an entity is defined as a person who either holds 5% of equity or voting rights or is a person who will be managing the business. Why is it necessary to have security clearance for a 5% shareholder who may not be participating in managing the business? And, if it deemed relevant to clear shareholders, why is the bar set at only 5%, meaning that the remaining 95% of shareholders do not need security clearance? Is this meant to cater for companies whose shareholders are mainly corporations?",4,215,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00215
2021-01-05-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, I move on to the factors considered by the Licensing Officer in deciding on security clearances. It is stated in clause 45 that the Licensing Officer must consider various factors, including whether the applicant has participated in any criminal activity, has a history of violence or threat of violence and whether clearing the applicant is contrary to the public interest or national security. The explicit listing of the factors is welcome for transparency.",5,216,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00216
2021-01-05-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"At this juncture, it would be useful for the Ministry to clarify whether the Licensing Officer still has discretion to grant the security clearance to an applicant who fails on one or some criteria, say, the applicant has an old conviction in the Youth Court when he was a teenager.",6,217,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00217
2021-01-05-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Another question on security clearances is how the Licensing Officer would access information submitted to him in such applications. Clause 45(2) provides that to assist the Licensing Officer, the Commissioner of Police or a law enforcement agency may provide a report to him to help assess applications for security clearances. Thus, the Licensing Officer can verify whether the applicant is known to have participated in criminal or violent acts and so on.",7,218,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00218
2021-01-05-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"In this regard, I believe the Ministry expects to receive applications from foreigners, such as those who need short-term licences for trade fairs. How will be Licensing Officer verify the background information of foreign applicants? I hope there will be no compromise in ensuring that foreign persons are subject to the same standard of checks as resident applicants.",8,219,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00219
2021-01-05-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Finally, I have one clarification on the appointment of Compliance Officers. Clause 80 of the Bill provides that the Licensing Officer can appoint an individual who is not a public officer to be a compliance officer. According to the Ministry’s press release of 3 November, the investigation and enforcement of breaches will still be handled by Police officers.",9,220,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00220
2021-01-05-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I also note some restrictions on the powers of a Compliance Officer under clause 80(7). Nevertheless, under Part 6 of the Bill, compliance officers will be empowered to check licensees for compliance including inspection of premises, asking for information and explanations, stopping vehicles in transit and so on. These are potentially confrontational situations at locations where guns and weapons are kept. Failure to comply with a Compliance Officer’s directions is also an offence punishable with a fine of up to $10,000.",10,221,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00221
2021-01-05-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"As the powers and responsibilities of Compliance Officers are thus not trivial, could the Ministry explain why it decided to set the minimum age for Compliance Officers at only 18 years?",11,222,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00222
2021-01-05-T-009,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,"Mr Speaker, Sir, when I learnt about this Bill, I wondered at first if it was necessary to regulate guns, explosives and weapons through a new piece of legislation.

We are fortunate to be able to provide a fairly secure environment for Singaporeans and residents so far. Even so, there are still cases of violence and unauthorised use of fireworks. Our tight control over guns and weapons has helped minimised the destructive impact of such events. However, we must not take things for granted.",5,227,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00227
2021-01-05-T-009,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,"It is of the utmost importance that we continue to remain vigilant and stringent on security measures. There have been many incidents and tragedies in countries that had legalised arms possession. We must continue to have zero tolerance towards guns and weapons, just as we do not tolerate drugs in our jurisdiction. We must continue to educate Singaporeans that such a stand has been key to our secure and safe living environment.",6,228,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00228
2021-01-05-T-009,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,"Therefore, the deterrence penalties, in line with other relevant legislation, including capital punishment, must be upheld.

2021-01-05-T-009,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,"In addition, we need to tighten the surveillance of potential influence and threats in social media.

2021-01-05-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Mr Speaker, the Guns, Explosives and Weapons Control Bill of 2021 comes at an appropriate time, as advances in additive manufacturing technology mean that the accessibility of firearms is now simpler than ever before. While the key objective of the Act is to consolidate a number of older pieces of legislation, it also introduces a number of updates that are designed to accommodate the reality of weapons in the modern world.",1,234,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00234
2021-01-05-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Historically, our ability to successfully control the distribution of weapons was premised on the combination of managing supply and demand. On the supply side, we have been able to tightly control the inflow of goods and people due to our small, island geography and sophisticated policing of porous points along our borders. In terms of demand, we have instituted some of the world's most severe gun control laws – with punishments for unlawful possession, trafficking and use stipulated in the Arms Offences Act of 1973 and 2008, and Arms and Explosives Act of 1913 and 2013. We have supported these sticks with the carrot of an efficient, uncorrupt Police force.",2,235,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00235
2021-01-05-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"This largely airtight control is now being undermined by the advancement of technology. Worldwide, there are currently an excess of 1.4 million 3D printers, and the figure is estimated to rise to more than eight million units by 2027. The ease of obtaining, securing and subsequently deleting electronic blueprints for weapons means that for a digitally-sophisticated population such as ours, the ability to independently print guns, if one chooses to do so, will increasingly be trivial. Moreover, if printed with non-standard materials, such 3D- printed guns will become increasingly undetectable with our usual screening devices.",3,236,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00236
2021-01-05-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"While the printing of ammunition remains rudimentary and generally impotent at the moment, clause 4 of the bill will appropriately ensure that, if the technology to do so does emerge in the future, these will thereafter fall under tight legislation.

2021-01-05-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Same arguments are often made in the context of defenders of the right of individuals to carry weapons in self-defence. Now, the problem with this simple logic of deterrence, and the reason why strict weapons control is generally preferable, is that the deterrent effect is no longer applicable when we relax some of these basic assumptions. In particular, brandishing a gun on an unsuspecting victim confers first-mover advantage to the aggressor, which nullifies the threat of a retaliatory response. A gun in one's backpack is of no use if an erstwhile robber has one pointed at your face.",7,240,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00240
2021-01-05-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"And the simple rationality that undergirds deterrence theory also breaks down when one agent is viewed as particularly susceptible to emotional response. This is, for example, why some observers have argued that dealing with North Korea may require actions beyond simple deterrence.",8,241,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00241
2021-01-05-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Nevertheless, it is our responsibility to at least consider how, compared to the past when tight monitoring and policing was often sufficient, future attempts to control the spread of firearms will be that much more challenging. Thus, even when we widen the scope of controlled goods, as clauses 12 and 13 seek to do, by designating the manufacture and possession of unauthorised digital gun blueprints as illegal, we need to recognise that the act of simply banning such items will be more limited than before. Yet, the majority of the subsequent clauses, such as clauses 17 or 20 or 27, prescribe penalties for violations; relying, as it were, on the stick rather than the carrot. My argument is that we need to be more creative about our use of deterrence.",9,242,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00242
2021-01-05-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),The crux of the matter is this  We should be willing to consider the efficacy of a blunt reliance on strict weapons control as our central tool for containing violent crime and take efforts to address the underlying motivations for crime more seriously.,10,243,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00243
2021-01-05-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Of course, crime is a complex and multi-faceted phenomenon. Criminologists point to factors as varied as the thermal climate, urban density, inhabitant characteristics and psycho-social risk. But two important drivers have emerged recently and stressed the effects of poverty and income inequality. Of course, I am not suggesting that the Government has not made any efforts at addressing these more fundamental drivers.",11,244,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00244
2021-01-05-T-009,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"What we should not forget though is that an important spillover of our policies to diminish inequality and eliminate poverty is that we yield the payoff of reduced crime too. If we believe this to be true, then we should be prepared to resource our agencies accordingly, to examine whether there is room to increase our expenditure for welfare and social services, and if budget considerations preclude otherwise, to re-examine our existing expenditure on publicly-funded domestic security services. On that note of general caution, I assert my support for the Bill.",12,245,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00245

As someone who is exposed to 3D printing at the workplace, I can assure that whatever that you can think of, it is highly likely that the 3D printer can print it out for you.",3,249,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00249
2021-01-05-T-009,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"3D printing is also relatively cheap compared to traditional manufacturing with lathes and milling machines. Printers are readily available under $1,000. For the more serious hobbyist, a sophisticated 3D printer can be purchased under $5,000 for all your DIY needs from online portals such as Lazada and Amazon – and you can even have it delivered to your doorstep within a week. These 3D printers can print many different kinds of materials – from plastics to carbon fibre reinforced thermoplastics, to even different metals for the more complex and sophisticated machines.",4,250,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00250

AM has revolutionised how we design and manufacture components where there is little or even zero waste, unlike traditional subtractive manufacturing.

This is indeed a worrying trend given our objective of becoming a digitally connected nation.",7,253,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00253
2021-01-05-T-009,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"There is also a strong online community of advocates pushing for the digital design of guns to be made available to all for free as an extension of the United States' second amendment on the freedom to bear arms. As an example, Cody Wilson, described as a crypto-anarchist, had designed and successfully tested his first 3D-printed gun, which he named ""The Liberator"". He proceeded to upload it online for others to access for free. When the US authorities got wind of it, they managed to shut the site down but not before the gun design had been downloaded a total of 100,000 times.",8,254,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00254

2021-01-05-T-009,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"What has stood out for me in this Bill is the criminalisation of the unauthorised possession of digital blueprints for the manufacture of guns or major gun parts. This is necessary with the rapid advancement of 3D printing technology, which has been improving by leaps and bounds. It is frightening and sobering to see how the Internet has enabled the world to connect and share all good and bad.

2021-01-05-T-009,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, this Bill seeks to consolidate and update our laws relating to guns, explosives and weapons. The regulation of guns, explosives and weapons is important to the safety and security of Singaporeans, and our regulatory framework should be updated to account for changing technologies and threats. I have four clarifications to raise on this Bill.",1,298,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00298
2021-01-05-T-009,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My first clarification is on the proposed definition of “store” and the four limbs of the definition. The definition first sets out the first and second limbs, followed by the phrase “and includes”, then the third and fourth limbs. Can the Minister clarify if this should be interpreted to mean that the first and second limbs are broad definitions, and the third and fourth limbs are specific examples of the first and second limbs? Can the Minister also clarify if the third and fourth limbs are examples and do not exhaustively set out situations where a gun or major part of a gun is deemed to be stored?",2,299,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00299
2021-01-05-T-009,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I seek this clarification because the third limb refers very specifically to being in possession of any explosive or explosive precursor for more than 24 hours. The fourth limb refers specifically to controlling or managing 12 guns or major parts of a gun. These very specific numbers seem to provide an opening for someone to circumvent the law by possessing an explosive for only 23 hours or controlling only 11 guns.,3,300,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00300
2021-01-05-T-009,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second point is on the definition of ""weapon"". The Bill defines weapon in the First Schedule, which comprises a detailed list, such as arrows, knives and swords. The First Schedule does not provide any exceptions for imitation, replica or ornamental weapons. By contrast, the definition of gun or explosives in the Bill does provide exceptions for imitation guns and explosives. The result appears to be an expansion of the law, with the proposed Act requiring licences for imitation, replica and ornamental weapons, while existing laws do not. For instance, under section 13(6) of the existing Arms and Explosives Act, a licence is not required to possess a sword or dagger kept in a dwelling for ornamental purposes.",4,301,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00301
2021-01-05-T-009,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"While clause 94 of the Bill deems ornamental or theatrical weapons as lawful purpose for possessing an offensive weapon under the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act, it is not clear how imitation, replica or ornamental weapons are treated under the new Guns, Explosives and Weapons Control Act.",5,302,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00302
2021-01-05-T-009,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Can the Minister clarify if the term “weapon” is intended to cover imitation, replica or ornamental weapons? If so, can the Minister share how it intends to address the enforcement issues that may arise because of the over-inclusiveness? Would the Ministry consider, for instance, issuing class licences for activities involving objects that fall within the definition of weapons but would not ordinarily be used to cause harm, such as imitation, replica or ornamental weapons?",6,303,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00303
2021-01-05-T-009,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My third point is about variation orders for class licences. Section 57(1) of the Bill allows the Minister to vary a class licence by order in the Gazette. However, the Gazette is not necessarily accessible to the layperson. To propose to vary a class licence, the Minister is required to publish a notice on a website or in other forms readily accessible to the public. While the proposal to vary a class licence must be published, the order to vary itself is not subject to these requirements. For consistency and transparency, will MHA ensure that the variation order itself be published in forms readily accessible to the public?",7,304,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00304
2021-01-05-T-009,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My fourth and final point is about the enforcement powers of compliance officers. The Bill empowers the Licensing Officer to appoint compliance officers to assist the Licensing Officer in the exercise of its enforcement powers. These compliance officers are private contractors, not public agents. Despite not being public agents, compliance officers may exercise a range of enforcement powers under the Bill.",8,305,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00305

2021-01-05-T-009,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Having had the experience of being a former National Service Police Commander, I can see that this Bill has taken a holistic approach. Not only has it appropriately increased the deterrence for offences with the intent to cause harm, it has also included proactive features in two key areas, namely  one, upstream preventive measures; and, two, the use of class licensing regime. These steps allow for better risk management without increased regulatory burden, of which, I have a request and one clarification for the Minister.",2,309,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00309
2021-01-05-T-009,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Relating to the first point, a few years back, I previously practised at the National Shooting Centre at Choa Chu Kang under the oversight of a coach. At that time, I noticed that the procedures of the range were not as tight as now. It did cross my mind then that a range user could leave the range with arms and live ammunition – in this scenario, the severity would be high, and the probability is low, although not zero.",3,310,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00310
2021-01-05-T-009,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"This Bill will now address this gap and require, for example, the National Shooting Centre, which is now not a licensable activity, to operate more securely under licence, such as tighter control of ammunition storage and issuance, for example, armed security at the range’s control points and better security measures in place to prevent firearms and ammunition leaving the shooting range.",4,311,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00311
2021-01-05-T-009,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"This measure is more reassuring for all range users as well as the public. However, in view of the tightened level of security and licensing requirements, I hope that the Ministry will keep the inconvenience to impacted stakeholders to a reasonable level in terms of, for example, wait time for licence registration and approvals, lead time for range and arms booking, as well as keeping the associated costs manageable.",5,312,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00312
2021-01-05-T-009,Derrick Goh,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"On the second point, the Bill’s calibration is evident by the inclusion of the new class licensing regime. This class of licensing will facilitate the development of Shooting sports which is an area where Singapore has done well, with world-class athletes. Examples include in the international arena, such as the SEA Games, ASEAN Games and at the International Shooting Sports Federation World Cup. I am heartened that the Minister has highlighted that this Bill will mean that student members of a school’s Air Gun Club would now not be required to apply for individual licences, as this has always been a good source for scouting of young talent. In this way, class licensing will facilitate legitimate users and stakeholders. However, as we have noted, the risk of GEW is low but not zero. I hope the Minister can give us the continued assurance that the Class Licensing regime will not apply to the higher risk GEW categories or situations.",6,313,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00313

Those passionate about drones, e-scooters, Nerf, Warhammers, even baking, and so many more, have found 3D printing to add incredible value to their hobbies and passions. Beyond its obvious economic benefits and industrial uses, 3D printing has also been an added catalyst for hobbyists resourceful enough to tap on it.",3,318,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00318

The technology allows hobbyists to forge more powerful blasters that greatly enhance their game. While store-bought blasters typically fire at about 80-100 feet per second, our resourceful hobbyists are known to modify blasters that propel their foam darts up to 150-200 feet per second. Also, modifications to the aesthetics and performance of blasters are shared among the community to encourage innovation and celebrate each other’s achievements.",5,320,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00320

For example, modifications to blasters’ aesthetics that paint them black are frowned upon, as such realism might cause panic to the public. Hobbyists actively and responsibly refrain from such realism so as not to put the wider Nerf community’s interests at risk.

Proposed controls on 3D printing activities reminded me of the controls we placed on colour copiers from 1979 to the late 1990s. Yes, colour copiers. This is too familiar a tune. These same controls on colour copiers were lifted also because of their onerous restrictions, making way for innovation in counterfeit-resistant currency notes in Singapore.

2021-01-05-T-009,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"My third clarification, given that the security direction is non-appealable and that there is no automatic right to be heard under section 64(4). Would it nevertheless be possible for any aggrieved party to seek judicial review of the process or perhaps, allow a party to seek interim relief for preservation of any asset which may fall under the said security direction. Mr Speaker, Sir, in Malay please.",9,343,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00343

2021-01-05-T-009,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Even though our situation in Singapore is very different due to our already very tough laws, we must continue to monitor emerging new threats. Our world, which is plagued by the COVID-19 outbreaks and economic slowdown, will make more people feel pressured and this may lead to disputes or even domestic violence.",11,345,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00345
2021-01-05-T-009,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"For example, in my earlier parliamentary speech, I have shared that police reports relating to domestic violence in Singapore had increased by 22% since last April during the circuit breaker period in Singapore. On average, trends around the world show that social pressure and social isolation will result in more cases of domestic violence.",12,346,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00346
2021-01-05-T-009,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"In domestic violence cases in countries such as the United States, Britain and South Africa, nearly 70% of the deaths involve women and the perpetrators are usually their spouses or ex-spouses. Within these, about one in three murder cases is committed using firearms.",13,347,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00347
2021-01-05-T-009,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Therefore, we need to continue providing protection to those who are more in need and should not allow any dangerous weapons that can be used to create violence in our society.",14,348,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00348
2021-01-05-T-009,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,A research paper published by the RAND Corporation in 2018 stated that 3D printing technology will accelerate the proliferation of dangerous weapons and could result in more crimes and violence. The situation becomes more high-risk because of the unemployment rate and the alienation of workers who face more pressure due to the declining global economy.,15,349,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00349
2021-01-05-T-009,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"Therefore, I agree with the Bill, which will further tighten surveillance and ownership of any details or plans that can be used to produce dangerous weapons through 3D printing technology.",16,350,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00350

2021-01-05-T-009,Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim,"(In English)  With that, Mr Speaker, Sir, suggestions and clarifications notwithstanding, I support this Bill.",18,352,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00352
2021-01-05-T-009,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Vikram Nair.,1,353,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00353
2021-01-05-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Mr Speaker, I speak in support of this Bill. Singapore is well known for its no nonsense approach to weapons possession. The possession of guns and firearms by members of the public is prohibited, and the usage of firearms is heavily restricted and generally limited to the armed forces, police and a few private gun clubs. The possession of other weapons, including items that might be used as weapons such as knives, is also controlled and people are not permitted to be in possession of such items in public without good reason.",1,354,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00354
2021-01-05-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Strict laws like this have played an important part in keeping Singapore safe and we do not have horror stories of shootings and gun violence. While we do have other weapons being used in incidents like gang fights, the strict laws against improper possession have also permitted police to move pre-emptively in such cases, arresting individuals in possession of weapons without good reason even if they have not used it for violence yet. As such, violent fights with weapons are also few and far between.",2,355,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00355
2021-01-05-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Against this backdrop, these latest changes to legislation and harmonisation of several different Bills tighten and expand the laws to cover developing areas of potential threats. One example of such a potential threat is the 3D printing of gun parts. While smuggling guns or gun parts into and around Singapore is not easy and subject to the strictest of penalties, it has now become possible to manufacture gun parts with 3D printers, which are becoming more widely available. The blueprints for such weapons may be found on the Internet, or more commonly, the Dark Net. With such blueprints and a 3D printer, individuals could 3D print usable gun parts.",3,356,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00356
2021-01-05-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The new rules will make it an offence for people to possess the blueprints required to 3D print gun parts. Now, this is a tough measure, but one which I welcome as the more easily something dangerous is readily available, the tougher the rules must be to discourage its possession and use. This sends a clear, no nonsense signal that we are remaining tough on the possession of weapons, even if all that one possesses is a blueprint to 3D print such parts.",4,357,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00357
2021-01-05-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"While the use of guns by military and the Police are heavily controlled, one area where members of the public may access weapons is at private shooting ranges. A few years ago, in 2017, the Police already had imposed measures to better control activities at these premises, including measures to make such premises more secure and to better control the type of weapons being used. This Bill allows the Police to issue licences for ranges, which allows Police more flexibility to regulate how they will operate through the imposition of licence conditions and they would be able to ensure the most stringent conditions for the use of firearms in Singapore and to ensure that such firearms are not easily available outside.",5,358,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00358
2021-01-05-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),The introduction of a class licensing regime for lower risk activities balances the generally tough approach with practicality. There are some people who participate in lower risk activities such as the use of air rifles for sport. The introduction of a class licensing regime to deal with these is a clever method and saves each person the hassle of getting an individual licence.,6,359,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00359
2021-01-05-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Class licences have been used in other areas too, for example, in legislation by MCI in relation to the media, although in this case, given many of the class licensees will be individuals, it will be important for them to know the relevant rules that will apply. I will be interested to know what steps the Government will take to keep the class licensees informed of such rules. While the mechanism being used is that of a licence, in substance, what needs to be done is for the individuals in possession of such weapons to know exactly what is permitted and what is not to stay out of trouble.",7,360,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00360
2021-01-05-T-009,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The other changes largely involve the rationalisation and harmonisation of offences that existed across many different pieces of legislation. There were some inconsistencies in these previously, as different offences were covered by different rules and developed at different times, but the overall changes in this new legislation rationalises the penalties based on degree of culpability, which means that there will be higher penalties for intentional offences and less for unintentional ones, as well as seriousness of the harm, which means higher penalties for more dangerous weapons and where weapons are used to cause harm. These are, of course, very sensible and the general principles on which all criminal legislation is based. I therefore support this Bill.",8,361,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00361

2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"There are many questions that have been asked.

Following which, I shall address issues raised by Members thematically.",2,364,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00364
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),Many Members raised questions about clause 13 which is on the new offence of unauthorised possession of 3D blueprints for the manufacture of guns or major gun parts. The divergence of views among Members shows that there is no straightforward answer to achieving an appropriate regulatory balance on this matter.,3,365,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00365
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"On the one hand, Mr Sharael Taha asked if the offence should be widened beyond guns and major gun parts to also cover gun modifications and attachments and offensive weapons. Mr Melvin Yong also took the view that clause 13 should cover possession of digital blueprints for gun replicas. On the other hand, Ms Yeo Wan Ling was of the view that 3D printed guns are unlikely to work in practice and that clause 13 could have a chilling effect on innovative applications of 3D printing.",4,366,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00366
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"To be clear, under present law, if you produce a gun using a 3D printer without a licence, you are committing at least two offences  unlicensed manufacturing a gun and possession of an illegal gun. The Bill does not change this basic position. What the Bill does is to address the new phenomenon where it is increasingly easy for anyone to seek out and acquire online designs and directions on how to make a gun, and using a technology that is increasingly accessible.",5,367,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00367
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"But we are also careful to ensure the law is not over-reaching.

2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"On the other hand, gun accessories are designed to be fitted to or attached to a gun for various purposes, such as to conceal its fire, like a silencer or flash suppressor, or it cannot work except in connection with an operative and functioning gun. They therefore pose a lower risk.",8,370,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00370
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"As for weapons like swords and knuckledusters, they are less lethal and dangerous than guns, and therefore, we think there is no necessity at this juncture to also control the possession of 3D blueprints for the manufacture of these weapons.",9,371,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00371
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"On replica guns, while we agree that they can potentially be used to cause alarm, they cannot be used to cause physical harm per se and therefore similarly pose lower risks. But if such guns are used while committing certain offences, such as robbery and extortion, an offence would be made out under the Arms Offences Act, along with the Penal Code offences for the main criminal act.",10,372,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00372
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"To address Ms Yeo Wan Ling's point that 3D-printed guns are unlikely to function and her concern on inhibiting innovation, as I mentioned in my Second Reading speech yesterday, the threat posed by the 3D printed guns and gun parts is real. This point was echoed by other Members as well. There have been genuine cases and online videos demonstrating the use of 3D printed guns or gun parts, especially the metallic ones.",11,373,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00373

2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Licensing the possession of such blueprints will enable the authorities to know who are involved in 3D manufacturing of guns, to ensure that proper security and practices are in place for handling dangerous articles that may potentially be produced as a result.",13,375,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00375
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"But I also want to emphasise that items which do not fit the description of a gun under clause 3 of the Bill will not require a licence to possess or 3D print. Clause 3(4)(c) also makes clear that imitation guns are not considered guns for the purpose of the Bill. Therefore, the possession of 3D blueprints for the manufacture of such items will not require a specific licence under clause 13.",14,376,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00376

2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"First, to clarify, the import of a 3D-printed gun, whether metallic or not, still requires a licence.

We note Mr Derrick Goh’s suggestion to manage the inconvenience and costs to stakeholders.",43,405,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00405
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"I must reiterate that, when designing the regulations and processes, safety and security will remain our topmost priority. But within this objective, we are also mindful to minimise regulatory burden as far as possible.",44,406,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00406
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Specifically, prior to granting or renewing a shooting range operation licence, there are certain procedures which are fundamental to ensuring the safe conduct of activities that need to be carried out. These include inspecting the range premises to ensure the robustness of safety and security measures, and security vetting of key persons. These inevitably take some time.",45,407,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00407
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Where possible, Police have streamlined procedures and processes to make things easier on licensees and applicants. For example, Police have digitalised the entire licensing application and renewal process, reducing administrative burden and unnecessary waiting time. However, activities such as range time slot booking are managed by the range operators, and are not within the control of the regulator.",46,408,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00408
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"On the issue of compliance cost, range operators have generally implemented most required measures on their own accord, even today, such as the installation of CCTV systems and setting up access controls into and out of the range premises. We therefore do not expect the introduction of shooting range licences to impose significant additional costs in the immediate term on these operators.",47,409,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00409
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"In addition, to help manage costs for operators, we will introduce a new licensing model, where if an applicant seeks to conduct related activities, he will only need to make one application to the regulator, to obtain the set of different licences for these activities. The cost of this one application will be lower than the total of having to apply individual licences for each regulated activity.",48,410,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00410
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Next, on class licensing, Mr Derrick Goh asked for assurance that class licensing will not apply to higher risk categories or situations. Mr Vikram also asked about the steps that Government will take to keep class licensees informed of requirements under a class licence. Relatedly, Mr Louis Ng also asked if variations to class licences will be published in forms more readily accessible to the public, than the Gazette.",49,411,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00411
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"To Mr Derrick Goh's question, as class licensing is less stringent than individual licensing from a security standpoint, MHA’s intent is to apply class licensing only to lower-risk activities, such as air gun shooting in school settings.",50,412,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00412
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"To Mr Vikram's question, under clause 56, class licensing conditions will be published in the Gazette, which is publicly accessible.

2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"First, on the need to security clear close associates. While close associates may not handle GEW directly, they need to be security cleared because of the security risk associated with the indirect influence they can exert over the operation of the entity and on the regulated activities the entity conducts.",59,421,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00421
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"The threshold of 5% equity interest or voting rights to qualify as a close associate is similar to that for determining a ""substantial shareholder"" under the Companies Act, and is currently used by the Police for the purpose of evaluating the fit and proper criteria. As setting a lower threshold would make it more onerous for businesses, MHA assesses that the 5% threshold is sufficient and balanced, based on the current circumstances. The threshold can be reviewed from time to time, depending on the threat environment. So, shareholders who hold 5% and above will have to be security cleared.",60,422,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00422
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Second, on whether the Licensing Officer (or LO) has discretion to still grant security clearance if a person fails one or more criteria under clause 45(1).",61,423,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00423
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"The answer is yes. The clause does allow the LO to give such weight to the factors, as he considers appropriate, when assessing the security clearance of a person.",62,424,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00424
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Third, on the security clearance for foreigners, such as arms dealers for short-term trade fairs.

Specifically for foreigners, the Police Licensing Officer will request for relevant documents to show proof that they have been duly licensed or authorised by the source countries to handle the GEW.",63,425,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00425
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"To further mitigate the security risks associated with imported guns and explosives, all movement of such high-risk items in Singapore must be escorted and guarded by armed auxiliary police officers, thereby minimising the chances of the items being misused or mishandled.",64,426,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00426
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Mr Zhulkarnian asked about security directions under clause 64.

2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"A possible scenario is where there is an on-going suspected terrorist incident, such that for public safety reasons, licensees and even those who are exempted from holding GEW licences must immediately enhance their security posture or completely shut their premises for a specified period to prevent the terrorists from getting their hands on guns and explosives.",66,428,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00428
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"In such a scenario, issuing a security direction would be critical to mitigate the threat first, given that the matter is of such urgency and magnitude that there is not enough time for regulations to be amended or new regulations to be made, and for the due process under clause 63 or licence conditions to be modified.",67,429,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00429
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Secondly, Mr Zhulkarnain also asked if a security direction would apply to a ""close associate"" of a licensee. The answer is no. A security direction can only apply to a licensee, class licensee or person exempted from the Act.",68,430,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00430
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),They are ultimately responsible for the regulated activity and are best placed to take necessary action to comply with the security direction. It would be ineffective and disproportionate for a security direction to apply also to a close associate.,69,431,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00431
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"To Mr Zhulkarnain's question on whether it is possible to seek judicial review against a security direction, given that a security direction is non-appealable under the Act, the Bill does not contain a privative or ouster clause, and so yes, a person who is aggrieved by exercise of power can seek judicial review.",70,432,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00432
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"On the need for asset preservation, the Member need not be concerned because the security direction is aimed at dealing with a particular situation and is valid only for a period of up to six months.

2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),I will now progress to other issues raised. Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked for the statistics on crimes involving imitation guns.,72,434,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00434
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"There are only a handful of such cases – nine cases were reported in the last 10 years, of which seven resulted in conviction for offences under the Arms Offences Act or the Penal Code.",73,435,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00435
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),Using imitation guns to commit certain scheduled offences such as robbery and extortion continues to be a serious offence under the Arms Offences Act. The offender can be jailed for up to 10 years and be liable for caning of no fewer than three strokes.,74,436,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00436
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),Ms Sylvia Lim also asked the question for the number of gun possession licences issued for self-defence that are still in force.,75,437,2021-01-05-T-009-S-00437
2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"There are currently 19 gun possession licences in force, issued to personal security officers of certain embassies, for security reasons and protection.

2021-01-05-T-009,Desmond Tan,The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Tan),"Mr Melvin Yong asked on the defences and counter measures against drone attacks. SPF will work closely with CAAS to deal with the threat of weapon-mounted drones.

2021-01-05-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"First, on the purpose of the programme. Second, the built-in protection for privacy. And third, the legal provisions governing the use of TraceTogether data.",3,454,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00454
2021-01-05-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"First point  contact tracing is absolutely essential for the control of COVID-19. We need to quickly identify everyone who has been exposed or potentially exposed to a patient who is infected in order to provide the necessary care to this close contact and to reduce the probability of them passing on the virus. In other words, to be able to truncate chains of transmission quickly, effectively and early.",4,455,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00455
2021-01-05-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"We have today in Singapore perhaps the most successful contact tracing programme in the world, with a TraceTogether participation rate of around 78%. This is one of the key reasons for our current good control of the COVID-19 situation in Singapore today.",5,456,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00456
2021-01-05-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Second point  we have always been conscious of the need to protect personal privacy. To this end, we took great effort in the design of the system, the coding of the application. We even open-sourced the code for public scrutiny and to share with overseas jurisdictions.",6,457,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00457
2021-01-05-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),TraceTogether only collects Bluetooth proximity data on a temporary basis. It does not collect – and I want to emphasise – it does not collect GPS location data nor movement data.,7,458,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00458
2021-01-05-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),Let me reiterate this. The TraceTogether app and token were not designed to allow any Government agency to track the user. The app or token only keeps a temporary record of who you have come into close contact with for a prolonged basis. Neither the app nor the token tracks a user's location. The data is then stored in encrypted form locally on your device – either your phone or your token. And that encrypted data is automatically purged after 25 days.,8,459,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00459

2021-01-05-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"We have gone to great lengths to protect the privacy of all TraceTogether users in all normal use cases, but TraceTogether data is not exempt from section 22 of the CPC.

2021-01-05-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"This application of the CPC is not unique to TraceTogether data. Other forms of sensitive data, for example, phone or banking records, which may be protected by specific privacy laws are also, nevertheless, subject to the provision of the CPC. And from time to time, the Police have done so, with proper safeguards and with the good outcomes that Singaporeans have come to expect from our Police investigations.",13,464,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00464
2021-01-05-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"I think Singaporeans can understand why section 20 of the CPC confers such broad powers. There may be serious crimes, like murders or terrorist incidents where the use of TraceTogether data in Police investigations may be necessary in the public interest. The Police must be given the tools to bring criminals to justice and protect the safety and security of all Singaporeans. And especially in very serious cases and where lives are at stake, it is not reasonable for us to say that certain classes of data should be out of reach of the Police. But this power – on the part of the Police to access data – must be exercised judiciously and with utmost restraint.",14,465,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00465

2021-01-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),I thank Minister for acknowledging that the CPC was not really in his contemplation when that statement was made. I think Minister has made that remark in good faith and we will take it as it is.,2,473,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00473
2021-01-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"But Minister made another comment about the Police judiciously using the information that is collected by TraceTogether.

So, I think some clarification of this would be quite important for members of the public because everybody wants TraceTogether to succeed, in view of the public health considerations. But this particular point has done has caused consternation and that also probably explains why the Minister has decided to make this clarification.",4,475,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00475
2021-01-05-T-010,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"I thank the Member. I think Mr Singh will know under section 20 of the CPC, the Police are authorised to seek any information within the possession of a person. There are various provisions. As long as the seeking of such information is not excluded by some other written law. There are some provisions and some written laws which circumscribe the exercise of Police powers. Subject to that, the CPC gives the power to the Police and when such a power is given, the Police are obviously under a duty as well.",1,476,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00476
2021-01-05-T-010,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"To give you an example. Let us say there is a murder and the victim, the victim's family and information is available on the TraceTogether token. If Police chose not to seek that information, you can imagine how the victim's family and indeed the rest of Singapore might react to that situation. You could even argue that there can be a judicial review application in such a situation.",2,477,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00477
2021-01-05-T-010,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"However, given that this TraceTogether token is necessary for dealing with the pandemic and it is of national importance and its purposes are to help us deal with the pandemic, the Police approach has been and will be that it is pretty much restricted to very serious offences. And while that requirement is not in the legislation, it will be carefully considered within the Police and discretion will be exercised in seeking this information.",3,478,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00478

2021-01-05-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Minister Balakrishnan just now said that once the pandemic is passed, the TraceTogether programme will be stood down. My question is, will the data that collected by TraceTogether including data that is beyond 21 days, will that be stored on a server and will that still be accessible by the Police if they invoke the CPC?",2,489,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00489
2021-01-05-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"And secondly, has the Government considered the impact that yesterday's clarification would have on the adoption and the usage of the TraceTogether app as well as the token? Because as I mentioned yesterday, although we might have 78% adoption, there is no real way of finding out whether people actually using the system because you may have it downloaded on your phone, but you can switch off your Bluetooth when you enter the building or you could use what is called a Faraday bag to keep the token. So, there are many different ways which people can prevent themselves from being tracked if they could well be criminals or engaging criminal activities.",3,490,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00490
2021-01-05-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Which is more important then? Is it the fight against this pandemic or the exceptional circumstances where the Police, with all their other powers on hand, are not able to trace where the person is and track the person down?",4,491,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00491
2021-01-05-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,I thank Mr Giam for that very useful set of supplementary questions. His first point was – what happens post-pandemic? We all look forward to that day.,1,492,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00492
2021-01-05-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"First, let me deal with the data in your phones and in your tokens. As I said, all that data, first of all, is encrypted and is auto-purged after 25 days. You do not need to wait for the end of the pandemic before your longer term historical data beyond 25 days is auto-deleted.",2,493,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00493
2021-01-05-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,I will volunteer an extra supplementary question for you – what about the data on patients and close contacts?,3,494,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00494
2021-01-05-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Which with the patient's consent or with the close contact's consent and, in fact, active participation – you will know if you look at the app, you actually have to receive a PIN from MOH and you will have to authorise that upload – that data would reside, when you upload it, in a database that MOH's contact tracers have.",4,495,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00495
2021-01-05-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"I would imagine that so long as the pandemic is alive and posing a clear and present threat, MOH will want to have that data available because it may be the start of a larger transmission chain.",5,496,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00496
2021-01-05-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"But I believe that once the pandemic has passed, that data – certainly, the specific, personalised data – those fields should be eliminated. For research purposes, I believe MOH may want to still have epidemiologic data but it should be anonymised. It should not be personalised, it should not be individualised.",6,497,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00497

2021-01-05-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Your second question is a very important point as well, which is what impact does all this open discussion have on participation and on the way we handle the pandemic itself?",8,499,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00499
2021-01-05-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The Member will recall – in fact, I know he had paid attention to this issue even before coming into Parliament this time.

2021-01-05-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,Your final point was on the pandemic.

2021-01-05-T-010,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"First of all, I understand that the TT token itself does not have the GPS function and that the data will be deleted after 25 days. For the handphone app, I would just like to clarify because the handphone itself has GPS function. Would this also apply to the TT application on the phone? I understand that the data will be deleted or purged after 25 days. I just want to seek clarification and confirmation on this.",2,522,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00522
2021-01-05-T-010,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"The next question that I have is that prior to COVID-19, the Police has a range of ways of collecting data or information that they need for criminal investigation. Therefore, in this case, given it is only exchanges of Bluetooth information, how is the data from this TT useful to Police investigation into crimes? I hope to get a better understanding on this.",3,523,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00523
2021-01-05-T-010,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Lastly, I really appreciate the effort to make such a statement in Parliament, in this Chamber, because this is a matter of public access. Everything will be on public record. Therefore, I would like to ask the Minister for his reaffirmation that the vast majority of the ordinary Singaporeans out there will not be affected by this question that we are now exploring. That the data that is being taken and collected by TT is really only for a very selected purpose and that is only for serious criminal investigation.",4,524,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00524

2021-01-05-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"First, on the technical point. The token has no GPS chip and we have opened it up, we have allowed external parties to dissemble it. I can guarantee you there is no GPS chip. There is no way that the token can keep track of your location.",2,526,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00526
2021-01-05-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,Ms Tin makes the point that most smartphones nowadays do have a GPS chip. But we have been very careful in our coding for the TraceTogether app – that it does not keep a record of GPS locations. The only thing that the TraceTogether app keeps track of is proximity on the basis of Bluetooth data.,3,527,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00527
2021-01-05-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"On your second question – whether this is useful? I mean that is an operational question, which I will leave to the Police – whether proximity data is useful or not and how they would use it. But, again, I will stand by what the Minister for Home Affairs has said – that this is not something to be accessed lightly or trivially, only for serious crimes and to be used very judiciously, and with utmost discretion applied.",4,528,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00528
2021-01-05-T-010,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The final question was to give an assurance that the majority will not be affected. Ms Tin, I will put it to you this way. The vast majority of Singaporeans are not involved in or assisting in criminal investigations. In that sense, they are not affected. But TraceTogether and its success affect the welfare and the public health of all of us. In that sense, confidence in this programme makes a difference to all of us.",5,529,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00529

Firstly, how many instances are there where the Police has tapped the data from the TraceTogether app? Secondly, I would like to thank the Minister for making his statement, because since yesterday, there has been a lot of responses from the public. However, I would also like the Minister to clarify further. One, when did he discover that his statement that he made before, is going to be affected by the CPC? Two, his message today, is it that he wants to apologise that the Government or the Minister had made an oversight? Or is his message telling us that in Singapore, we should just take it that the CPC will be able to access all the information that they have on us in Singapore?",1,531,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00531

Subsequently, we have been having discussions, especially over the last few weeks as to whether, and I alluded to it earlier, we should in fact change the law or whether we continue as we are now. In any case, we decided it is better to be upfront and that is why we were very glad that Mr de Souza asked the question and Minister of State Mr Desmond Tan answered it yesterday.",2,533,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00533

And that means over the years, from time to time, when I have misspoken, I have said so. I have never shied away from saying so because, as I said, it is far more important to maintain trust. And that I might be right or I might be wrong or I might have mistaken some thing or overlook something but, rest assured, when I discover it, I will say so. And to the best extent possible we will find a solution together. That is my approach and I do not see any need to change from that. And I hope you understand.",3,534,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00534

But my intervention was mainly for the purpose of ensuring that there is a maximum adoption of the TraceTogether system because I have been a strong advocate of it on the ground with my residents in the face of quite a bit of scepticism actually, about the system.

So, it is possible to have a PDPA that has carve-outs that allow the Police do certain things and access certain data. It is not incongruous to what I said earlier on.",4,542,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00542

One point that I would like to make is that I would actually support the use of TraceTogether for Police investigations. Because not only is it necessarily helpful in finding out who may have been in the vicinity of a crime, for example, but it can also help exonerate people who are wrongly accused.",1,544,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00544
2021-01-05-T-010,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"So, for example, if you accused and TraceTogether will tell you who was around you, it may help you establish an alibi. So, I would suggest that people who are accused or assisting in investigations, should be able to request that the Police do check their TraceTogether to see if they may have alibis at the time of the offence.",2,545,2021-01-05-T-010-S-00545

Harmonised regional and global transport environments encourage global trade and tourism to flourish. The various elements of transport are akin to cogs in the wheel of a massive machinery. If one part gets stuck, the rest of the machinery will not be able to move smoothly. It may even come to a standstill.",1,569,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00569
2021-01-05-T-011,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),We saw how this came into play during the pandemic. Border restrictions and closures worldwide caused supply chain disruptions in almost every country. Our excellent relationships and various bilateral agreements established with our foreign counterparts over the years enabled us to facilitate border movements for the transport of essential goods and services.,2,570,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00570
2021-01-05-T-011,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Today, countries looking to diversify their supply chains have set their sights on ASEAN, so we will certainly see a greater movement of goods and services within the region. Moreover, in the past decade, the ASEAN region has exhibited strong economic growth, which is driven by rapid urbanisation. A burgeoning middle-class population translates into increased spending power, providing viable markets of consumers in the region for our local companies to appeal to.",3,571,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00571

But Singapore is a small market and we should strike while the iron is hot, do more to help our local logistics companies to spread their wings and encourage them to look beyond the shores. I note that the implementation of a registry of multimodal transport operators recognised under AFAMT could be one of the ways to give our logistics sector a boost.",5,573,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00573
2021-01-05-T-011,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"May I ask the Senior Minister of State, what is the process for logistics companies to join? I understand that some minimum conditions set by the AFAMT must be met, but overall, I hope the domestic qualifying criteria is not too onerous, or that the Government would help companies with it. The AFAMT framework has been described as useful for new logistics entrants to gain a foothold in new ASEAN markets. I believe that this would mean the threshold for eligibility is not out of reach for the less established logistics companies. On the other hand, we want our companies to be recognised for their abilities and reliability. I urge the Ministry to extend assistance to raise standards across the companies that opt to join the registry.",6,574,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00574
2021-01-05-T-011,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Speaker, it is also important that we address how the movement of hazardous materials is to be addressed under this AFAMT framework. At the same time, we must also ensure that there is a robust system in place to prevent the movement of illicit goods, such as drugs, weapons, wildlife and so on.",7,575,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00575
2021-01-05-T-011,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Will there be outreach efforts to encourage companies to join the registry for example?

Will they enjoy some form of protection and insurance for their services and goods?",8,576,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00576
2021-01-05-T-011,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Among the many challenges associated with overseas operations, one of the major concerns is making sense of the foreign policies and laws. If their cargo or carriers go missing or get seized, would they receive assistance to retrieve it? With extreme weather causing more catastrophic events and natural disasters, do they get some form of insurance or support as part of the registry to curb their losses? This could take the form of strategic planning and risk management to help them navigate the safest routes based on the season and current trends. The current COVID-19 pandemic has emphasised the importance of transport network to ensure that essential items from food to medicine can be moved expeditiously, with minimum hinderance.",9,577,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00577
2021-01-05-T-011,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I believe that being part of this registry can only be a boon. Administrative work, red tape and long waiting times are costly aspects of business overheads. The Multimodal Transport Document is recognised by all ASEAN member states. It streamlines the process such that companies seeking to transport goods across ASEAN would not have to navigate different regulations. This would translate into lower overheads and better margins for companies. Reduced logistics means and presents a win-win situation for all.",10,578,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00578

2021-01-05-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My first area of clarification is on the registration regime set out for the Singapore Competent National Body. The process of appealing decisions made by the Competent National Body would benefit from clarity in two respects.,6,591,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00591
2021-01-05-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"First, will a holder of a registration certificate be able to appeal the Competent National Body's decision to add to, vary or revoke any of the conditions of a registration certificate?",7,592,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00592
2021-01-05-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Second, rather than the Competent National Body state in writing the reasons for refusal to issue or renew a registration certificate only if requested by the applicant, can the Ministry consider making known the reasons for refusal upfront? Providing reasons for refusal to issue or renew a registration certificate upfront would avoid unnecessary back-and-forth and save everyone some time and effort.",8,593,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00593
2021-01-05-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My second area of clarification is on environmental sustainability. One goal of the AFAMT is to enhance the sustainability of multimodal transport operations. Can the Ministry share how Singapore's AFAMT National Work Plan aims to achieve this goal? The reason I am asking is that a region-wide strategic alignment on transport and logistics is a great opportunity to coordinate ASEAN and Singapore's plans for sustainability.,9,594,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00594
2021-01-05-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In 2019, the European Commission released a report, titled ""Transport in the European Union  Current Trends and Issues"".

One recommendation is to impose environmentally differentiated port charges to stimulate investment in green vessels.",10,595,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00595
2021-01-05-T-011,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Will the Ministry work with regional partners to study such initiatives? This can foster the longer term development of sustainable transport infrastructure in ASEAN and advance Singapore's status as a global logistics hub.

I am sure that logistics companies in Singapore will welcome the convenience this new framework provides. Upon joining the registry of operators recognised by the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Multimodal Transport (AFAMT), they will no longer have to submit different documents for each jurisdiction. Our SMEs which sell to other countries will also benefit from it. The reduced red tape will lower administrative costs and processing time, facilitate businesses within ASEAN and foster new partnership explorations.",2,599,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00599
2021-01-05-T-011,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"(In English)  Would the Minister elaborate on the criteria to be admitted into the registry? In addition, how does a customer know the amount of liability insurance that a multimodal transport provider has purchased? The amount of contracts that it can undertake should be predicated on the amount of liability insurance it has subscribed to.",3,600,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00600
2021-01-05-T-011,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"I also have a concern regarding the language of the transport documentation. In the past, our companies had to coordinate the various modes of transportation, including ship and railway. Railway receipts and delivery notes issued by overseas service providers are not stated in English and thus cannot be submitted to financiers in Singapore as proof of delivery unless these documents are translated and signed off by notary public. The multimodal transport document should follow International Chamber of Commerce Banking rules and be accepted by banks in the event the consignor or consignee requires financing. This important piece of document proves that shipment has been made. ASEAN is an important gateway to other parts of Asia. Thus, I hope that we will have a common language for all related supporting transport documents.",4,601,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00601
2021-01-05-T-011,Don Wee,Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang),"I am also hopeful that this new framework will create more advanced jobs in the logistics sector. A multimodal transport operator's most important asset is its staff who must be well-versed in international transport procedures and regulations. In Singapore, the vocational training courses offered by the Singapore Logistics Association are excellent. But each MTO should take the responsibility to continuously train their staff by providing in-house or on-the-job training.",5,602,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00602

This can help potential customers make informed decisions before engaging logistics companies for their multimodal transport services.,8,612,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00612
2021-01-05-T-011,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Sir, Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked about the movement of hazardous materials. The ASEAN Framework Agreement on Multimodal Transport does not introduce additional requirements on the type of goods or materials that can be transported. However, the Bill requires the consignor to accurately inform the multimodal transport operator, or MTO for short, of the nature of the goods. In particular, the consignor will need to spell out if any of its goods are of dangerous character, and could endanger life or property. If it fails to do so, the consignor will be liable to the MTO, if the MTO incurs any loss during the shipment that is due to the dangerous nature of the goods.",9,613,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00613
2021-01-05-T-011,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"As for Mr Saktiandi’s question about protection and insurance for logistics companies, the Bill provides for a common and consistent liability regime for MTOs across ASEAN. To protect logistics companies, the Bill also sets out exclusion conditions to exempt MTOs from liability in the event of loss or damage to goods due to unforeseen conditions.",10,614,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00614
2021-01-05-T-011,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Mr Don Wee suggested that the contents of the Multimodal Transport Document be specified in English, to lower transaction costs for businesses. The ASEAN Framework Agreement on Multimodal Transport does not explicitly state the language requirements of the Multimodal Transport Document. However, as English is the official working language of ASEAN, we will work with fellow ASEAN member states towards formalising this arrangement for the implementation. There have been precedents in other ASEAN initiatives where documents are required to be in English or to be accompanied by a certified English translation.",11,615,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00615
2021-01-05-T-011,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Lastly, Mr Louis Ng asked about environmental sustainability for transport. This is an important topic. The ASEAN Framework Agreement on Multimodal Transport is focused on the legal, regulatory and procedural aspects of facilitating the multimodal transport of goods across ASEAN member states. So, it does not deal with environmental sustainability issues per se.",12,616,2021-01-05-T-011-S-00616
2021-01-05-T-011,Chee Hong Tat,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"Having said that, ASEAN recognises the importance of environmental sustainability including in the area of transport, and there are other ASEAN initiatives and platforms that promote this goal. And Singapore, we are involved in these initiatives. These include the ASEAN Regional Strategy on Sustainable Land Transport, which was adopted by ASEAN Transport Ministers in 2018.

Archaic words like ""hereinafter"", ""hereby"", and so on, which lawyers sometimes use all too often, are no longer used, as far as possible. The use of ""shall"" is also reduced.

2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"For existing legislation, the Revised Edition of the Laws Act provides for them to be revised to be more user-friendly. Law revision is carried out by the Law Revision Commissioners, with the support of AGC’s Legislation Division. In preparing a revised edition, the Commissioners can modernise and simplify the language of an Act or subsidiary legislation, provided that they do not change the meaning. So, for example, lengthy phrases and big words are replaced by simpler ones in the manner which I have outlined earlier. As far as possible, ""shall"" is replaced with ""must"" to signify legal obligation. The Commissioners also consolidate an Act with all subsequent amendments, so that the amended Act can be read as one unified document. This is particularly important for hard-copy laws. The Commissioners can also supply additional material that are useful to legislation users, such as information about the commencement date of each legislative provision.",10,634,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00634

The Acts in the new revised edition will, therefore, not have any Chapter numbers.",14,638,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00638
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),Clause 5(a) provides for all Acts in force as of 31 December 2020 to be included in the new revised edition.

First, the short titles of Acts will include their year of enactment. For example, the Penal Code will be cited as “Penal Code 1871”. With the year of enactment, users will immediately have a rough idea of the history and how long ago such an Act was enacted. Second, each Act will also be supplemented with a complete and verified legislative history, tracing an Act’s history from its first enactment and through each subsequent amendment.

2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Madam, I turn now to Part 4 of the Bill. The universal revision exercise, as I have mentioned earlier started some years ago, has also led to the identification of various Acts and provisions that are obsolete. Part 4 of the Bill seeks to repeal these obsolete laws. Let me go through the provisions and cite just some of the obsolete laws by way of example.",19,643,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00643
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Clause 15 repeals spent or obsolete transitional provisions. These provisions were only intended to operate for a transitional period and are no longer necessary today. To give an example, Clause 15(1) repeals section 69(2) of the Accountants Act. That provision allows the Minister to amend any written law which is inconsistent with the Accountants Act. The intention of section 69(2) was to bridge any gap between existing laws and the newly enacted Accountants Act then, at that point in time. Any transitional amendments made by the Minister under section 69(2) would have been made closer to 2004 when the Accountants Act was enacted. Any further amendments to the Act are to be made in the ordinary way, through an Amendment Act passed in Parliament. Indeed, this has been done several times since that Act was passed in 2004. Hence, section 69(2) of the Accountants Act is no longer relevant today and can be repealed.",20,644,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00644
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Clause 16 of the Bill repeals consequential provisions that were superseded by events and never commenced. For example, Clause 16(1) repeals section 65 of the CareShield Life and Long-Term Care Act. Section 65 of that Act makes consequential amendments to the Bankruptcy Act. However, that provision had not been commenced by the time the Bankruptcy Act was repealed by the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act which came into force in July 2020. With the repeal of the Bankruptcy Act, section 65 of the CareShield Life and Long-Term Care Act has, therefore, been superseded and should be repealed.",21,645,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00645
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"I now come to Clauses 17 to 26 of the Bill, which I am sure Members would have gone through. It seeks to repeal obsolete Acts or obsolete parts of some Acts. Some of these Acts were enacted many decades ago and are archaic and no longer applicable today. For Members' benefit, for example, Clause 26 repeals the Personal Injuries (Emergency Provisions) Act. This Act was enacted in 1941 to establish a compensation scheme for war injuries sustained by workers or civil defence volunteers during World War II. I think, by my description alone, one can appreciate why we seek to repeal that obsolete Act. It has been 75 years since World War II ended.",22,646,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00646

2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"It is common for Acts of Parliament to confer functions on Ministers, who are ultimately responsible to Parliament for the exercise of executive authority. The Prime Minister then assigns the responsibility for each Act to a Minister. Ministers, in turn, can delegate their functions under the current section 36 of the Interpretation Act with the President’s approval.",25,649,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00649
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"However, the existing framework only allows for the delegation of functions “in the absence of any provision of law to the contrary”. This restriction, therefore, depends on the context in which the specific enactment is made in the Act. Even if there is no express restriction in the Act against delegation, an implied parliamentary intention or a common law rule could prevent a delegation when it was not intended. The uncertainty as to whether a function may or may not be delegated is at odds with a rule that is meant to make public administration more efficient. If a function is non-delegable, the Minister cannot delegate it at all, not even to a Second Minister in the same Ministry. This is increasingly problematic and unnecessarily limiting. To make this clear, Part 2 of the Bill repeals and re-enacts section 36 of the Interpretation Act to create a two-tier delegation framework.",26,650,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00650
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"The first tier provides for delegations by the responsible Minister to a political officeholder in his or her Ministry. This could be a Second Minister, a Minister of State or a Parliamentary Secretary. These delegations require the Prime Minister’s approval because, constitutionally, the Prime Minister has the prerogative of assigning responsibilities to political officeholders. At the same time, because political officeholders are directly accountable to Parliament, the scope for delegation is also wider. Basically, almost all statutory functions can be delegated under this first tier. This would include statutory appeals that must currently be heard and decided by the Minister himself. There are only three classes of exceptions. First, function cannot be delegated if any Act expressly prohibits delegation. In practice, though, this will be rare. Second, the power to make subsidiary legislation, which is already delegated from the Legislature, cannot be further delegated. Third, the power to delegate under this section cannot itself be delegated.",27,651,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00651
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"As for the second tier, the responsible Minister may delegate functions to public officers and public bodies. This is not too different from the position that we have today. Delegation under the second tier of the framework is subject to any contrary legislative intention, which can be expressed or implied from the statutory context. Whether there is a contrary intention is really a matter of statutory interpretation. Relevant factors will include the nature and gravity of the function, as well as considerations of administrative necessity. The three restrictions that I have mentioned earlier – the three classes – also apply to the second tier. One point to note though is that the scope for delegation under the second tier is not as broad as the first tier. This is appropriate because the range of possible delegates under this second tier is wider.",28,652,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00652
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Once a function is delegated under the new framework, the delegate will have the power to exercise the function in his or her own name. With this two-tier delegation framework, statutory functions can be more effectively performed and, where appropriate, by delegates as well. This will help to ensure that public administration is carried out smoothly and efficiently to meet the challenges of the day and that services are delivered to the public in a timely fashion.",29,653,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00653
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"I should highlight that the responsible Minister remains accountable to Parliament for how a function is performed by his or her delegate. A delegation also does not prevent the responsible Minister from exercising the function. In practice, the responsible Minister will continue to personally consider the most serious cases and exercise oversight over his or her delegates.",30,654,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00654
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Madam, finally, I turn to Part 3 of the Bill. Members will recall that the Constitution was amended in May last year to enable Parliament to sit under continuity arrangements in times of exigency. In such times, Article 64A enables Parliament to meet, with Members of Parliament spread out over two or more places appointed by the President. Part 3 makes two amendments to the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act in consequence of the constitutional amendments.",31,655,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00655

2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Clause 14(b) of the Bill makes it an offence for a person to interfere with the communication links between the places where Parliament is sitting, should there be more than one place. This is important as continuity arrangements are dependent on contemporaneous communication links, which allow Members to participate contemporaneously at a sitting from different locations. Any interference with such communication links can be disruptive to Parliamentary business.",33,657,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00657

2021-01-05-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"First, the Bill proposes to allow the delegation of a Minister's function to a public body or public officer unless express or implied contrary intention appears in the Act. It would be very useful to the Court to have clear guidance on how contrary intention should be inferred.

2021-01-05-T-012,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Second, the Bill allows delegation of function to a public body or a public officer. Helpfully, the Bill clarifies that if a ministerial function depends on the Minister’s opinion, belief or state of mind, the delegate may exercise the function based on the delegate’s opinion, belief or state of mind. While this can be done where a ministerial function is delegated to a public officer, it is less clear how opinion, belief or state of mind of a public body should be determined.",4,663,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00663

2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Madam, I thank Mr Louis Ng for speaking and expressing support for the Bill.",1,668,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00668
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,I just want to go into one clarification before I answer Mr Louis Ng's three questions.,2,669,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00669
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Louis Ng cited Asia Development and raised some good points regarding the delegation of the Ministerial functions under the new section 36 of the Interpretation Act.,3,670,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00670
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I just want to point out for this House that Asia Development deals with the devolution of Ministerial functions under the Carltona principle. The principle is explained in the Explanatory Notes of this Bill. It is a common law principle established by the English Court of Appeal case. In that case, the Court of Appeal recognised that a Minister's duties and powers are normally exercised by responsible officers who act under the authority of the Minister. It is also recognised that the decision of the officer is the decision of the Minister in this instance. The new section 36(8) of the Interpretation Act makes clear that the principle of the Carltona devolution, which has been applied by the Singapore Court of Appeal in Asia Development, remains unaffected.",4,671,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00671
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On the other hand, what is being introduced in this Bill is a delegation of Ministerial functions. Conceptually, delegation is quite different from a devolution. Where a power has been delegated under the Interpretation Act, which is what this Bill seeks to do, the delegate exercises the power in his or her own name, as I have explained in my speech earlier. In contrast, where a power is devolved under the Carltona principle, then the authorised officer exercises the power in the name of the Minister. I just want to clarify that before I address Mr Louis Ng's three questions.",5,672,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00672
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Both delegation and devolution though are important tools to allow the Government to respond quickly and effectively to the needs of Singaporeans.There are also clear lines of accountability to Parliament, and to the public.",6,673,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00673
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Louis Ng asked how one might discern, the contrary intention as appears in the Act. I think the question is, what are the factors we look at to discern this contrary intention.",7,674,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00674
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Louis Ng would know that that is actually a matter of statutory construction and is not uncommon for pieces of legislation to contain this phrase ""unless the contrary intention appears"". In fact, this phrase appears more than 70 times on our statute books, and can be found in Acts such as the Partnership Act, Medical Registration Act, Copyright Act and Companies Act. In the Interpretation Act alone, the phrase appears more than 20 times. So, this is a concept that the Courts will be familiar with, legislative users are familiar with, and how to interpret them.",8,675,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00675
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On the more specific question as to how this contrary intention against delegation can be inferred, there are well-established principles that can be applied. The express language of the legislation should first be looked at. That is the best indication of what the intention of the draftsmen is in that piece of legislation. The intention can also be implied by statutory context, by looking at the overall architecture and context, the construction of the provisions and the location in which this particular provision sits in the context of the broader provisions in the Act.",9,676,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00676
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Louis Ng also asked what other relevant factors could be taken into account. These include the nature and gravity of a function, and I think Mr Louis Ng himself mentioned, the nature, purpose and scope – they are not different – as well as considerations of administrative necessity. The exercise is similar to deciding whether the common law doctrine of Carltona devolution, which I mentioned earlier, applies.",10,677,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00677
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, to illustrate, at one end of the spectrum, where a power affects life and liberty, or is quasi-judicial in nature, such as the hearing of an appeal, then unless the express language makes it clear, then it is likely that there is an intention against delegation. On the other end of the spectrum, where the function is administrative in nature and likely to involve a substantial volume, such as transmitting a document from one authority to another, then it is very unlikely that there would be an intention against delegation.",11,678,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00678
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Louis Ng also asked whether statutes can expressly address the question of delegation. The short answer is yes. I think to the extent possible, this would be made clear in provisions and that is part of the exercise that the AGC is undertaking.",12,679,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00679
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Specific provisions in an Act of Parliament may allow the delegation of functions, for instance, by providing that a Minister may authorise another person to exercise certain functions that are conferred on the Minister by that Act. The new delegation framework in this Bill does not affect those statutory provisions.",13,680,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00680
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Mr Louis Ng's second question is how a public body's opinion, belief, or state of mind should be determined.",14,681,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00681
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Madam, in general, a public body has, of course, its own independent legal status. But at the same time, it is also made up of natural persons. And the natural persons will usually comprise a Chairperson or some other members within the body. It is also not uncommon for the Chief Executive to sit as a member of the public body. The opinion of the public body would therefore be the opinion of the constituent persons, and this opinion would be formed in the same manner as how a public body ordinarily makes a decision. For example, if a Statutory Board can make a decision by a simple majority of its members, then this simple majority can likewise form an opinion for the purposes of making that particular decision. The exact process would, of course, depend on the legislation that constitutes the public body and any rules that they apply to the process under which the public body undertakes that decision-making. The broader point here though is that there are established legal doctrines which can be used to determine the state of mind of a public body, and this Bill does not seek to introduce anything which is fundamentally new or controverts existing principles in this regard.",15,682,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00682
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Louis Ng's third question relates to good practices recommended by the Court of Appeal in Asia Development.,16,683,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00683
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Madam, shortly after the decision in Asia Development was released, administrative guidance was issued by the AGC to public agencies. The administrative guidance effectively adopts the good practices that were recommended by the Court of Appeal in Asia Development.",17,684,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00684
2021-01-05-T-012,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Madam, this brings me to the end of the three responses that I had for Mr Louis Ng. I think I have touched on all the questions that he has raised. With that, Madam, I beg to move.",18,685,2021-01-05-T-012-S-00685

We will still move and take the Treasury Bills motion separately to ensure that the procedural requirements are dealt with. However, this proposal to have the substantive debate for both Motions taking place now, will allow the substantive arguments to be captured cogently in a single debate.",1,693,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00693
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Let me explain why there is a need to increase both borrowing limits.,2,694,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00694
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, the Government Securities Act (GSA) authorises the issuance of Government Securities in Singapore. These securities are issued not for Government spending. They are to fulfil other purposes. Specifically, the Singapore Government Securities (SGS) are issued to develop the domestic debt market and provide financial institutions with high quality liquid assets to meet regulatory requirements; the Special Singapore Government Securities (SSGS) are non-tradable bonds issued primarily to meet the investment needs of the Central Provident Fund (CPF); and the Singapore Savings Bonds (SSB) are issued to provide individual investors with a long-term savings option.",3,695,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00695
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Separately, the Local Treasury Bills Act (LTBA) authorises the issuance of Treasury Bills, to develop the domestic short-term debt market and to meet market demand for short-term rated Singapore Government debt securities.",4,696,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00696
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, let me emphasise again that these borrowings under both the GSA and the LTBA are invested, and do not increase the amount available for Government spending. So, the increases in the respective borrowing limits do not improve the Government's fiscal position.",5,697,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00697
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Both the GSA and the LTBA provide for limits on the amounts that can be borrowed through the issuance of Government Securities and Treasury Bills respectively. These limits are authorised by Parliament.,6,698,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00698
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For the GSA, the last increase for the issuance limit took place in 2016, when Parliament approved the increase of the Government's issuance limit from S$490 billion to S$690 billion. Currently, the outstanding amount of securities issued under the GSA is S$642 billion.",7,699,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00699
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For the LTBA, the last increase for the issuance limit took place in 2007, when Parliament approved the increase of the Government's issuance limit from S$30 billion to $60 billion. Currently, the outstanding amount of securities issued under the LTBA is S$60 billion.",8,700,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00700
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, the Government has fully utilised the prevailing LTBA limit, and we expect to utilise the prevailing GSA limit before mid this year. There is therefore a need to raise these limits, to cater to the growth in demand for Government Securities and Treasury Bills expected over the next five years.",9,701,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00701
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Under the GSA, we project that the outstanding amount of securities will reach S$960 billion by the end of 2025. About 74% of this increase is expected to be issued to the CPF as SSGS. In other words, we issue this to CPF as Special Singapore Government Securities (SSGS) to meet its investment needs. The coupon rates which the SSGS earn for the CPF Board match the interest rates that CPF members receive. We expect CPF balances to increase due to growth in the resident labour force and wages. For example, the resident labour force grew by an average of 1% per year from 2015 to 2020. Over the same period, nominal median gross monthly income from work of full-time employed residents grew by 2.8% per year. Upcoming CPF policy enhancements, like the higher CPF contribution rates for older workers will also increase CPF's investment needs in the coming years. So, that is for the 74%",10,702,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00702
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The remaining 26% of the increase under the GSA will be for the issuance of SGS. This is to support the continued development of a vibrant SGS market, that serves as an anchor for the growth of corporate debt market, and to meet the increased demand for high quality liquid assets from financial institutions in tandem with the growth of our financial markets.",11,703,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00703
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Like SGS, we have seen an increase in demand for Treasury Bills from investors. These are shorter in tenure. Issuing more Treasury Bills will help meet market demand for high quality short-term Singapore dollar denominated papers.",12,704,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00704
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We will continue to monitor the market demand for both Government Securities and Treasury Bills and will increase the rate of issuance to meet this demand, if necessary.",13,705,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00705
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Government will also put in place a new short-term cash management tool, where Treasury Bills can be issued on an ad-hoc basis to meet temporary cashflow mismatches. The Government strives to maintain a healthy level of Government Deposits with MAS and has a variety of cashflow sources like tax revenue and land sales to meet our liquidity needs for day-to-day operations. The introduction of this new tool is part of the Government's on-going efforts to expand our cash management toolkit and will provide more operational flexibility to raise cash quickly, should any short-term cashflow mismatches occur in future.",14,706,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00706
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Issuing ad-hoc short-term bills for cash management is not a new concept, as countries from around the world like Sweden have similar cash management bills programme to meet their governments' temporary cashflow mismatches.",15,707,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00707
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Such temporary cashflow mismatches may occur from time to time as we seek to optimise the Government's treasury and liquidity management and minimise the excess cash holdings in the Government's balance sheet. Cashflow mismatches can occur when there are unanticipated delays in cash inflow, which may coincide with an earlier-than-expected cash outflow. When this occurs, we would address this by tapping on our liquidity buffers. It is, therefore, important for the Government to have diversified sources of liquidity for better risk management, and the ability to issue ad-hoc Treasury Bills when needed would provide the Government with greater operational flexibility to manage our liquidity needs.",16,708,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00708
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"To distinguish this from the regular Treasury Bills, the ad-hoc Treasury Bills will be called ""Cash Management Treasury Bills"", or CMTB in short. The tenure of CMTB will be tailored to meet the period of need and will be less than six months as it will be issued solely for short-term cashflow management.",17,709,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00709
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I should emphasise that issuing CMTB will only expand our cash management toolkit. Again, it does not increase our fiscal budget available for spending.",18,710,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00710
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The maximum size of the CMTB is envisaged to be no larger than S$10 billion, which has been accounted for under the proposed increase in the LTBA borrowing limit.",19,711,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00711
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,The increases in the borrowing limits are for specific market development and operational needs purposes and not to cover the Government's fiscal shortfall. Any increase in the Government borrowings under the GSA and LTBA will correspondingly increase the Government's cash and liabilities but will not increase the Government's fiscal budget for spending.,20,712,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00712

2021-01-05-T-013,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Madam, unlike many countries around the world, Government Securities issued by the Singapore Government cannot be used to fund Budget spending. Under the Government Securities Act, these borrowings can only be used for investments and the proceeds are safeguarded in the Government Securities Fund.",2,717,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00717
2021-01-05-T-013,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"This is to ensure that the government of the day operate on a balanced budget basis, funding its expenditures with revenues received during the term of Government, which would also include the Net Investment Returns. This instills discipline and fiscal prudence. If the current Government runs into an end-of-term deficit, it has to either cut spending, increase revenue by raising taxes or seek consent from the President to draw on past reserves.",3,718,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00718

2021-01-05-T-013,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"As I can hear from the Second Minister for Finance, the primary purpose is to help develop the domestic debt capital markets where, among the necessary ingredients, is to have a domestic risk-free Singapore dollar bond yield curve so that the other institutional and corporate debt issuers can benchmark upon to price their cost of borrowings.",5,720,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00720
2021-01-05-T-013,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),Having a tradable and liquid bond market – both SGS and Treasury Bills – is also key to strengthening Singapore's position as a premier financial centre as it draws in institutional investors and other eco-system players into the Singapore markets.,6,721,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00721
2021-01-05-T-013,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),It also enables banks and institutional players to use the Government Securities as collaterals to manage their balance sheets as well as facilitate the development and growth of repurchase agreements and derivative products.,7,722,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00722
2021-01-05-T-013,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Notwithstanding, it is also important to periodically review and restate our policy position on the purpose and the use of Government Securities – whether it still remains relevant in the evolving landscape. So, I have a few questions for the Minister.",8,723,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00723
2021-01-05-T-013,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Firstly, can I ask the Minister as to how the Government decides when to issue the securities, what amount and which tenure? We know that this issuance and the funds raised are unrelated to the country's fiscal position. So, what are the basis and the considerations for lifting the debt issuance ceilings? Why are debt issuances by Government Statutory Boards not covered under the overall borrowing limits in this Act?",9,724,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00724
2021-01-05-T-013,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Secondly, as the proceeds from these issuances would need to be invested, how would the Government balance between investment risks versus taking advantage of the low interest cost due our AAA sovereign rating to issue more debt? Also, given the flushed liquidity situation and increasingly more investible dollars chasing for limited quality investments, would our investment agencies like GIC and Temasek be able to find investment opportunities with acceptable risk-return trade-offs?",10,725,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00725
2021-01-05-T-013,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Thirdly, given our challenging fiscal position in the years ahead and that the Government is contemplating using borrowings to fund very large and long-term infrastructure projects, would the Government be considering using a certain portion of the SGS to finance such projects? I think it is important to ascertain that again.",11,726,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00726
2021-01-05-T-013,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Would the Government also consider newer variations of issuances, such infrastructure bonds, green bonds or social bonds, for special purpose funding?",12,727,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00727
2021-01-05-T-013,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),My final question relates to the negative interest rates that we have seen around the world. Many developed economies and their government securities are currently experiencing interest rates in negative territory. I would like to ask the Minister what would be the implications for Singapore if our Government Securities also yield negative interest rates and what would be the impact on savings in Singapore?,13,728,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00728

I recognise that these two Motions constitute a fairly narrow exercise of the Government Securities Act and the Treasury Bills Act for the purposes of raising the debt ceiling. I am also aware that this is a fairly routine procedure, which is for the purposes of funding CPF as well as for raising liquidity needs in response to the growth of Singapore's capital markets. I just wish to add two thoughts  one is to request some clarifications over the underlying assumptions behind the amount requested and, second, I would like to query whether this is a good time to actually be borrowing more.",1,730,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00730
2021-01-05-T-013,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"For starters, I would like to ask for some clarification over the underlying assumptions that support the specific figure of $270 billion. In particular, what were the projections for GDP growth numbers that were used to derive this increase in the debt ceiling? Did this take into account the changed economic conditions relative to what has recently transpired? I am requesting this clarification because I believe that there is actually substantial uncertainty over the way that the economy will subsequently evolve over the next few years.",2,731,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00731
2021-01-05-T-013,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"If the economy does eventually bounce back strongly – much like how it did following the SARS epidemic or even the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis – then, a ceiling premised on a more pessimistic growth trajectory may turn out to be excessively generous. In contrast, if the recession proves to be more drawn out – akin to the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis – then, this amount of borrowing may turn out to be insufficient to even meet routine needs, necessitating yet another round of requests to raise the ceiling.",3,732,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00732
2021-01-05-T-013,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"But if you would indulge me and allow me to take a further step and pose the question very much in the spirit of the Bill – is this a good time to borrow, and why? I have previously shared with this House that governments operate on very different budget constraints and time horizons from that of a typical household. Accordingly, it is misleading to think of government indebtedness in the same manner as liabilities accrued either by a private firm or a household.",4,733,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00733
2021-01-05-T-013,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"In particular, because governments operate essentially on an infinite time horizon and they possess the unique ability to finance their expenditures with money creation, the usual concerns faced by private actors over short-term illiquidity do not generally apply. It is, therefore, not only sound economics but, in fact, a fiduciary responsibility for our Government to consider whether debt finance fiscal policy might actually offer a superior value proposition to either drawing down on reserves or strict adherence to a reserves replenishment schedule.",5,734,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00734
2021-01-05-T-013,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"As context, it is useful to consider the evolution of two key drivers of borrowing costs as the other Member has mentioned – the inflation rate and the interest rate.",6,735,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00735
2021-01-05-T-013,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Inflation has remained very contained virtually everywhere. In advanced economies, expectations of future inflation are very well anchored.

2021-01-05-T-013,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),Interest rates have also remained very low worldwide. This limits the room for traditional monetary policy to operate since further reductions are constrained by the zero lower bound.,8,737,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00737
2021-01-05-T-013,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Furthermore, in countries where rates are close to zero, positive inflation means that borrowing costs in real terms are negative. This means that the costs of borrowing are no longer prohibitive and, perhaps, the more pertinent question is not so much whether we should incur more public debt or even how much public debt is on the books but whether in this environment of low interest rates and deficient demand, prudent fiscal spending is required to take the place of otherwise independent impotent monetary policy.",9,738,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00738

2021-01-05-T-013,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Such expenditures typically offer the most bang for the buck – when the Government spends specifically on investment in public goods, such as new educational retraining programmes or infrastructural needs, as opposed to funding Government consumption. Hence, when spending on replacing lost income was crucial in the early stages of the pandemic recession and remains important for vulnerable groups now, such as those in Tier-1 and Tier-2 sectors, there should also be a clear transition plan away from purely supporting consumption to an investment, especially, if I may suggest, in human capital.",13,742,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00742

2021-01-05-T-013,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"For example, to draw down $52 billion in a short period of time may mean that GIC needs to liquidate some of its investments at unfavourable prices.

2021-01-05-T-013,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"I would also like to ask whether the Government will be tightening up the budgeting process a little more.

Each Ministry then uses its discretion to re-allocate the “block” to its individual projects and uses.",13,759,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00759
2021-01-05-T-013,Leong Mun Wai,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),A zero-based budgeting process should be adopted instead whereby each project is re-evaluated every year by MOF. Projects which have outlived their usefulness should be closed or scaled down promptly. On-going projects after reaching maturity should reduce their spending gradually every year to reinforce the importance of achieving efficiency gains. These practices are common in the private sector and can also be adopted in the public sector.,14,760,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00760

2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I think Assoc Prof Jamus Lim gave us an economics tutorial on the virtues of using debt financing, and Mr Leong Mun Wai also agreed with the merits of using debt financing. I am in complete agreement with the broader points that are raised, that there is scope for debt financing in Singapore. And that is why we have said that we are studying very carefully the use of borrowing for long-term major infrastructure projects. So, that is coming. But that is not the scope of today's Motions. We will have a full presentation on the Government's plans when we are ready and we can have a full debate on the extent to which debt financing is used, the limits for such borrowing and the scope of such borrowing. So, we will do that in due course.",2,770,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00770
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Leong asked about Statutory Boards having excess cash. We are very mindful of the cash that is in Statutory Boards. That is why we have put in place a framework to look at centralised management of liquidity across the whole-of-Government. So, from time to time, very regularly, we will discuss with the Statutory Boards if, indeed, they do not have specific plans for use of these reserves, we may very well and we have in the past swept back the reserves into the Government funds. So, that has happened and we will continue to do that. The point that Mr Leong raised is a valid one. We will continue to do so.",3,771,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00771
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Leong also asked about Budget processes. It is an area close to my heart. I started my career in the Civil Service as a Budget Officer. I know all about zero-based budgeting. We do that. We do that. So, we have a framework of block budgets. Yes. That is to give certainty and assurance to Ministries for spending and for planning. But from time to time, we go in and we review Ministries' projects, Ministries' spending and we take a zero-based approach to make sure that there is value for money in Government spending.",4,772,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00772
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Finally, Mr Leong suggested increase in taxes. Excellent! We fully support that. And when the Government were to put up proposals for increase in taxes, please, we would certainly hope that the opposition Members of this House would also support us in making these moves in order to strengthen our fiscal position. And I assure you, each time we make such a proposal, we will want our taxation system to be progressive. It is already a very progressive system, in fact. We have highlighted this many times in this House. We have said that for every tax dollar that a person pays, if he is lower income, he gets $4 in benefits, a ratio of one to four. Whereas, if you are higher income, for every tax dollar you pay, you get much less in benefits. It is already a very progressive system. Even in the way we do GST, we have introduced elements of progressivity because we have a permanent GST Voucher which we give back to the lower income. So, the whole basis of our taxation system is designed to be fair, to be progressive, to enable us to move towards a fairer and more equal society. So, we are in complete agreement in moving in that direction.",5,773,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00773
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Next, there were some questions raised about assumptions. Assoc Prof Jamus Lim asked about the assumptions behind the increase of the debt ceilings and I think Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked the same question.",6,774,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00774
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"These debt ceilings for the Singapore Government Securities, SGS and Treasury Bills are raised periodically. I think Members have highlighted, it is almost like a routine exercise. The reason why we do this every four or five years is twofold. The purposes of raising the debt ceiling and to issue bonds, SGS or SSGS are twofold. Number one, to develop the domestic bond market; and number two, to meet the investment needs of the CPF and the CPF members.",7,775,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00775
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, why are we doing this? Number one, CPF needs are growing and I have highlighted, almost 75% of the increase in the proposed limits will be issued for SSGS, for CPF needs. What are the assumptions behind CPF members' needs growing? It is not really about GDP. It is linked to resident workforce growth, CPF contribution rates. These are quite predictable and the needs are growing and therefore, we need to cater for it. And I said, the significant part of the increase will be put for SSGS purposes, which means for the needs of CPF and CPF members.",8,776,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00776
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The second area is to develop the domestic bond market. Here, it is not so much about the overall economic condition, but it is about the demand for high-quality assets from financial institutions in tandem with the development of our financial markets. We get that assessment from MAS, they tell us that there is strong demand, continued demand. In fact, even in this period, there is continued strong demand for high-quality safe assets. And SGS and Treasury Bills are safe assets. So, financial institutions have demand for these assets. We have reached the limits and therefore we are also providing for an increase in the GSA and in the LTBA to provide to issue more SGS and the shorter term Treasury Bills. So, that is the basis for raising the debt limits.",9,777,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00777
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I think Mr Liang asked, how about that debt issuances by the Statutory Boards. That is quite separate from sovereign debt. Statutory Boards are separate legal entities from the Government. The provisions, the safeguards for the issuance of debt by Statutory Boards are governed in their respective legislation. But, for sovereign debt, SGS, Singapore Government Securities, Treasury Bills, we have the two Acts that we are referring to today – the Government Securities Act and the Local Treasury Bills Act; and the limits for issuance of debt under these two Acts are set out in the Act and authorised by Parliament. From time to time, when we need to increase, we come back to Parliament and we seek Parliament's endorsement for an increase in these limits.",10,778,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00778
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Let me see which other questions. Mr Liang asked about borrowing cost and whether we can ensure that we are able to invest well enough to pay the debts, debts that we borrow through the Singapore Government Securities; and the answer is yes. Temasek, GIC are long-term investors. They are constantly looking out for long-term investment opportunities and overall, we are able to meet our debt servicing cost fully from the returns generated from our investments.",11,779,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00779

2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"He asked also about whether there will be newer variations of issuance like green bonds. That is something we will consider, quite separate from this exercise. So, when we think about borrowing and using debt as fiscal policy for funding of major infrastructure projects, we will study if they are possibilities for different types of issuances like the issuance of green bonds.",13,781,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00781
2021-01-05-T-013,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Finally, Mr Liang asked about negative interest rates. It is something that we monitor very closely. In Singapore, the context is different because MAS uses an exchange rate policy, so, it is not constrained by zero interest rate like other central banks. Our interest rates in Singapore are determined more by global interest rates, but we monitor this very carefully. I think for now, our situation is such that we expect interest rates to remain low for quite some time until we see a broader upturn in the global economy and a normalisation of monetary policy, we do not expect to enter into negative interest rate territory.",14,782,2021-01-05-T-013-S-00782

But, for now, our baseline, or based on what we are looking at, I do not think we are entering a negative interest rate environment, but we do expect interest rates to remain low for a while, which as Assoc Prof Jamus Lim said, gives rise to the motivation to think about borrowing for projects. And like I said, that is something we are studying carefully and we will come back to this house with a fuller presentation when we are ready and have a fuller debate on it.

2021-01-05-T-016,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,asked the Minister for Health (a) how does the Ministry balance the cross-subsidisation of MediShield Life premiums between the private and public hospitals; (b) whether there is a cap imposed on insurers for the administrative cost charged as a percentage of the premiums received; and (c) what are the plans to keep premiums affordable.,1,794,2021-01-05-T-016-S-00794
2021-01-05-T-016,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"MediShield Life is a basic health insurance scheme designed to protect Singaporeans against large Class B2/C hospitalisation bills. As private hospital bills are generally higher, they are pro-rated to the equivalent level of a Class B2/C bill before MediShield Life payouts are computed. This ensures comparable payouts for subsidised and private patients.",1,795,2021-01-05-T-016-S-00795
2021-01-05-T-016,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Government has accepted the MediShield Life Council’s recent recommendation to lower the pro-ration factor for private hospital bills from the current 35% to 25%, to more adequately adjust for the differences between private hospital and subsidised bills. Over the past four years, the average bill size for inpatient and day surgeries in private hospitals has increased about 20% faster than in public hospitals. If we take the example of a coronary angiogram, the procedure when done in a private hospital would incur a bill of about $10,000 on average, while the same procedure in a B2 ward would cost about 25% of that, or $2,500 on average, after subsidies.",2,796,2021-01-05-T-016-S-00796
2021-01-05-T-016,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"To keep premiums affordable and sustainable, we must ensure that rising healthcare costs are kept in check. All stakeholders must play their part and exercise responsibility in choosing and delivering appropriate and necessary care, without inadvertently leading to over-consumption, over-servicing and over-charging for healthcare services. The Government has introduced a suite of measures through the years, including a minimum level of co-payment for private insurance riders and fee benchmarks, to keep healthcare costs sustainable. The MediShield Life Council has also noted the rapidly rising costs of cancer therapies and will be reviewing MediShield Life coverage for such treatment so they can be covered in a more sustainable manner.",3,797,2021-01-05-T-016-S-00797
2021-01-05-T-016,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"To ensure that MediShield Life premiums remain affordable even with the upcoming premium adjustments, the Government will provide up to $2.2 billion for premium subsidies and support over the next three years. The net premium increase for all Singapore Citizens will be no more than about 10% in the first year. The annual MediSave top-ups for Pioneer Generation seniors will also be increased from 2021. Premium payment will be deferred till end-December 2021 for those who have insufficient MediSave balances and are unable to pay their premiums in the coming year due to the economic impact of COVID-19. The financially needy can apply for Additional Premium Support for assistance with their premiums. No one will lose their MediShield Life coverage due to an inability to pay their premiums.",4,798,2021-01-05-T-016-S-00798
2021-01-05-T-016,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"There is no cap imposed on insurers for the administrative costs for the private insurance portion of Integrated Shield Plans (IPs). IP premiums are set, reviewed and adjusted by private insurers based on their commercial and actuarial considerations. Insurers have an incentive to keep premiums competitive, to attract and retain policyholders. As IP premiums are higher than MediShield Life premiums, we encourage Singaporeans to carefully consider their ward preferences and long-term affordability of IP premiums when choosing an IP, especially since premiums increase with age.",5,799,2021-01-05-T-016-S-00799

From 2017 to 2019, a total of 212 second-timer applicants were successful in applying for a flat from HDB under the Assistance Scheme for Second-Timers (Divorced/Widowed Parents) or ASSIST.

2021-01-05-T-018,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Housing and Development Board (HDB) provides multiple forms of support to help rental tenants work towards home ownership, including priority in sales exercises and generous subsidies. In addition, the Home Ownership Support Team was set up to guide rental tenants who are ready to buy a flat, including advising them on their housing budget and options, and the available grants and schemes.",1,804,2021-01-05-T-018-S-00804
2021-01-05-T-018,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Seniors aged 55 and above can buy 2-room Flexi flats from HDB on shorter leases, and HDB has exercised flexibility on the age requirement on a case-by-case basis. Eligible second-timer families with young children who are living in public rental flats can also buy 2-room Flexi flats on shorter leases, under the Fresh Start Housing Scheme. Buyers of short-lease 2-room Flexi flats must choose a lease that can cover them and their spouse at least until age 95, so that the flat can be a home for life, and to avoid the situation where they outlive the lease of the flat.",2,805,2021-01-05-T-018-S-00805
2021-01-05-T-019,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how does the Police track its performance in investigating and solving crimes involving online scams; and (b) in cases where bank accounts of recipients of scam monies have been frozen by the authorities in Singapore, what are the impediments to expeditiously returning victims’ monies.",1,806,2021-01-05-T-019-S-00806
2021-01-05-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The number of scams has been on the rise. In the first eleven months of 2020, there were around 14,960 cases of scams reported, which is an 80% increase compared to the same period last year. The total amount lost to scams has also increased. In the first eleven months of 2020, the total amount cheated was $254.3 million, which is a 64.3% increase compared to the same period last year.",1,807,2021-01-05-T-019-S-00807
2021-01-05-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The rise in scams can be attributed to high internet penetration amongst our people. Many more Singaporeans are interacting and transacting online. Criminal syndicates, many of whom operate outside Singapore, have been quick to exploit these trends. A significant proportion of online scams reported are transnational in nature, and are therefore particularly challenging to deal with. The investigations required will have to take place outside our jurisdiction, and cooperation from other countries will be needed.",2,808,2021-01-05-T-019-S-00808
2021-01-05-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Police have taken a number of steps to try and deal with scams. One example is the formation of the Anti-Scam Centre (ASC) in June 2019, which acts as a nerve centre for investigations into scam-related crimes. The ASC’s focus is to mitigate victims’ losses, through the interdiction of the proceeds of crime.",3,809,2021-01-05-T-019-S-00809
2021-01-05-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Member asked about how the Police track their performance in investigating and solving online scams. As indicated earlier, to the extent that the perpetrators are outside Singapore, there will be obvious difficulties. The Police track the number of money mules investigated, number of scammers arrested, number of bank accounts frozen, and amount of monies that have been recovered. These are reported in Police’s Annual Crime Brief. As at 17 December 2020, more than 14,000 reports involving total losses of more than S$162.2 million have been referred to the ASC. The ASC has frozen more than 11,200 bank accounts and recovered about S$57.7 million. Where the monies had already been transferred out of Singapore the recovery is more difficult.",4,810,2021-01-05-T-019-S-00810
2021-01-05-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Member also asked about the process of returning the monies to the victims. In cases where the bank accounts of recipients of scam monies have been frozen by the authorities in Singapore, the monies are seized as proceeds of crime. The investigation officer will typically apply for a disposal order from the Courts after ascertaining that the money indeed belongs to the victim in question. While there is no fixed timeline for this process, under Section 370 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the officer must make a report to the Court within one year after the date of seizure of the monies, or when the monies are no longer relevant for the purposes of any investigation or trial, whichever is earlier. However, should the monies still be relevant for the purposes of investigation or trial, or if there is any pending court proceeding, the Court cannot dispose of the monies and the monies cannot be returned to the victims yet.",5,811,2021-01-05-T-019-S-00811
2021-01-05-T-019,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"The application of a disposal order entails the authorities satisfying the Courts that a crime did take place, that the seized monies are proceeds of crime traceable to that identified crime, and lastly, that the victim concerned is the rightful owner of those seized monies.

2021-01-05-T-020,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Member asked if we will be extending BIPS beyond December 2021. BIPS has received positive feedback from corporates and IPCs. Some corporates see contributing to the community as part of a business’ larger role in the society, and an expression of the mutual, symbiotic relationship between a company and the community in which it thrives. Employees of corporates who give back to society also have higher levels of well-being and are more productive and fulfilled. IPCs in turn, benefit from the skills and expertise that a corporate offers and can serve their beneficiaries more effectively.",6,823,2021-01-05-T-020-S-00823

Similarly, other green spaces such as Thomson Nature Park and Windsor Nature Park could have been developed for housing.

These comprise key representative ecosystems and habitats for Singapore’s native biodiversity. Not all of these Nature Reserves and Nature Parks were untouched habitats. For example, Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve and the upcoming Khatib Bongsu Nature Park were once prawn farming areas. These areas were abandoned, acquired by the Government, and have over time become green spaces inhabited by indigenous flora and fauna. Similarly, Clementi Forest was an abandoned rubber plantation.

The trend was largely similar in 2019 and 2020. Of the minority that had exceeded the time limits in 2019 and 2020, around half were either referred to other forms of legal assistance or the claimants decided not to pursue their claims; the remainder were followed up by TADM, such as helping them explore private settlement or arranging for a mediation session if both parties agreed to it.",2,874,2021-01-05-T-031-S-00874
2021-01-05-T-031,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"It is important to encourage employees to come forward early to lodge their claims, as it becomes more difficult to establish the facts with the passage of time. Early reporting is also critical to improve the chance of a full recovery and the best way to ensure that their colleagues are not similarly affected.

Parents can use the CDA to pay for expenses at Approved Institutions such as childcare centres, kindergartens, hospitals and clinics. The Government regularly reviews the CDA scheme to consider feedback from parents and to better support the developmental needs of children. Parents have provided us feedback that they would find it helpful if the Government expands approved uses of CDA funds to cover Student Care Centre (SCC) expenses. We are thus already considering this as part of our ongoing review of the CDA scheme and we will provide an update on this in due course.",1,903,2021-01-05-T-038-S-00903

Outside of Speakers' Corner, the question is whether any assembly, procession, may potentially breach one of the provisions of Section 7(2) of the Public Order Act. These provisions are capable of being breached by one person, and they are capable of being breached by more than one person. It will depend on the conduct of the person(s) involved. And assemblies which start with the intention of being peaceful, can also turn violent, through the actions of a very small group, which take advantage of such a situation.

The talks covered issues such as under-reporting, late-reporting and inconsistent statements by victims of sexual offences, rape trauma syndrome and memory-trauma dynamics.

In particular for school-based SCCs, schools also exercise close oversight of SCC operations to ensure that quality is maintained, and work closely with the SCC operators to ensure alignment between the programmes in the SCC and the students’ educational experience in school. For example, the SCC staff work closely with the school to plan and deliver programmes that promote the holistic development of students, reinforce values taught by the school, and promote positive social interaction. For students with greater needs enrolled in school-based SCCs, schools also work with community partners and the SCC operators to further strengthen motivational support and resilience through meaningful programmes.",4,990,2021-01-05-T-054-S-00990

For the Tourism sector, MTI worked with industry stakeholders to pilot Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions (MICE) events and formulate an Event Industry Resilience Roadmap to provide guidance on safe and gradual resumption of business events.
