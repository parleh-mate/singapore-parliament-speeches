2018-02-28-T-002,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,asked  the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether the Government's Factually website is actively being used to verify information and debunk fake news about Government policies; and (b) whether the information on the website is updated in a timely manner.,1,8,2018-02-28-T-002-S-00008
2018-02-28-T-002,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Sir, Factually aims to clarify widespread or common misperceptions of Government policy, or inaccurate assertions on matters of public concern that can harm Singapore’s social fabric. This is done on a timely basis to ensure that prevailing falsehoods and misinformation are debunked as soon as possible.",1,9,2018-02-28-T-002-S-00009

2018-02-28-T-002,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Over the years, the site has addressed inaccurate assertions on various matters, ranging from savings and taxes, to education and employment. For example, in January this year, several online articles claimed that the Government had raised the CPF Retirement Sum in a “secret policy change”, when in fact the revised figures had been publicly announced in 2015 and was widely reported in the media. Another online rumour claimed that our public universities reserve a minimum 20% quota for foreign students, when in fact, no such policy exists.",3,11,2018-02-28-T-002-S-00011

2018-02-28-T-002,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),I thank the Minister for the reply. I would like to understand what are the criteria used to determine what policies need to be explained on the Government Factually website. Does it have to do with how serious the subject matter is or is it also correlated to how viral the fake news is?,1,14,2018-02-28-T-002-S-00014
2018-02-28-T-002,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Sir, Factually aims to address what we call ""drums"", that is, distortions, rumours, untruths, myths, smears and inaccurate information published in the public domain.

Certainly, when the misinformation has really gone viral that needs to be addressed very quickly, we will do it in a timely manner. Those that may not, but still needs to be addressed, we either do it ourselves or we work with the various agencies which are involved to see whether we can push out the information as quickly as possible.",3,17,2018-02-28-T-002-S-00017
2018-02-28-T-003,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked  the Minister for Home Affairs since October 2016 (a) to what extent are users of legal online gambling sites operated by Singapore Pools and Singapore Turf Club current gamblers on any platform versus first-time gamblers; and (b) whether such gamblers have used these sites to add to their total gambling spending as opposed to switching gambling spending from other platforms.,1,18,2018-02-28-T-003-S-00018
2018-02-28-T-003,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Mr Speaker, Sir, more than one-third and four-fifths of Singapore Pools and Singapore Turf Club’s remote account holders respectively, previously held telephone betting accounts. Among those who had previously not held telephone betting accounts, over 95% of them indicated that they had placed bets with the operators in the preceding 12 months. In short, the large majority do not appear to be first-time gamblers.",1,19,2018-02-28-T-003-S-00019

2018-02-28-T-003,Josephine Teo,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"It is not possible to ascertain whether these remote account holders have simply switched from other platforms, including illegal ones or have increased their total gambling. That said, there has not been evidence of a surge in the sum of bets placed with Pools and Turf Club since the commencement of remote services in 2016. In 2017, Pools and Turf Club’s turnover grew by 2.6%, in line with the average annual growth of 2.4% between FY2012 and FY2015.",3,21,2018-02-28-T-003-S-00021

2018-02-28-T-003,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),I thank the Second Minister for the reply. Just one very quick supplementary question  may I know the source of the data for the first part of the answer on the proportion of users who previously had telephone betting accounts.,1,24,2018-02-28-T-003-S-00024
2018-02-28-T-003,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,The sources are Pools and Turf Club themselves; the information is from surveys done on the users of their services.,1,25,2018-02-28-T-003-S-00025
2018-02-28-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked  the Minister for National Development (a) what measures are in place at our border checkpoints to deter wildlife trafficking; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider establishing a wildlife sniffer dog programme to detect cases of wildlife trafficking at our border checkpoints.,1,26,2018-02-28-T-004-S-00026
2018-02-28-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for National Development),"Sir, the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) works closely with Singapore Customs, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, and local and international partners to combat wildlife trafficking.",1,27,2018-02-28-T-004-S-00027

2018-02-28-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for National Development),"First, we subject all passengers and cargoes as well as shipments to risk assessment. Our risk assessment framework helps agencies flag out which passengers and shipments require more detailed checks. Agencies ensure that these risk profiles and indicators are up-to-date by continually reviewing wildlife trafficking trends and exchanging information with international partners like INTERPOL and the World Customs Organisation.",3,29,2018-02-28-T-004-S-00029

2018-02-28-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for National Development),"Second, agencies carry out multiple layers of checks at Singapore’s border checkpoints. For example, radiographic scanners and x-rays are used to screen passengers and cargo. The officers performing these tasks are trained to pick out suspicious items and behaviours.",5,31,2018-02-28-T-004-S-00031

2018-02-28-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for National Development),"Third, agencies adopt a coordinated enforcement approach.

2018-02-28-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for National Development),"Taken together, these measures have led to several successful seizures of illegal wildlife in Singapore.

2018-02-28-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for National Development),"AVA is continually studying the efficacy of different tools and techniques to detect illegal wildlife at our border checkpoints. To the Member’s specific question about sniffer dogs, we understand that they are used in some countries to detect wildlife products. In Singapore, we use other effective scanning technologies for this purpose. More studies are needed to determine if sniffer dogs can be more effective than our current methods.",11,37,2018-02-28-T-004-S-00037
2018-02-28-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. The issue really is that the officers who are scanning the bags have so much to look out for that it is really difficult for them to also look out for wildlife products I hope that MND would seriously consider the proposal to set up a wildlife sniffer dog programme.,1,38,2018-02-28-T-004-S-00038

2018-02-28-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Secondly, the sniffer dogs are already deployed in our fight against drugs, so why not also use them in our fight against wildlife trafficking?",3,40,2018-02-28-T-004-S-00040
2018-02-28-T-004,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Sir, as I said earlier in my answer, we employ a multi-pronged approach and not just depend on one modality. It starts with good intelligence and then, employing technology and techniques that have been proven to work in many other cases. So, we will continue to look at options including sniffer dogs if there can be objective data to show that they are more effective than our currently deployed methods.",1,41,2018-02-28-T-004-S-00041
2018-02-28-T-005,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked  the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in each of the past three years (a) how much has been spent on the National Recycling Programme; and (b) how many tonnes of recyclables has the programme contributed to the total amount collected from Singapore's domestic recycling sector.,1,42,2018-02-28-T-005-S-00042
2018-02-28-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"Public waste collection (PWC) contracts cover both the collection of recyclables, under the National Recycling Programme (NRP), and the collection of waste.

2018-02-28-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"In 2016, the public waste collectors collected about 44,200 tonnes of recyclables. This was an increase from 2014 and 2015, when about 31,000 and 37,000 tonnes of recyclables were collected respectively.",5,47,2018-02-28-T-005-S-00047

2018-02-28-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"My Ministry continues to look at how we can improve recycling rates in the domestic sector, where the recycling rate has been hovering around 20% since 2012. In recent years, we have been enhancing recycling infrastructure to make it even easier for Singaporeans to recycle. For example, from 1 April this year, all new non-landed private residential developments above four storeys will need to provide dual chutes for refuse and recyclables. These dual chutes have already been introduced in new HDB Build-to-Order flats since January 2014. All existing condominiums will also have to provide one recycling bin per block from 1 August this year. We will also use regulatory measures to complement the new recycling infrastructure. For example, we will introduce a new framework to make it easier for Singaporeans to recycle their e-waste.",7,49,2018-02-28-T-005-S-00049

The NEA promotes the 3Rs, that is, “reduce, reuse and recycle”, via social media posts and educational materials distributed at community and school events. Information on the proper use of recycling bins, location of collection points and 3R tips are also available on NEA’s website and NEA’s myENV mobile app. We will continue to encourage every Singaporean to play their part to reduce, reuse and recycle.",9,51,2018-02-28-T-005-S-00051

2018-02-28-T-005,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"At the same time, Singaporeans should not misuse the recycling bins. A little less-known fact is we can no longer use the recyclables once they are contaminated, such as by food waste. Let us all be gracious and not waste the efforts of our fellow Singaporeans who want to do their part for the environment.",11,53,2018-02-28-T-005-S-00053
2018-02-28-T-005,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply, but I have also asked how much has been spent on the NRP for each year in the last three years.

I must admit that I am impressed. In fact, I would say it is a very clever Budget, especially on the fundamental change in the way major projects are to be financed in the future. It is a Budget that I consider as inclusive and progressive. It is heartening to see a well-balanced palette of offers and initiatives being laid down for all Singaporeans.

The move to extend the Wage Credit Scheme (WCS) and all other related initiatives in continuation to support firms in coping with near-term costs are rightfully addressed as they are directly linked to manpower, for example, Foreign Worker Levy (FWL), which is one of the major components of business operating cost.",4,75,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00075

I feel this is missing and I believe this would make a big difference if the Budget could take this as one of the many initiatives to help businesses in the near term. As we know, two major components of business cost in Singapore are  manpower cost and premise rental cost.

It is so heart-warming to see current running and new programmes and initiatives being rolled out concertedly, either enhanced or fine-tuned. The SG Cares initiative is proven to be alive and serves as a national platform towards the spirit of caring and giving nation.

As major and infrastructural projects will have to be financed through borrowing, thus, the overall cost of these projects will be inflated by an additional amount equivalent to the cost of borrowing.

This is not a matter of whether you are rich or poor. In many of the MPS cases that I have seen over the years as a Member of Parliament, much of the hardship and challenges faced by our residents and their families are usually a matter of lack of financial planning.

By providing an environment to support the access to opportunities and the ability to seize these opportunities will provide Singaporeans with hope and I hope also the aspiration to do better for themselves and their families. With that, I support the Budget.",22,127,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00127

2018-02-28-T-009,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"The pressure to make major changes within a short period of time is daunting. On top of that, talks of increased spending on various crucial areas like healthcare, enhanced social safety nets and massive infrastructural developments, as well as the possible GST hike, have got Singaporeans waiting for this year’s Budget with apprehension.",2,129,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00129
2018-02-28-T-009,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Amidst a climate of uncertainty, the Minister for Finance has crafted a practical Budget that addresses all these challenges. He has outlined ways in which we can keep our economy innovative and vibrant, which means more opportunities for businesses and, in turn, a better future for all Singaporeans. Businesses will certainly appreciate the strong focus on the available support for pursuing innovation and increased digital capabilities. We will be making bigger steps towards our vision of a Smart City that is also green and liveable. A few days ago, Hong Kong announced their financial position as well. They have achieved a $28-billion surplus. In fact, one of the key focuses when I read it up on it, was how do they continue to invest in innovation?

2018-02-28-T-009,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"At a dialogue session with my residents in Sembawang after the Budget Statement was released, one concern among the residents was naturally on the proposed future GST hike. The residents were asking whether this was going to make Singapore an even more expensive place for businesses and for us to stay and for tourism as well.",4,131,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00131
2018-02-28-T-009,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"In 2007, when the GST was raised from 5% to 7% occurred, CPI inflation rose to 2.6% in July 2007 from 1.3% in June, reflecting the 2% GST hike. How will the proposed GST increase from 7% to 9% affect Singapore’s competitiveness? Will the increase deter foreign direct investments into Singapore and hurt our tourism and MICE industry? How will the proposed GST increase impact our Consumer Price index and inflation when implemented?",5,132,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00132
2018-02-28-T-009,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"The appeal from the residents was to delay the GST increase as far as possible. If it is not 2021, is it possible to push it to 2025. Better still, have plans to grow the economy, grow the income of Singaporeans, grow the revenues and incomes of all businesses and also let the revenues of the country can grow concurrently. So, if we can, we can deter the GST increase indefinitely.",6,133,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00133

I think it is fair. But the more we build, the more we need to maintain. Did the Government take into account the maintenance cost after the construction? And I am a little bit concerned whether our construction sector and manpower can handle so many infrastructure projects at the same time. We are worried about whether we have the resources to do so, not just about finance but also the space and the manpower. Can we space all these developments a bit further apart?",7,134,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00134
2018-02-28-T-009,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Next, I would like to move to our environment, a topic that I have been following closely with every Budget for the last 12 years. Environmental issues are closely related to our sustainability and living standards. Hence, it is important for us to continue to review and improve policies regarding this aspect. The carbon tax, scheduled for 2019, was announced last year, and this year’s Budget revealed further details on it. The carbon tax will no doubt serve as a deterrent for big emitters of greenhouse gases.",8,135,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00135
2018-02-28-T-009,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),But I think we need to do more to push for more measures to help companies and households to reduce their energy usage and use renewable energy. Will the Government introduce incentive measures like grants for projects to help households as well as businesses to achieve a lower carbon emission?,9,136,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00136
2018-02-28-T-009,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"At last year’s Budget, I spoke about exploring the use of solar energy, and I am glad tangible progress has been made. It is heartening news that the private sector, Town Councils and various Government agencies have been major contributors to expand solar capacity in Singapore in recent years. The private sector accounts for 45.9% of total installed capacity, while Town Councils and Government agencies like HDB accounts for 44.7%. The residential sector, comprised primarily of private homes, accounts for 589 installations, but that is less than 5% of total installed capacity.",10,137,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00137
2018-02-28-T-009,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"The way forward is to keep the momentum and increase take-up rates. Understandably, space constraint remains a challenge. While smaller rooftop systems are less economical than larger ones, making them seem to be poor investments in the short term, increasing awareness on the cost-saving abilities and installation procedures can help to generate more interest among private home owners.",11,138,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00138
2018-02-28-T-009,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"In the UK, the National Network for Low-Carbon Open Homes, an initiative by the Centre for Sustainable Energy, provides a platform for people with energy-homes to share about the technology they use, their experiences and to answer questions. For Singaporeans, the use of renewable energy is still in its infancy stage. So, perhaps a similar platform could help to generate awareness and interest. I hope the Government can consider subsidised or free energy consultation to encourage more buy-in from the public. The Government should also work closely with private developers and residents to facilitate convenient and affordable installation of solar panels for condominiums and other private residential apartments and commercial buildings.",12,139,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00139
2018-02-28-T-009,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"On a related note, from middle of this year, Singaporean households will be able to choose which provider to buy their power from. They can tap on the e-commerce platform for electricity to pick their provider. So, now would be an appropriate time to step up on public education and encourage households to make more eco-friendly decisions. I note that many such clean energy projects are still in the test-bed or pilot stages, awareness and presence are lacking. Not many residents are aware that their homes are being powered by, or will eventually be powered by solar panels on roof tops. How many are aware that they will soon have a choice to use renewable energy in their homes, and plan to make the switch? More importantly, how many Singaporeans see this as a good thing? It is important to get Singaporeans excited about renewable energy, and this can only be achieved through greater transparency and public education, even for early-stage projects.",13,140,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00140
2018-02-28-T-009,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"My next topic is on encouraging acts of charity in Singapore. On behalf of my residents, I would like to thank the Government, and especially Mr Heng Swee Keat, for giving an early ang pow of $100 to $300 to all eligible Singaporeans aged 21 and above. I know the schools have encouraged students to donate an ang pow during the Chinese New Year period to the welfare fund so needy students can benefit from the fund. In the same spirit of caring and giving, I would like to propose that the Government facilitate giving by providing an easy option for Singaporeans who are keen to donate their SG bonus ang pow to local charities like the Community Chest or even the President’s Challenge 2018. Maybe the Government can provide dollar-for-dollar matching to encourage the public to donate.",14,141,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00141
2018-02-28-T-009,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Next, I am glad that the Government intends to extend the Wage Credit Scheme. The goal of the scheme is to encourage employers to give wage increases to their employees. However, I would like to know if any study has been done on the effectiveness of the scheme. How many employers are doling out salary increases because of the scheme? On the flip side, many employers are also concerned with raising salaries as this will permanently increase their manpower cost, whereas the Wage Credit Scheme is a temporary one. Most employer would prefer to share the company’s profits with the staff by special bonuses which are one-off and will not permanently increase their manpower cost. Does the Wage Credit Scheme include such one-off bonuses?",15,142,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00142
2018-02-28-T-009,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Lastly, with all the talk about SkillsFuture and upgrading, there was disappointment felt by my residents that there was no enhancement and no top-up in SkillsFuture credits. There are Singaporeans who have utilised all their credits, and there are some, on the other hand, who are waiting for a perfect course to come by. They are afraid to waste their current credit on a course that may not benefit them. Why not top up their SkillsFuture credits since there is a Budget surplus? This is investing in our people.",16,143,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00143

Accept those who are self-reliant financially, can contribute good tax revenue for Singapore or who could create quality jobs for Singapore.

Longer term plans that are announced usually do not retain in our thoughts for very long. After all, the Finance Minister announces many initiatives or schemes in each annual Budget. To many, the crux of the Budget is - how much will I receive and how much will the Government take in return. Herein lies the problem. To many, they view our Budget on a transactional basis rather than one that is about participative nation building.",3,180,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00180

It seemed there were always new applications to learn, new situations to grapple with that required me to think on my own feet. I recalled one incident where I was struggling and about to give up. This was what my then line manager told me  “Do not shy away from the issues. Be keen to learn or do more. Always think and go beyond your assigned tasks, continue to evolve, build your skills frequently as the company or even the global market changes. Someday, you will realise that you are the ultimate beneficiary of all the knowledge and skills that you have acquired in the process.” I am glad to have heed his advice as it has been one of the most practical and useful advice, and has since been my mantra for skills upgrade and constant learning even before SkillsFuture emerged.",8,185,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00185

More importantly, our older workers need opportunities. Opportunities to be given continued employment or job re-design or even opportunities to be mentors to younger workers.

I have brought this up before in this House. Personally, I believe that older persons have much more patience to work with young children, compared to their younger counterparts.

These MNCs or large firms that are earning in excess of $1 billion annually, can be charged a corporate tax rate of 17.5% to 18%. It is a small increase, in order to keep Singapore globally competitive for businesses, but the revenue that can be generated to fund Government expenditure and social spending is significant even with this half to one percentage point increase.",29,234,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00234
2018-02-28-T-009,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Since personal income tax has already been made progressive, corporate income tax should also be made progressive, rather than the current flat rate that benefits high income earning MNCs or large firms significantly more than smaller firms.",30,235,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00235

For instance, the GST can be increased 1% for one to two years, then another 1% for the next one to two years. This staggered increment will give people more time to adjust to the increased GST and better manage their finances and expenses.",31,236,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00236

I am very pleased that this year’s Budget Speech by Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat aims at narrowing this divide.

National University of Singapore sociologist Vincent Chua, one of the studies’ researchers, noted that while Singapore has done “a pretty good job of fostering multi-culturialism and mixing between ethnic groups”, “the next step now is to increase efforts to increase mixing between classes”.",3,242,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00242

The Government has intervened to help those who are less well-off in the areas of home ownership, healthcare and education, as well as means-tested assistance schemes for Singaporeans from lower income households. Programmes such as Workfare, the progressive wage model and self-help groups such as Mendaki, SINDA and the CDAC also provide support through a variety of schemes from financial assistance to learning enhancement programmes.",5,244,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00244

The emphasis is on ""we"". We, the citizens of Singapore, pledge to build a society.

And as the country progressed, so did its people. Social mobility matched economic growth as Singapore and Singaporeans worked hard to build their country and their lives. We have many inspiring stories of Singaporeans who have become shining examples of what it would take to succeed in spite of humble beginnings. Our President, Mdm Halimah Yacob, the former Speaker of this House, is one clear example. Her work ethic, resilience, and consistent concern for the less privileged serve as a benchmark for many of us in this House, and an inspiration for every child who dreams of becoming President of Singapore. What has moved many Singaporeans, in particular, is the credit that Mdm President gives to her mother for the person she is today.",10,249,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00249

Some may refer to this as parenting with heart and backbone, while others may say that it is about building resilience through positive psychology. It is really about learning how to get up when you fall, or to keep your chin up in times of adversity. Many in this House might be familiar with this parenting style, but I wonder if “conscious parenting”, as I would like to call it, is all that common in our very busy Singaporean households?",11,250,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00250

You see, Mr Speaker, my father, who came from an even more impoverished background, had through merit, made it into the top boys' school for his Secondary education, and he wanted his son to do the same. Of course, it did not help that my eldest sister had made it to the elite top girls' school! My father did not openly show his disappointment, though I could feel it.

By hearing their stories about jobs, I saw how hard they have to work and how little they get in return for their labour. By asking them about their children, I saw how much their kids struggled in school and how worried parents are that they would eventually have difficult lives. By listening to them talk about their crises, I heard about their feelings with humiliation, trying to access social assistance.

2018-02-28-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, I should add here that where there is lack of social mobility, it is not only the poorer families that are stressed, even those higher up in the income chain, including the middle class, have the stress of ensuring that they retain their current positions or climb up. The competition in the education system is high. Just look at the money spent on private tuition and other enrichment classes which in turn adds to the economic stress that families face.",19,287,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00287
2018-02-28-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Why is it so important to show a commitment to the goal of reducing inequality and increasing social mobility? Because it is vital to our very existence as a nation. We recite the words of the pledge daily. How can we say these things about justice and equality, happiness, prosperity and progress for the nation, if we are perpetuating a society where citizens are not equal, where some are seemingly having little hope and doom for failure, while others boom ahead? Will there eventually be an erosion of trust where a class divide makes it harder for people at the bottom and the middle to identify with those at the top?",20,288,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00288
2018-02-28-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"We fiercely guard our sovereignty and expect Singaporeans to defend Singapore. But will the day come when Singaporeans who find Singapore a cold and cruel place, have no motivation to defend it? This will be a disaster at all levels.",21,289,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00289
2018-02-28-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, next, I move on to one aspect of inequality that I believe needs to be reviewed, and that is  healthcare coverage under medical insurance. If one compares the coverage of private insurance plans and the coverage under MediShield Life, one will observe that there is significant inequality in access to healthcare that affects the poorer and older Singaporeans. As regards insurance coverage, there are some practices in the healthcare industry that need looking at.",22,290,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00290
2018-02-28-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"One such practice is that of some insurance policies providing full coverage for hospitalisation bills. Such insurance policies undertake to pay for surgeries as long as they are done as day surgeries, or if the patients stay at the hospital. All charges will be paid by the insurance company ""as charged"". Such policies do not require the patient to pay any deductible or make any co-payment.",23,291,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00291
2018-02-28-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"In contrast, MediShield Life understandably has deductibles and co-insurance to avoid over-consumption. One feature of MediShield Life, however, is that the annual deductible rises when one passes 80 years old. While the annual deductible for persons aged 80 and below is between $1,500 and $2,000, the annual deductible for those aged 80 and above is between $2,000 and $3,000. Thus, the most senior of our people, aged 81 and above, who have the least income and most health problems have to foot bills up to this higher deductible before MediShield Life will kick in.",24,292,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00292
2018-02-28-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Has the Government analysed how this increased deductible has affected the consumption and delivery of medical services to our most senior citizens? To give one specific example, operating on a trigger-finger release usually costs less than $2,000. So, those aged 80 and above cannot claim the expenses for the surgery, but those who are younger can claim part of the expense as the deductible is lower for younger people. Premiums are already higher for older people, why are deductibles also higher when in general, the older people have less financial ability to pay? Why this reverse discrimination for our older citizens?",25,293,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00293
2018-02-28-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Coming back to the private ""as charged"" insurance policies, there is another aspect that needs review. Has the Government studied the effect of such full coverage policy on the behaviour of patients and its implications? When a person has to undergo a minor surgery which could be done at the outpatient clinic, does he choose instead to do it as a day surgery or as an inpatient in a hospital, so as to be able to tap on the insurance for full coverage? Does such insurance result in some unnecessary surgeries, when more conservative treatments will suffice? Is there inefficiency and a waste of expensive resources caused by such policies?",26,294,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00294
2018-02-28-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, I am not suggesting that patients or the medical profession are doing anything unethical, as this behaviour is sanctioned by the regulators of the insurance industry. It is important to review the kinds of insurance schemes in the market, so as to discourage over-consumption and inefficient use of resources. There have to be deductibles and co-payments for all medical insurance schemes. Regulators have to direct their attention to this area.",27,295,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00295
2018-02-28-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, in conclusion, I would like to emphasise that inequality is a threat to our solidarity as a nation. We have to drill deeper into the sources of inequality and take concrete steps to remedy it.",28,296,2018-02-28-T-009-S-00296

2018-02-28-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"We have some way to go. Let me cite an example in the taxi industry. Given the onslaught of cheap money under the guise of ride-hailing technology, all the taxi companies in Singapore have no choice, but to form alliance with the two dominant ride-hailing companies. For commuters, it means more choices as they can now hail taxis from the taxi stands, on the roads, on the streets, and from the taxi company’s call centre or app, as well as through the ride-hailing companies under different pricing mechanism. This is pleasing to the commuters, but it puts taxi companies in a tight spot.",12,321,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00321
2018-02-28-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"This is because taxi companies are regulated by the LTA under its Quality of Service (QoS) framework, and one of the criteria to demonstrate good quality of service is that at least 92% of taxi requests made by commuters through phone have to be matched with taxis – out of 100 calls, 92 calls must be matched with taxis. However, with a good proportion of taxis responding to third-party ride-hailing app, it means that there are fewer taxis on the road to take on requests coming in through taxi’s companies’ app or call centre, which is what LTA looks at only.",13,322,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00322

2018-02-28-T-011,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Ideally, LTA needs to consider taxi booking data from both the taxi companies and third-party ride hailing companies that dispatch taxis collectively.

MOT is also planning to double the rail network length to 360 km by 2030. However, are there efforts being made to nurture local firms as we expand the rail network?

From the inception of our MRT system until today, 30 years has passed, we have to rely on these foreign companies to replenish our rolling stock, upgrade our train or upgrade our signalling system. In fact, the current signalling system in many MRT lines is like a black box to us. In 12 years' time, when we double our train network length, will we face the same problem?",20,329,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00329

Thales, for example, formerly known as Thomson CSF and Thomson SA, had the support of its government to privatise in 1998. The move had helped the company to expand globally. For Alstom and Siemens, they are competitors but they merged the train building business recently with the support of their governments in order to compete better with China. Bombardier was founded in 1942 and as recently as last year, the Canadian government provided interest-free loans worth over $370 million to the company to support its projects.",21,330,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00330

2018-02-28-T-011,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"In his Budget speech, Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat cited ageing as one of the three major shifts that we must prepare for. We are told that the number of seniors living alone more than doubled between 2006 and 2016 to 47,400. I believe the trend will continue to grow. Together with a projected increase in our elderly population relative to other age groups in the coming years, it is important that we get our policies on elderly care right.",2,346,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00346
2018-02-28-T-011,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"The Government seem to be still finding its way in deciding how extensive the role of the State should be when it comes to care-giving. If it prefers to continue to rely substantially on care-giving through an individual’s family care network, it should consider giving more support at every level to the supporting family as well as to care-givers including supporting the care-giver who has to stop work and deciding what is a decent level of support for the care-giver. Further, with the growing number of elderly or elderly singles living alone, the Government needs to put in place adequate resources and the infrastructural support for assisted living.",3,347,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00347

2018-02-28-T-011,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"While it is good that the Government now recognises that singles are often a key source of care-giving support within their families, in my view, many singles end up taking a larger role in care-giving support than their married siblings who may be bogged down with caring for their children. Hence, I think such singles do not deserve a lesser grant than their married counterparts whether they are living near or with their elderly parents. In fact, arguably, many married siblings benefit more from living near their parents than their single siblings as they benefit from their parents helping out in caring for their children. Whatever rationale the Government chooses to use to give married children a higher grant, I hope the Government will consider equalising the grant for the reasons I have given.",7,351,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00351

2018-02-28-T-011,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"The Foreign Domestic Worker's (FDW) Levy will be increased in two ways. The FDW levy for the second FDW employed without levy concession will go up from $265 to $450. The increase is hefty, about 70%. I am concerned this may affect households employing two helpers, one to handle all the housework and one to look after elderly parents who may be bedridden or even just require attentive care at all times while their children are working. If the second FDW is not allowed levy concession, this increase in levy will add to the financial burden of their children. Can the levy increase be exercised more equitably in favour of families needing two FDWs to look after elderly parents as well as doing housework? Can the Government not distinguish the example I mentioned from the situation of say a wealthy family living in a big house requiring more than one FDW? Again, I hope the Government will regard enhancing elderly care efforts in priority to other considerations on this issue.",10,354,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00354

I hope the Government will relook how it applies its Singles Premium policy on elderly singles. Elderly singles may require more support from the Government. They will likely have fewer options than their married counterparts insofar as family financial support or family care-givers is concerned.

Can we place greater premium on elderly care and welfare in such a case? For example, the Government can consider helping all singles aged 55 and above purchasing two-room flexi-flats for the first time on a shorter lease by reducing the Singles Premium. A premium reduction of say upwards to $5,000, based on their income levels and length of lease, upholds the rationale of the Singles Premium, but reduces its impact for our elderly poor singles who can then use their savings for their retirement.",13,357,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00357

Singles tend to shoulder heavier responsibilities because their married siblings are probably caught up with taking care of their own children, and are therefore unable to share the responsibilities. Therefore, I believe singles should enjoy the same amount of housing grants as those who are married.

2018-02-28-T-011,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines),"Mr Speaker, this Budget is an unusual Budget. Most Budgets looked at how to meet next year’s needs, or at most, the next few years. This Budget looks at the future needs of Singapore, beyond the term of this Government. A BBC World Service Report dated 20 February 2018 put it this way",13,408,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00408

It’s a nice Budget because it has a good medium- to long-term view”.",14,409,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00409

I explained that we will be spending more, especially on healthcare, education and infrastructure. I said we will need more money in future, hence the need for increase in GST. They asked why the Government is raising GST when we have so much money. Why not spend some of our reserves? This is a valid question which the Prime Minister and the Ministers have answered and must continue to explain. As their Member of Parliament, I will try to convince them too.",15,410,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00410
2018-02-28-T-011,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines),"But what we need to do is to ask ourselves where did the reserves come from in the first place? The answer, of course, is that it was the hard work of our pioneer generations, working hand in hand with the Government, to grow our economy and create wealth, and to spend within our means, and always putting something away for a rainy day. These three cardinal principles – growth, surplus, savings – have been followed faithfully by successive PAP Governments for over 50 years since independence.

The eldest child, a girl, is eight years old. Her brother, the second child, is six years old and the youngest girl is five years old. The father recently had heart surgery and is not working but is actively looking for a job. The mother is working in sales. Some time ago, they had sought higher subsidies from the eldest child’s school for student care fees but were not successful. Now, after the surgery and with the husband not working, the family is feeling the financial pinch. They have some debts to clear as they had previously paid for various bills in the past with credit cards.

Their circumstances are specific to them, but some of the issues that they faced are not uncommon. An unexpected event, especially a health-related one, often derails a family’s financial plan.

2018-02-28-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"There are many elements in this Budget that can help the family I spoke about. There will be increased support for education. In particular, the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme will be reviewed and one of the outcomes is the eligibility criteria will be raised to cover more families. This family can expect to receive some assistance that will reduce at least the eldest child’s school expenses. The extension of the Service and Conservancy Charges rebate will also go some way in alleviating their household expenses. The father could also avail himself to the schemes within the Adapt and Grow programme and find a suitable job that will help to improve the family’s finances. Indirectly, the other initiatives targeted at supporting businesses for growing a vibrant and innovative economy like the extension of the Wage Credit Scheme, enhancement of corporate income tax rebate and the Enterprise Development Grant will all help to create a more conducive environment to look for a job and stay employed. Hopefully, by the time the GST increases kick in, the family is financially stable. Even if they are not, the GST offset package, amongst other things, would be in place to support them.

It means we go to them, have discussion sessions where they hang out after school, or where they seek recreation. We should also be open to implement meaningful ideas generated from the discussions. This could encourage more mature and constructive discussions in the youths here.

Many have voiced their views on this matter. Clearly, discussions about the Budget gave us an opportunity to think about matters that are important to our nation. Will our country continue to survive in the coming years? How can we continue to ensure that our country can still compete internationally in an ever-changing world? What should we do to provide a good life for our children who will inherit this nation from us?",17,436,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00436

2018-02-28-T-011,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"First, it is important for us to think about the long-term impact of each decision made for our country. The Government needs to balance efforts to look after the well-being of the people, with the efforts to ensure that this nation stays strong for future generations. Therefore, we must understand the need to increase the rate of GST to achieve long-term benefits. We need to be prepared for a rainy day.",19,438,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00438

Various suggestions may have been raised, but all of them will have an impact on the nation’s assets. There are those who rejected the increase in the GST, but in the same breath, they asked the Government to enhance social assistance measures.

We must be open-minded, work hard to acquire new knowledge and upgrade our skills. We need to pay attention to our children’s education, so that they will not be left behind in this current of rapid change. In this regard, I welcome Mendaki’s efforts to enhance our community’s education.

The convergence of these two shifts, indeed the shifting of the global economic weight to Asia and the emergence of new technologies, in which the Fourth Industrial Revolution is taking place in the region stretching from South Asia to Northeast Asia through Southeast Asia. For the first time in modern history, the Asian economies combined are developing more robustly than Western economies.

The opening up of China to global capitalism by Deng Xiaoping also opened up the minds of the Chinese people to the world. Many overseas Chinese talents returned from the developed countries of the West to China, bringing with them the knowledge and culture to advance China’s science and technology. The political will to succeed and the hunger of the Chinese people to learn and live better lives fuelled rapid economic development. China is fast becoming an economic and military superpower.",4,447,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00447
2018-02-28-T-011,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"Singapore has thrived in the past 50 years by making ourselves useful to global capitalism, especially by correctly identifying future trends before others do. We made ourselves useful to American-led capitalism in Southeast Asia and East Asia during the Cold War and, in the process, helped to transform ASEAN from a political grouping into an aspiring economic community. In the last three decades, Singapore correctly predicted the rise of China and was one of the first countries to share the know-how of economic development with China. We have reaped a lot of benefits from this first-mover advantage.",5,448,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00448
2018-02-28-T-011,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"But I am afraid this advantage is now irrelevant. China is leading the region to become the centre of global capitalism. Global-Asia also means competitive pressures and realities, especially when the value chain of global production in the region diversifies even as the value chain re-orients to centre on China. China’s One Belt One Road Initiative expresses this, with the many lines of economic flow being re-imagined and re-organised as starting from China and extending in different directions westwards, southwards and northwards.",6,449,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00449

2018-02-28-T-011,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"In the past 50 years, Singaporeans’ ability to speak English well has contributed to fostering our relationships with Western countries at the centre of global capitalism in the region. We have a new challenge today. There is a unique ethnic connection between Chinese Singaporeans and the Chinese in China due to ancestral and linguistic ties. But many people have observed that this kinship advantage is fading fast as China modernises.",8,451,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00451

I would even go further to argue we should also learn our dialects as well. In China, speaking Mandarin ‒ Putong Hua ‒ is just the official language in official dealings. If one would like to connect better to the Chinese, not just rationally, but also affectionately, then the language to use is the local dialect.",9,452,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00452

The Chinese language is, today, one of the most popular languages being learned by people all over the world. Chinese culture is fast becoming less a scholarly curiosity but more a tool of soft power today. This has helped perhaps some Chinese-educated Singaporeans feel that they are finally freed of the feeling of inferiority. They are excited that the so-called ""Sick man of Asia"" has now been fully awakened with the full force of 5,000 years of rich Chinese culture.",12,455,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00455
2018-02-28-T-011,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"However, Sir, many overseas Chinese are also concerned about the intention of China, especially under one-party rule and as a superpower, in her policy and attitude towards weaker states. Will China seek to turn the tables on its experience of European imperialism and become an imperialist power itself?",13,456,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00456
2018-02-28-T-011,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),This is not far-fetched if we consider that Japan did just that in the first half of the 20th Century. Will China revive its old tributary empire and use sharp power to compel small states to submit to its will and pay it the equivalent of tribute today? How China behaves will have serious implications on small states in the region like Singapore in the near future.,14,457,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00457
2018-02-28-T-011,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"I am personally wary of the political ambitions of China as a Global-Asia superpower. I am worried that Singapore, if we are not careful and if we fail in our economic strategy to become a Global-Asia node, would become a pawn on the chessboard of great power games in Southeast Asia.",15,458,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00458
2018-02-28-T-011,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully agree with the Minister for Finance that we must anchor Singapore as a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise. There is a need to transform the Singapore industrial-era mindset and culture to make us relevant and useful to the future economy and contribute to the economic dynamism of the region. But besides focusing on economic opportunities, we should also have the new political scenario in mind while anchoring Singapore as a Global-Asia node. It is important that we see the political economy of the major shifts, instead of just the economic challenges and opportunities.",16,459,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00459
2018-02-28-T-011,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),I appreciate the Government’s vision statements and the articulation of how Singapore should strategically position itself in the new era. This is a forward-looking Budget to anchor Singapore firmly in the future and for the future.,17,460,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00460
2018-02-28-T-011,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"Sir, the unfortunate thing about this Budget is that it is looking forward too hastily for future revenue streams by prematurely announcing the GST hike. This has become an unnecessary distraction from the vision articulated in this Budget, and as a real distraction causing the Government to lose its focus in getting buy-in for the vision because it has to explain the future GST hike instead. Do not let this opportunity to lead Singapore with this vision go to waste.",18,461,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00461
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mr Speaker, the Government is transparent about what it sees on the horizon – that our spending needs will continue to increase due to healthcare expenditures for an ageing population and the need to renew infrastructure.",1,462,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00462
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),Some Members before me have spoken about how they wish more can be done for our seniors about what more can be done to address inequality. We will have to match these needs with the resources that are needed to do so. That is the responsible thing to do. And that is why the Minister for Finance has announced the need to raise GST in the foreseeable future to be able to match this increasing expenditure needs.,2,463,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00463
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"In my speech, I would like to touch on how we grow our economy so that we have more resources, jobs and tax revenues from a more buoyant economy to meet our needs so that we will have more to address the various issues that Members have raised before me.",3,464,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00464
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Second, I would also like to touch on how we ensure Government spending is used effectively and efficiently. This is so that resources collected from the public can be used to best address needs.",4,465,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00465
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mr Low, who has spoken before me, spoke on the importance of leveraging on ideas and new technology. I have a specific suggestion.",5,466,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00466
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),We cannot grow in a vacuum. We need to have contact points into globally innovative cities as so to have global access to ideas and technology. The Minister for Finance and his team have spelt out their plans through the Global Innovation Alliance (GIA) and the ASEAN Innovation Network. I support the GIA and the ASEAN Innovation Network which are ways for us to be plugged into the eco-system of ideas and new technologies.,6,467,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00467
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"We currently have many Singaporeans working and studying in the region, Singaporeans familiar with the venture capital and private equity circuits and Singaporean firms and their partners with investments in these cities. Apart from strengthening our bilingual and bicultural skills, I suggest we more deliberately build our networks and leverage on them to sense-make and get a better grasp of emerging trends in Asia – open platforms to bring in various partners to widen our reach and understanding of new developments and establish linkages back into Singapore to provide more opportunities for business and partnerships.",7,468,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00468
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Second, we should invest in priority areas which are central to our economy and which can also develop new adjacent avenues of growth.",8,469,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00469
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Our aviation and maritime industries today account for 10% of GDP and close to 170,000 jobs. Our mega investments in Changi Airport Terminal 5 and Tuas Megaport will continue to build on these strategic sectors. Our investments in these sectors can provide us a strong platform to develop new avenues of growth if we continuously reassess what the most valued part of the sector is.",9,470,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00470
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Data and the use of data for instance have emerged as a change agent for many industries and spawned new businesses and business models. For airports and ports, there is a lot of data from the travellers and trade that pass through our shores. Can this data be monetised? For instance, can we create our own global online travel company given the amount of data we have about the preferences of travellers? We can also leverage on data to market to travellers even after they have left our shores.",10,471,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00471
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),The Aviation and Maritime Transformation Programme described in this year's Budget thus build on our capabilities in the airport and seaport. We should challenge ourselves to mine these sectors for new development opportunities.,11,472,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00472
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Third, we should equip our people and our companies to take advantage of new opportunities. Continuous skills upgrading is thus critical. Skills upgrading allows workers at different stages of their work life to catch up on skills gaps which, if left unaddressed, could lead to long-term income gaps.",12,473,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00473
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Skills upgrading and training has thus been a key initiative in successive Budget plans. I would like to suggest that to maximise outcomes from training, that we encourage company-based training as training initiated, envisaged and monitored by companies are most closely tied to market needs. Further, to ensure that our young Singaporeans are ready for the workforce, I would like to suggest that internships be made available to all youths above 18 years old from the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). Internships can provide youths a reality check on the skills needed for the workforce and complement the education they receive from the IHLs.",13,474,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00474
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Lastly, I support the Capability Transfer Programmes that are being piloted in certain specialised fields. This is used, for instance, to bring in experts in data analytics, machine learning and AI to facilitate the transfer of specialised knowledge to our local professionals in fintech. This is timely help for our companies and industries which are facing skillset gaps in certain important fields.",14,475,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00475
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),I would next like to discuss how we can ensure that Government spending is used effectively and efficiently.,15,476,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00476
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Monies collected could have been left in our citizens' pockets, as their personal savings or for their own care for their families. I appreciate the value-for-money initiatives the Minister for Finance explained in his Budget speech and acknowledge that at 19% of GDP, our Government expenditures are prudent comparatively. However, I hope that Government agencies can constantly challenge themselves to manage costs while delivering good quality services. I have three micro-level implementation suggestions.",16,477,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00477
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"First, Government agencies should always strive to negotiate the best deal with suppliers when it comes to Government procurement for the benefit of taxpayers. For instance, with the need to build more healthcare facilities for an ageing population, there is scope for economies of scale via centralised procurement of hospital supplies, equipment and IT software. And as the country steps up public renewal works, there is scope to demand discover what various agencies are procuring and if there are overlaps which allow more streamlined purchasing and better leverage.",17,478,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00478
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),A well-thought through centralised procurement process may go beyond simple demand aggregation to require standardisation of product needs across institutions. I hope that the Ministry of Finance can look into this actively to ensure that we are not being charged different prices across different institutions. DSTA and SUSS recently launched a certificate in procurement for public servants. I hope more will be trained through such a programme.,18,479,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00479
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Second, I will like to stress the importance of assessing asset purchases via a life-cycle approach so that costs are managed over the entire life-cycle of the asset. This is especially important when we look at assets that have a long life-cycle like lifts and rail parts which are intended to last 25 to 30 years. Cashflow projections should take into account their maintenance costs and life-span of their replacement parts.",19,480,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00480
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Given the challenges in projecting cashflows, in-house expertise may be required to make a fair assessment. Government agencies, such as the HDB for instance, should consider having businesses such as EMS develop lift expertise so that they are able to make a reasoned assessment on the costs of maintenance and replacement. In the meantime, greater care and scrutiny need to be put into purchase contracts to bind suppliers to their promises.",20,481,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00481
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Third, I would like to see greater collaboration between the public, private and community sectors to configure resources to deliver optimal outcomes. The Finance Minister described the Community Network for Seniors. I have also seen how private operators, like Grab Shuttle Plus complement our national transport infrastructure by introducing buses to Punggol during off-peak hours and serving residents who stay in less populous areas. And in Gambas, the community came together to buy and share umbrellas rather than spend public monies building a high sheltered linkway which may not provide good cover for residents from the rain.",21,482,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00482
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"We should be open and enthusiastic in encouraging different configurations of public, private, community contributions to deliver optimal outcomes for citizens while minimising the burden on public monies. At the end of the day, everybody wins.",22,483,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00483
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Mr Speaker, no one likes higher taxes. If increased spending is here to stay because we have to take care of our elderly and renew our infrastructure, let us seize the opportunities to grow our economy and revenues, and at the same time, make every tax dollar count. Let us be united in our vision and apply our energies correctly. Only then, can we overcome the challenges we face and create a stronger, better Singapore. Mr Speaker, in Chinese, please.",23,484,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00484
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Mr Speaker, some Members expressed hope that more can be done to help the elderly and the disadvantaged. This Budget is precisely about how to allocate our resources optimally, to create the biggest economic pie to support increasing expenditure, so that we can look after our senior citizens and the disadvantaged effectively. Therefore, I would like to discuss two points.",24,485,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00485
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Firstly, to ensure that our economy continue to prosper, we should be bold in taking advantage of major long term trends to develop new growth opportunities and strengthen the competitiveness of Singapore’s key industries. After decades of hard work, Singapore has made great strides in our ports and aviation industries. These were achieved by our forefathers who were bold to explore in the face of great uncertainty.",25,486,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00486

2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Of course, the value chain of today is very different from 50 years ago.

2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"As people say in Chinese ni shui xing zhou, bu jin ze tui (when you are sailing against the current, you must keep forging ahead, or you will falling behind). We should keep up with the major long term trends and actively pursue new business opportunities in the value chain. For example, investment opportunities in transportation big data, online travel services, and more. Only by doing so, can we stay ahead in the face of global competition.",29,490,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00490
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"To seize opportunities in the major long term trends, we need to link Singapore up with international innovation hubs. This is why I support the Global Innovation Alliance (GIA) programme.",30,491,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00491
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"In addition, I also suggest setting up an international network for Singaporeans under the GIA, so that overseas Singaporeans can also contribute to our development. It is also important to nurture our local talent. We should ensure that both working adults who are currently employed and young people entering the labour market are better able to meet market demand, and that job training programmes are market-driven.",31,492,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00492
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Secondly, with the growing Government expenditure, we must ensure efficiency in Government spending, such that every effort is made to ensure that every dollar contributed by taxpayers is well spent.",32,493,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00493
2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Government revenue comes from taxpayer’s hard-earned money.

2018-02-28-T-011,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"For example, based on the premise of procuring quality products and services, Government agencies should always strive to negotiate for the best deal with suppliers, while achieving economies of scale and reducing procurement costs through centralised procurement and product standardisation.",34,495,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00495

2018-02-28-T-011,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Sir, our Government stated some time ago that it had sufficient funds to meet its public expenditure needs for the current term. That is why the GST increase of 2%, announced in the Budget Statement, does not need to come into effect during this term of Government. As the Prime Minister and his Cabinet colleagues have signalled for some time, our taxes must rise to pay for our future public spending needs.",2,506,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00506
2018-02-28-T-011,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Sir, I am not aware of any government in any part of the world that announces GST increases three to four years ahead of time. Not only does this approach demonstrate our Government’s ability to plan for the long term, it also demonstrates, once again, its integrity. Our Government does what it says it will do. Our Government means what it says. And our Government keeps faith with Singaporeans whom it both represents and serves.",3,507,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00507
2018-02-28-T-011,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"This is, Mr Speaker, Sir, only right and proper. It should and must always be the Singapore norm. But it is by no means the norm elsewhere. Singaporeans can be justly proud of their Government’s record of integrity especially at a time when flip-flopping on policy decisions and policy positions is the order of the day in some countries.",4,508,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00508
2018-02-28-T-011,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Sir, the same integrity is demonstrated in the measures announced in the Budget to benefit Singaporeans. Our Government is fulfilling its role of always acting in the best, long-term interests of Singaporeans. It is right that we invest in our children because they will form the core of our future. It is right that we take measures to help workers stay relevant. It is right that we take measures to respect and help our senior citizens who have contributed so much to making Singapore what it is today. It is right that we square up to and act to increase inclusivity by looking after those less fortunate to reduce income inequality and strengthen community cohesion.",5,509,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00509
2018-02-28-T-011,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"It is also right, Mr Speaker, that public expenditure is governed by the principle of fiscal sustainability. Every citizen understands that whether they manage a household’s accounts or those of a business. To paraphrase Charles Dickens’ character Mr Micawber of David Copperfield  ""Monthly income $5,000, monthly expenditure $4,500, result happiness.

This is eminently preferable to spending our reserves and reducing the very source of net investment returns which contribute so much to this country’s budget revenue.",7,511,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00511
2018-02-28-T-011,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Utilising our reserves as guarantees for loans to fund long-term, large-scale infrastructure projects is both innovative and wise. As the Minister stated in his announcement, this approach should enhance the Singapore Bond Market. The approach is also fairer to all Singaporeans as it spreads the burden of costs across the generations in an equitable manner.",8,512,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00512
2018-02-28-T-011,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Sir, let me now turn to the theme of vision. The Budget Statement demonstrated our Government’s commitment to sustaining a vibrant and innovative economy in two key ways. Firstly, by a range of measures to support our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which form the backbone of any country’s economy. Secondly, by maintaining Singapore’s attractiveness to foreign direct investment (FDI) by keeping taxation competitive. Our SMEs and the FDI which the Economic Development Board (EDB) works tirelessly to attract and retain are two sides of the same coin. Our economy needs both to stay successful.",9,513,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00513
2018-02-28-T-011,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"The focus on sustaining a vibrant and innovative economy is the vital component to ensuring our country’s goals are achieved and, indeed, to ensuring its continued survival. It is only with a vibrant and innovative economy that we can support and defend ourselves. It is only with a vibrant and innovative economy that the little red dot can continue to punch above its weight internationally. It is only with a vibrant and innovative economy that the Singapore passport allows visa-free entry to more countries than most other passports.",10,514,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00514
2018-02-28-T-011,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I think Singapore needs to benchmark itself not only against large developed economies as has been the practice to date but also against other global cities. If we are to do this, we would quickly discover that our rates of economic growth are less than other global cities. I am well aware that other cities do not need to incur big ticket items, such as defence in its Budgets.",11,515,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00515
2018-02-28-T-011,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"However, Sir, for us to ultimately continuously punch above our weight, we need to compare ourselves with what other cities are doing.

2018-02-28-T-011,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Many people here and abroad have complemented Singapore on its industry transformation maps (ITMs). The amount of work which has gone in to producing these ITMs is considerable and very impressive. However, how will they be implemented? My sense, from talking with businesses is that there may well be a gap of understanding as to which ITM is relevant to them and what they should be doing. This is an opportunity for Government and businesses to deepen their existing collaboration and roll out targeted, quality communication on ITM execution. The communication model could be that of the excellent quality of communication from MOF’s team for this year’s Budget.",13,517,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00517

As the Minister said in his Budget Statement, by 2030, we will have 900,000 Singaporeans aged 65 and above. These facts are a cause for concern. They certainly are of concern for our SMEs which provide most jobs for Singaporeans and for those businesses which invest in Singapore and which also provide jobs for Singaporeans.",15,519,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00519

The environment in which children cram or are hothoused for better grades should be changed to a “push-frontier” environment, in which children challenge each other by creating problems and by devising solutions to those problems, an environment in which children are challenged with different risk permutations and are allowed to grapple with defective or inadequate responses. Simulations of real-life scenarios in which they analyse, brainstorm, role play and make judgement calls. Instead of clearly-defined experiments within each subject, students could be challenged to use a combination of their knowledge and skills across subjects to achieve certain outcomes.",25,632,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00632

Be brutal in cutting waste and inefficiencies. Encourage innovative ways to raise productivity. I do not advocate starving the public services of much needed resources to do their jobs properly.

One big irony of Budget 2018 is that we report a surplus of $9.6 billion, even as we make an advance announcement of an increase in GST to raise revenue. I understand from the Finance Minister that this is an exceptional surplus, and we cannot always count on having exceptional surpluses. Still, could we, say, direct this surplus and any others in future, into a fund separate from the reserves, perhaps find ways to invest it to build it further, to fund our increased needs, and hence defer any GST hike to a later date?",7,695,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00695

I believe Singaporeans will understand the rationale and trade-offs for raising GST, however painful it is for our citizens, provided that the Government works very hard to deliver on promises and proves that every revenue dollar raised is efficiently and effectively used for the public good.

In the past, if seniors have needs or encounter issues requiring our assistance, we have to approach the agencies one by one and be subjected to their available resources, which is time consuming. Most of the time, it would be extremely challenging to get a common date that the agencies can agree on. Moreover, some agencies may not have sufficient resources or provide the right type of help.

There is a call by IMF for more room to install more growth-friendly, inclusive, strong and prudent fiscal policies around the world.

This report states that in a rapidly sharing economy, a ""network orchestra"" model that provides platforms to bring partners together for transactions and collaborations is almost now a new normal.

I am delighted, for example, that senior care services will be led by a single Ministry, MOH, to ""enable these services to be planned and delivered holistically"".",8,812,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00812
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"An eminently sensible first step, Mr Deputy Speaker, as those of us who are care-givers to elderly parents and relatives will acknowledge. Let me share a personal experience, if I may, about the role of caretakers of the elderly, which extends beyond their medical or palliative care alone.",9,813,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00813
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"I was one such care-giver to a grand aunt and a grand uncle. The face of a care-giver is usually seen through a child. But increasingly given that one in four Singaporeans by the year 2030, as we know, is going to be above the age of 65. And soon many of us will not just have elderly parents or grandparents, we will also have extended families who deserve and need urgent medical care but increasingly financial assistance.",10,814,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00814
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"One such example in my case is with my grand aunt and grand uncle. They are fortunate because there are quite a few members around but they do not have children of their own. So, they turned to family members who do not live with them. They have an extremely good Town Council in a mature HDB estate where they live. They have a Member of Parliament whom they greatly respect and admire whom I shall not name, in case I am playing favourites.",11,815,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00815
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"But I will say is that after numerous visits to the HDB office to talk about how to talk about reverse mortgages and a sell-back package which is both financially beneficial for them in the next years in their twilight years ‑ they are both above the age of 85 ‑ there is one question that breaks the heart and that question is when they asked a grand nephew  ""What happens if I live beyond the 15 years that has been promised in my last lease I can take?""",12,816,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00816
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"It is especially hard and tough to swallow because this is the third house they have gone through because of rightsizing. As an example, they had not planned for their financial retirement. So, every time they needed money, the one asset they would use would be the one that is over their head. So, you sell your house and use the income that you have for the next few years.",13,817,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00817
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"How many Singaporeans may be in the same boat but may not have the same kind of Member of Parliament who would sit down with them and explain to them what they could do, or may not have family members who are either legally trained or professionally trained to guide them over the next steps. This is the question that troubles me, Mr Deputy Speaker. I think this is something that we should be thinking about.",14,818,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00818
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),As we look at the next steps beyond our elderly ‑ and I firmly believe and I support the welfare-centric Budget that Minister Heng has put before us ‑ but I do think and I will speak about this in a moment that we have to spend more time communicating the importance of such a Budget to Singaporeans.,15,819,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00819
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"When we speak to my fellow Singaporean friends, colleagues, a question that has emerged with this year’s Budget speech and it has been repeated time and time again is  ""Why are we tightening the purse strings now?"" This is a natural question, Mr Deputy Speaker, because we have done so remarkably well this Financial Year. And I must record my thanks at this point to beyond everyone else, the Jurong Town Corporation and Monetary Authority of Singapore.",16,820,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00820
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"Yes, it may be one-off. It may not ever happen again. But the question still comes  when we are not combating a deficit, why are we tightening the purse strings? Is it because we fear that our small and open economy is vulnerable to fluctuations in the global economy and financial markets? Of course, it is. But this is not new to us. We are accustomed to Singapore and its limitations as a low-lying, small island state.",17,821,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00821
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"What stands out, to me, in this Budget that Minister Heng has put before us, is that it does not seem to be driven only by fears. And this, I celebrate. On the contrary, there is a savvy inherent in his proposed measures. Minister Heng suggests, for example, that Government Ministries, much like private enterprises, will need to look for more productive and innovative ways to run their own agencies. Simply put, they should adopt a corporate work ethic. He does not use these words, but it is inherent in the Budget speech. That there should be this corporate work ethic and innovation that should be infused within Government-owned infrastructure companies, for example, government agencies to ensure very much with infrastructure companies, very much like how private companies fund acquisition and expansion, so should our Statutory Boards and infrastructure companies.",18,822,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00822
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"Mr Deputy Speaker, many professionals and business persons will see the merit of Minister Heng’s financial plan and they actually welcome it. But I do ask this  how will this message be communicated from this point onwards to the non-professionals, to the non-business people, to everyday Singaporeans who would have to deal with the direct taxation that will be coming in 2021 to 2025?",19,823,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00823
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"Beyond adopting a corporate culture, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Government has a solemn responsibility to explain, in plain and practical terms, how these taxes tomorrow will benefit us, our elderly and our children in further time to come.",20,824,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00824
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"The Government may wish to explain why Singaporeans should go from maintaining their own parents alone, which is their current social and legal compact, to assisting with the maintenance of the nation’s elderly as a whole?",21,825,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00825
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"The Government should explain whether Singapore will continue to be a ""liveable"" city if we are consistently ranked amongst the most expensive cities in the world.",22,826,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00826
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"Is there a real likelihood, many have asked me, on the current projections as to whether the GST could be further raised beyond 2021 if, despite prudent spending, and the ""save and borrow"" scheme and the policy we have for infrastructure projects, new gaps emerge?",23,827,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00827
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"If there are new gaps, will the Government then think about revising upwards the current GST as an example? If the answer is, which I imagine it should be, ""well, yes, it will be reviewed from time to time"", the recurrent question that Singaporeans will ask, and they will ask it now is  why not rely a little more heavily, not completely, but a little more heavily on the Net Investment Returns Contributions? Why can they not be increased to finance our needs? This will come back again and again every time there is an increase in GST, and in any other tax. Alternatively, they will ask ""should we not have more progressive wealth taxes""? So, the best way to deal with this now when we are planning for 2021, is to speak to Singaporeans at this point.",24,828,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00828
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"In all honesty, Mr Deputy Speaker, the questions and clarifications that I am raising, while directed at Minister Heng and the Ministry of Finance, really are at the Government as a whole, because they warrant a broader conversation. Singaporeans’ concerns over public expenditure are real, and they need to be heard, if possible, so that they can be addressed. They need to be heard in a context where this message can be unpacked.",25,829,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00829
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"And I say ""unpacked"" because I enjoyed the healthy debate that we had today. The clarification over inequality and inequity ‒ that is interesting to me. But that is because I am an academic, Mr Deputy Speaker. That is because I am legally trained, and that is because of the people who spoke. I know from my own experience that two of them are expert Junior College debaters and one is a really good lawyer. That is the instinct, Mr Deputy Speaker. But what about every other Singaporean?",26,830,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00830
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"Minister Heng mentioned in his speech that “Our Singapore Conversation"" in 2011 or 2012, if I remember, gave him a window into what Singaporeans were thinking at that time. It gave him a unique opportunity, in his words, ""to converse with Singaporeans about their aspirations for themselves and for Singapore”.",27,831,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00831
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"As a member of that Committee, together with many other people in this House, I would affirm the value of the OSC as a participatory process, and I would ask the Government to take measures to ensure that new dialogues could signal some semblance of ""participatory budgeting"". These conversations would perhaps be by the Ministries individually with groups that have relevant concerns  where persons, Singaporeans, are given a sense that their views matter and could one day help determine how public finances are spent and how Budgets are implemented; where it is made plain that welfare-centric expenditure tracks demographic trends. We have heard this, and I believe it to be true, as I am experiencing it as a caregiver.",28,832,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00832
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"But this has to be explained to people, who may not have the same burdens or the same considerations on their mind all the time, beginning with the needy aged. So, that is the first demographic trend that we have all agreed on. But in time to come, I am sure there will be other demographic trends which require our welfare-centric concern. Singaporeans are not fully accustomed to responding to these welfare-centric trends, and we should take the time to explain the importance of doing so.",29,833,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00833
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"Traditionally, Mr Deputy Speaker, socio-economic issues have fallen solely within the remit of the Government and, sometimes, through civil society. But going beyond this, surely our corporate citizens also have a role to play, and they should be giving back in some way or the other.",30,834,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00834
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"Just as Singaporeans are asked to give back to society, I therefore welcome initiatives that encourage corporate giving. But I would ask that beyond the Business and IPC Partnership Scheme, the Ministry could consider a national action plan on corporate social responsibility. To prosper over time, corporations should not only deliver financial performance but should also see how they could make a positive societal contribution.",31,835,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00835
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"Just as the Public Service in Singapore is being encouraged to adopt, as I have mentioned earlier, a corporate ethic and culture to ""do well’, corporations, too, should be encouraged, Mr Deputy Speaker, or perhaps even required to adopt the core culture of the Public Service – that is, an unstinting commitment to ""do good"" in the public interest.",32,836,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00836
2018-02-28-T-011,Mahdev Mohan,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, as we look forward to the next generation of this nation’s political leadership, Singaporeans want to be in safe hands. To be led by a team, by people whom they can trust to understand the financial opportunities, brace for the headwinds that may lie ahead, but, above all, who have Singaporeans’ welfare and contentment chief in their minds and in their hearts.",33,837,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00837

2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, this year's Budget is flexible. It is clinical in its approach to dealing with what Singapore needs in the future. It is not bogged down with theoretical purity. It is relevant and bold. It provides assistance to those who need it most. It does not discourage prosperity nor does it discourage diligence. It allows Singapore to remain competitive.",1,842,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00842
2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In short, this years’ Budget is ambidextrous ‒ a mix of left- and right-leaning policies. It shows that we are not concerned as much about theoretical purity as we are about doing what is correct in each circumstance.",2,843,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00843
2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, unbridled capitalism, as well as extreme socialism, are to be avoided. Both have negative effects on populations.",3,844,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00844
2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"There are problems with either extremes in economic theories. From the now-dissolved USSR, we can see that there is a problem with socialism in the form of Marxist Communism. Even in China, we see the need for exceptions to socialism in the form of free economic zones in Shenzhen and other designated cities and the Special Administrative Region in Hong Kong. Today, Shenzhen is known as the Silicon Delta. Hence, even socialism needs exceptions to survive.",4,845,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00845
2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"On the other extreme, we see the breakdowns of pure capitalism ‒ unbridled capitalism. According to David Korten, extreme capitalism has the same problems as that of extreme Marxist socialism. For example, economic power concentrates in unaccountable centralised institutions – the state, in the case of Marxism; and the transnational corporation, in the case of capitalism. The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer. This is because those who control wealth accumulate it at a faster rate than the economy can produce it. This trend continues, unless something disrupts the status quo.",5,846,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00846
2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Muller, the author of ""The Mind and the Market  Capitalism in Western Thought"" says it this way  “Inequality is an inevitable product of capitalist activity...Indeed, one of the most robust findings of contemporary social scientific inquiry is that as the gap between high-income and low-income families has increased, the educational and employment achievement gaps between the children of these families has increased even more.”",6,847,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00847
2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Hence, pure, unbridled capitalism has its problems ‒ that of extreme, entrenched income divides.",7,848,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00848
2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Therefore, what we need in Singapore is to have a flexible fiscal policy. We cannot be rigid or be slaves to fiscal ideology just for ideology’s sake. And this is, in my view, what this Budget seeks to achieve. Financial analyst Ram Ramesh wrote in the Trinidad Express and he expresses it this way  “Labels such as socialism and capitalism are making men in power forget that their role is to administer the right medicine regardless of what label it carries… In these times, it is not the philosophical underpinnings that will guarantee [organisations'] survival but their own ability to adapt to the rapidly changing economic landscapes. Not adapting can cause them their very survival.”",8,849,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00849
2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In other words, when we are too inflexible, we are unable to respond to changing situations. When we are too concerned about avoiding a certain label or fitting into a particular mould, we tie ourselves to a deadweight and we lose. Therefore, what we need is a flexible approach – an economic policy for our time, for our future, and for the best for Singapore. An array of fiscal options should be on the table with one caveat – that our foundations do not change. What are these foundations?",9,850,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00850
2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"One, a strong military. Two, securing our water supply. Three, stewardship, that is, making difficult national decisions today for the sake of a better future tomorrow. Four, freedom of religion. Five, education.",10,851,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00851
2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"There are more foundations, but, to me, these are among the most crucial.",11,852,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00852
2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Therefore, what we need is a flexible fiscal policy anchored onto unshakeable foundations but without a single-minded fixation on theoretical purity. Dr Goh Keng Swee was known for being a practical economist, doing what works and not necessarily aiming for theoretical purity in economics. An example is in how he “envisioned an important role for the state–government promotion of public goods and externalities… through institutions [such] as the Economic Development Board (EDB) and the Jurong Town Corporation (JTC)” while being “for the most part… a believer in the efficacy of the markets and the private enterprise system.”",12,853,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00853
2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"This illustrates how we should not be afraid to try less popular policies and be free to think out of the box.

In short, this years’ Budget is ambidextrous, as I have said, a mix of left- and right-leaning policies. On the one hand, we have policies leaning towards the left. And, on the other hand, we have policies leaning towards the right. As regard the left, the increase in GST will be implemented in a way that tries to ease the extra burden on lower income families ‒ the permanent GST Voucher scheme will be increased and offset packages will help families adjust to the increase. The Budget also looks to render more support for healthcare and education by having more meal coverage for Secondary school students under the Schools Meal Programme and increasing the merit bursary quantum for Pre-University students. There is also a review on subsidising premiums to ElderShield for the lower and middle income to keep healthcare affordable.",14,855,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00855
2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"We are doing all this while also retaining and preserving some right-leaning policies – for example, personal income tax was not increased.

Indeed, this Budget continues to subsidise business costs, employers and business owners through the continuation of the Wage Credit Scheme, the enhanced and extended Corporate Income Tax Rebate, and the Productivity Solutions Grant.",15,856,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00856
2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),This is why I view the budget as a strategic fiscal plan to meet the needs of Singapore and Singaporeans present and future.

2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"If I heard correctly, Mr Singh mentioned that he is unable to support the GST hike at this point in time.

2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Therefore, the real query for us to answer is this  why are we announcing now a hike that is to take place three years or more from today?

2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"One, healthcare for all Singaporeans, including those who helped to build Singapore, the budget for Ministry of Health has grown from $4 billion in 2010 to $10 billion this year, to ""at least"" $13 billion from 2020. This includes expanding healthcare infrastructure, such as public hospital, community hospital and nursing home capacity; enhanced subsidies for specialised outpatient clinics, as well as intermediate and long-term care and subsidies on premiums on MediShield Life. This also accommodates longer life expectancy and an ageing population.",19,860,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00860

There is even more need to ""take action"" and strengthen our security and defence in the face of ""turbulent geopolitics"" and the threat of a terror attack at its highest. In 2010, spending by MHA, Mindef and MFA on security was $14.8 billion and has since increased to $19.5 billion on security in 2016 – 32%, amounting to about a quarter of the national budget. More cameras are being installed. Video Trawling and Analytics System to detect track and recognise faces is being developed; and officers are being trained with simulations and are being equipped with pistols that can hold more bullets. Further, all MHA departments are expected to be housed at a single complex by 2023 for better coordinated responses in a crisis.",20,861,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00861

To help everyone reach his or her potential, expenditure per child has increased. This starts even at a young age. By 2020, spending on a pre-school sector will be at $1.7 billion per year. It is a colossal task to give every child a good foundation from a younger age, especially pre-school. But, we are doing just that. We are also rolling out programmes to increase financial literacy, digital skills in helping mid-career Singaporeans reskill and upskill in the changing economic landscape.",21,862,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00862

And we are being upfront with the people we serve – that is honest politics. That is why I disagree with Mr Low's position that we should not have disclosed the future GST increase now so as to get ""buy-in"" for the broader vision of this Budget. But my counter is this. We cannot conceal from the people we serve that this revenue will be needed in three or more years. That is transparent politics.",22,863,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00863

2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mr Singh also mentioned that we keep on piling accolades on people at the top. That took me by surprise and I would like to respond to that point because the statement goes against a lot of what I and many in this House stand for.

Recently, he shared with me that the family has secured a HDB loan and they will be moving to a flat they can call their own. So, he would be a homeowner.",25,866,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00866
2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"It reminds me of another family – single mother who works as a security guard to raise her family, living in a rental flat. We worked hard to piece together and appealed to HDB for her to purchase her own HDB flat. The approval was given. I should say thank you to HDB for that, and she is now a homeowner. We both celebrated when we heard the news. That is upward mobility. That is social mobility.",26,867,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00867
2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"How could that happen? Flexible economic policies. Caring for the lower income and at the same time, being business-friendly so that the economy thrives. And being honest with the people we serve, about Singaporeans' future needs and how to meet them.",27,868,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00868
2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mr Pritam Singh has suggested using the revenue raised from land sales to fund expenditure. In particular, Mr Singh suggested a cap on the amount of earnings that can be used such as not more than 20% of the value of average land sales over 20 years or 20% of land sales for that year, whichever is lower.",28,869,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00869
2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The point here is that we do not want to build in a formula which promotes indiscriminate or rash sales of land to increase revenue for immediate spending. The suggestion on 20% of land sales for that year does not solve that issue; neither would value of average land sales over 20 years resolve that issue as, one, land sales revenue can fluctuate over a long period of time; and two, even if it is pegged the average land sales over 20 years, this average can be pushed upward each year to more and more sales.",29,870,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00870
2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Hence, instead of building in a formula who promotes possible indiscriminate quick sales of land to increase revenue for immediate spending, it is more fiscally prudent to allow land sales to form part of the reserves and then investing those reserves to achieve healthy NIRC.",30,871,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00871
2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Ms Sylvia Lim is of the view that because the reversionary title of 10 or 99-year leases return to the Government, land sales is not one-off, that we can use the revenue from land sales and not put all of that in our reserves.",31,872,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00872
2018-02-28-T-011,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The point is not that the reversionary lease returns to the Government but that the reversionary lease only returns to the Government 100 years later or 10 years later and you would have spent the income from the sales this year. This does not lend itself to financial prudence. It is better to treat revenue generated from land sales as reserves, invest it and use the net income from it up to 50%.",32,873,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00873

I thought the most important part of this Budget is anchoring Singapore. I am not saying that revenue is not important but GST is not part of the Budget measures at this Budget. So, I thought it would be better that you announce the intended GST increase of two percentage points at another time. We can then have a full debate here. Thus I wonder whether it is better to announce it separately and have a debate here, or to debate it at the Budget.",1,886,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00886

What we are saying, and we are questioning whether or not, is there any other avenue to look at instead of raising GST because it affects a lot of people. We are looking at whether there are possibilities of other revenue. Some Members of Parliament have spoken about it. And I think we can explore it. We can have a full debate on this.",2,887,2018-02-28-T-011-S-00887

2018-02-28-T-014,Khaw Boon Wan,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"When assessing the need for a pedestrian crossing, LTA evaluates whether the crossing would enhance connectivity to key amenities and major transport nodes, and also takes into account factors such as traffic volume and road geometry. If providing an at-grade pedestrian crossing would be dangerous or cause serious traffic congestion, LTA will consider other types of crossing facilities such as pedestrian overhead bridges or underpasses.",2,905,2018-02-28-T-014-S-00905
