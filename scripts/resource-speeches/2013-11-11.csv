While TIP can affect anyone, it mainly involves women and young children. Singapore is seen as an attractive destination by human trafficking syndicates due to the perception of potential monetary gains.",1,2,2013-11-11-T-001-S-00002

In terms of prevention, our tight border control measures deter perpetrators from trafficking persons into Singapore. Frontline officers are trained to identify victims. Raising public awareness is another key thrust of prevention. In January this year, the Task Force established a grant of up to $80,000 per year to co-fund public awareness initiatives.

Working with strategic partners to multiply our efforts on the ground is another limb of Singapore's anti-trafficking strategy. At the international level, we partner other countries – whether source, transit or destination – to break the vicious cycle in human trafficking. This includes joint efforts to tackle organised crime that profit from the exploitation of the vulnerable. Indeed, while Singapore has worked hard and continue to do so, source countries, too, have the responsibility to uplift conditions so that their citizens will not have to resort to desperate and risky ventures.

2013-11-11-T-001,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Senior Minister of State for the response. I believe there should be zero tolerance for human trafficking, especially the trafficking of minors. What is needed is a dedicated piece of legislation to criminalise the trafficking of persons and minors for the purpose of sexual exploitation, forced incarceration, slave labour and forced organ trafficking. Such legislation will enhance Singapore's arsenal to combat trafficking in and through Singapore.",1,18,2013-11-11-T-001-S-00018

I have brought it here today, in Parliament. It is a ""work in progress"" and I wanted to know whether there can be some collaboration from the Government.",2,19,2013-11-11-T-001-S-00019
2013-11-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I thank the Member for advocating for more measures to deter human trafficking. We are also supportive of his suggestion to introduce a private Member's Bill. This is, indeed, a commendable effort. I have mentioned earlier that a dedicated law is, indeed, important and is an essential progression in our fight against trafficking in persons (TIP). I am, therefore, happy to support the Member's initiative and will ask the Task Force to work closely with him to co-develop the Bill.",1,20,2013-11-11-T-001-S-00020
2013-11-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"All of us know that this would be a major undertaking as TIP issues cut across many Ministries and agencies. We require many consultations with various stakeholders. Not only do we need to ensure that this new law addresses the substantive TIP issues fully, we will also need to examine issues relating to the administration of the new law, taking reference from international conventions like the UN TIP Protocol. We then have to adapt what is relevant for us.",2,21,2013-11-11-T-001-S-00021

2013-11-11-T-001,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"Mdm Speaker, just one more supplementary question. The process cuts through various areas of enforcement, for example, MHA for enforcement and investigation, Immigration because it is cross-border, MOH because of the need to deter exploitation and trafficking in terms of organs, as well as MSF because we need to see what we can do for victims. So, I hope that the Senior Minister of State's response really is to allow me to work with all of these different Government departments, in addition to a public consultation with NGOs, VWOs and Singaporeans of the same value and who are like-minded. I would just like that confirmation from the Senior Minister of State.",1,23,2013-11-11-T-001-S-00023

2013-11-11-T-001,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, I am delighted to hear that there are plans for a dedicated legislation and that the Member, Mr de Souza, is also prepared to work with the Ministry on this proposed legislation. Is there a target date for this legislation to be ready? And until that legislation is ready, what can the Ministry do in the meantime with regard to Special Passes which are issued to persons who are deemed to have been trafficked? I think one problem is that the Special Pass does not provide them with adequate financial support and that could compromise the investigation process. It does not provide for adequate counselling.",1,25,2013-11-11-T-001-S-00025

2013-11-11-T-001,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member),"Finally, the Senior Minister of State spoke of the National Plan of Action. I would appreciate it if he could also articulate some of the tangible outcomes.",3,27,2013-11-11-T-001-S-00027
2013-11-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"There are many questions and I may lose track of them, so please correct me if I do not address any of the questions. Firstly, on the Special Pass, this is, indeed, one of the issues, not only for the purpose of prosecuting and helping in the investigations, it also helps out the victims. We have to balance the need for both. This is something the Task Force has to continue to look at to see from the number of cases that we are looking at, whether these are, indeed, adequate. Over time, we will evolve the processes to ensure that the protection of the victims is adequately given, either by the Government or by the NGOs with which we work.",1,28,2013-11-11-T-001-S-00028
2013-11-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Secondly, on the artistes' passes, indeed, as both Mr de Souza and I have mentioned, these offences involving trafficking in persons are broad. They involve all kinds of offences and they involve all kinds of Ministries. Over time, as we plug one area, new areas will tend to come up. We are aware of these issues, and when they come up, we will certainly address them within whatever current and existing legislations that are available to us and, in the future, with the new legislation that will be tabled.",2,29,2013-11-11-T-001-S-00029
2013-11-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,And I did not get the third question.,3,30,2013-11-11-T-001-S-00030

2013-11-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"As we have mentioned, the complexity of this Bill is not only that it would involve many Ministries, it also involves addressing the issues that are raised at international fora. We have to include all the concerns that are raised either against us or what we have not done adequately, and also to cover as many loopholes that will possibly appear in the future so that this Bill will be robust.",1,32,2013-11-11-T-001-S-00032
2013-11-11-T-001,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I do not foresee this coming up very quickly. We have to do consultations. We have given ourselves a timeline of within a year to table this Bill. The National Task Force has already been in place. Even before the Task Force came into action, many of the offenders have been put to book. Currently, there are about less than 100 complaints. We have already put about six of them through prosecution and through the Courts and they have been convicted, but there are others that are still in the process of investigation.",2,33,2013-11-11-T-001-S-00033
2013-11-11-T-002,Lily Neo,Dr Lily Neo,asked the Minister for Transport whether more help can be provided to needy families to cope with public transport costs.,1,34,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00034
2013-11-11-T-002,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for Transport how can public transport be made more affordable and attractive given the Ministry's intention to raise public transport ridership to 70% by 2020.,1,35,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00035
2013-11-11-T-002,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Transport whether concessionary fares or higher subsidies for public transport can be provided to disabled Singaporeans upon an application by them.,1,36,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00036
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Mdm Speaker, there have been a number of questions and suggestions by Members during today's Parliament sitting as well as past sittings on the affordability of public transport fares and concessions. Since the release of the report by the Fare Review Mechanism Committee (FRMC), this has also been an issue of much public discussion. I feel, therefore, that I should give a more comprehensive reply in responding to the three Parliamentary Questions by also addressing the various recommendations by FRMC.",1,37,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00037
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"But before I do so, let me first put on record my deepest appreciation and commendation to FRMC Chairman Mr Richard Magnus and his Committee Members for their tremendous effort in putting together what I consider a very comprehensive —",2,38,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00038
2013-11-11-T-002,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Minister, are you taking all three Parliamentary Questions together? Are you seeking permission for that?",1,39,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00039
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Yes, Mdm Speaker, I am, indeed, taking all three Questions together.",1,40,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00040
2013-11-11-T-002,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,Please proceed.,1,41,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00041
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,I very much appreciate the FRMC Chairman Mr Richard Magnus and his Committee members for their effort in putting together a very comprehensive and balanced report. I do appreciate their efforts to consult widely and to look at the difficult issues of both ensuring commuters' interest in having affordable fares and the long-term financial sustainability of the public transport system.,1,42,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00042
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Reading the report, and also from the generally positive response from the public to the report, I can clearly see that the FRMC has put a lot of ""heart"" into their recommendations, in particular, for a concession framework that better ensures fare affordability for Singaporeans.",2,43,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00043
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"I think it is useful to recap what is the context and purpose of this Committee that I appointed. In June 2012, I asked Mr Richard Magnus to chair a Committee to review and recommend improvements to the public transport fare review mechanism. In February of this year, I further requested the Committee to review the existing public transport concession schemes and propose improvements or new schemes to benefit a wider group of commuters, so that we can help keep down their expenditure on public transport.",3,44,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00044
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"We have studied the report carefully. The FRMC has put together a list of recommendations that meets its Terms of Reference and, in my view, addresses the issue of fare affordability in a comprehensive manner. The Government accepts the FRMC's recommendations in full, including the new fare formula; the fare review mechanism, which includes the proposal to allow for smoothening of fare increases by rolling over part of the fare increases to the following year; and the proposals for new concessions and enhancements to existing schemes. The new fare formula, which is an improvement over the old, was meticulously crafted to better reflect the cost pressures that the PTOs face.",4,45,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00045
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Overall, the report is fair and reasonable and contains a timely reminder that we need to make regular fare adjustments from time to time to ensure that the system is sustainable and workable. Its recommendations will provide the Public Transport Council (PTC) with an enhanced framework to ensure that fares remain affordable across the diverse spectrum of public transport users.",5,46,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00046
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"In February this year, I explained in Parliament that our fare increases over the last few years have been slower than that of comparable cities like Hong Kong and London. For example, London had raised their public transport fares by 6.8% in 2011, 5.6% in 2012, and, in January this year, by 4.2%. Fares in Hong Kong have increased by a total of 13% since 2009, including the latest 2.7% increase in June this year, which was preceded by a 5.4% increase last year. I should add that fares in Singapore were not higher than both cities to begin with.",6,47,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00047
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"In contrast, since 2005 – when the first FRMC had proposed the past fare formula that was valid till 2012 – from 2005 to 2011, which was when our last fare increase took place, public transport fares in Singapore have increased by a cumulative 2.7% or an average of 0.4% per annum. This is despite the fact that there have been significant changes to the cost environment of the public transport operators. For instance, diesel prices have gone up by about 90%, while national average wages have gone up by about 30% over the same period.",7,48,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00048
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"In short, fares have not kept pace with increases in operating costs. To the FRMC's credit, they did not duck this issue and have recognised the need for some discipline in ensuring that we have reasonably regular fare adjustments to keep our public transport system financially sustainable.",8,49,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00049
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"That said, we would like to assure Mr Gan Thiam Poh that we remain fully committed to ensuring that public transport fares remain affordable. Wages over the past few years have gone up at a much faster rate than fares, which means that fares have actually become more affordable for the average commuter. This is an important point that I would like to emphasise  public transport fares for the average commuter have become more affordable, not less.",9,50,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00050
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"However, we do recognise that there are certain commuter groups who would still be in need of help. That is why I had asked the FRMC to also study the affordability of public transport for Singaporeans of different income levels and various special groups who may need assistance should fares be raised. I am, therefore, pleased that the FRMC has come up with several useful recommendations, which we have decided to accept.",10,51,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00051
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The FRMC has recommended that Government implement and fund two new concession schemes. One, for persons with disabilities (PWDs) and the other, for low-income workers (LIWs). I am pleased to inform Mr Christopher de Souza and Dr Lily Neo, who have asked for more public transport assistance for disabled and needy Singaporeans that the Government agrees with the FRMC's proposals. We are committed to further strengthening our social safety net on the public transport front. The two new concession schemes for LIWs and PWDs go beyond giving these two groups of Singaporeans ad hoc assistance through Public Transport Vouchers.",11,52,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00052
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"We will, of course, need some time to work out the details of these two concession schemes, including who can apply and how to apply, and the precise concessionary benefits. However, our rough estimate is that about half a million Singaporeans will be eligible for these two new schemes. This would constitute a 40% increase in the number of commuters who currently enjoy various fare concessions, from about 1.2 million currently, to about 1.7 million.",12,53,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00053
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"We have not yet decided on the exact amount of discounts to give to these two groups. However, it is my intention to ensure that the discounts given will more than offset any fare increase in the next fare exercise. So, the discounts that we are going to give to these two groups – the LIWs and the PWDs – will more than offset any fare increase in the next fare exercise.",13,54,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00054
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"What is of the greatest interest to all Members is not so much the new fare formula that is proposed in the FRMC report – although I will touch on it briefly at the end – but instead, what this means for the next fare review exercise – how much will fares increase, and when.",14,55,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00055
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Following the Government's acceptance of the FRMC report, the next task will be for the Public Transport Council (PTC) to apply the new fare formula for the next fare review exercise and consider how to incorporate the FRMC's recommendations on existing concessions. The PTC will need time to go through various deliberations. While it may start the process for the 2013 fare review exercise later this year, its decision and the implementation of the decision will not likely be in 2013, but only in the first half of 2014, for practical reasons.",15,56,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00056
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The PTC will consider the 2012 fare cap that was based on the old formula and which was suspended during the FRMC review, as well as the 2013 fare cap based on the new fare formula. Should the PTC, after careful study, decide not to effect both fare caps in one go, it may allow for part of this to be rolled over, as provided for under the new fare mechanism framework.",16,57,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00057
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Given the intent and spirit of what the FRMC has recommended to smoothen fare increases and ensure fare affordability, I would urge the PTC to consider the possibility that any fare increase for this next round of fare adjustment not exceed the average national wage increase for 2013. This will avoid an outcome where fares suddenly become less affordable for the average commuter. So, what I am suggesting to the PTC is that for this next round of fare increase, that any increase should not exceed the average national wage increase for 2013.",17,58,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00058
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"PTC will, of course, have to decide what exactly the increase will be. That is their prerogative. And as part of the overall package for the coming round of fare adjustments, also look into implementing, in full or in part, the various enhancements to the existing fare concessions as recommended by the FRMC.",18,59,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00059
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"If we add together all these possible changes to the concession schemes, including those to be funded by the Government, the next fare exercise could see a total of about one million commuters actually benefiting in some way. This could include preschoolers, students, including those in the Polytechnics, and also those who may wish to take up the adult and senior citizen monthly passes, which will cap expenditure for heavy public transport users. This is in addition to the low-income workers and persons with disabilities whom I had mentioned earlier. We have to be patient for the details as these are matters on which the PTC will make the call as part of its fare review deliberations.",19,60,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00060
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The PTC should also take into consideration the FRMC's recommendation for the PTOs to make one-off contributions from the fare increase they receive to the Public Transport Fund. Together with the channelling into this Fund the fines that have been incurred by PTOs for regulatory breaches, we will have a sizeable fund which can allow for more generous Public Transport vouchers to be given out to all needy households affected by any fare increase.",20,61,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00061
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Let me next touch on the issue of service quality, as there has been some feedback that this is missing from the FRMC report. Some have suggested that we should suspend fare increases until there is tangible improvement in service levels. I do acknowledge that this is a source of unhappiness for some.",21,62,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00062
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The FRMC has carefully considered this – whether to have a service component in the fare formula – and decided that the issue of service level is best addressed separately outside of the fare formula, where the Government can regulate and work with the operators to improve service levels.",22,63,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00063
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"I think this is sensible and certainly practical in terms of keeping the fare formula relatively straightforward. In addition, we have practical considerations as we have a unified fare structure that is applicable for the entire public transport system, and it would be challenging to try to give differentiated fare increases to different PTOs on account of service quality issues.",23,64,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00064
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"However, not having service quality as part of the new fare formula does not mean that we are not raising service levels, or that we are letting the PTOs off easily. In the 2008 Land Transport Master Plan (LTMP), we explicitly declared our long-term intention to make public transport a mode of choice. This is re-affirmed in our recently launched and refreshed 2013 LTMP.",24,65,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00065
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Shifting commuters away from private to public transport is a strategic imperative, given our land constraints, and to make our city even more liveable. Our aim is to raise the public transport mode share during the peak period from the current 63% to 70% by 2020, and to 75% by 2030. To do so, we know that we have to substantively improve the availability and quality of public transport, and we have already announced many initiatives, both long and short-term.",25,66,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00066
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"For bus commuters, we are accelerating the programme to add 800 buses, or what is going to amount to about a 20% increase, to the bus fleet. In the areas where we have implemented new routes or improved existing services, the benefits are already being felt by commuters.",26,67,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00067
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"For rail, we will be adding more than 100 trains from 2014 over the next three years across all our rail lines. We will also be upgrading the signalling system of the North-South and East-West Lines by 2018 to allow peak hour trains to run at 100-second intervals, instead of 120 seconds currently. We will also be doubling our rail network from 178km to about 360km over the next 15 to 20 years.",27,68,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00068
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"In addition to adding more buses and trains, we have also seen some improvement in the reliability of the rail network. For instance, train withdrawal rates for our oldest North-South and East-West Lines have come down significantly from about four per 100,000 train-kilometres in June 2012 – that means, four withdrawals every 100,000 kilometres travelled – to about 2.3 per 100,000 train-kilometres in September this year.",28,69,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00069
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"We are also raising Operating Performance Standards, increasing penalties and tightening our regulatory framework to ensure that the PTOs deliver higher service levels. Starting next year, the rail operators will be running more train trips throughout the day to bring down waiting times to no more than five minutes for most of the day, even outside the peak period. PTOs will also need to further reduce the number of short service delays below five minutes and strengthen their maintenance regimes to raise reliability levels. We will complement these improvements with stiffer penalties for non-compliance.",29,70,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00070
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"We are, therefore, making significant moves to improve service levels and to realise these improvements as fast as we can. Major improvements will take time but they are on the way. Meanwhile, it is imperative that the public transport system as a whole continues to remain financially viable, with commuters, transport operators and the Government all contributing. Hence, there will still be a need for regular fare increases to keep the system going, to maintain and improve service levels. But in doing so, Members can have my assurance that we will insulate the more vulnerable and needy Singaporeans from the full impact of fare increases.",30,71,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00071
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"So, let me give Members this assurance that while fares are likely to have to go up in the coming years, they will not become less affordable for the average commuter, and, in fact, will be considerably more affordable for the low-income and the disadvantaged groups. This is my intention and I have every confidence that we can achieve it.",31,72,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00072
2013-11-11-T-002,Lily Neo,Dr Lily Neo (Tanjong Pagar),"Mdm Speaker, I am glad that MOT accepts the FRMC's recommendations to give fare concessions to low-income workers, the disabled and Polytechnic students. May I ask the Minister whether the fare concessions can be given as Monthly Concession Passes, especially for the needy and the elderly, instead of the usual one-off transport vouchers? May I ask the Minister how does his Ministry ensure good outreach to assist the targeted groups so that no one falls through the cracks? Lastly, will the Minister consider different fare pricing for Singaporeans, PRs and visitors for our public transport?",1,73,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00073
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mdm Speaker, first, let me thank Dr Lily Neo for her supplementary questions and also for her strong advocacy over the years for the lower income and disadvantaged groups.",1,74,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00074
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"On whether it is monthly passes or ad hoc vouchers, the intent is for the two groups that we have mentioned – the LIWs and the PWDs – to be given a card that will entitle them to the discounted fares. It will not be in the form of vouchers. It will be in the form of a pass.",2,75,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00075
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Secondly, on the point of good outreach, that is really important. Indeed, we would like to encourage all Members in the House to support us in this venture. I recall that in the previous fare exercise in 2011, we made available 200,000 public transport vouchers to try and offset the impact of the fare increase on the most vulnerable groups. Instead of making one call for applications, we actually made two calls. We made two calls for applications. In the end, just over half of the 200,000 vouchers were taken up. I think it is not the situation where we do not have enough vouchers but, really, it is how to reach out to them, how to make sure that they are fully aware of some of these schemes. We will try and do more in terms of the general publicity but I do encourage Members to support us in this.",3,76,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00076
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Finally, with regard to differential pricing, I think it is something that we need to be quite careful about. In fact, already, there is a certain amount of differential pricing because many of the tourists who come in would already be using single-trip tickets, rather than to use the ez-link card. We have, over the years, set the single-trip fares at a different price compared to what you would pay if you were to use your ez-link card for a particular trip, but we are also mindful not to stretch this too far.",4,77,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00077
2013-11-11-T-002,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Thank you, Minister. I have questions specifically on our disabled Singaporeans; that was my Parliamentary Question. So, I will restrict it to that. Are the subsidies envisioned for our disabled Singaporeans distinct from the intent not to have fare increases beyond the NWC wage increase for 2013? Are they distinct concessions that will be given to our disabled Singaporeans?",1,78,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00078
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Yes, that is the intent. For the LIWs and the PWDs, the intent is that, with the next round of fare increase, the discounts given to them will more than offset any fare increase. So, in other words, they will actually see a reduction in their fares.",1,79,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00079
2013-11-11-T-002,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister two supplementary questions. The first is the thinking behind the cost of certain schemes being borne by the Government and certain others being cross-subsidised by the full-fare commuters. And because some of the concession schemes are subsidised by the full-fare commuters, the rate with which these schemes are undertaken will affect the affordability of full-fare commuters. Can the Minister assure us that any future increases would bear this particular point in mind?",1,80,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00080
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"I want to thank Mr Cedric Foo for a very thoughtful question. When I asked the FRMC in February of this year to look at the concession schemes and to see whether we need additional schemes beyond the enhancements to existing schemes, I also asked them to look at the overall affordability how these schemes ought to be paid.",1,81,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00081
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The FRMC, I think, has come up with some very balanced recommendations. To benefit the additional of about half a million people – the LIWs and the PWDs – and to be able to achieve what I have just said in terms of concessions given to them must more than offset any fare increase for this next round, it would entail quite a substantive amount to be invested in these concessions. I think the FRMC realised that if all these were to be cross-subsidised by full-fare paying commuters, it would be a heavy burden on them, bearing in mind that they believe that it is really up to about the 60th, maybe 70th, percentile of Singaporeans that are public transport users. So, the FRMC was conscious of this fact and recommended – and the Government has accepted – that the Government be responsible for the new concession schemes.",2,82,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00082
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"At the same time, the FRMC was also mindful that if all the concession schemes, including the existing ones, were to be borne by the Government, there would be a lack of tension in the system, so to speak. And so they retained the existing mechanism where enhancements to existing schemes would be borne by the rest of the commuters. So, I think there is a certain tension and a certain balance that they are trying to achieve.",3,83,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00083
2013-11-11-T-002,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member),"Madam, I have four supplementary questions. First, will the Minister consider extending concessions to the intellectually-disabled commuters as well, not just physically-disabled commuters?",1,84,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00084
2013-11-11-T-002,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member),"Second, regarding incorporation of service quality in the formula, since most commuters do associate service quality with their willingness to pay higher fares, the Minister has said that it is because the Government does not want to have differentiated fares between different operators but my question is ""why not?"" And how difficult is it to implement differentiated fares between the two operators? In fact, that will actually spur the operators to do better on the service quality standpoint.",2,85,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00085
2013-11-11-T-002,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member),"The third question is regarding the energy component in the index. While I accept that energy is a major cost component for the PTOs, there are many other cost components as well, like manpower. Are we trying to shield the PTOs from all these negative externalities in the fare formula?",3,86,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00086
2013-11-11-T-002,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member),"And my last question is, will this new fare formula – if you compare it with the previous fare formula and with the knowledge that we know as to how much the previous fare formula allowed for increases over the last few years – would this new fare formula lead to higher maximum fare increases?",4,87,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00087
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mdm Speaker, I want to thank Mr Giam for his supplementary questions. The first is that we talk about people with disabilities, not physical disabilities per se. There is, certainly on my part, no intention to exclude certain groups of people. Having said that, I would say that MOT is really not the expert in this area and we would be bringing in our colleagues from MSF and the groups who have much greater expertise to advise us further on this.",1,88,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00088
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"On service quality, the one thing you want to try and do is to keep it as straightforward as possible. The FRMC had that in mind, to not want to complicate the fare formula unnecessarily. If you do want to include a service quality component in the fare formula, then I suspect that the PTOs would also say, ""Well, what about the cost increases that are associated with any service quality improvements? Would that also be included into the fare formula?""",2,89,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00089
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Today, I think what we have is a situation where the regulator can very carefully and, I hope judiciously, increase the operating standards without the corresponding increase in cost being directly passed on to the commuters straightaway.",3,90,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00090
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"We have been increasing the operating performance standards. We have required the operators to put in more trains and so on, and that has not translated into a fare formula where the commuters are required to pay, so, bear that in mind.",4,91,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00091
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The next is on the energy index and I am glad you agree with it but you also expressed concern whether we would then have to shield them from all the other components like manpower. Well, if you look at the fare formula, instead of just taking CPI and the wage index minus the productivity component, as in the past formula, now it is both core CPI plus the wage index and the energy index minus a smaller productivity formula.",5,92,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00092
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"We believe that that actually reflects better the cost structure of the operators. We have about 20%, or slightly over 20% of the expenditure going towards energy, which has increased by about 50% from what it was in the middle of the last decade. And 40% of their cost is already manpower-related.",6,93,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00093
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"When the FRMC came out with the new fare formula, they had looked very carefully at the cost structure of the PTOs, but they also recognised that, instead of using headline CPI, it was more appropriate, as recommended by the academics, to make use of core CPI to take away the accommodation and the private transport components of it.",7,94,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00094
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"On whether the new or old formula is superior, which will lead to higher or lower increases, it really depends. In a year where the electricity and energy prices go up significantly, as they have in the past, then I believe that the new formula will lead to a higher number. But in a year where those remain relatively stable and where the CPI increases are largely driven by accommodation and private transportation, then the new formula would lead to a smaller number. Regardless of a higher or smaller number, when the FRMC looked at it, they really wanted a fare formula that was more reflective of the overall cost structure.",8,95,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00095
2013-11-11-T-002,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Mdm Speaker, the public is happy that there would be long-term concession rates for the low-income commuters. They are also heartened that the Public Transport Fund would be enhanced by way of collection of penalty fees, as well as a part of the fare increment in revenue that PTOs receive. We also note that only half of the transport vouchers in the recent round were collected or redeemed by commuters. I would like to ask the Minister how does the Ministry envisage the bigger fund will be used for the right purposes and whether they will consider allowing people with severe hardship to be able to apply, not just one time, but for many times, to tie over short term or even extended periods of financial hardship?",1,96,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00096
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Those are good questions. Again, I reiterate the call to Members to be on the lookout for those who do need help and to see in what ways we can help them, both in transport as well as beyond transport. The intent, going forward, is perhaps, think about the possibility, as the Member has suggested, to not only make some vouchers available during a round of fare increase but also have some vouchers available on an	ad	hoc basis, so that assistance can be given to those who are most in need or who are in difficulties on a very sudden short-term basis. So, we will look at that very carefully and I thank you for the suggestion.",1,97,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00097
2013-11-11-T-002,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"I would like to ask the Minister this  there are calls for including profitability into the public transport fare formula. I just want to know if that has been considered into the formula because if the transport operators are making excessive profits, then commuters will find it very hard to accept any fare increase.",1,98,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00098
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,Thank you. May I ask the Member for his definition of what would be considered excessive profits?,1,99,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00099
2013-11-11-T-002,David Ong,Mr David Ong,"If you look at the bottom line, and if you see that net profit is in the hundreds of millions as reported, then I think people will find that it is hard for them to say, ""I still have got to pay for any of these fare increases.""",1,100,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00100
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The FRMC, while they have not completely addressed this, actually devised a feature to try and moderate this somewhat. The FRMC would like to recommend that we have regular fare increases, and not follow the pattern of what we have seen in recent years where, sometimes, it is deferred and forgone because there is no roll-over mechanism.",1,101,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00101
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The FRMC added a feature that PTOs, based on their profitability, should contribute between 20% and 50% of the additional revenue that they would get arising from a fare increase exercise. So, for that year, they would take between 20% and 50%, depending on their profitability, and contribute this to the Public Transport Fund and then it would be up to PTC to decide how else to use the Fund beyond what it is today.",2,102,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00102
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Having said that, without defending in any way what the PTOs' profitability numbers are, it is also interesting to look at how that has changed over the years. I think it has really been SMRT's profits that sort of enjoy a certain scrutiny, more so than SBST's. As part of the fare exercise, I was actually looking quite closely at the numbers. What we had seen from March 2011 to March 2013, over the space of those two years, was a 50% decrease in the profits for SMRT, and the last financial year was about $80 million.",3,103,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00103
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Again, looking at the reports for the first two quarters of this year up to September, it has come down further by another 55% from last year's corresponding numbers. They are under some degree of cost pressures because we have required them to step up their maintenance, we have required them to set themselves to higher performance standards, and they have had to pay their staff more.",4,104,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00104
2013-11-11-T-002,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"So, that is the situation as it is, which is why FRMC, when they put up the report, to their great credit, focused very much on affordability and concessions, but at various parts in the report, also made it very clear that they were concerned about the financial viability of the public transport system and, therefore, the need to maintain discipline in terms of having regular fare reviews.",5,105,2013-11-11-T-002-S-00105

2013-11-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Speaker, this list is illustrative and by no means exhaustive. It illustrates how we share the fruits of our success with all Singaporeans by providing more for those with less. Our strategy is to have multiple lines of assistance to help fellow Singaporeans with differing needs. These range from broad-based subsidies that benefit many, to targeted assistance for smaller groups who need additional help. The eligibility criteria vary, depending on the target group of beneficiaries and the purpose of assistance.",1,116,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00116
2013-11-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"For essential needs, such as housing and healthcare, or developmental areas, such as early childhood development, education and training, our subsidies generally cover a wider group of Singaporeans, with greater levels of support and subsidies provided for the lower income. The eligibility criteria are developed according to the groups we help. For example, our childcare subsidies cover up to the 67th percentile of households with preschool children while the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) card caters to the lower- and middle-income households earning up to a per capita income (PCI) of $1,800.",2,117,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00117
2013-11-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"There are also programmes that support a smaller group of low-income Singaporeans who need extra support. Examples include ComCare, which provides both short- and longer-term assistance to families in need. Similarly, the income criteria for these schemes reflect the low-income and needy groups that we help. However, there is flexibility within the help system to cater to those who may not meet the criteria but who are genuinely in need.",3,118,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00118
2013-11-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the other hand, Workfare has a different objective. Workfare is designed to mitigate wage inequality, rather than to meet certain basic needs. We design the system to help the lowest 30% of income earners or more than 400,000 Singaporean workers in absolute numbers. This scheme allows our lower-income workers to narrow the wage gap and share in the nation's success.",4,119,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00119
2013-11-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Yee Jenn Jong asked how we avoid a ""cliff effect"" for ComCare. ComCare applicants are assessed holistically to determine their needs and circumstances, taking into account overall circumstances beyond income. Factors like household size, number of schooling children and medical conditions are considered. We mitigate any cliff effect by having a gradation of assistance given to families who fall within the eligibility criteria. On the other hand, in 2012, more than 1,500 households who did not meet the income criteria were also assisted under ComCare. Those who have other needs that cannot be met by ComCare assistance will be referred to other agencies to ensure that they receive assistance appropriate to their needs.",5,120,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00120
2013-11-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On Mr Yee Jenn Jong's other query, as at the first six months of 2013, close to 11,800 households are receiving ComCare Short and Medium Term Assistance.",6,121,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00121
2013-11-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"To Ms Lee Li Lian's question, across all Ministries and schemes, we will continue to review the eligibility criteria regularly to ensure that they remain relevant and effective for our target groups.",7,122,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00122
2013-11-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Speaker, we are heartened by many Singaporeans who wish to know more and, more importantly, to do more to help fellow Singaporeans in need. Indeed, we must never forget the needy amongst us, no matter how rich our country may be. We can all contribute our part towards this effort to share the fruits of our nation's success and uplift fellow Singaporeans in need. Very often, the needs of Singaporeans who require assistance are multidimensional, beyond a simple income matrix. Social workers, in partnership with volunteers, community groups and like-minded individuals, will understand very well the need to provide flexible, integrated and timely support for such families to walk through the dark valleys of life. We seek to continually improve our care for all Singaporeans, especially the most needy amongst us, in partnership with our fellow Singaporeans.",8,123,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00123
2013-11-11-T-003,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"I thank the Minister for his very comprehensive response and for the table, which helps to provide details of the various schemes and how they target different groups of Singaporeans. Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask a supplementary question.",1,124,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00124
2013-11-11-T-003,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Even though it is very clearly laid out in the way the Minister explained just now, I think somehow the people who need the help have the impression that the schemes are available on a case-by-case basis. I would like to ask the Minister whether the Government will consider communicating the assistance schemes much more clearly to the target groups, so that residents can better understand who the schemes are targeted at, and raise awareness of the availability of the schemes to those in need. It will also give more confidence to residents to come forward if they need help because they are more aware of their eligibility.",2,125,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00125
2013-11-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Speaker, indeed, that is one of the key and, perhaps, most important things that we must do in any policy implementation. It is not just about having good policies, it is about closing that last mile, making sure that our communication reaches the people whom we are targeting the message. And in this area, I would like to appeal to all Members of this House to help us and walk this journey with us. Because, very often, the people who are most in need may not read the newspapers, access the Internet or even understand English, but they need people who can talk to them in their language, people who will knock on their doors, check on them to see whether they are okay, and explain some of these assistance schemes to them.",1,126,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00126
2013-11-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In my own house visits, very often, you will find that families do not even apply for bursary for their school-going children. Sometimes, because they do not know about it; sometimes, they think that other people may look down on them if they apply for such assistance. But this is where we need to do a lot of work to encourage them to come onboard and take up the assistance where it is available. We cannot emphasise enough this point about communication and the last-mile communication. And I urge all Members of the House to join us in this, to mobilise the volunteers and reach out to these groups of people, so that they, too, will understand the help available and they do not need to go through the difficult moments in life alone.",2,127,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00127
2013-11-11-T-003,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Minister for the answers and the table. I have one supplementary question. I would like to understand a bit more about the criteria for the $550 per capita income or $1,700 household income cap for ComCare. I would like to know if this is based on any research or international norms, or if this is a definition by MSF about minimum living income. I would like to also know how and when MSF would consider adjustments to these lines that are being set.",1,128,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00128
2013-11-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Speaker, in response to Mr Yee's question, let me explain that ComCare provides short- and medium-term assistance to the families in need to supplement the other sources of help that they might have. It is not a uniform scheme whereby everybody gets a fixed amount. The amount that is given out to the respective families actually takes into account various factors like, as I have explained, the family sizes, their other sources of income, their particular needs, for example, in medical, and so forth. So, the criteria that we set here for the per capita income of about $550, for the PCI, of about $1,700 for the family, those are guidelines that we use because these are generally lines whereby, from our experience, people coming to seek help are in this range. And, of course, we will regularly review the criteria, as we have done so in the recent years.",1,129,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00129

2013-11-11-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I have a couple of supplementary questions for the Minister. First and foremost, I am glad that the Minister has shared the reasons why some low-income families have not undertaken some of these schemes. I note that there are many of these schemes available but there is also a perception that these schemes are not accessible. So, how can we improve their accessibility? Because for many of these low-wage workers, they are typically daily-rated and do not have documentation, or some may also find it a hassle to go to the CDC or Social Service Offices (SSOs) because of the nature of their job.",1,131,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00131
2013-11-11-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The second question is about how we can make it easier to access the schemes. How much does the Government spend or what is the increase in terms of the funding for such schemes? And in terms of the increase in expenditure, what is the impact on taxpayers?",2,132,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00132
2013-11-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Speaker, I thank Mr Zaqy for his questions. Can I just clarify what his second question is?",1,133,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00133
2013-11-11-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Basically, my second question relates to this. We have always said that we are not a welfare state. We have a lot of schemes available to the low- and middle-income workers. But as we keep increasing the schemes, moving into the middle-income range, for example, would that put a heavy burden on the taxpayers? I want to ask the Minister how is the Ministry planning in the long term, in terms of the sustainability of such schemes.",1,134,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00134
2013-11-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Speaker, if I may take the first question on accessibility. Indeed, we need to spend a lot of time and a lot of effort to mobilise the volunteers and grassroots community leaders to come and help spread the message. For example, recently, we have set up a chain of Social Service Offices across the entire island. We will have 10 by the end of this year and, hopefully, 20 by the end of next year. These are all avenues to help improve and increase the number of access points where the needy families can get help.",1,135,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00135
2013-11-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We are also expanding the network of Family Service Centres from the previous of about 40 to now more than 40, so that families in need can also access help. But, most importantly, it goes back to what Ms Foo Mee Har mentioned just now, which is that we need our volunteers and grassroots partners to know the schemes first so that they can go out and help spread the message because they are our best opinion multipliers.",2,136,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00136
2013-11-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The other thing that we have to do is to improve our communication. Many of these needy families get the information from other needy families on what are the sources of help available. So, we will try all channels, and we must try all channels, to get the message out. On the other hand, we must simplify the messaging so that it does not matter whether you understand English, Mandarin or any other languages, so long as you get to an access point, like a Family Service Centre or a Social Service Office, you will have the information available to you.",3,137,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00137
2013-11-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"What we want to work towards is that the person applying for assistance should not be required to understand the complexity of the scheme. If they need help, they should be able to approach someone who understands the scheme, and it is up to us who are providing the help to find out which is the most appropriate scheme and package the scheme to help the person in need. So, we do this at the backend but, at the front end, the persons who need help will just need to let the social worker or the social work professionals know the kind of situation that they are in.",4,138,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00138
2013-11-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Of course, there are other things that we are trying to do better, which is to have an integrated database to avoid having people repeat their case stories when they move from point A to point B. We have an integrated case management across time and across space so that the needy families get the help that they need.",5,139,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00139
2013-11-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the second question that the Member asked  what does this mean for us, going forward? Indeed, this is a very important question. We know that because of the way technology has come about, and because of global competition, there is a tendency in many countries for the gap to widen between the top and the bottom. This means that, over time, we can expect that we will need to do more, not just the Government but the community partners, and so forth. Over time, we must continually find those resources to help the people that we want to do so, which is why I started this answer by saying that our first priority is to make sure that, if you like, the tide goes up and the pie continues to grow so that we have more resources. We are not aiming for economic growth for the sake of economic growth per se. We are aiming to grow the pie so that we have the resources to help the people in need. If the pie does not grow, if we do not have a stable country and the pie continues to shrink, it makes it so much harder for us to find the resources to help the people in our country.",6,140,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00140
2013-11-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Having said that we have grown the pie, the next thing we must do is that we must have a social compact – a social compact that says that we are prepared to do more for those with less. If you look at the multi-coloured chart that I have just distributed, you will notice that there is a cascading effect, whereby the low-income actually gets the most help, and that is how it should be. We should not be in a situation whereby, because of politics, the middle-income group ends up getting the bulk of it and we neglect the lowest income group. We should have a system, where it is broadly where we are now, whereby the lowest income will always get the most, then we slowly cascade down, and those with the most will also be willing to share more of what they have. Only so will we be able to have a social compact for us to stay united as a country.",7,141,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00141

2013-11-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mdm Speaker, different Ministries will have different methods of reviewing it. But what I can share, common to all Ministries, is that you do not just look at one particular indicator but at a range of indicators to give us a sense of it. It may not be an exact science but we must try and get as many different indicators as possible to help us do this.",1,143,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00143
2013-11-11-T-003,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Let me use the example of the childcare subsidies that is under my own Ministry. For example, in the review of the childcare subsidies, we used to have a uniform assistance scheme for many of the people who are eligible, which is a flat rate of $300. Over time, we have gotten feedback from people that actually we should focus more resources on those with less and, indeed, we agree with that. Over time, we have also found, as a percentage of household expenditures, what is a reasonable number that we should have per child per household, and we look at the experiences of other countries and our own experiences. Then there is also the absolute amount that people spend. So, we also look at prices in the market. With all these different indicators, they would give us a sense of what we need to do. In the recent review that we announced in the earlier part of this year – the first quarter of this year – we targeted the most subsidies to those families with the least so that the families in the lowest income group can even send their children to a childcare centre at $3 per month per child. We do all we can to help them and, very often, this $3 is even covered by the community groups. But that also means that, progressively, we will not have the same level of assistance to the rest of the people who are much more well-off. So, there are different ways.",2,144,2013-11-11-T-003-S-00144

""Redundancy"" refers to the concept of having ""spares"". It means putting, on standby, additional equipment or services which cut over if the primary equipment fails. Recovery means the ability to respond to incidents and to restore services expeditiously with minimal delay.

IDA has, over the years, taken steps to progressively improve resiliency. Since 1998, IDA has put in place the Telecom Service Resiliency Code which places strict requirements on operators of key network infrastructure. This is to ensure that they invest in and enhance the resilience of their networks to prevent outages, as well as having processes for quick service recovery in the event of an incident. IDA has penalised operators under the Resiliency Code where IDA believes operators could have prevented or taken shorter restoration time.",6,156,2013-11-11-T-004-S-00156
2013-11-11-T-004,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"The Member asked what lessons have been learnt from this incident. We take the opportunity to learn from every incident that happens, and review policies and regulations to enhance resilience. In January 2013, M1 suffered a mobile telephone outage. IDA conducted an in-depth review of the resiliency of the three mobile operators' networks. So, apart from imposing a record fine on M1, IDA's investigation also identified areas of improvement for the sector. While the review highlighted that the three mobile operators' networks generally meet international standards, IDA felt that further improvements can be made. For example, international experts indicated that no country has required its operators to build a full geo-redundant mobile network at the core level. This is where an operator puts in place at least two sets of replicated network equipment, housed at different geographical locations, so that in the event that one location is brought down, the other location is capable of immediately taking over the full load and capacity. This is an option that IDA is currently considering. IDA will implement an audit framework by the second half of next year and is in discussion with the mobile operators on the scope of the audit, which would cover the network design, technical processes, business continuity planning, and infrastructure and facilities to support the mobile network. IDA will also work with the mobile operators on implementing enhancements in areas, such as network design, by minimising the number of single points of failure, upgrading network architecture to support full redundancy, and implementing better business continuity planning.",7,157,2013-11-11-T-004-S-00157

For critical sectors, such as the financial sector, regulators, such as the Monetary Authority of Singapore, require financial institutions to maintain resilience in their systems. End users and businesses that require higher resiliency can adopt various strategies, by diversifying the risk through path or exchange diversity from the same operator, by using different technology platforms, for example, fibre vs wireless, or by purchasing services from different network operators. As their needs vary, it would be impractical to require the telecom operators to offer only a fixed menu of tiers. Rather, end users need to work closely with their telecom service providers in order to ensure that the telecom service offered is well integrated into their enterprise systems.",9,159,2013-11-11-T-004-S-00159

2013-11-11-T-004,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. He spoke about Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Planning, and there was quite a bit of stress in terms of infrastructure. Such things also involve typically process and ensuring that there is regular updating of these processes and performance of the tasks, like how you would do fire drills. What is IDA's framework with regard to this, and has SingTel been performing these exercises prior to the fire?",1,163,2013-11-11-T-004-S-00163
2013-11-11-T-004,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Also, do the requirements involve the other operators? I also note that M1 and Starhub were also affected as they link back to the OpenNet infrastructure.",2,164,2013-11-11-T-004-S-00164
2013-11-11-T-004,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The Minister also touched on IDA's new audit framework that is to be launched in the second half. Will that also mean that IDA will now practically audit service providers? The proactiveness is important. Is it also time to look at more stringent requirements because of our heavy dependence, compared to other developed countries, on the communications infrastructure today?",3,165,2013-11-11-T-004-S-00165
2013-11-11-T-004,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"To answer the second question first, the Member is right that when we have the audit framework in place, it means that we will have to go out and check on a regular basis as to whether the requirements that we have put in place in the Code are being implemented by the operators. We want to look at our requirements in a comprehensive manner. I mentioned just now the example of the M1 outage and what we have learnt from that incident. We have reviewed some of the requirements that we want to put into the audit framework, which we have now released to the public for consultation. We will do so for other networks that I mentioned in my reply earlier. We think this is the best way to move forward, because it is important for us to ensure that, given the complexity of the systems, that our requirements must be heightened to meet all possible circumstances.",1,166,2013-11-11-T-004-S-00166
2013-11-11-T-004,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"On the first question  at the moment, what we have is a resiliency code that places certain requirements on all our network operators, especially the large operators whose network has a wide impact. They are supposed to follow the requirements, and as and when an incident happens, an audit would be done by IDA to find out whether they had adopted the requirements.",2,167,2013-11-11-T-004-S-00167
2013-11-11-T-004,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Finally, we will leave it to the operators to do their own audit checks and their own internal assessments to make sure that they have all the requirements in place. At the network level, we want to have certain redundancy and resiliency. At the business end, as I had mentioned in my reply, it is something for the operators and the businesses to decide what level of redundancy and resiliency the businesses would like to have.",3,168,2013-11-11-T-004-S-00168
2013-11-11-T-004,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"We are concerned about the critical infrastructure, and, at the network level, we have requirements which are in place; at the consumer end, we have basically left it to them to decide on a commercial basis.",4,169,2013-11-11-T-004-S-00169
2013-11-11-T-004,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Going forward, with the audit framework in place, we hope that would further strengthen, not only the resiliency code, but the regular audits will also ensure our operators are in line. We cannot be too prescriptive because we recognise that technology moves ahead at different speeds. What we want to do is to impose certain requirements that are necessary to ensure the operators have good recovery in case an incident happens, a certain level of resilience should be built within the operators' network, and the need for certain types of network diversity.",5,170,2013-11-11-T-004-S-00170

My question is related to the on-going and never-ending debate on tuition. Could I ask whether the MOE is looking at ways to reduce the dependence on tuition, including setting a realistic amount of content being taught in our schools, and, therefore, ensuring that teachers are able to complete the syllabus comfortably?",1,174,2013-11-11-T-005-S-00174

New teachers in schools are mentored by Senior Teachers, Heads of Department (HODs) and school leaders in their initial years. Schools also have Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) where teachers come together regularly to share and learn from one another. Teachers also receive continual training at the Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST), which was set up, together with the other teacher academies, to spearhead the professional development of teachers and enhance the quality of the teaching force.",2,178,2013-11-11-T-006-S-00178
2013-11-11-T-006,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister this  the MOE Paper on Principal Rotation states that the process of systematically appointing and rotating principals enables experienced principals to share best practices in support of ""Every School a Good School"".

2013-11-11-T-006,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Mdm Speaker, we do rotate our teachers for the same reason. Rotating teachers across schools is one way for experiences and ideas to be shared. That is one of the ways. The other very important way is for our teachers to come together to share in their professional community their experience and their ideas. Indeed, there are many such forums for doing so. For instance, we have a MOE ExCel Festival where innovations within schools are shared across schools. We also have teachers coming together at the cluster level to share ideas and experiences. There are many different ways in which experiences can be shared, including rotation of teachers across schools.",1,180,2013-11-11-T-006-S-00180

2013-11-11-T-006,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"For posting of teachers, we have two systems. One is what is known as open posting, and one is closed posting. In the case of open postings, teachers can apply for posting to another school, in which case, the principal of the school and the school leaders may interview the teachers and, if there is a mutual agreement, MOE will post these teachers to another school. MOE also has to take into account the needs of different schools, so we also operate a system where MOE HQ will decide on the postings. Principals do have a say in the posting of these teachers.",1,184,2013-11-11-T-006-S-00184

2013-11-11-T-007,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"To make it easier for employers and workers to use and understand these data, we recently launched a new suite of interactive benchmarking tools on our website. These tools allow employers and workers to benchmark themselves against national or industry norms on a variety of indicators, such as wages, staff turnover, employment conditions and so on. For example, employers and employees can use the benchmarking tool to find out whether the wage that they are paying or are receiving for a certain job is near the 25th percentile, at median, or 75th percentile of the industry range.",2,187,2013-11-11-T-007-S-00187
2013-11-11-T-007,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"In general, wages should be determined by the market in a flexible manner, taking into account a multitude of factors, such as productivity, the demand and supply of skills, and economic conditions. Therefore, information and awareness will play a very important part in this process. Hence, the development of these benchmarking tools will make a big difference to both employers and workers to have easy access to reliable, relevant and timely labour market information.

Eyewitnesses were too afraid to testify in open Court against the secret society members for fear of reprisals against themselves and their family members.",3,206,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00206
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Over time, the powers under the Act have been invoked in response to new criminal threats that emerged. For example, in the 1970s, the activities of drug trafficking syndicates became a serious issue that required a swift response. In the past decade, unlicensed moneylending syndicates became a concern with their brazen harassment tactics. These crimes posed serious threats to public order and safety, with the same difficulty in securing witness testimony in open Court.",4,207,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00207

The threat to public order and safety is clear and present, although it may manifest itself in new and different forms. Hence, the CLTPA continues to be a critical part of our criminal justice system, allowing law enforcement agencies to act swiftly and decisively against criminal syndicates. Madam, let me illustrate with specific examples the nature of the various threats that we continue to face today and how the Act has been effective in addressing them.",5,208,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00208

Each year since 2009, there has been an average of about 75 reported fights involving secret society members. These incidents have ranged from minor skirmishes to larger fights and confrontations involving more gang members. Most of those involved in such incidents have been dealt with in court. However, in some instances, the powers under the Act were used as our enforcement agencies had to act decisively against such gangs and their activities that undermined public safety, peace and good order.",6,209,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00209

Eventually, six perpetrators were detained under the Act, another three were placed on Police supervision, while five others were given stern warnings.

The production of opiates in the Golden Triangle has continued to increase in recent years, alongside a rise in heroin seizures in regional countries. At the same time, transnational drug syndicates from Africa and the Middle East continue to bring Ice and other illicit drugs into the region, drawn by the rising affluence. Our regional connectivity has also prompted drug syndicates to attempt to route their drug consignments through Singapore.",10,213,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00213
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"One example was a West African syndicate, which was based in Singapore and actively recruited Singaporean women as drug runners. The members of this syndicate would prey on Singaporean women through Internet chat-rooms and nightspots, and lure them with offers of high paying jobs and overseas travel. Even though recruitment and coordination occurred in Singapore, the drugs were physically handled overseas. In view of the absence of drug exhibits seized in Singapore to enable a court prosecution, as well as the witnesses' refusal to testify in open court, two Nigerians who were part of the syndicate were detained under the CLTPA in 2009. The syndicate shifted its operations to other countries after CNB moved in.

While the overall number of reported unlicensed moneylending and associated harassment cases has declined by 40% from 2009, it remains an area that Police is actively tackling. In recent years, the tactics of such syndicates have also evolved. For instance, they have moved parts of their operations overseas to escape detection, and employed debtors as runners, or used bank accounts registered by debtors to preserve anonymity.",12,215,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00215
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"In 2009, the CLTPA was used to detain a ""towkay"" of a UML syndicate operating in Singapore. In that role, he was responsible for the formation and financing of new UML ""stalls"" and the recruitment of syndicate members. He directed his runners to harass defaulters. The syndicate vandalised public places, splashed paint and scribbled UML messages on walls. Overall, the syndicate was responsible for over 500 harassment incidents, and even shifted some of its operations overseas to evade detection by the Police. Members would agree that we must come down hard on such syndicates, especially those in the upper echelons who have removed themselves from the day-to-day operations and hide behind complex and layered syndicate hierarchies.",13,216,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00216
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"More recently, in October 2013, the CLTPA was used to deal with five persons for their involvement in global soccer match-fixing activities. Of these, four were issued Detention Orders and one was issued a Police Supervision Order. The underlying nature of these match-fixing activities was no different from those of other criminal activities that have necessitated the use of the Act. Such criminal activities are often carried out by organised syndicates with complex and layered structures and extensive networks which make full use of technology. Also, where cross-border illegal activities are involved, the difficulties of securing witnesses who are willing to cooperate and testify in open Court are amplified.",14,217,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00217

I have spoken at length on the various criminal elements that continue to target Singapore, and pose a threat to the safety and security of our people. We have managed to mitigate these threats with the support of the community, and the vigilance of our law enforcement agencies, and the range of enforcement powers that they can avail.

2013-11-11-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The Act or CLTPA, has been renewed 12 times since it was first enacted by Parliament in October 1955. Since then, the CLTPA has proven to have been an effective tool in suppressing the surge of drug trafficking, syndicated criminal activities and secret societies. In more recent years, the Minister for Home Affairs and local enforcement agencies have used the CLTPA to effectively deal with modern menaces like match-fixing and human trafficking. More specifically, last month, the CLTPA was used to detain four persons who were involved in a match-fixing syndicate here in Singapore. This exemplifies the versatile nature of the CLTPA which provides local enforcement agencies the ability to effectively handle a myriad or a range of crimes.",2,231,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00231
2013-11-11-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I support this Bill for two reasons. First, because this law remains to be relevant in Singapore's context today, in light of the recent transnational crimes involving match-fixing and loan sharking. And, secondly, because there are robust review mechanisms that ensure that powers provided for under the CLTPA are not abused.",3,232,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00232
2013-11-11-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Singapore must have a tool to dismantle and guard against organised crime syndicates. Criminal networks that engage in criminal activities like human trafficking and match-fixing have a detrimental effect on society. The CLTPA is essential in dealing with such networks. Further, due to the hierarchical nature of these crime syndicates, accomplices, witnesses and victims are sometimes unwilling to cooperate or testify against these offenders in open court for fear of future reprisals. As such, without a versatile tool like the CLTPA, local enforcement agencies will be left without an effective means of handling such crimes and this would undermine their ability to maintain public safety, peace and good order in Singapore.",4,233,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00233
2013-11-11-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"On a related note, it has been reported that in Queensland, Australia, in a bid to deal with the growing menace of biker gangs involved in organised crimes, the state parliament has passed new legislation that imposes mandatory sentences of 15 years or more for crimes committed as part of organised gang activities, in addition to the existing penalties for the offences. The legislation was enacted in response to the increasing problem of organised crimes across Australia, particularly relating to drugs and guns by outlawed motorcycle gangs. However, these new laws are reactive in nature as they only seek to punish and prosecute offenders after the damage has already been done after a trend of harm has hit society. It is not a proactive tool. It does not allow for law enforcement agencies to neutralise the threat that these offenders seek to inflict.",5,234,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00234
2013-11-11-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"On the other hand, the CLTPA provides local enforcement agencies with an important proactive tool to actively tackle the menace of organised crimes, even before any serious damage has been done. This is particularly important in situations where new and novel harmful behaviour is being conducted, or where witnesses are less than forthcoming to testify against individuals known to be involved in criminal syndicates.",6,235,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00235
2013-11-11-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Furthermore, modern-day criminal syndicates are able to adapt their operations quickly to evade detection and prosecution.

2013-11-11-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Therefore, Mdm Speaker, it is clear that the CLTPA continues to be an essential part of the arsenal of weaponry available to local law enforcement agencies to efficiently and judiciously deter criminal syndicates and cross-border crimes in Singapore. However, in order to ensure that these far-reaching powers are not abused by local enforcement agencies, the review mechanisms and safeguards that are currently in place must continue to be adhered to and utilised robustly.",8,237,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00237

Presently, before a person is detained under the Detention Order pursuant to section 30 of the Act, there are substantial safeguards and administrative procedures that must be adhered to. The safeguards include the necessary consent of both the Minister for Home Affairs and the Attorney-General, the examination of potential detainees before an independent Criminal Law Advisory Committee, the detainees being informed of the reasons for their detention and have the opportunity to present their defence in response to the case against them, and the express approval of the President.",9,238,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00238

2013-11-11-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The CLTPA also provides law enforcement agencies with the option of using the less invasive Police Supervision Order and allows the suspected criminals to be closely supervised and watched by the Police rather than to be detained under a Detention Order. Undoubtedly, the fact that the Minister for Home Affairs has come before Parliament every five years to seek the renewal of the Act, like he does today, provides Parliament an avenue to hold MHA and law enforcement agencies accountable for the use, past use and continuing use of the Act. This also ensures that at each renewal the CLTPA remains relevant and necessary for the maintenance of law and order in Singapore.",11,240,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00240
2013-11-11-T-014,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Taken together, it is my view that these safeguards ensure that detention or Police supervision orders are not handed out lightly. And that law enforcement agencies only resort to the CLTPA in instances where there are very strong reasons and justifications for doing so. Further to that, accountability in the form of requiring regular renewals of the Act every five years ensures that Parliament is able to maintain an oversight of the use of the CLTPA and to ensure its continued relevance in Singapore law.",12,241,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00241

It is now seeking to reinstate a wider scope for preventive detention and detention without trial by amending the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act and Prevention of Crime Act.",4,247,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00247
2013-11-11-T-014,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"We have long been criticised by Western governments for having detention without trial which is something we inherited from the British. Then on 11 September 2001, things became less black and white. The US established Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp in Cuba, which sanctions, among other things, preventive detention and what has been called ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" – what most people would understand as ""torture"". You would think that many people would be against this, but according to a Washington Post poll released in February this year, 70% of respondents either ""strongly"" or ""somewhat"" approved of keeping the prison facility open. Why? Because when the rubber hits the road, and where public safety and human lives are at stake, certain realities sink in.",5,248,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00248

The fact of the matter is that there are criminal syndicates operating here and in the region which are a direct threat to our safety and security. They know what the rules are and how to get round them with impunity. You cannot bring a case to Court in Singapore if there is no evidence, and one way to keep the evidence out is to make sure that you keep your operations overseas or you intimidate people from testifying against you. As Al Capone said in the movie ""The Untouchables"", ""Somebody messes with me, I mess with them."" I cannot do the voice! And if they know that the police are powerless to prosecute, there is nothing to stop them from committing or continuing their activities. In other words, there is no deterrence and that is the reality.",6,249,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00249

We can acknowledge and accept that special circumstances call for a different solution.

2013-11-11-T-014,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"But giving such wide powers always carries the concern of abuse or misuse. Will the CLTPA be used in cases for which it was not intended? Will the Police use it as a convenient tool where it is too costly, or time consuming or otherwise difficult to prove the crime? We must continue to ensure a rigorous review of the use of the CLTPA in every case.",8,251,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00251
2013-11-11-T-014,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In this regard, the CLTPA does provide that an independent Advisory Committee will review all Detention Orders and Police Supervision Orders.

The Committee comprises prominent individuals, including former judges and experienced lawyers in private practice.

2013-11-11-T-014,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"However, there are two points that I would like to raise. The first concerns the scope of the CLTPA. Recently, it was reported that Detention Orders under the CLTPA were issued to four Singaporeans involved in a global match-fixing syndicate. The explanation given for the use of the CLTPA was that the criminal syndicate was a complex and multi-layered one, witnesses able to provide testimony were unwilling to do so, and that the cross-border nature of the criminal activities gave rise to evidential difficulties.",10,253,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00253
2013-11-11-T-014,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I understand the difficulties in prosecuting the crime. But it has always been the Government's position that the CLTPA will only be used as a last resort where a serious crime is involved. So, the question is  is match-fixing, regardless of how wide-spread it is, a sufficiently serious offence to invoke the CLTPA?",11,254,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00254
2013-11-11-T-014,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"It is of a different order from crimes involving secret societies, drug trafficking or loansharking. Match-fixing is essentially cheating and it is really driven by the gaming industry. In other words, many who lose money as a result of match-fixing, were gambling in the first place, and some illegally. There is no apparent threat to life or limb, or to security. It is unclear whether match-fixing warrants invoking the CLTPA, just because it is done in a manner where elements of an organised crime are present. We have to be careful because an inappropriate use of the CLTPA will only strengthen the arguments of those who oppose it.",12,255,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00255
2013-11-11-T-014,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The second point is I would be grateful if the Minister could set out a road map for the future of the CLTPA. Using the CLTPA for match-fixing suggests that our current laws may be inadequate. I understand that the Ministry is working on Organised Crimes legislation. That will presumably deal with secret societies, gambling and vice syndicates and other elements the CLTPA was directed at. Will the proposed legislation provide for preventive detention as well? And will there still be a need for the CLTPA if that legislation is enacted? With that, Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.",13,256,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00256

However, I believe that the Government should reveal more of why the suspected activities justified detention without trial under CL.",20,276,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00276
2013-11-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"In a parliamentary answer, the Government tried to draw a parallel between match- fixing syndicates and drug trafficking and unlicensed moneylending, stating that they were all perpetuated by organised criminal syndicates with complex and layered structures motivated by financial gain.",21,277,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00277
2013-11-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I would like some clarification on this. Does this mean that so long as there are complex and layered structures, the authorities find it more efficient to go for detention without trial instead of trying to gather solid evidence to mount a prosecution?",22,278,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00278
2013-11-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The Ministry further mentioned in the parliamentary answer that where cross-border illegal activities are involved, the difficulties of securing evidence and witnesses willing to cooperate and testify against a syndicate in open court are amplified. I am not sure whether the Government is saying that transnational crime is now a new category for which CL detentions will be handy. What if that transnational crime was simply a revenue offence, for example, a syndicate dealing in contraband goods, with no links to violence? Would CL be used for that too?",23,279,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00279
2013-11-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"To prosecute match fixers in court should be the usual route. One of our leading soccer match fixers, Wilson Raj Perumal, was tried and convicted in Finland for bribing soccer players and rigging matches. In Singapore too, we have been pursuing soccer corruption cases in our courts in the past and currently. Why could the four detainees not be prosecuted in court, either locally or in Europe? If the four had done any preparatory acts from Singapore, it is possible to pursue their cases in a local court. If the acts were wholly committed overseas, Singapore citizens can still be prosecuted in Singapore for their overseas acts under section 37 of the Prevention of Corruption Act.",24,280,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00280
2013-11-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Alternatively, they should be extradited to stand trial in the country where the crimes allegedly took place. What then was the difficulty? Were the European investigators slow to share with us the information they had, which was what Interpol Secretary-General told various media? Are there gaps in the cross-border process, preventing the suspects from being extradited to the appropriate jurisdiction for trial?",25,281,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00281
2013-11-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, the fact the soccer match-fixing syndicate was working across borders should not be a justification for detention without trial. Indeed, in his parliamentary answer to Member of Parliament Alex Yam last month, Deputy Prime Minister Teo revealed that our agencies vigorously pursued leads through Interpol, Europol and European countries to share information and otherwise collaborate on curtailing the soccer syndicate. Would it not have been possible to work towards prosecution instead?",26,282,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00282
2013-11-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),These latest detentions raise concerns about whether powers of CL detention are now being extended to cover gaps in the law or law enforcement processes to tackle crimes across borders. It also makes one worried what other new offences will be covered under CL detention in the future.,27,283,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00283
2013-11-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Accordingly, it is important for the Minister to clarify three things. One, since the Act requires detentions to be in the interest of public safety, peace and good order, does the Government agree that CL detentions should ordinarily be restricted to organised crimes which threaten life and limb?",28,284,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00284
2013-11-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Two, will the Minister confirm whether the detention of soccer match fixing detainees are unprecedented in the history of the Act and explain further why the detentions furthered public safety, peace and good order?",29,285,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00285
2013-11-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Three, are our Government and other governments working together on a better regime of international cooperation such as suspects of transnational crime can be investigated and extradited for trials in the appropriate jurisdictions?",30,286,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00286
2013-11-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, I move on to safeguards and the need for enhancement. Over the years, Members have debated on whether the safeguards against arbitrary detention are robust enough. Personally, I think they are not adequate and should be strengthened.",31,287,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00287
2013-11-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, let me lay out what I understand are the existing safeguards and their limitations. There is an avenue of judicial review. In the 2007 case of Wong Sin Yee, the High Court affirmed that it had jurisdiction to review the Detention Order but only on the grounds of rationality, not merits. In other words, the Court had powers to quash the Detention Order if the Minister had not made the order on the grounds of public safety, peace and good order. However, the Court did not have the power to do its own risk threat analysis of the suspects' activities to decide if the suspect should be detained in the interest of public safety, peace and good order. Therefore, if I may simplify, the court's jurisdiction is to look more at whether the Government had acted rationally and not to weigh the information to decide if detention was justified. Who then would supervise the detention on its merits to see whether it was justified?",32,288,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00288
2013-11-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Under section 31 of the Act, the Minister's decision to detain will be sent to an Advisory Committee together with a written statement of the grounds of detention. According to the Criminal Law (Advisory Committee) Rules, the Committee will meet to consider the case with the suspect present. The Committee is to meet in private and will read reports that the Minister has authorised to be placed before the Committee. The suspect may be represented by a lawyer if leave is given by the Committee. The Advisory Committee may, in its discretion, call witnesses to adduce oral or documentary evidence. Whatever the case, the suspect and his lawyer are not privy to the reports and evidence the Advisory Committee refers to for its decision. The Advisory Committee will then send its report to the President who acts on the advice of Cabinet to cancel or confirm the Detention Order.",33,289,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00289
2013-11-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, it would be instructive to know how often an Advisory Committee has called for additional evidence before putting up its recommendations. Moreover, it can be seen in the scheme of things that the Advisory Committee is merely that – advisory. Even if the Committee were to come to the conclusion that the person should not be detained, it can only give such advice in its secret report to the President. The President, who is the final gatekeeper, will read the Committee's recommendations but will still decide based on the advice of Cabinet. Therefore, for a Minister's decision to be overturned on the merits, the Cabinet must come to the conclusion that their Cabinet colleague, the Home Affairs Minister, was wrong.",34,290,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00290
2013-11-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Could the Government tell us how many times the Advisory Committee had recommended release and what the President did in those cases? Going further upstream, it will be useful to know how often recommendations for detention put up by Police or the Central Narcotics Bureau have been turned down by the Public Prosecutor or by the Minister.",35,291,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00291
2013-11-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, past debates in this House showed that at renewals of the Act, Members had raised various concerns over the years about the review process. Has the Government considered the feasibility of enabling the merits of the Detention Order to be subject to judicial scrutiny? A scheme could be worked out where a judge scrutinises all the relevant information in camera, away from the public eye to ensure that at least an identifiable impartial person currently serving in the judicial branch of the Government has weighed the information before we lock a person up without trial, and can order his release if not satisfied. At least under such a regime, the decision to detain someone without trial would be subject to a check and balance system from two branches of Government rather than be a decision taken by the executive branch alone.",36,292,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00292
2013-11-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"As a second alternative, the powers to confirm or cancel the Detention Order could be given to a body other than the Minister or Cabinet. I note that in Malaysia, under the recent amendments to the Prevention of Crimes Act, the Malaysian government has decided to give the powers to detain – not to any Minister but to a board comprising five persons.",37,293,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00293
2013-11-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, the review process is a crucial safeguard. I hope the Government will not close its mind on this matter but will do a serious assessment of how it can be improved.",38,294,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00294
2013-11-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, to summarise, I am not opposing the extension of the Act for another five years as I do not think the current climate is the right time to abolish it in the interest of public safety. However, I am grappling with the rationale and justification for detaining the suspects of soccer match-fixing under the CL instead of working towards trying them in court. Some clarity on this is necessary for us to know where this is going.",39,295,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00295
2013-11-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I am aware that the review process for the four detainees is still on-going.

2013-11-11-T-014,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,"First, the Bill speaks of the Government's determination to have the full range of legal powers to keep hardcore crime at bay. It cannot be denied that the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (CLTPA) was crucial in the fight against violent crime since its promulgation in 1955. Our no-nonsense approach towards crime has made security and order defining features of our society.",2,305,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00305

2013-11-11-T-014,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,"This is notwithstanding the Government's consistent position that the CLTPA is used only as a last resort when an alleged serious crime has been committed, and a successful court prosecution not possible because witnesses are not willing or afraid to testify in court.",4,307,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00307
2013-11-11-T-014,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,"Madam, most CLTPA cases, as the Minister has just elaborated, relate to secret society activities, drug trafficking, and unlicensed moneylending.

Just last month, it was used against several persons alleged to be involved in a major international soccer match-fixing syndicate.",5,308,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00308

Notwithstanding the saving provision of Article 9 of our Constitution, which provides constitutional protection for laws like the CLTPA, the CLTPA does significantly impinge upon the rights of all persons in Singapore. It is a cardinal rule of law principle that no person should be imprisoned without an open trial. And we should not look at the CLTPA as something which brings alleged perpetrators to justice because they have not been properly accorded the judicial process.",20,323,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00323

2013-11-11-T-014,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,The Government had always insisted that the mandatory death penalty for murder and drug trafficking had helped to keep Singapore safe. But we have moved boldly away from that with this House passing the necessary legislative amendments last year to make the incremental shift towards a discretionary death penalty regime in specified circumstances. This shift was made notwithstanding the Government's assessment of a worsening regional drug situation and the large number of repeat drug abusers likely to be released in the next few years.,34,337,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00337

I hope the Government will spare no efforts to see how the CLTPA can be revamped in order to retain public confidence and legitimacy in our administration of criminal justice. As it stands, the CLTPA is too omnibus a law. The long title of the Act reads  ""An Act to make temporary provisions for the maintenance of public order, the control of supplies by sea to Singapore, and the prevention of strikes and lock-outs in essential services."" I note that the Minister made reference to the maintenance of public order; I am not aware of any reference to the supplies by sea to Singapore as well as the prevention of strikes and lock-outs in essential services. The CLTPA deals with both criminal and non-criminal matters. The CLTPA should be stripped to its bare essentials if the Government decides to retain this law.",35,338,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00338

2013-11-11-T-014,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,"Renaming the Act is necessary and urgent, in my view, and there is a need to go beyond form. The substance of the CLTPA must also be seriously evaluated. The CLTPA, as I mentioned earlier, is too broad in its scope and application. Drafted at a tumultuous time in our history, the law urgently needs refreshing. The draconian powers must be handled with utmost care. Beyond the Government's assurance, I believe that a critical revamp is needed so that when the CLTPA reaches its milestone 60th anniversary, the legislation would be in keeping with the tenor of the times. Above all, it would also strengthen our commitment to the rule of law. Madam, despite my reservations, I support the Bill.",38,341,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00341

2013-11-11-T-014,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"A couple of weeks ago just before Deepavali, my residents in Jurong witnessed a high speed car chase. A van was speeding down from the top of a multi-storey car park towards the exit on the ground floor, damaging a few structures along the way. It was pursued by an unmarked Police car, much like a movie scene you see in the cinema. Immediately, the residents associated the car chase to drug offences. Although the Police has clarified that they have arrested the driver of the van and he did not commit any drug offences, many Singaporeans still have the perception that the drug problems are far from over in Singapore.",3,344,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00344

It was reported in their local press that in the first 10 months of 2013, there were 109 shooting cases, including some fatal cases, and all of them were linked to secret societies. As a result, the parliament of our neighbouring country had to make a quick decision to pass the Prevention of Crime Act 2013 which is similar to the CLTPA to allow criminals to be detained without trial.",6,347,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00347

Rather, we need to review whether the existing safeguards to prevent abuses are sufficient, especially when the CLTPA is used by MHA for other crimes. We need a corresponding increase in transparency on how the safeguards, as mentioned by the Minister, could function properly and appropriately. For that, I have a few suggestions.",9,350,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00350

In the eyes of the detainee, he might feel that it is not justified for him to be detained without trial. For that matter, an unremorseful criminal might not feel that justice is done even if he is convicted in an open Court.",13,354,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00354
2013-11-11-T-014,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"So, it might be good for MHA to explain how the length of Detention Order is determined. Or how many times the Court Order is renewed? Does it correlate to the imprisonment terms of the offence if the detainee were to be charged in the open Court? Or does it correlate to the propensity that the detainee would commit the same offence again if he is released?",14,355,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00355

2013-11-11-T-014,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Mdm Speaker, the number of Advisory Committees does not necessarily equate with the number of safeguards. Section 40 of the Act empowers the Advisory Committee to summon and examine witnesses, to administer oaths or affirmations and to compel the production of documents. So, the question is  how often do the Advisory Committees summon and examine witnesses?",16,357,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00357

One could argue that the Advisory Committee may be prone to accept a well argued paper if they do not independently summon and examine witnesses to verify the arguments in the paper. I am not questioning the integrity and competency of the Advisory Committees. As mentioned by the Minister, they comprise of prominent private citizens ""such as Justices of the Peace, senior lawyers, High Court Judges and community leaders."" What I am advocating is that MHA could provide more information on how often the Advisory Committees meet and how often they summon and examine witnesses, so as to assure the public that the safeguards are adequate.",17,358,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00358

Singapore has reached a high level of living standard today; one important reason is our harmonious tripartite relations. MOM pays close attention to the well-being of our workers. This is something that everybody can see. If workers have any grievances, they can use the many existing channels to lodge their complaints with the Union or MOM. We cannot tolerate workers in the essential services industries to ignore the laws and do anything they wish to and damage Singapore's industrial relations. Just now, when I spoke in English, I said that we must continue implementing this Act to deal with organised criminal organisations, such as drug-trafficking syndicates, illegal moneylenders and secret societies.",20,361,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00361
2013-11-11-T-014,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"The illegal strike last year showed that CLTP, which has been in effect from 1955, is still relevant and necessary today. However, we need to have safeguards and make sure that this Act is not abused, especially under section 6. Can MHA consider reviewing this clause so that we keep up with the times? In this Internet age, is 14 days' notice period too short or too long? Although we have slowed down the growth of foreign workers, there are still many of them working in the essential services. I hope that MHA can work more closely together with MOM to educate them on the importance of harmonious tripartite relations, hence prevent similar incidents from happening again.",21,362,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00362

I applaud MHA's effort in taking pain to explain the relevance of the Act when it seeks Parliament's endorsement to extend its validity every five years. It is rightly so, as detention without trial is a departure from the norm in the view of a civilised society.",23,364,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00364

My concern with extending the Act to match-fixing is that it provides a too convenient means by which to get around the usual legal processes in trying accused persons. Can we not look to improve our legal framework to address such crimes in open court as opposed to doing it through the Act?",2,367,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00367
2013-11-11-T-014,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),I would also like to ask the Minister if our transnational agreements and exchanges are sufficiently robust and deep enough to specifically address match-fixing such that we can prosecute offenders in open court.,3,368,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00368
2013-11-11-T-014,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"With regard to the recent detentions, the Minister for Home Affairs stated that our security services worked closely with Interpol and other international law enforcement agencies and were able to obtain information from Interpol, Europol and European countries affected by the syndicate's match-fixing activities. It would seem that this information was insufficient to prosecute the match-fixers in open court for some reason. Were there requests for extradition? Were there specific difficulties in extraditing the match-fixers to countries where the crimes were committed for the law to take its course?",4,369,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00369
2013-11-11-T-014,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Madam, any decision about whether to add another category of crime to the Orders issued under the Act should be weighted carefully between an affront to the right of the accused to have his case heard in open court and the need to give our law enforcement bodies adequate tools to tackle real and pressing threats to public safety, peace and good order.",5,370,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00370

2013-11-11-T-014,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The most controversial part of the Act is probably the powers under Part V that permit the Minister to subject a person to police supervision or make Detention Orders where he believes that the detention of a person associated with activities of a criminal nature is necessary in the interests of public safety, peace and good order.",3,376,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00376
2013-11-11-T-014,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"As a lawyer, I am not generally in favour of having alleged criminals detained without a proper hearing. The main benefit of the trial process is that it allows an accused person to be charged in an open process and the opportunity to hear and respond to the evidence of his accusers. The person is then given a chance, either individually or through his lawyers, to ask questions of his accusers and test the evidence.",4,377,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00377
2013-11-11-T-014,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"However, the merits of a public trial process are probably also its greatest weakness when facing organised crime. The challenge with organised crime is that each individual who stands accused of a crime might potentially have both the support and scrutiny of his organisation behind him. Witnesses are, therefore, going to be much more unlikely to come forward to give evidence. Where the witness is a mole or informer within the organisation, this might even compromise his ability to continue to provide useful evidence. In very bad situations, judges and prosecutors may face retribution, too.",5,378,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00378

Two things were especially memorable about the show. The first was that even the heroes got killed in the movie.

But he did not go to jail for any of his gang-related crimes. He went to jail for tax evasion. The reason he did not go to jail for his gang-related crimes was because he was able to suffer the entire justice process. Witnesses were afraid of coming forward, jury bribery was rampant and the scary part is that although this was a Hollywood movie, the real Al Capone also was not prosecuted for any of his gang-related crimes. In fact, he did go to Alcatraz in the end for tax evasion.",7,380,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00380

In fact, just across the Causeway, Malaysia had a very similar provision to Singapore's which was called the Emergency Ordinance. Malaysia had the benefit of a falling crime rate from 2009 to 2011, at least if official releases were to be believed.

At the petrol station, they were approached and threatened by two men who demanded money. There were a lot of other people at the petrol station but no one came forward to help. They then tried to flee in their car, but the two men followed them, swerved in front of them, stopped them, then proceeded to get out of the car, threatened them with a knife and they were not just satisfied with the RM3,400 that they had with them. They, in fact, asked Mr and Mrs Lim to go to a series of ATMs to draw out more money and give them that money as well.

2013-11-11-T-014,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Speaking with them, it became extremely clear that the fear of repercussions when you are dealing with organised crime is very real. Amongst my own residents, there were reports of potential drug trafficking near my rental blocks. When I asked them why they did not want to tell the Police, they said, ""Oh, if I make a Police report with my name on it, people will come and get me."" So, what I think gave them comfort in the end was that they could make the reports and have their identities protected when necessary.",21,394,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00394
2013-11-11-T-014,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Loansharking was another major problem when I first came in, and in almost every other house visit, I could see reports within that block of at least one person who had been subject to some form of loanshark harassment. Not all were borrowers. Many were innocent victims who happened to be living next door or were somehow associated with the borrowers. They were subject to, at the very least, vandalism. In other cases, threats of violence. In the very worst cases, there was even one case where kerosene was poured under the door and a threat to set the place on fire.",22,395,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00395
2013-11-11-T-014,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The crackdowns in the last two years have helped this problem significantly. And this has been a combination of regular police enforcement methods along with the use of CLTPA where necessary. The number of reports of loansharking activities has come down quite significantly in the last two years. And I am quite happy to say that I think the measures are moving in the right direction. It is still a problem but what I can see now is that loanshark runners are a lot more afraid of getting caught. In one of the incidents recently that I came across, the alleged harasser threw a cup of paint at the door because he was so afraid of getting caught and then ran away. So, it is a nuisance but it is not the menace that it used to be.",23,396,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00396
2013-11-11-T-014,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"However, I believe this menace is always simmering just beneath the surface. If the CLTPA is not renewed and people currently detained under the CLTPA are released, then I am definitely concerned about a resurgence in more aggressive types of organised criminal activities.",24,397,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00397
2013-11-11-T-014,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"One final point that I think we should look at going forward is what form you would like the CLTPA be able to take. Amongst the critics of CLTPA, two criticisms come out. The first is that it is called ""temporary provisions"" but in fact, it has been enforced since 1955. The second is that there is no real mechanism for judicial oversight of it.",25,398,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00398
2013-11-11-T-014,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I do not think massive changes are really necessary. Personally, I would have no objections to having something like this on a more permanent footing if necessary. The basis for that would be that as long as the threat for organised crime exists, and organised crime makes it possible to subvert the trial process in some way, whether it is to intimidate witnesses or whether it also means losing the ability to get informants from inside to come out, then it might be necessary to have a more permanent provision to deal with it because I do not see this threat going away.",26,399,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00399
2013-11-11-T-014,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Secondly, personally, I am extremely comfortable with the safeguards we have at the moment because there are many avenues involved for evidence to be heard from the accused and for the accused to be represented if necessary. The only thing that is not permitted is for the accused to have the opportunity to hear the evidence or to meet the evidence of his accusers directly. That is necessary to protect the secrecy of the people giving evidence.",27,400,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00400
2013-11-11-T-014,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"One measure that might be introduced is to include judicial oversight in the Advisory Committee. At the moment, the Advisory Committee has very senior lawyers; it has retired judges; so I have no doubt that it has the capability of dealing with the evidence there. But, perhaps, because we do not have representation from the judiciary specifically in there, it may be subject to criticism on the basis that there is no judicial involvement in the process at all.",28,401,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00401
2013-11-11-T-014,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I have no objections with having judicial oversight in that particular limb of the CLTPA test and that would at least have an experienced sitting judge hearing the evidence where necessary, using his own training as a judge to deal with such issues. I stand and support this Bill. I think it needs to be renewed for the next five years. I also think there is space for putting this Bill on a more permanent footing if we are going to be dealing with organised crime for a long time to come.",29,402,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00402
2013-11-11-T-014,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Mdm Speaker, a cornerstone of the CLTPA is the power to impose executive detention without trial. It is a very serious incursion into a fundamental civil liberty for a person to be detained without trial, without legal proof that an offence has been committed. One of the most fundamental human rights in the criminal justice system is the right to a fair trial. In this case, in this Bill, Detention Orders can be issued without even a trial, let alone a fair one.",1,403,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00403
2013-11-11-T-014,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"One of the safeguards built into this piece of legislation is the sunset provision. The Act has to be renewed every five years by this House, properly considering, evaluating and debating the factors to determine if this Act should merit continued approval.",2,404,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00404
2013-11-11-T-014,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"In considering the renewal of this Act, in my view, this House has to be satisfied on two counts  first, that there remains a need for such executive detention powers today, almost 60 years after it was first promulgated; and second, if so, then we have to be satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards to ensure that these powers will not be abused.",3,405,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00405
2013-11-11-T-014,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Mdm Speaker, the Minister has explained that the CLTPA is intended principally to disrupt and dismantle secret society and organised gang activities. Of course, the sort of problems that Singapore faced in the 1950s and 1960s are no longer troubling society at the same level today. But we would be very naÃ¯ve to think that these activities no longer pose a threat to society. The Minister has outlined the areas of organised illegal activities in three areas which the CLTPA has been principally targeted against. They are namely secret society activities, drug trafficking and loansharking.",4,406,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00406
2013-11-11-T-014,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),There are three threads which are common and run across all of these three activities,5,407,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00407
2013-11-11-T-014,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"First, these activities are pervasive and they afflict a broad spectrum of society, not just the victim, not just the offender. These activities infiltrate and affect society, and cause a sphere of damage greater than just the offence alone.",6,408,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00408
2013-11-11-T-014,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Take drug trafficking, for instance, which is a serious social ill. The true victim of drug abuse is society. Drug abuse is a great tragedy which really cannot be measured only in terms of the harm caused to the individual drug abuser who suffers from the addiction. There is a much greater cost to his family, to his friends, to his colleagues and the social and economic infrastructure around him. It affects many families and destroys a person's life and it destroys the fabric of society around that person, the drug offender. There are also problems caused by drug-related crimes, commonly, stealing, housebreaking, robbery, or more serious, desperate crimes which an abuser is driven to commit, in order to fuel the addiction. All of these lend to a less safe Singapore.",7,409,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00409
2013-11-11-T-014,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"It is the same for unlicensed moneylending. Many of us in this House would have received many complaints from residents on this issue and see for ourselves that the intention of these loansharks is often not just to target the borrower, but also the people living around the borrower. Loansharks threaten, and many of us have seen the chilling messages designed to strike fear and create embarrassment not just in the victim, but also the people around him. And these activities often take place at or around the victim's home – our home, our neighbourhood and this is the heart of our residential neighbourhood, where one is supposed to feel and be safe.",8,410,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00410
2013-11-11-T-014,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Mdm Speaker, Singapore is not rid of these problems by any stretch. A look at some of the statistics will give us a sense. Drug arrests have gone up over the last three years. The first half of 2013 alone, we have seen a 13% increase in drug-related arrests over the same period in 2012. As Minister mentioned earlier, the street value of drugs seized have had a record high. Between 2004 and 2009, we have seen a year-on-year increase, every year increase in the number of harassment and loansharking complaints. In fact, the number of complaints in 2009, more than triple the number of complaints in 2004.",9,411,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00411
2013-11-11-T-014,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"So, there is therefore a strong need to ensure that these activities are kept firmly in check – which leads to my second point, one which many Members of this House have canvassed. These activities are often syndicated and well-organised, with a complex hierarchical structure. These crimes are inherently difficult to prosecute in many instances because of the lack of direct admissible evidence and the obvious unwillingness of witnesses, whether they be members of the public or even members of the same syndicate, to testify. They are often concerned about the reprisals against themselves and, perhaps, more importantly, against their families.",10,412,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00412
2013-11-11-T-014,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Madam, I therefore believe that the Act, used judiciously, is not just a powerful tool for law enforcement. The fact that we have such tough laws would itself be a strong deterrent against anyone even contemplating such activity in Singapore. It would also be a clear message to organised gangs outside Singapore that this is not a place to even start to think about to base or to anchor such activities.",11,413,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00413
2013-11-11-T-014,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Madam, I move on to the second issue, which is – even if this Act is useful in keeping Singapore safe, how do we ensure that the power is not abused? That is a key consideration for this House in deciding to continue with the Act for the next five years. We have heard the in-built CLTPA regime and safeguards, the Detention Order has to be concurred by the Public Prosecutor, and then confirmed by the President upon the review by a separate Advisory Committee, the detainee is entitled to make representations and must be given reasons for the detention to allow him to make an effective challenge.",12,414,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00414
2013-11-11-T-014,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"I have myself previously served on such Advisory Committees set up under section 39 of the Act, and I can personally attest to the robustness of the Committee's work. Each committee member is given the details of the case; they have access to all documents including statements and eye-witness accounts. The detainee and witnesses are often heard, and the detainee can make full arguments against the Detention Order. The detainee can also be represented by counsel at such hearings and all of this material is then carefully scrutinised, critically, by each committee member before a conclusion is drawn.",13,415,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00415
2013-11-11-T-014,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"And I can assure the hon Members for Aljunied and Ang Mo Kio that this Advisory Committee does not have any connection or speak to the Minister; we do not have any one from the MHA discuss the case with us, save for administrative details concerning the hearing.",14,416,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00416
2013-11-11-T-014,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"In addition, a detainee retains the right to seek judicial review of Detention Orders in Court. There have been several challenges in the Singapore Courts for the past few years. And I think I heard the Member for Aljunied mentioned a recent case in 2007, where in that case, as the Member would know, not just that the Court found that it was capable of being judicially reviewed, in that case, I believe the detainee was also represented by a reputable Senior Counsel.",15,417,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00417
2013-11-11-T-014,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Mdm Speaker, all of these measures, including the review by this House today are safeguards against abuse of such an extensive power. I am myself satisfied that these safeguards have worked well and are sufficient. However, notwithstanding that, I would like to put forward a couple of additional measures for the Minister's consideration.",16,418,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00418
2013-11-11-T-014,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"First, section 30 of the CLTPA, which is the section that confers the power of the Minister to issue detention or Police supervision orders, requires that the Minister be satisfied that the person ""has been associated with activities of a criminal nature"". The Minister has also to be satisfied that any Detention Order would be in the ""interests of public safety, peace and good order."" There is no requirement that the activities of a criminal nature be of a sufficient severity or culpability as to warrant the making of a Detention Order. In that context, would the Minister consider raising the threshold to one where the activities are of such a serious criminal nature, or at least where the activities have or are likely to cause serious and widespread harm to Singapore and Singaporeans?",17,419,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00419
2013-11-11-T-014,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Second, whilst a detainee under the current CLTPA and the rules has the right to counsel at every level, at every hearing, he cannot always afford or instruct one. Accordingly, would the Minister consider an amendment to be made where the state will assign a counsel to any detainee who requests one?",18,420,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00420
2013-11-11-T-014,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Third, a Detention Order can be made on the basis of evidence or materials which would not, otherwise, be admissible in Court. We have discussed this before, and we can see the reasons why that is so. However, our law enforcement agencies have a primary duty to prosecute all suspects in a Court of Law. They should not be able to think that they can get away with a less than thorough investigation and simply bring a Detention Order against a suspected, but not proven, criminal. This would, inevitably, lead to complacency and make for a less rigorous law enforcement agency. With that in mind, may I suggest that provisions be strengthened to add the requirement that the Minister be first reasonably satisfied that a criminal prosecution is not possible or that there is insufficient available admissible evidence before choosing to invoke CLTPA provisions.",19,421,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00421
2013-11-11-T-014,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Madam, this legislation is tough and I can see why there could be detractors. But it also signals very clearly our Government's firm interest in keeping Singapore and Singaporeans safe and free from the harmful effects of serious, vicious and pervasive crimes. If we have robust safeguards, I am sure no law-abiding citizen would disagree that there is a greater interest for our people in society to be kept safe.",20,422,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00422
2013-11-11-T-014,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"We have heard the Malaysian experience quite graphically by some Members earlier. I will just add a couple of short points. The Emergency (Public Order and Crime Prevention) Ordinance that allowed the government to hold suspects for a long period without charging them, was repealed in December 2011. The recent article in September 2013, just about two months ago, the Wall Street Journal opined that the repeal put many hardened criminals onto the streets and quoted the criminologist, Mr P Sundramoorthy of the University Science Malaysia as noting that gun seizures alone more than doubled since the repeal. We have heard the number of gun cases and that is quite staggering. The same period saw many reports of serious and vicious crimes being committed in Malaysia. We do not want this in Singapore. Singapore remains particularly vulnerable because of our geographical position, our boundaries are porous.",21,423,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00423
2013-11-11-T-014,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"So, the real question in this debate is – what kind of society we want to live in. The Malaysian experience tells us that we cannot afford to take our relatively low crime rates for granted. We, therefore, have to strike a balance between ensuring that our society is protected against serious crimes and ensuring that judicious application of these powers is carried out with a scrupulous and thorough review of each, and every Detention or Suspension Order made. Madam, with that, I support the Bill.",22,424,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00424

Ms Sylvia Lim said, if I remember correctly, she is unable to oppose the Bill under the current circumstances. I would like to clarify does that mean that she supports the extension of the Bill? And Mr Pritam Singh sought a range of clarifications but did not state his position on the Bill.

Many Members have raised a range of issues and it broadly falls within three themes. First, on the need for the CLTPA in today's context; the second on the manner in which the CLTPA has been used, in the release of information pertaining to the use of the CLTPA; and, finally, on the safeguards that govern the use of the CLTPA. I will address these in turn.",1,431,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00431
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, this debate, the extension of the CLTPA for a further five years serves a very important purpose. It allows the Minister to account to Parliament of the nature and extent of use of the Act, and to provide a detailed explanation as to why the Act remains necessary in the prevailing environment.",2,432,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00432
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Its temporary nature is not simply a matter of nomenclature. Rather, it compels a periodic reminder and discussion within Parliament and without on the powers under the CLTPA and the need to review its continued relevance. I, therefore, disagree with Assoc Prof Eugene Tan's characterisation of this process in this debate as a legislative ritual. Far from it, it is a robust debate as, in fact, evident from today's proceedings, that needs to take place every five years, so that Members of Parliament and, indeed, all Singaporeans, fully appreciate the nature of the criminal threats we face and the powers that are needed to maintain public safety, peace and good order that we deeply value as a society.",3,433,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00433
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Let me reiterate the reasons we continue to need this Act. I am glad that Members, in general, acknowledge that we must remain vigilant even as the crime situation improves. As mentioned by Members like Mr Ang Wei Neng, the threats posed by international criminal syndicates involved in illicit activities, such as drug trafficking, have by no means been eradicated. Instead, they are evolving their modus operandi and becoming more sophisticated to evade capture and prosecution. Every time an arrest is made, the syndicates quickly adapt and adjust their operations in response.",4,434,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00434
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The recent experiences of other countries reinforce the dynamic and pernicious nature of this threat. Several Members, Mr Hri Kumar and Mr Vikram Nair, in particular, have cited the example of Malaysia where the Emergency Ordinance was repealed in 2011. However, in just two years, they have found it necessary to restore detention provisions in their laws to bring the worsening situation of violent crime under control.",5,435,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00435
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,Mr Christopher de Souza mentioned the situation in Australia where biker gangs have been responsible for violent crimes such as brazen public shootings and clashes with rival gangs. Tough anti-biker gang laws were recently passed in Queensland to address the lawlessness caused by these established criminal groups.,6,436,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00436
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In Singapore, we cannot afford to merely react to the situation after the impact of a pernicious criminal threat has become fully apparent. We have an imperative to act swiftly and decisively, especially given our circumstances as a small city state. I do not think this is just an argument about Singapore's exceptionalism. It is, I think, an honest assessment of the realities that we face. That is why we need the CLTPA and the powers it affords our law enforcement agencies to deal with such syndicated criminal groups.",7,437,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00437
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Hri Kumar has asked about the relevance of the CLTPA in the future, given that the Ministry of Home Affairs is developing legislation to deal with organised crime, criminal syndicates. An Organised Crime Act is being considered with the view to enhance powers to deal with criminal syndicates and strengthen our ability to disrupt their activities. But I must emphasise that any organised crime legislation will serve to complement the CLTPA and it is not intended to replace the CLTPA, much like we have the Misuse of Drugs Act in the context of drug trafficking. The CLTPA will continue to be necessary and relevant in addressing serious criminal activities, especially where it is not possible to prosecute persons in Court because witnesses are fearful or unwilling to testify.",8,438,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00438
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Assoc Prof Eugene Tan has asked for an articulation of the circumstances and conditions under which the CLTPA may be abolished. I think it is neither possible to do so nor, in my opinion, is it something we should attempt to do. Criminal groups re-organise and re-work themselves constantly. This is the experience of all our law enforcement agencies. And new forms of serious criminal activities evolve in a borderless world, assisted by advances in technology.",9,439,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00439
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Thus far, the CLTPA is and has remained an effective measure in our context to deal with serious criminal elements. So, the circumstances warrant it; they are dynamic. And I think it would be unwise for us to set specific conditions without knowing how the situation would evolve in the future. But I will assure the Member and all Members of this House that the Government will always make a rigorous case based on a thorough assessment of all circumstances and the criminal landscape each time we seek Parliament's approval to extend the CLTPA.",10,440,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00440
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,Several Members have also raised the questions pertaining to the scope and application of the CLTPA. Mr Christopher de Souza has described the CLTPA as a tool that enables our law enforcement agencies to proactively deal with criminal activity that threaten the safety and security of Singaporeans. This is critical in the face of the kind of criminal activities that continue to pose a challenge to our society.,11,441,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00441
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,Assoc Prof Eugene Tan and Ms Sylvia Lim have expressed their concerns for the rights of individuals who may be detained without an open trial. And I think this is a concern and a cautionary note that all Members of this House share and would sound. But the equally valid countervailing consideration is the impact such criminal act can have on victims and the broadest society if they are committed with impunity and the perpetrators not taken to task. We must find a balance between the rights of individuals and the need to preserve public order.,12,442,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00442
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I want to assure Mr Edwin Tong, and indeed all Members, that the powers under the Act are used judiciously against serious criminal activities and where it is necessary to do so as stated in the Act, in the interest of public safety, peace and good order.

2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Neither should we, as Ms Sylvia Lim suggested, interpret public safety, peace and good order as merely referring to danger to life and limb. That is one important consideration. But, indeed, there are many other elements that contribute to an assessment of what constitutes a threat to public safety, peace and good order.",14,444,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00444
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The Act has not been used and not meant for non-criminal matters as Assoc Prof Tan has suggested. The fundamental tenet remains that court prosecution is the first and preferred course of action, and the Act is used in a calibrated and targeted manner only as a last resort.",15,445,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00445
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"These were the same considerations in the decision to use the CLTPA to deal with the members of a match-fixing syndicate in October 2013. While I am unable to go into the specifics of this case – as some Members have observed, because it is still in process – I will address some points that have been raised by Mr Hri Kumar, Mr Ang Wei Neng, Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Pritam Singh in general terms.",16,446,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00446
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Fundamentally, match-fixing syndicates operate no differently from those involved in drug trafficking or unlicensed moneylending. They share some of the most egregious characteristics that render them a threat to public order. Yes, some Members have said they have complex and layered structures, use technology and other means to avoid detection, and are motivated by financial gain. And the implied question is, ""But, so what?""",17,447,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00447
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,They also have links to other transnational criminal syndicates. They are also known to resort to violence and other means to settle scores against those who stand in their way.,18,448,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00448
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"At the same time, the transnational nature of the activities does aggravate the difficulties we have in securing witnesses willing to cooperate and testify against the syndicates in our Courts. This is a fact. We cannot afford to consider match-fixing or transnational crime another country's problem.",19,449,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00449
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Organised crime syndicates often collaborate and have links with syndicates in other countries and are involved in a whole plethora of businesses. If allowed to take root, this kind of criminal activity will cause a profound decay in public order in Singapore.",20,450,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00450
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Ms Sylvia Lim has asked about the extent of collaboration with other jurisdictions in tackling the problem of match-fixing. This is an important point. Our agencies work together with their international counterparts with exchange of information and intelligence. If we receive a request for extradition, and this is allowed for in the law, we will extend our fullest cooperation to other countries in accordance with the law. But it does not change the fact that our agencies need to act decisively to cripple the illegal activities of such syndicates.",21,451,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00451
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I want to caution against taking the view that match-fixing is simply a case of cheating or corruption with no threat to life, limb and security. On that basis, unlicensed moneylending is also simply a financial transaction between two parties. However, we are all well aware of the deeply harmful spillover effects of the scourge of loansharking and associated activities, and the threat that they pose to public safety, peace and good order.",22,452,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00452
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Kumar, Mr Ang and Assoc Prof Tan have also asked whether we can give a more detailed update or even an annual report on the use of the CLTPA. Let me just reiterate some of the facts that I shared in my Second Reading speech. The majority of inmates have been detained for less than four years. Long detentions of over 10 years are only used in exceptional circumstances. There is currently one detainee who has been detained for close to 11 years for being involved in drug trafficking activities.",23,453,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00453
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"From 2009 to 31 October 2013, close to 300 Police Supervision Orders (PSOs) were issued under the CLTPA. This includes persons who have been released from detention in prison.",24,454,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00454
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Assoc Prof Tan has also asked about the recidivism rate of detainees. In general, the recidivism rate of detainees is lower than that of the broader prison population. It could in part due to the PSO regime that we have. However, the key point is that there is a range of provisions and, moving forward, we also intend to release relevant statistics on the detentions under the CLTPA on a more regular basis as part of the Singapore Prison Service Annual Statistics Release.",25,455,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00455
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Ang has also asked if it was possible for MHA to inform the public on the frequency with which the Advisory Committees had summoned and examined witnesses. Madam, the need for Advisory Committees to do so is dependent on the circumstances specific to each case. Hence, such aggregate or average information would not be very helpful. Advisory Committees comprise individuals with legal training. They work independently of MHA, as Mr Edwin Tong has stated. They understand the general rules and the need for adequate evidence. And I assure Members that we give the Committees our full support so that they can do their work.",26,456,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00456
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Finally, Members have also mentioned the need for strong safeguards under the CLTPA. I fully agree with all who have said so. The powers under the Act are wide-ranging and, therefore, we need strong safeguards. I have elaborated on these safeguards earlier, but I think it bears repeating. First, it is an important fundamental safeguard that the Government must seek Parliament's endorsement to extend the CLTPA every five years. It provides for periodic parliamentary scrutiny and ensures that the CLTPA continues to be relevant in the present operating environment. It is also an opportunity for us to remind ourselves that we do not operate in a benign environment, and we must remain vigilant. Second, the assessment of each case is deliberate, with comprehensive checks and balances with several independent parties and communities involved at each stage. Each case is reviewed thoroughly before an order is issued. The order is for a duration of up to one year in the first instance.",27,457,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00457
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Edwin Tong asked how the Minister can be reasonably satisfied that criminal prosecution is not possible. First, the law enforcement agencies themselves know that they need to abide by the safeguards and they investigate each case thoroughly, no different from any other case that they investigate. Specifically, each proposal from the enforcement agencies, together with the evidence that has been gathered, is first scrutinised by senior officials in MHA. The Attorney-General's consent, in his capacity as the Public Prosecutor, is also required for the issuance of orders by the Minister for Home Affairs. There have also been instances where Ministry officials or the Attorney-General has disagreed with the recommendations for detention by the law enforcement agency. Third, the orders are reviewed by Criminal Law Hearing Committees which comprise distinguished members from the community and the legal profession, including former High Court and District Court Judges. Mr Nair's proposal to have at least one former Judge chair each committee is a good one, and we would take this into consideration when looking at how we can improve the system.",28,458,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00458
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The review process is thorough and rigorous. Committee members may examine detainees, investigating officers and witnesses. They have untrammelled access. Detainees are informed of the case against them and have an opportunity to present their case to the Committee or through their legal counsel. On this point, we also note Mr Tong's suggestion for assigned counsel for persons dealt with under the CLTPA. I understand that the Ministry of Law has been generally looking at enhancing criminal legal aid and I think it will be able to announce its position on this soon. Having scrutinised the evidence and the facts of the case, the Committee will submit its recommendations on whether to cancel, vary or confirm the orders.",29,459,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00459
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Members have asked for the number of instances when the final recommendation was in variance with the original Detention Order. This question poses an interesting dilemma. If there were many instances, the conclusion would be that the system is not working. If there were no instances, a similar conclusion would also be drawn. So, the answer really is one that cannot really satisfy the level of curiosity that some Members have expressed. But I would say this. There have been a number of instances where the initial Detention Orders were cancelled and Police Supervision Orders subsequently issued in their place in view of the Committee's recommendations. Each Detention Order is only valid for up to 12 months, and each case is then reviewed annually by a Criminal Law Review Committee. Members of this review committee are different from those of the initial hearing committee. Review committee will similarly submit its recommendations to the President on whether to extend or vary the Detention Order. The President then acts on the advice of the Cabinet. Each extension of the Detention Order is for a period of up to 12 months.",30,460,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00460
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Ang asked how the length of detention is determined. In making its recommendation, the Criminal Law Review Committee considers a number of factors, including the nature and gravity of the offences committed, the detainees' criminal antecedents, conduct and response to prison's rehabilitation programmes and the likelihood of reoffending and continuing to pose a threat to safety and security. The assessment is holistic, specific to the circumstances of each case and each individual, and the various factors need not carry equal weight; not just any single factor outweighs the others. Yet another independent Advisory Committee is the Criminal Law Review Board which reviews all cases of detention beyond 10 years. The Board comprises members who are different from the Review Committee and the Hearing Committee, and this process ensures that cases where persons have been detained beyond 10 years are scrutinised by a separate committee and that they have not been detained longer than necessary.",31,461,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00461
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Ms Sylvia Lim suggested that judicial review cover the merits of detention as well. That has not been the intent of this legislation from its very outset. Parliament has conferred on the Executive the power to issue such Detention Orders and the Judiciary's role is limited to the review of the procedural integrity and rationality of the processes. That is also why we come back to Parliament every five years because of the temporary nature to account to Parliament, for Parliament to vest the authority. Renew the authority that is assigned, to be exact.",32,462,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00462
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"She also drew comparisons with the Malaysian system of detention. The detention provisions within the Prevention of Crime Act in Malaysia have to be renewed by Parliament every five years. The members of the Prevention of Crime Board are appointed by the Yang Di Pertuan Agong for a term not exceeding two years. The Yang Di Pertuan Agong acts in this instance on the advice of the Cabinet. If you contrast this with the Singapore system, Parliament explicitly vests the authority for detention under the CLTPA with the Executive who is then clearly accountable to Parliament for the use of the Act. She has compared this with what is the accountability for a committee appointed for two years in terms of the exercise of powers accorded to it under the Prevention of Crime Act. At the end of the day, it is the system that needs robust safeguards, checks and balances and people of integrity who are involved in ensuring that we are doing the right thing in the right way.",33,463,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00463
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Assoc Prof Tan proposed removing the provisions on essential services in Part III of the CLPTA and incorporating them under other legislations such as those dealing with employment or trade unions. Some clarifications are in order and I agree with the Member that this may not be the most elegant legislative solution. But to clarify, the detention powers under the CLTPA apply judiciously and only in situation, which is quite clear, like the threat to public order. In practice, these powers have not been used for strikes and lock-outs. Second, the provisions on illegal strikes and lock-outs in essential services, unlike those on detention, those who commit an offence under this section, are dealt with through court prosecution, as was the case with the SMRT strike recently. The penalties are also clearly spelt out, which are a fine – maximum of $2,000 – and imprisonment of up to 12 months.",34,464,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00464
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The provisions on illegal strikes and lock-outs sit independently from those on detention. Third, these provisions on strikes and lock-outs in the CLTPA are specific to essential services. They prohibit strikes and lock-outs in three sectors  gas, water and electricity. As for the other essential services such as public transport and air transport, broadcasting and banking, which are listed in the First Schedule of the CLTPA, workmen or employers who wish to take part in a strike or initiate a lock-out must give a 14-day notice period. This notice period is required to ensure minimal or no disruption to services which are necessary for the proper functioning of critical operations in Singapore. These are not provided for in other legislation, such as the Trade Unions Act and the Trade Disputes Act. And I believe that these provisions are still relevant and appropriately placed within this Act at this juncture. Legislation will constantly be reviewed and, if there is an opportunity that is suitable, we will consider the Member's point.",35,465,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00465
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, I want to conclude by thanking Members who have spoken for voicing their support for the extension of the CLTPA. I know that this is a difficult decision. Since its inception, the CLTPA has been essential in allowing our law enforcement agencies to act decisively against evolving criminal threats and they are constantly evolving their modes of operation and manifest themselves in different forms. What remains common across all of these threats, whether it is secret society activities, drug trafficking or other types of criminal syndicates and criminal rogues, the consequential impact on public safety, peace and good order is beyond question. The experiences of other countries underscore the need for the CLTPA. It provides us with appropriate powers which can be used in specific circumstances. In practice, the Act is applied judiciously to a targeted group of persons associated to the activities of a criminal nature and where it is in the interests of public safety, peace and good order. Court prosecution is and will continue to be the norm. Powers under the Act will be used as a last resort. This is why there has to be an elaborate system of strong safeguards and multiple checks and balances to ensure that the Act is used judiciously and the powers not abused in application. I have elaborated at length on this because it is important that Members of this House appreciate that we do not take these powers lightly.",36,466,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00466
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, ultimately, the essence of today's debate is really about ensuring safety and security of Singapore for present and future generations. The CLTPA is an integral part of our efforts to do so. I hope that you will not take it for granted.",37,467,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00467

2013-11-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Thank you, Madam. I would like to seek two clarifications from the Minister. The first relates to the orders made against the four detainees for suspected match-fixing. I believe that they have been involved in activities that were largely committed overseas. I would like to ask the Minister whether the fact that they are being detained under the CLTPA here is because the current international process for cooperation is not efficient enough. Are there gaps which the Government is working to plug, for example, whether it is to increase the speed of information being shared across borders or to increase the number of countries with which we have extradition treaties. I think this is quite important because we want to understand whether this is just an episode that will pass because there will be greater cooperation in the future for extradition overseas or this is going to be something we are living with, which is the current inefficiencies that were reported.",1,469,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00469
2013-11-11-T-014,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim,"The second clarification relates to the safeguards. I think the Minister earlier referred to Mr Vikram Nair's suggestion and he said he was suggesting that a former High Court Judge chair an Advisory Committee. But if I heard him correctly, he was actually suggesting that a current sitting Judge, who is from the judicial branch, actually be involved in the Advisory Committee, which is also in a way what I suggested earlier, except it was in relation to the Judge sitting alone. So, I would like the Minister's comment on that – whether the Government is considering getting a sitting Judge currently in the High Court to be involved in this process, looking at the merits of the Detention Order.",2,470,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00470

2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, first on the level of international cooperation between match-fixing cases  it will be fair to say that all enforcement agencies in the relevant jurisdictions are alive to the challenge and they are working together. We have, for example, in Singapore, the CID and the CPIB which have formed a special investigation unit that is working closely with their counterparts in Interpol and so on, in order to ensure that the collaboration is as deep and extensive as possible.",1,472,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00472
2013-11-11-T-014,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"As the Member would appreciate, there are legal constraints to how much you can do cross borders. Extradition treaties are one aspect of it. I think this is something that will continue to have to be worked on, but I think the problem is well recognised. Its transnational nature necessitates this kind of close collaboration across enforcement agencies. I want to re-state the assurance I gave that we fully cooperate with all international bodies on these sorts of crimes, and where there is a request for extradition or any other form of cooperation, we will do so as provided for under the laws that we have.",2,473,2013-11-11-T-014-S-00473

First, reviewing adequacy of out-of-court compensation settlements in all cases of motor accidents involving death or injury.

And third, reviewing reasonableness of fees charged by solicitors acting for the victims.",3,531,2013-11-11-T-016-S-00531
2013-11-11-T-016,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"These roles were introduced in 1960. The aim was to protect uneducated or lowly-educated motor accident victims from rogue or ""ambulance-chasing"" lawyers, who would exploit such victims for their gain.

This includes ensuring that the compensation amount received by the victim is commensurate with the injuries sustained from the motor accident and that it is adequate.",12,540,2013-11-11-T-016-S-00540
2013-11-11-T-016,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The Public Trustee is not involved at any stage of the compensation process.

In all other cases, compensation will be paid directly to persons entitled to compensation, by either the insurer or owner of the motor vehicle.",21,549,2013-11-11-T-016-S-00549

The feedback from the industry stakeholders is that they would like the Public Trustee to have a continued oversight role in this regard. This is to ensure that the lawyers' fees remain reasonable and do not encroach into compensation sums and, conversely, that the lawyers are fairly remunerated for services rendered. We have taken the feedback onboard and have decided to retain this role.",23,551,2013-11-11-T-016-S-00551

2013-11-11-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, I have some concerns about clause 5 of the Bill which will reduce the Public Trustee's role as the guardian of victims of motor accidents in cases where the claim is settled out of court.",1,558,2013-11-11-T-016-S-00558
2013-11-11-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Under clause 5, section 6 of the Act will be amended in two key ways.",2,559,2013-11-11-T-016-S-00559
2013-11-11-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Firstly, for claimants who are represented by lawyers, settlement sums offered by the defendants or their insurers would no longer need to be approved by the Public Trustee. This means that it will be left to the claimants' lawyers to be the gatekeepers to ensure that their clients get adequate compensation for their injuries and losses. On the one hand, we would expect lawyers to obtain a fair settlement for their clients as it is their duty to do so. This is also logical as there is generally a link between the compensation obtained and the fees lawyers will be entitled to charge. On the other hand, there is the risk of lawyers who may occasionally settle matters quickly due to workload or other considerations. It should be remembered that the clients we are talking about in such accident cases include persons who may not know their rights and rely entirely on professional advice. The current situation of having the Public Trustee as the gatekeeper of compensation adequacy has always added a layer of comfort and protection for such accident victims.",3,560,2013-11-11-T-016-S-00560
2013-11-11-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"From the lawyer's standpoint, too, there is an advantage  retaining the Public Trustee's approval on settlement sums protects lawyers from unjustified complaints that their claimants were short-changed. With the amendments in this Bill, are we not compromising on these aspects?",4,561,2013-11-11-T-016-S-00561
2013-11-11-T-016,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Secondly, under the amendments, the Public Trustee will longer be receiving and disbursing compensation sums and legal costs whether the claimant is represented by a lawyer. Instead, the insurer or the owner of the vehicle who caused the accident will directly pay to the claimant the compensation sum due to him and will also directly pay the legal cost to the claimant's lawyer. The Public Trustee who used to receive and make the payments will no longer be involved. This bypassing of the Public Trustee theoretically carries with it the increased risk that the payments meant for the victim and his lawyer may not be received, for example, where the vehicle owner or insurer fails to effect the payment accordingly or delays the payment. Does the Ministry intend to put in place any safeguards to minimise the risk of non-payment or delayed payment?",5,562,2013-11-11-T-016-S-00562
2013-11-11-T-016,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Sir, the Member has raised two issues  firstly, whether with relinquishing the oversight role, there will be an increased risk to the victims in terms of the compensation amount and, secondly, whether the Ministry intends to put in any safeguards with respect to the timing of the payment by the owner or the insurer.",1,563,2013-11-11-T-016-S-00563
2013-11-11-T-016,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"With respect to the first issue, as I indicated earlier, the relinquishment of the role will only be with respect to those who are represented. As the Member has pointed out, a lawyer is expected to safeguard the client's interest. As a general rule, because the lawyer's duty is to look after the client's interest and to ensure that the client gets an adequate settlement, we think that that role can be played adequately by a lawyer but, at the same time, also in recognition of what the Member had said about the linkage between the lawyer's fees, we have retained the oversight role on the reasonableness of the fees. We feel that these amendments actually strike the correct balance. We arrived at this conclusion after taking in industry feedback and it was felt that the way that the amendments were done would be sufficient to take care of the adequacy of the compensation.",2,564,2013-11-11-T-016-S-00564
2013-11-11-T-016,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"I would add that if there is concern as to whether the lawyer has performed the lawyer's role properly, the victim does have redress.

2013-11-11-T-016,Indranee Rajah,Ms Indranee Rajah,"With respect to the second question as to whether the Ministry will put in place a specific framework, the answer is that we do not think it is necessary for these reasons  with respect to those who are unrepresented, there is no change.

2013-11-11-T-017,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, ""That the Bill be now read a Second time.""",1,573,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00573
2013-11-11-T-017,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),This Bill seeks to make a number of changes to the Road Traffic Act. The key changes relate to  (a) the conditional growth for the taxi fleets of taxi companies under the taxi availability framework; (b) taxation for the registration of previously de-registered vehicles; and (c) measures to improve the operational effectiveness and efficiency of the Land Transport Authority (LTA).,2,574,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00574
2013-11-11-T-017,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Firstly, conditional growth for taxi fleets. Sir, let me first discuss the changes in this Bill to implement the conditional growth criteria for taxi companies.",3,575,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00575
2013-11-11-T-017,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Under the taxi availability framework that was announced in July 2012, taxi companies will have to fulfil minimum standards pertaining to the availability of their taxis during peak hours and the general availability of their taxis on the road, before they can grow their fleet. This is to ensure that existing taxis are better utilised and, hence, better fulfil their public transport role.",4,576,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00576
2013-11-11-T-017,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),Clause 7 of the Bill thus amends section 103 of the Act to enable LTA to determine the maximum number of new public service vehicle licences for each taxi company based on its performance. The amended section 103 also provides for the right of taxi companies to make written representations for LTA's consideration.,5,577,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00577
2013-11-11-T-017,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"LTA had given the taxi industry time to adjust to the new framework after it was announced in July 2012. From August 2012 to December 2013, taxi fleet growth was capped at 2% for all taxi companies, but without conditions. From January 2014, taxi fleet growth for individual taxi companies will still be capped at 2% but will be subjected to the company having met the required taxi availability standards.",6,578,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00578
2013-11-11-T-017,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Two, taxation for the registration of previously de-registered vehicles. Sir, the second set of changes to the Act empowers LTA to collect the relevant vehicle tax, known as the Additional Registration Fee (ARF), upon the registration of previously de-registered vehicles.",7,579,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00579
2013-11-11-T-017,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Currently, the Act only allows the collection of tax at the point of first registration of every vehicle in Singapore. This precludes the second registration of vehicles, namely, after they had been previously de-registered in Singapore. As a rule, de-registered vehicles are not allowed to be brought back into Singapore. However, an exception was made for de-registered vehicles that qualify for the Classic or Vintage Vehicle schemes, if the relevant taxes are paid. Clause 5 of the Bill amends section 11 to allow ARF to be collected for such vehicles.",8,580,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00580
2013-11-11-T-017,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"The third group of amendments, Sir, will improve LTA's effectiveness and efficiency in its operations.",9,581,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00581
2013-11-11-T-017,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Clause 2 allows the LTA to take better enforcement action against car owners who illegally rent out their personal vehicles for use by members of the public for hire and reward. Currently, such rented vehicles may only be regulated under the Act as public service vehicles if they are chauffeur-driven, but not if they are self-driven by the hirers. Clause 2 amends the definition of public service vehicles to include these self-driven rented vehicles so that they will be regulated under the Act.",10,582,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00582
2013-11-11-T-017,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Clause 4 strengthens LTA's ability to enforce against vehicle alterations for fuel tax evasion. The existing section 6A of the Act only allows LTA to prosecute against motorists who alter the fuel gauges in Singapore. LTA is unable to prosecute against motorists who alter the fuel gauge outside Singapore. To address this gap, the new section 6B makes it an offence to leave or attempt to leave Singapore knowing that the fuel-measuring equipment in their vehicles has been altered.",11,583,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00583
2013-11-11-T-017,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Finally, clauses 8 and 9 delegate the power to appoint individual LTA employees to cancel traffic ticket notices and compound offences from the Minister for Transport to the Registrar of Vehicles in person. Sir, I beg to move.",12,584,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00584
2013-11-11-T-017,Lui Tuck Yew,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)],13,585,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00585
2013-11-11-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Deputy Speaker, my speech on the subject of this amendment Bill covers the new section 6B – which creates a presumption that a person in charge of a motor vehicle driven past the Customs checkpoint with a tampered fuel gauge knowingly does so and is liable to be guilty of an offence. The presumption is rebuttable, of course, for example, if it can be proven that the vehicle is shared or driven by a number of people and an accused person is unaware of the fact that the fuel gauge has been tampered with.",1,586,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00586
2013-11-11-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"However, this new section will appear in our Road Traffic Act after Parliament approves it, as a result of another law that has been in place for more than 20 years now – the three-quarter fuel tank rule for Singaporean cars which cross Singapore Customs before entry into Malaysia, as referred to in the amendment Bill, section 136 of the Customs Act. Sir, I do not oppose the amendment Bill but I do ask that the Government conduct a review of the continued relevance and rationale of the three-quarter tank rule.",2,587,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00587
2013-11-11-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"When then Finance Minister Richard Hu introduced the half-tank rule in 1989, the rationale, in his words, I quote, ""was to ensure that the use of petrol pricing to control the usage of roads in Singapore was not bypassed"" because of cheaper petrol in Malaysia. The move was also to staunch the loss of duty on petrol, estimated at $2 million a month. The same rule was amended two years later in 1991 when the half-tank rule was raised to become the three-quarter tank rule.",3,588,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00588
2013-11-11-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, measures to control the usage of roads in Singapore have seen many changes since 1989. In fact, today, the common man does not think of the petrol tax as an inhibitor before buying a car. Instead, it is the two abbreviations – COE and ERP – that are seen to be the primary instruments curbing road usage. These have little, if any, correlation to the rules that determine the entry of Singapore cars into Johor. At the recent 6 November exercise, the price of an open category COE was at $89,001 and, since August this year, Singaporeans have had to pay $6 at three ERP gantries, a number which has since jumped to seven after the levy was raised to $6 at four more gantries this month.",4,589,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00589
2013-11-11-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, like the three-quarter tank rule today, the new section 6B of this Bill, must be seen through the lenses of 2013 and not 1989. Many things have changed since then.",5,590,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00590
2013-11-11-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Firstly, there has been a steady political and economic shift in Singapore's relationship with Malaysia. Only 11 months ago, in December 2012, the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) was actively encouraging MNCs to invest in the Iskandar region in Johor, with The Straits Times reporting that this new approach was because of rising land and labour costs in Singapore. To mitigate this, the EDB saw MNCs siting their higher value and more skilled operations as well as headquarters in Singapore, while their factories operate in the neighbouring countries, where land and labour are relatively abundant.",6,591,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00591
2013-11-11-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"While the EDB's statement covered MNCs specifically, about a week earlier, Minister for Finance Tharman Shanmugaratnam was quoted as saying, I quote, ""There will, over time, also be increasing pressures on our SMEs, because of the shortage of labour in Singapore as well as land"" and it goes on to say, ""Malaysia is a logical hop away, easy in terms of operational flexibility and logistics"".",7,592,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00592
2013-11-11-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, some of our SMEs would receive a shot in the arm if the rationale of the three-quarter tank rule was reviewed or even perhaps reduced to the half-tank level, so as to encourage our businessmen to take further advantage of the cost benefits that can be reaped in Johor, but not in Singapore. Allowing our SMEs to access the market in Johor by removing rules that impede free enterprise would also go some way to encourage greater entrepreneurship amongst younger Singaporeans in particular.",8,593,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00593
2013-11-11-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Secondly, Sir, Malaysian policy has also changed since we introduced the three-quarter tank rule. Singaporeans now do not have access to subsidised Malaysian petrol and can only buy 97-octane fuel or a higher variety, which is not subsidised by the Malaysian government, a law which was passed three years ago.",9,594,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00594
2013-11-11-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Thirdly, Sir, a review of the rationale of the three-quarter tank rule will be in concert with the goals and objectives of the ASEAN Economic Community's 2015 goal of (a) a single market and production base, (b) a highly competitive economic region, (c) a region of equitable economic development and (d) a region fully integrated into the global economy.",10,595,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00595
2013-11-11-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Singapore, as one of the most-open economies in the world, opens its doors to foreigners and businesses and we are known to be one of the easiest places to do business. Singaporean enterprises and Singaporean businesses would greatly benefit if the protectionism manifested by the three-quarter tank rule today is reviewed and Singaporean businesses looking to venture north are not hamstrung by Government policy.",11,596,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00596
2013-11-11-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"A change to the rule would benefit our local SMEs and MNCs and contribute to their enterprise ambitions, no different from the ambitions of hundreds of thousands of Malaysians who come to Singapore to work and for business daily, riding on our comparative advantage.",12,597,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00597
2013-11-11-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In conclusion, Sir, greater people-to-people interaction between Singaporeans and Malaysians can also assist in contributing positively to the Malaysia-Singapore relationship, one that has already premonitioned the construction of a third causeway, a high-speed express link between the two countries and the decision earlier this year between both countries to go ahead to link Johor Bahru and Singapore by a rapid transit system, with the Woodlands MRT station to serve as an interchange station. Singaporean businesses should not be denied the economic opportunities unfolding in Johor by the three-quarter tank rule that contributes to disadvantage some Singaporean businesses.",13,598,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00598
2013-11-11-T-017,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, my request for the Government to review the rationale of the three-quarter tank rule notwithstanding, I support the Bill.",14,599,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00599
2013-11-11-T-017,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Speaker, Sir, let me first declare my role as the Executive Adviser of the National Taxi Association.",1,600,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00600
2013-11-11-T-017,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"LTA should, indeed, put in place indicators that enable the taxi industry to operate competitively and grow its size upon meeting certain conditions.",2,601,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00601
2013-11-11-T-017,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Taxi fares and the supply of taxis were previously deregulated to inject greater competition. The aim is to allow fares to be set competitively and that commuters can enjoy high quality of service. To do so, taxi operators have to comply with the Quality of Service (QoS) standards in call bookings, safety, taxi drivers' conduct and so on.",3,602,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00602
2013-11-11-T-017,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"I would like to propose that determinants to measure taxi operators' ability to increase their fleet size should include how they expand the relief driver pool, how fairly they draft the hiring agreements and what efforts they undertake to look into the welfare of their hirers and relief drivers.",4,603,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00603
2013-11-11-T-017,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"In a truly competitive landscape, taxi operators should be able to do more to provide for their drivers. Currently, operators have the full bargaining power and can terminate the hiring agreements of drivers should they fail to meet the standards. In some sense, operators can ""churn"" the drivers' pool.",5,604,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00604
2013-11-11-T-017,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"For instance, there are currently over 90,000 taxi vocational licence holders but only about 28,000 are hirers and a small number of active relief drivers. As such, taxi operators can possibly access an untapped pool and an ever-growing pool of new vocational licence holders.",6,605,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00605
2013-11-11-T-017,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Other than raising the service standards, taxi availability indicators were recently implemented to get taxi operators to meet peak hour taxi demands and shorten waiting time.",7,606,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00606
2013-11-11-T-017,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"For drivers who are unable to meet this standard, they may have their hiring agreement terminated or penalties imposed by the operators. Taxi hirers are under immense pressure and many struggle to look for relief drivers to assist them.",8,607,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00607
2013-11-11-T-017,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"As such, hirers are squeezed in between, as relief drivers now know that they have been given additional bargaining power. Many have shared with me that, in their experience, relief drivers can determine when they want to drive and at what rental rates they can charge the hirers. As a result, this often leaves the hirers bearing the bulk of the responsibilities.",9,608,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00608
2013-11-11-T-017,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Another example that operators are passing on the higher COE cost is in the form of higher taxi rental. While commuters today express their confusion and unhappiness at the different and higher flag-down fares, many taxi hirers have also expressed their concerns that higher rental fees are affecting their take-home income. To taxi hirers, higher flag-down fares merely offset the increase in rental fees partially while operators continue to maintain their business margin.",10,609,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00609
2013-11-11-T-017,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"Taxi operators should provide more supportive conditions to taxi drivers to help them. They can introduce incentive schemes to motivate the drivers. Having programmes to keep drivers safe, fit and healthy will be welcomed as well. They can also offer assistance programmes to help the drivers who face difficulties in getting relief drivers.",11,610,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00610
2013-11-11-T-017,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"There are valid concerns that operators are fully passing on the taxi availability indicators to the drivers. The National Taxi Association (NTA) had earlier urged LTA to review the taxi availability indicators, set up a mediation system and consider having new taxi vocational licence holders serve as relief drivers for a period of time. I urge that LTA take them into consideration to improve the situation on the ground.",12,611,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00611
2013-11-11-T-017,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"To illustrate, LTA can measure how effective the taxi operators are matching the hirers to a relief driver. A set of clear guidelines can also be developed to regulate the shared responsibilities relating to rental and vehicle maintenance between the hirer and relief driver, and also checking that the operators share in these responsibilities as well.",13,612,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00612
2013-11-11-T-017,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"When their taxi fleet does not meet the minimum mileage requirement, some taxi operators issue warning letters and threaten to remove those drivers who are unable to meet the standards. Eventually, they choose to retain only the drivers who can help them meet the desired KPIs. We should ensure that taxi operators do not merely ""churn"" the drivers so as to fulfil the requirements set by LTA.",14,613,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00613
2013-11-11-T-017,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"For the drivers, we want to develop a steady pool of career drivers who are committed and motivated. They can get good support from the operators to find relief drivers and enjoy a portable scheme whereby they can switch to a different taxi company that offers more attractive terms.",15,614,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00614
2013-11-11-T-017,Ang Hin Kee,Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio),"With some of these proposed amendments and refinements, I believe that LTA can better create an environment where taxi operators can operate competitively, treat their hirers and relief drivers fairly, maintain higher service standards and, finally, meet the conditions to enable them to enlarge their fleet size. With that, Sir, I support the Bill.",16,615,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00615
2013-11-11-T-017,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Sir, I would like to thank the two Members who have spoken on the Bill, firstly, Mr Pritam Singh and then Mr Ang Hin Kee.",1,616,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00616
2013-11-11-T-017,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Pritam Singh had queries with regard to the relevance of the three-quarter tank rule and, as he had said, many things have changed in the intervening years. But I would also hasten to add that many things still remain relevant. And, certainly, in the context of Singapore, ownership and usage restraints need to be taken together, given the land constraints that we are fully aware of in tiny Singapore. Certainly, while we have caps on the growth rate of the vehicles, in terms of the 0.5% growth that we have allowed for over the few years, usage restraints are equally important. And, hence, the ERP, parking charges, as well as fuel cost, are all matters that a motorist would have to take into consideration.",2,617,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00617
2013-11-11-T-017,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Pritam Singh also mentioned the possible benefits to the SMEs. It is unusual that, actually, we have not heard very much from the SMEs or this matter being raised by them in a concerted fashion. They believe that whatever it is there now, is generally a level playing field for the SMEs and it is something that they accept as part and parcel of doing business here in Singapore. I am not so sure, therefore, that, actually, the three-quarter tank rule that the Member had mentioned really disadvantages Singaporeans from benefiting from the growth that is taking place in Malaysia. Otherwise, we will not have seen the kind of investments that we are seeing taking place, for example, in Iskandar.",3,618,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00618
2013-11-11-T-017,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Let me also thank Mr Ang Hin Kee for his comments on the taxi availability standards and his suggestions to improve taxi services. I certainly share his desire to see better and more reliable services for our commuters. This is exactly the reason why we introduced the taxi availability standards and these were developed after a rigorous consultative process with key stakeholders, including the National Taxi Association (NTA).",4,619,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00619
2013-11-11-T-017,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"In fact, the feedback that we have received from taxi drivers who are actually serious about their vocation is that it is not difficult to clock 250 kilometres on their taxis on a regular day, even without a relief driver. This is supported by the data that we have in LTA. But LTA will certainly continue to consult and engage the NTA and other stakeholders as we finetune the availability regime in the years to come.",5,620,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00620
2013-11-11-T-017,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"In response to the suggestion by NTA to help match hirers to relief drivers, LTA had launched an online matching portal in June this year. It has seen a fair take-up rate over the last few months and we certainly encourage more hirers and possible relief drivers to make use of this online portal. And we would be happy to work with NTA to promote this further.",6,621,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00621
2013-11-11-T-017,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"However, LTA has not incorporated requirements on relief driving, such as measuring how well operators are expanding their relief driver pool or matching hirers with relief drivers, into the LTA's taxi availability standards, as Mr Ang had suggested. We do not want to be so prescriptive as to dictate that taxi companies and drivers must operate a two-shift system because we know that some drivers prefer to drive alone.",7,622,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00622
2013-11-11-T-017,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Ang had made a few other suggestions, including how to manage the pool of relief drivers. I think it is also appropriate for NTA, whose mandate is to look after the interests of all its drivers, to take on a more active role on this issue, and to consider mediating between hirers and relief drivers. After all, ""conciliating and mediating differences"" and ""fostering friendly relations and mutual help"" amongst its drivers are also part of NTA's constitution. LTA will be happy to lend support to Mr Ang and NTA on this and his other ideas.",8,623,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00623
2013-11-11-T-017,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"At the end of the day, let me say that we need to find the right balance between the interests of taxi commuters, taxi drivers and taxi companies. The taxi availability framework aims to increase the utilisation of our taxis, so that commuters find it easier to hail a taxi on the road. I know that taxi drivers are trying hard to provide the level of service and availability that commuters want. On the part of taxi companies, I again urge them to work with and help their drivers achieve the service and availability standards, and not expect the drivers to achieve them all on their own.",9,624,2013-11-11-T-017-S-00624

2013-11-11-T-018,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"It is important that employers fulfil their CPF obligations to their employees. This is especially so for lower wage and vulnerable workers to help them save up for their retirement needs, and ensure that they benefit from Government assistance schemes, such as Workfare, which are implemented via the CPF system. Hence, we view non-compliance by employers of the CPF Act seriously and will take firm action against errant employers. This Bill will amend the CPF Act to support enhanced enforcement of the Act. General penalties will be increased and powers of CPF Board inspectors will be strengthened to aid investigations.",2,634,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00634
2013-11-11-T-018,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Other amendments to the Act will provide some flexibility for the CPF Board to address appeals on withdrawal frequency by CPF members above the age of 55, update pledging rules for private property and close Minimum Sum-related schemes which are no longer relevant. Various technical amendments will also be made to streamline the administration of the CPF.",3,635,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00635
2013-11-11-T-018,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Let me first begin with the changes to enhance our enforcement of the CPF Act. Most employers comply with CPF obligations, with more than 97% of employers making their CPF contributions for their employees in a timely manner in a given month. However, while compliance is high, for those Singaporeans who have not received their due payments, it matters. I believe that non-compliance tends to impact the less educated and those who may be earning less, precisely for whom the CPF contributions will help more.",4,636,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00636
2013-11-11-T-018,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Since late 2012, the CPF Board has stepped up enforcement to deter errant employers who do not comply with the CPF Act. This has been complemented by outreach activities to raise awareness amongst employees and employers of their CPF rights and obligations.",5,637,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00637
2013-11-11-T-018,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"The CPF Board and MOM will continue to step up efforts to bring about greater compliance with the CPF Act and Employment Act to better protect employees, including under the WorkRight initiative. The review in penalties under the CPF Act will ensure that the penalties have a stronger deterrent effect on recalcitrant employers.",6,638,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00638
2013-11-11-T-018,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"For offences under the CPF Act for which no specific penalty is prescribed, which include non-payment and late payment of CPF contributions and providing false statements, general penalties are imposed on offenders upon conviction. Currently, for such penalties, the Act prescribes a maximum fine of $2,500 for first offences and a maximum fine of $10,000 for subsequent offences. There is, at present, no minimum fine.",7,639,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00639
2013-11-11-T-018,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"We will increase general penalties to enhance their deterrent effect so that they are commensurate with the severity of the offences. As such, we will amend section 61 of the CPF Act to double the maximum fine for first offences to $5,000. For offences involving payment of CPF employee contributions, we will also introduce a minimum fine of $1,000 for first offences and $2,000 for subsequent offences. All these fines apply per charge. Employers who default on their CPF contributions for months or for more than one employee can face multiple charges, and the total fine will be considerable.",8,640,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00640
2013-11-11-T-018,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"In conjunction with the increase in general penalties, we will also double composition amounts, which are collected for compoundable offences, from $500 per charge to $1,000 per charge. These refer to cases where CPF Board compounds the offence by accepting the composition amount instead of prosecuting the employer if the employer has met certain conditions, such as paying up CPF arrears.",9,641,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00641
2013-11-11-T-018,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Among the small group of recalcitrant employers who repeatedly default on their CPF contributions, there may be Directors or officers of incorporated companies who are not personally liable to pay the CPF arrears owed and, therefore, might not be deterred by the Court fines imposed. We will, therefore, introduce a jail term which can replace or accompany the increased fines. A jail term of up to six months will be applicable to the first offence, and this will be doubled for subsequent offences. The inclusion of a jail term aligns the CPF Act with the Employment Act which also provides for a jail term for labour-related offences.",10,642,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00642
2013-11-11-T-018,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"The vast majority of employers comply with their legal obligations to pay CPF contributions. But for the minority of employers who take advantage of their employees by not paying their CPF contributions, these changes send a clear and strong signal.",11,643,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00643
2013-11-11-T-018,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),Another enhancement we are making to strengthen our enforcement of the CPF Act is to better equip our CPF Board inspectors in their ability to carry out their duties.,12,644,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00644
2013-11-11-T-018,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"With non-traditional work arrangements becoming more prevalent, our CPF Board inspectors are increasingly hampered by employers' complex HR practices. For instance, for cases of non-payment of CPF contributions for outsourced employees, the Board's inspectors may need to obtain relevant documents and records from the company where these employees are working, rather than from the employer of these employees. Such documents and records may include records of wages and attendance logbooks.",13,645,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00645
2013-11-11-T-018,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"In view of this, it is necessary to equip our inspectors with the ability to obtain documents and records from persons other than the employer. Section 5(3) of the Act will be amended to empower the Board's inspectors to obtain documents or records from any person connected with the employment of the workers in the course of an inspection. Inspectors will also be empowered to obtain information, documents or records from any person in the course of an investigation into a specified offence under the new section 5(3A) of the Act. These amendments will aid CPF Board in its enforcement efforts and help the Board protect the interests of employees, particularly those in non-traditional work arrangements.",14,646,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00646
2013-11-11-T-018,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Sir, I will now move on to the next amendment that will give the Board flexibility in handling appeal cases related to withdrawal frequency made by CPF members above the age of 55. Currently, CPF members above the age of 55 are allowed to withdraw balances above their cohort Minimum Sum and the prevailing Medisave Required Amount once within each birthday year, subject to applicable withdrawal rules.",15,647,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00647
2013-11-11-T-018,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"We have seen cases of CPF members who have made a withdrawal within their birthday year, but subsequently request to make another withdrawal before their next birthday for various reasons. At present, CPF Board already has discretion to allow for an additional withdrawal within a year, for example, where it is satisfied that the member has been unemployed for six months prior to his application. That said, there may be other cases where one more withdrawal within the year is merited.",16,648,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00648
2013-11-11-T-018,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"We will, therefore, amend section 15(4) of the CPF Act to provide CPF Board with the flexibility to assess and allow a CPF member to make more than one withdrawal within the same birthday year. However, the amount of money that the member may withdraw will still be based on applicable withdrawal rules.",17,649,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00649
2013-11-11-T-018,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Let me move on to the next amendment that will update the pledging rules in relation to private property owned by a CPF member and one or more persons who are not related to the CPF member. CPF members who own property can choose to pledge their property up to half of the Minimum Sum upon reaching the age of 55, to withdraw cash from the Retirement Account. The CPF Act currently specifies that owners may only pledge their respective shares of their private property if they are related. However, this is incongruent with the policy where non-related singles are allowed to use their CPF savings to jointly purchase a private property under the CPF (Residential Properties Schemes) Regulations since July 2005.",18,650,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00650
2013-11-11-T-018,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"We will, therefore, amend section 15(11A) of the Act to allow a CPF member to pledge a private property jointly owned by the CPF member and any other person.",19,651,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00651
2013-11-11-T-018,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Sir, I will now move on to the next amendment that will give effect to the closure of the Minimum Sum Bank Deposit Scheme (BDS) and the Minimum Sum Plus Scheme (MSPS). Both the BDS and MSPS were introduced in 1987 and 2000 respectively as an alternative to the Minimum Sum Scheme to encourage members to purchase annuities for more retirement income. However, with the introduction of the CPF LIFE scheme, lower bank interest rates and more annuity products granted tax exemption, members' participation in the BDS and MSPS has dropped very significantly over the years. All participating banks and insurers have actually also stopped accepting new deposits or annuity purchases under the BDS and MSPS.",20,652,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00652
2013-11-11-T-018,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Since both schemes have become defunct, amendments will be made to sections 15(6C) and 15B of the Act to cease the BDS and MSPS with effect from 1 January 2014. Members who are already on the BDS and MSPS can continue to remain on their respective schemes.",21,653,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00653
2013-11-11-T-018,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"The other amendments in the Bill are to clarify and streamline the administration of the CPF Act. We will constantly refresh and update the CPF Act based on the feedback provided by the public, and these changes, like many over the years, have been a result of your inputs and suggestions. So, thank you very much and please do continue to let us know how to improve the system.",22,654,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00654
2013-11-11-T-018,Tan Chuan-Jin,The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"Sir, taken in total, the amendments in this Bill will strengthen the compliance with the CPF Act, and refine and update the CPF system for the benefit of members. Sir, I beg to move.",23,655,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00655

2013-11-11-T-018,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Deputy Speaker, the Central Provident Fund (CPF) is definitely one of the key pillars of our unique Singapore system. Over the years, it has gone through many changes and amendments to adapt to the ever-changing needs of our citizens and the labour force.",1,657,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00657
2013-11-11-T-018,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Though the current set of proposed amendments is primarily technical and administrative in nature, it is clearly a result of feedback received, the need to be current, continuous review and also for housekeeping purpose. I am happy to note that the Ministry has given considerable thought to the implementation aspects of the proposed amendments. I support the general thrust of the amendments and would like to raise a few key points stipulated in the proposed amendments for discussion and consideration.",2,658,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00658
2013-11-11-T-018,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Firstly, Sir, the amendment proposed to expand the scope of the inspectors' powers in obtaining information, documents or records in the course of an inspection or where the inspectors has reasonable cause to believe that a specified offence has been committed. This may sound reasonable and logical, Sir, but I would like to request the Minister to clarify and specify the level of expansion and define the term ""reasonable cause"", as stated. How would the Ministry ensure that there are no abuses by officers with these expanded powers? And what is the seniority level of the Inspectors at CPF – because the Minister mentioned about the difficulty faced by them – and how are the officers trained to face such challenges?",3,659,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00659
2013-11-11-T-018,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Sir, as an employee in Singapore, we are also generally familiar with the current rule with regard to the keeping or withdrawing of allowable funds from our CPF accounts once we reach the age of 55. Over the years, we have heard feedback and suggestions from workers for the rule to be more flexible and allow for some margin of discretion with regard to the amount and also to the timing. In this amendment exercise, there is a proposal to empower the CPF Board to determine the conditions for further withdrawals from the member's account when he has attained the age of 55. Sir, I welcome this and request the Ministry to make the process of the decision to be made by the Board to be transparent and properly articulated to the account holders who are affected. Similarly, I would request the Minister to continue to provide CPF Board account holders proper avenues to appeal to the Board, if necessary, or where it is relevant, due to the ever-changing circumstances of the CPF member's life.",4,660,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00660
2013-11-11-T-018,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Next point, Sir. One of the allowable uses of the CPF savings is withdrawal under the Education Scheme. This scheme has helped many Singaporeans to benefit from the savings of their parents for their education. It has always been seen as a positive use of a member's CPF savings. It is obviously seen as an investment for their children and also for the future. Nevertheless, I notice there is an amendment proposed that requires the provision for an undertaking or a guarantee to cover reasonable expenses incurred by the Board in recovering any sum withdrawn under the Education Scheme. So, is there serious difficulty to recover the funds withdrawn under the Education Scheme? That is my first question. And what is the amount that is outstanding? Who is to pay for the cost, as mentioned in this amendment?",5,661,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00661
2013-11-11-T-018,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Sir, we recently saw the report in the media of some 600 employers who committed illegal acts by violating the basic rights of employees. These illegal acts also included the non-payment of CPF contributions to workers and, of course, other violations. So, I welcome the proposed amendment to provide for increased penalties for offences and also to provide for an enhanced penalty for repeat offenders. Honestly, I am exasperated when I hear the excuses given by employers of ignorance of the CPF. The reality is that the CPF has been around for years and it is a very important component of our workers' income. Thus, I find it difficult to accept the ignorance excuse. I would further request the CPF Board to name and shame the recalcitrant employers and even blacklist them from becoming future employers.",6,662,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00662
2013-11-11-T-018,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"On the subject of the primary role of the CPF Board, I wish to reiterate that CPF savings should be seen primarily as savings for retirement. While there is some merit in tapping on CPF savings for housing, investment and education purposes, we must constantly remind CPF members that, for the majority, it is their CPF savings that will support them in their retirement. While there may be temptations to invest CPF savings through various schemes, as a result, we all know, sometimes these are not consistent, and certainly nowhere near what the Board can provide in terms of returns through the CPF savings. I would like to also appeal for the CPF Board to consider looking at ways to improve the returns for our members so that they can also feel that it is good for them to keep the CPF savings for their future.",7,663,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00663
2013-11-11-T-018,Zainudin Nordin,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In conclusion, Sir, I think it is worthwhile for us to continue to remind members to think carefully, before taking any step of using their CPF savings – it is after all their nest egg that they are painstakingly building to finance their retirement years. Sir, I support the Bill.",8,664,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00664
2013-11-11-T-018,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Central Provident Fund is a unique implementation of a national pension and social security system, and plays a critical role in boosting the confidence of Singaporeans in their own financial security, both after retirement and even before. Measures to strengthen the CPF, particularly from the standpoint of compliance by employers, are always timely and welcomed.",1,665,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00665
2013-11-11-T-018,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"In recent weeks, MOM has revealed disturbing trends of non-compliance by employers over the past few years. Although these breaches have not been overwhelming in absolute terms, they have, nonetheless, been significant and increasing.",2,666,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00666
2013-11-11-T-018,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"The figures do not make for pleasant reading. In 2010, S$9.5 million were owed to about 6,000 workers from 2,600 companies. In 2011, about the same amount was recovered for about 10,000 workers from 3,700 companies. And just last year, S$9.4 million was recuperated for close to 7,000 workers from 4,000 companies while a further S$238.7 million was recovered from over 3,000 employers who were guilty of late contributions.",3,667,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00667
2013-11-11-T-018,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"In a reply to my recent Parliamentary Question on how many employers had been found to have violated the CPF Act over the past three years by illegally deducting from their employees' salaries to pay for the employers' contributions, such errant employers were thankfully few and numbered less than 20, but the amount recovered was still close to a quarter of a million Singapore dollars.",4,668,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00668
2013-11-11-T-018,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"It is the right of every Singaporean worker to be paid a fair wage, and it is the responsibility of every employer to ensure that this is so, and it is the duty of the Government to enforce this compliance. CPF monies comprise a significant portion of the wage package, and CPF monies can variously be used during a worker's working life to help pay for housing and education, and also medical expenses. Hence, failure to properly make CPF contributions is actually no different from failure to pay wages, and should, perhaps, be addressed in a similar manner. Perhaps, the Minister could share with the House how the figures regarding the revised fines and penalties were arrived at, and whether the penalties could actually be further aligned with those under the Employment Act, for instance, $3,000 to $15,000 for first-time offenders, and double that for subsequent offences. As the Minister has just mentioned, the jail terms for both the CPF and Employment Act infringements are already becoming increasingly aligned.",5,669,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00669
2013-11-11-T-018,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"I hope that the Ministry will continue to review the penalties for such offences, and calibrate the fines to reflect rising wages, and also to be commensurate with the sums involved and the number of workers affected, so as to send a strong signal of deterrence.",6,670,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00670
2013-11-11-T-018,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"With regard to the expanded powers of enforcement and the WorkRight programme, I hope that both investigation and enforcement activities continue to be improved through continued investments in both manpower expansion and training. I have received good feedback from constituents regarding the WorkRight programme, and it has proved to be a good touchstone for dialogue on both CPF issues and employment rights.",7,671,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00671
2013-11-11-T-018,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Finally, like many in this House and many Singaporeans, I am happy with the amendment which allows increased flexibility with respect to CPF withdrawals by account holders over the age of 55. This is a request which has been raised by more than a few of my constituents over the past few years and I believe that by allowing multiple withdrawals within the same year, while still maintaining the same constraints with regard to Minimum Sums, would encourage more prudent drawouts, as there would be less pressure on the account holder to withdraw more than he might require for the year.",8,672,2013-11-11-T-018-S-00672

While our median household incomes have risen and more have higher salaries, there still are vulnerable groups of Singaporeans who may need more than a leg up over a longer period of time before they can catch up with the rest.",2,682,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00682

2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"I must, however, acknowledge and state for the record that the Government has done quite a bit to help vulnerable Singaporeans, such as the elderly and low-income earners – through Government assistance schemes, such as the Community Health Assist Scheme, GST Vouchers, ComCare and Workfare Income Supplement, to name a few. The Minister for Social and Family Development shared with us in detail earlier today. Nonetheless, with the rising cost of living and inflation in the prices of food, housing and transportation, affordability remains a challenge for the low-income earners whose salaries have not quite increased in tandem with the increase in prices, and for the elderly whose current savings from years of toil and sweat have not quite amounted to much, in relation to today's prices of goods. Hence, there is still room for more to be done to help them.",4,684,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00684

Some residents I met have lamented that from the time they apply for ComCare, they would have to wait for another two to three or even four weeks before they would be given the much-awaited cheque. While they are appreciative of the financial assistance they receive, they also get frustrated with the wait, to the extent that some of them will jump with annoyance at the mere mention of ComCare! As MSF introduces the first 10 Social Service Offices in the heartlands, I hope that the processing and wait time can be improved.",5,685,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00685
2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"I would also like to propose that ComCare assistance be given for a longer duration at any one time – six months instead of the current three months. For many residents whom I have met and who have sought ComCare assistance, three months of financial assistance, in the first instance, is barely enough for them to find a job, wait for the next pay cheque, and settle their arrears or debts, before having a decent amount left over for daily expenses, such as for food and transportation. Most of the time, they would have to reapply and this would incur an even longer period of wait time.",6,686,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00686
2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"To enhance the ComCare assistance given to lower income families, specifically those with school-going children, may I propose that MSF work closely with MOE to identify the children from these families and extend transport and school breakfast vouchers to the children. These are important because the transport vouchers will help mitigate the cost of travelling to and from school and to ensure that the children continue to attend school, while the school breakfast vouchers will help to ensure that they are able to start off their school day with a good and healthy meal, despite the financial difficulties that their families are facing.",7,687,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00687
2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Conversely, I hope that MOE can also refer students who do not attend school regularly or who show signs of malnutrition to MSF so that a follow-up can be made to visit their families to identify those who are vulnerable and who may need further social or financial assistance; in other words, close collaboration between the Ministries and agencies would be very useful.",8,688,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00688
2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Another enhancement is the use of MediSave. I applaud the review of our healthcare financing but I also hope that MOH can grant greater flexibility in the use of MediSave by Singaporeans – not just for hospitalisation or surgical procedures; in other words, recuperative or reactive healthcare expenses – but for preventive healthcare expenses as well. I spoke about this in the Budget debate earlier this year, and as I did then, I would once again implore the Ministry to consider that Singaporeans be allowed to use our MediSave funds for preventive healthcare expenses, such as healthcare screenings, physiotherapy sessions, especially for the elderly, and dental checks, and also for ante-natal medical consultations, in both private clinics and restructured hospitals.",9,689,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00689
2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"One of my residents, Uncle Robert, whom I met during one of my block visits, is one such Singaporean who can benefit from such flexibility in the use of our Medisave funds. Uncle Robert lives with his wife, just the two of them, in a spartan but cosy five-room flat. His three children are all grown up, married and live with their own families. While Uncle Robert and his wife are retirees and hence do not earn any monthly salary, they lead a simple but comfortable life with enough to get by. He insists that he does not want any financial assistance nor does he want to ask from his children. But what he wants is to be able to be independent and spend his own hard-earned money for his needs.",10,690,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00690
2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"When I met him, Uncle Robert shared that although he was asked by his doctor to go for a detailed health screening at the hospital, he had been postponing it as he was certain one check would lead to another and the final hospital bill would be quite substantial for him for out-of-pocket cash payments. He added that he has ""several thousand dollars"" in his MediSave account and all he wants is to be able to finance his healthcare expenses with his own money in his MediSave account.",11,691,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00691
2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),I am sure many of us understand how Uncle Robert thinks. He feels a sense of dignity and independence because he can pay for his own expenses – medical or otherwise. Greater flexibility in the use of MediSave will certainly help seniors such as Uncle Robert to independently take care of their health and well-being.,12,692,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00692
2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Similarly, greater flexibility in the use of our MediSave funds will help expectant mothers mitigate their ante-natal medical expenses – be it at the restructured hospitals or private clinics. Many expectant Singaporeans can benefit from this, such as Mdm Rahimah, one of my residents. She was expecting her second child when she came to see me for financial assistance. She relied on her husband, the sole breadwinner, who worked as a security guard and earned about $1,200 a month, but who also had to pay alimony to his ex-wife and two other children. There was barely enough for Mdm Rahimah and her two-year-old child each month. She did not go for her monthly ante-natal checks as she could not afford it. However, having worked before, she had some funds in her MediSave account and was hoping she could draw down from her MediSave for her ante-natal consultations.",13,693,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00693
2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"At the moment, under the MediSave Maternity Package, up to $450 can be withdrawn from an individual's MediSave account for pre-delivery expenses, such as consultations, ultrasound scans and tests, but only if these were done at the same hospital that they deliver their baby in. The claim for these pre-delivery expenses is made only after delivery at the same hospital – in other words, a reimbursement claim structure that requires upfront cash payment first. So, for someone such as Mdm Rahimah, this is difficult.",14,694,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00694
2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"I hope MOH would consider granting greater flexibility for our expectant mothers to draw from their MediSave account to pay for their ante-natal medical expenses after each consultation, visit or test, whether at polyclinics, private clinics, or hospitals which may be different from the one they would eventually deliver their baby in, instead of the current reimbursement claim structure that requires upfront cash payment.",15,695,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00695
2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"In addition, I would like to suggest that the withdrawal limit for ante-natal or outpatient consultations or treatments by expectant mothers be increased to at least $600. In the spirit of encouraging and helping Singaporeans to have more children, I hope the Ministry will seriously consider making these proposed changes. A higher quantum would be appreciated for sure.",16,696,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00696
2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"The introduction of MediShield Life for all Singaporeans is very much welcomed. Residents I spoke to have expressed their support for it as this would help ensure all Singaporeans have a medical safety net to fall back on should medical expenses be more than what their MediSave or out-of-pocket cash payments can cover. Even younger and more affluent Singaporean residents I met have expressed their willingness and support for pre-payment of premiums while they are still young or while they can afford it. So, this is good news.",17,697,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00697
2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"However, one concern raised by specifically older residents and those with lower income, is whether they can afford the premiums for MediShield Life. This concern does not just come from older Singaporeans or those with relatively lower income, but several middle income earners who have more dependants to support – such as young children, ageing parents or family members with special needs.",18,698,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00698
2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"The Pioneer Generation Package is a good start to help older Singaporeans pay the MediShield Life premiums, but I would like to urge the Government to consider providing premium subsidies to these other groups of Singaporeans – the lower income earners and the middle income earners with more dependants to support.",19,699,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00699
2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"It is heartening to hear that the Government will convene a committee to look into the premium and payout structure of MediShield Life. But in order to help Singaporeans adjust in the initial period when MediShield Life is introduced, the Government can consider providing some form of financial support to those who need it. Yet, another consideration is to increase the Medisave withdrawal limits for each Singaporean so that the premiums for MediShield Life can be paid fully from our Medisave funds.",20,700,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00700
2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"While it is recognised that the Government has improved policies and programmes with regard to social and financial assistance, the implementation and delivery of such assistance can be enhanced further.",21,701,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00701
2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"For one, accessibility, as spoken by Members earlier today, of such assistance can be improved, where barriers to seeking assistance can be kept to a minimum or eliminated altogether. Easy access to such assistance will make it less frustrating for those who need it and, at the same time, help to preserve their dignity and sense of hope.",22,702,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00702
2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Next, the Government can do more to ensure affordability for Singaporeans. Social and financial assistance schemes can be reviewed regularly, to take into account current income and cost-of-living trends. And for low-income families who are plagued by illnesses or extenuating circumstances, or those with young, school-going, or elderly dependants, additional support can be provided. Managing the cost of living and continued affordability of services is important to such families, and any additional help by the Government will certainly be needed.",23,703,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00703
2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Third, the Government can provide greater flexibility in assessing the merits of each case applying for social or financial assistance, taking special circumstances into account when determining eligibility and the level of support to be rendered. This is so that families in genuine need can receive appropriate help even if they do not fit the criteria that have been set or only qualify for minimal help. Frontline staff can also be trained to assess such needs and exercise flexibility at the point of application for assistance.",24,704,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00704
2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"In addition, greater flexibility in the use of one's social security savings, in this case, the use of Medisave for preventive healthcare, will develop a sense of independence and self-worth among our people. For all we know, it may just pave the way for better healthcare in the long run.",25,705,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00705
2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Finally, there can be better coordination among the Ministries, Government agencies and organisations that extend social and financial assistance to those in need and who are more vulnerable in our society. Better coordination will not just lead to greater efficiency but also ensuring that the assistance rendered is more effective and targeted and, at the same time, reduce frustration and anxiety among the beneficiaries.",26,706,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00706

For the low-income group, increases to the cost of daily necessities, housing and transportation will continue to pose challenges because their salaries do not increase in tandem with the increase in the price of goods. For the elderly, the savings that they accumulated over the years through all their hard work and toil will now not amount to much, compared to the increase in the daily expenses and medical costs.",29,709,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00709
2013-11-11-T-020,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"While I concur that the Government provided many assistance schemes for these groups, there is still room to enhance the assistance given to ensure that those who really need help will be given help. One example is the recently introduced MediShield Life. Many of my residents support the MediShield Life Scheme but some are worried whether they will be able to afford the premiums to this scheme, especially those from the low-income group, the elderly and those from the middle income but have many dependants, like small children, elderly parents or family members with special needs. I hope that the Government will help these groups whether through a Pioneer Generation Package, premium subsidies or by increasing the MediSave withdrawal limits so that the MediShield Life premiums can be paid fully from the MediSave funds.",30,710,2013-11-11-T-020-S-00710

2013-11-11-T-023,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"The prospect of a tapering of the quantitative easing (QE) programme in the US has led to volatility in financial and currency markets in recent months. Part of the liquidity arising from QE in the advanced economies has come to the region in the form of short-term capital flows. In anticipation of the tapering of the QE programme in the US, such capital flows have reversed, resulting in a depreciation of regional currencies.",1,761,2013-11-11-T-023-S-00761
2013-11-11-T-023,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"While Singapore's trade-weighted exchange rate has also experienced some volatility, it remains comfortably within the policy band.

2013-11-11-T-023,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Looking ahead, the actual tapering of the QE programme is likely to take place gradually, in tandem with a strengthening of underlying economic conditions in the US. As a result, financial and currency markets are likely to adjust to the QE tapering in an orderly manner, although we could continue to see some volatility in the markets in the run-up to the Federal Reserve's decision. The impact on our exports to the US and other markets will also be small, as global growth is not expected to be significantly affected by the tapering.",3,763,2013-11-11-T-023-S-00763
2013-11-11-T-023,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Mr Gan has expressed concerns that the depreciation of regional currencies against the Singapore dollar could affect our competitiveness. In this regard, it is important to note that the exchange rate is only one of a number of factors affecting our exporters' ability to secure orders and gain market share. Singapore's trade-weighted exchange rate is the instrument of monetary policy to secure price stability. It cannot be used as a tool to gain export competitiveness. To enhance Singapore's competitiveness over the longer term, the Government will press on with ongoing efforts to restructure the economy, and help firms improve productivity and build up innovative capacity. This will, in turn, ensure healthy job creation and wage growth for Singaporeans over the long term.",4,764,2013-11-11-T-023-S-00764

However, the Government is mindful of the risks of a more disorderly process of QE tapering. In particular, if the QE tapering is done prematurely or if financial markets overreact to the QE tapering leading to a sharp spike in interest rates, the US economy could stall. This could adversely affect our exports to the US. The sharp pullback in financial market will also affect the sentiment-sensitive cluster of our finance sector, including stock broking and fund management activities. At this juncture, however, the risk of such a scenario is low.",5,765,2013-11-11-T-023-S-00765

It is only for the PIC Bonus and cash payout that businesses must have at least three local employees to qualify. The important point here is that these are both cash benefits, not tax deductions. Given the risk of abuse for a broad-based cash scheme, the condition of at least three local employees is necessary. As a result of this condition, the risk of abuse is significantly reduced and we can, therefore, incorporate features, such as more timely and regular payouts, to benefit genuine businesses.",2,782,2013-11-11-T-027-S-00782

Under this framework, the Government, instead of the operator, would own all operating assets and the associated risks for major capital asset investments. This allows us to be more responsive to changes in demand and public expectations, and injects greater contestability in the industry by lowering barriers to entry. It will allow us to better work with the operators to deliver a high level of service for rail operations. As for the existing rail licences, over the longer term, we would like to transit both SBST and SMRT to the new framework.",1,797,2013-11-11-T-030-S-00797
2013-11-11-T-030,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"For the bus sector, we have started to experiment with competitive tendering on a small scale, with tenders called for City Direct services and Peak Period Short Services. This has given us some room to raise bus service levels and help us consider doing more, larger scale competitive bus tendering in the future, as outlined in our Land Transport Master Plan. With competitive bus tendering, the right to run these routes is given to the bus operator best able to deliver the services specified by the Government at a cost-competitive price, enabling us to deliver better service levels at affordable fares. Separately, we are also working together with the PTOs to trial the Quality Incentive Framework in order to further improve reliability of bus services so that bus commuters can reduce their waiting times at bus stops. This will also help us incorporate a suitable quality incentive component when we embark on competitive bus tendering in the future.",2,798,2013-11-11-T-030-S-00798
2013-11-11-T-031,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan,asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether the recent phone spying incidents between the US intelligence service and European leaders have any implications on Singapore's own national security interests.,1,799,2013-11-11-T-031-S-00799
2013-11-11-T-031,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"This is a serious issue which impacts on the national security of countries. We have seen the media reports and are following developments closely. However, we will not comment on media reports that we are unable to verify the facts and could be speculative. Nevertheless, MFA has been informed by our security agencies that we continue to keep a close watch on any development that may have security implications for Singapore and we will take appropriate action as needed.",1,800,2013-11-11-T-031-S-00800
2013-11-11-T-032,Nicholas Fang,Mr Nicholas Fang,asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether the recent bombing incidents in Myanmar pose a threat to the country's chairmanship of ASEAN in the year ahead.,1,801,2013-11-11-T-032-S-00801
2013-11-11-T-032,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,The bombing incidents which resulted in casualties were deplorable. Myanmar is fully aware of its role and responsibilities as ASEAN Chair in 2014. Myanmar has commenced early and extensive preparations for its ASEAN chairmanship. It understands that the security of all visitors is a top priority of the Myanmar Government. Singapore will continue to support Myanmar's chairmanship and assist in whatever way we can. We have full confidence in the Myanmar Government's seriousness and ability in ensuring the security of its citizens and visitors. We are working closely with other ASEAN member states to ensure that Myanmar's ASEAN chairmanship will be a success.,1,802,2013-11-11-T-032-S-00802

2013-11-11-T-033,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"The Government adopts a pragmatic and light-touch approach to regulating Internet content. The Internet Code of Practice allows MDA to work with Internet Service Providers to block certain sites which contain prohibited content. We recognise that site blocking is not a perfect way of denying access to prohibited content, as it can be circumvented. Besides, there are many sites with undesirable content on the Internet and it is not practical to block every one of them. The Media Development Authority (MDA), therefore, blocks a limited number of sites as a symbolic statement of the types of content which the community is opposed to.",1,805,2013-11-11-T-033-S-00805
2013-11-11-T-033,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"The Ashley Madison website, however, stands out. It aggressively encourages and facilitates extramarital affairs and has declared that it will specifically target Singaporeans. For example, its founder gave an interview to a local newspaper and, according to reports, intends to fly into Singapore to launch the Singapore site in the week of 17 November.",2,806,2013-11-11-T-033-S-00806
2013-11-11-T-033,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"It is against the public interest to allow Ashley Madison to promote its website in flagrant disregard of our family values and public morality.

2013-11-11-T-033,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"The Member also asked whether we would permit publicity or advertisements for such services. Advertising in Singapore is largely self-regulated by the industry through the Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore (ASAS), an advisory council to the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE). MDA will work with ASAS to discourage advertisements of such services. In the case of Ashley Madison, it is unlikely that it will be taking up any advertisements in our local media now that access to its site has been blocked.",5,809,2013-11-11-T-033-S-00809
2013-11-11-T-034,Janil Puthucheary,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"asked the Acting Minister for Manpower (a) what is the current percentage of HDB homeowners who have to pay their Home Protection Scheme (HPS) premiums in cash; (b) what percentage of homeowners above 55 years old are not able to pay their HPS premiums; (c) whether the Ministry will consider allowing the use of CPF members' children's accounts for the payment of these premiums should the member's account have insufficient funds; and (d) whether the current provision of only allowing the use of a spouse's account be liberalised, especially for divorced individuals for whom the spousal option is no longer valid.",1,810,2013-11-11-T-034-S-00810
2013-11-11-T-034,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,HDB flat owners who are using CPF savings to service their monthly loan instalments are required to take up the Home Protection Scheme (HPS) or an equivalent mortgage reducing insurance. There are also HDB flat owners who are not using CPF savings to service their monthly loan instalments but chose to take up HPS. About 3% of HPS policy holders on the annual premium plan paid for their premiums partially or fully in cash this year. About 4% of HPS policy holders 55 years old and above on the annual premium plan had their coverage lapse due to non-payment of the premium.,1,811,2013-11-11-T-034-S-00811
2013-11-11-T-034,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The HPS premium is deducted automatically from the Ordinary Account (OA) of CPF members. For those with insufficient OA savings, a grace period of two months is provided for them to make their premium payment. During the grace period, any new OA contributions are channelled first towards meeting HPS premium payments and then monthly loan instalments, to minimise lapses in coverage. CPF members are also notified to make cash top-ups to their OA, as required, to make up the shortfall for the HPS premium. If their children wish to assist with making premium payments, they can do via this route. CPF members can also choose to tap on the OA savings of their spouse, who must also be a co-owner of the flat, to pay for the premium.",2,812,2013-11-11-T-034-S-00812
2013-11-11-T-034,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We will study the feasibility of using non-spouse co-owners' OA savings for the payment of HPS premiums, without affecting the payers' own retirement adequacy. We are also working with MND to study other options to help HPS policy holders who face difficulties in paying their HPS premiums to minimise lapses in HPS coverage.",3,813,2013-11-11-T-034-S-00813
2013-11-11-T-035,Laurence Lien,Mr Laurence Lien,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether, in view of other Asian economies developing an official poverty line, the Government will review its stance on not having one in Singapore.",1,814,2013-11-11-T-035-S-00814
2013-11-11-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The Government has been stepping up efforts to support Singaporeans who need help. We have chosen to have broader definitions of groups we seek to help, clear criteria to help us identify them and appropriate assistance schemes for them. For essential needs, such as housing and healthcare or developmental areas, such as early childhood development and education, our subsidies cover a wider group of Singaporeans, with higher levels of subsidies for the lower income. On top of these, programmes, such as Workfare and ComCare, provide additional assistance to a smaller group of low-income Singaporeans who need extra support.",1,815,2013-11-11-T-035-S-00815
2013-11-11-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Information on the criteria of the various schemes is made known, and the numbers of people helped are regularly published or announced. Household and worker incomes are also publicly available. Collectively, such information provides some insights on the numbers and needs of the lower income in Singapore.",2,816,2013-11-11-T-035-S-00816

2013-11-11-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We have decided to have different criteria to identify groups of Singaporeans who require support, depending on the purpose. In other words, we have multiple lines of assistance instead of a single poverty line. We believe this approach is more flexible. It allows us to extend assistance to more people and tailor assistance to different groups and needs",4,818,2013-11-11-T-035-S-00818
2013-11-11-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"A single official poverty line to identify the ""poor"" or to assess the efficacy of our schemes is one-dimensional. It has limitations in informing policies as it does not take into account the differing nature of needs, such as housing, health, employment, family issues. Neither does it provide useful information on the depth or intensity of needs of low-income families.",5,819,2013-11-11-T-035-S-00819
2013-11-11-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Also, a single poverty line is not without potential downsides, as seen from the experience of some countries. For some, it has become the single determining line for different help schemes, leading to a ""cliff effect"" where those below the line are guaranteed a whole range of help and those above receive none, regardless of actual needs. There are also concerns regarding social stigmatisation that can result from those who fall under the line being labelled as poor or needy.",6,820,2013-11-11-T-035-S-00820
2013-11-11-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"There will always be a segment in our society who are vulnerable and, despite their best efforts, need help to cope. The Government is committed to do more to help them. We will continue to review our assistance schemes regularly so that they remain relevant. We will also continue to develop different indicators to improve our understanding of the numbers and needs of low-income families in Singapore.",7,821,2013-11-11-T-035-S-00821
2013-11-11-T-035,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,The Government cannot do this alone. We will work with community organisations and kind-hearted Singaporeans who have been playing a crucial role in helping the needy in Singapore.,8,822,2013-11-11-T-035-S-00822
2013-11-11-T-036,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,asked the Prime Minister whether there are any plans to institute a capstone project for potential citizens to undertake at the end of the Singapore Citizenship Journey (SCJ).,1,823,2013-11-11-T-036-S-00823
2013-11-11-T-036,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong (for the Prime Minister),"Integration is a long-term journey for immigrants, whether in Singapore or elsewhere. Our new immigrants' sense of rootedness and belonging to Singapore and adaptation to the Singaporean way of life cannot be achieved through a single programme or project. These take time to develop and are influenced by their daily experiences in the community, schools and workplaces.",1,824,2013-11-11-T-036-S-00824
2013-11-11-T-036,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong (for the Prime Minister),"Hence, the focus of the Singapore Citizenship Journey (SCJ) has been to facilitate our new citizens' on-going efforts to integrate into Singapore society, by fostering relations with their local community and encouraging active involvement. Some SCJ participants have gone on to participate more deeply in community activities or volunteer their time and resources to various causes. The personal ties they form with the local community help to strengthen their commitment to Singapore and their identification with fellow Singaporeans. This ground-up approach is more effective and sustainable than a centrally-directed capstone project, as it takes into account the varied needs and interests of new citizens, as well as the local communities in which they live.",2,825,2013-11-11-T-036-S-00825

As at end-2012, the total arrears due from patients that exceeded two months amounted to about 2.5% of the public hospitals' total operating expenses. These figures include arrears brought forward from prior years. They also include patients who are paying their outstanding bills by instalments, or are awaiting assessment for financial assistance by the hospitals.",1,839,2013-11-11-T-040-S-00839
2013-11-11-T-040,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"A significant part of the arrears are eventually recovered or paid up over time, leaving a smaller portion amounting to about 1% of total operating expenses that becomes bad debt and have to be written off eventually. In some instances, this could be due to the patient remaining uncontactable despite repeated attempts, or even due to disputes regarding the treatment.",2,840,2013-11-11-T-040-S-00840
2013-11-11-T-040,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The trend of arrears has remained similar over the last five years and do not suggest increasing unaffordability of healthcare bills.

2013-11-11-T-041,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"The resulting impact of traffic accidents can differ greatly depending on factors, such as location, severity of accident, road and weather conditions. In cases where one or two lanes remain passable, TP and LTA will manage the traffic flow such that there are minimal disruption and inconvenience caused to other road users. TP officers may be despatched to assist with traffic regulation. Traffic alerts will also be issued via various channels such as LTA's signs and website, smartphone mobile applications, and radio broadcasts to pre-warn motorists to avoid travelling along the affected stretch of road.",2,844,2013-11-11-T-041-S-00844
2013-11-11-T-041,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Depending on the ground situation, TP may implement an active road diversion plan to divert traffic to alternative routes to further ease the congestion. In these instances, the diversionary points will depend on carriageway capacity of the peripheral roads, traffic conditions and other prevailing circumstances. At the same time, TP and LTA will strive to process the traffic accident scene quickly and make roads passable in the shortest possible time. For instance, the LTA has tow trucks on standby to swiftly move accident vehicles to road shoulders for expressway accidents to minimise traffic impact and avoid prolonged congestion.",3,845,2013-11-11-T-041-S-00845

2013-11-11-T-042,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Another common appeal from SMEs is to be able to retain experienced staff for longer periods. They may have been unable to do so because they could not obtain the skilled R1 status for their experienced Work Permit Holders (WPHs), which would have allowed them to stay longer. This is why we introduced the market-based skills framework in July 2013 to allow Services WPHs to attain skilled status if they earn at least $1,600 and have four years of working experience in Singapore, even if there was no training course for that occupation. Employers can then retain these skilled WPHs for up to 18 years, up from the maximum of 10 years for unskilled WPHs. Employers will also enjoy levy savings, as the levy for skilled WPHs is lower than that of unskilled WPHs.",3,850,2013-11-11-T-042-S-00850

2013-11-11-T-043,Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,"asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) if he can provide an update and assessment of the WTO talks on global trade liberalisation and Singapore's position vis-a-vis the failed Doha round; (b) how does the proliferation of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), especially in Asia, complement and undermine the WTO trade system notwithstanding their being ""WTO-plus""; and (c) what mechanisms are in place to strengthen local business support for FTAs and facilitate their being able to benefit from the various FTAs that Singapore is a party to.",1,852,2013-11-11-T-043-S-00852
2013-11-11-T-043,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"The WTO is active in trade negotiations, although the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) faces challenges. Several attempts have been made since the DDA's near successful conclusion in 2008 to try to take the negotiations forward. WTO Members are currently working intensively on three of the DDA issues, namely  (a) Trade Facilitation; (b) Agriculture; and (c) Development. If these efforts yield good outcomes at the WTO's Ninth Ministerial Conference (MC9) in Bali from 3 to 6 December 2013, there could be renewed momentum on other DDA issues in the future.",1,853,2013-11-11-T-043-S-00853
2013-11-11-T-043,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Notwithstanding the progress of negotiations, the WTO is more than just the DDA. The WTO also provides a predictable, transparent, and rules-based global trading environment. The regular work of the WTO prevents trade protectionism through vigilant monitoring of WTO members' trade protectionist measures and by enforcing trade rules via the WTO’s dispute settlement mechanism. Such work is significant in contributing to global trade liberalisation.",2,854,2013-11-11-T-043-S-00854
2013-11-11-T-043,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,FTAs can complement and support the WTO. They are building blocks to the multilateral trading system. The benefits of economic openness through the various FTAs and regional links contribute to maintaining momentum for global trade liberalisation.,3,855,2013-11-11-T-043-S-00855
2013-11-11-T-043,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"With this in mind, Singapore has 20 bilateral and plurilateral FTAs with our trading partners in force. IE Singapore undertakes a number of initiatives to create awareness and promote the use of FTAs to our business communities. For example, IE Singapore works closely with Trade Associations and Chambers such as the Singapore Business Federation to conduct FTA seminars and workshops. Through its FTA Certificate Programme, IE Singapore also provides structured training to companies and consultants to help them build in-depth FTA expertise and capabilities.",4,856,2013-11-11-T-043-S-00856
2013-11-11-T-043,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"For companies which need customised advice on how to take advantage of FTAs or overcome implementation problems, IE Singapore provides free one-to-one consultations. MTI and IE Singapore also continually seek company feedback on FTA-related issues, with a view of including these in subsequent reviews and negotiations, to ensure that Singapore's FTAs remain relevant and useful for business communities.",5,857,2013-11-11-T-043-S-00857
2013-11-11-T-044,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry has studied the impact of the growth of the car leasing market on COE pricing as car leasing is used as a means by distributors and consumers to avoid recently implemented car loan restrictions.,1,858,2013-11-11-T-044-S-00858
2013-11-11-T-044,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The Government has been monitoring developments in the car leasing market. Private hire cars, which are used either for short-term rental or long-term leasing, make up 6.9% of all new car registrations in the seven-month period since the implementation of car loan restrictions in end-February 2013. This figure was 4.7% for the same period last year and 5.6% for 2011. It is unlikely that this moderate growth of the car rental and leasing market has had a significant impact on COE prices.",1,859,2013-11-11-T-044-S-00859
2013-11-11-T-045,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what further measures are planned to discourage or penalise the use of plastic bags by consumers and commercial outlets; (b) whether the Ministry plans to introduce legislation to that end; and (c) what improvements to the waste management infrastructure are planned for the future in this regard.,1,860,2013-11-11-T-045-S-00860
2013-11-11-T-045,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The improper disposal of non-biodegradable plastic bags is a threat to global ecosystems. For example, they clog up drainage systems; pollute beaches; damage marine and bird life; and accumulate in ever larger quantities in the oceans. Fortunately, this is not a problem in Singapore because of our waste-to-energy incineration plants which ensure that all properly disposed plastic bags do not despoil our environment. Our approach to plastic bags is therefore based on the concept of avoiding overconsumption and reducing waste.",1,861,2013-11-11-T-045-S-00861
2013-11-11-T-045,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,We therefore welcome the efforts of retailers and environmental groups to encourage consumers to either bring their own bags or reduce the use of plastic bags. Residents can also deposit plastic bags into recycling bins which have been provided island-wide in convenient locations.,2,862,2013-11-11-T-045-S-00862
2013-11-11-T-045,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Furthermore, we encourage the re-use of plastic bags. For example, all households should reuse plastic bags for their refuse, as this helps ensure good public hygiene. Given our unique circumstances, there is no need for legislation on this specific issue apart from our existing laws against littering.",3,863,2013-11-11-T-045-S-00863
2013-11-11-T-046,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the number of teaching and non-teaching hours that teachers and head of departments are required to fulfil in a week respectively; (b) what is the breakdown in the types/areas of responsibility and the time allocated for the areas that each teacher has to undertake; (c) what is the number of teachers who have resigned over the past five years; and (d) whether the Ministry tracks how many of these resignations are a result of workload-related issues.,1,864,2013-11-11-T-046-S-00864
2013-11-11-T-046,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The workload of our teachers varies across the year, depending on whether it is peak or non-peak periods. Over the entire year, our teachers teach, on average, about 15 hours per week. To deliver classroom teaching effectively, teachers also spend approximately twice as much time on teaching-related duties such as preparing for lessons, providing remediation for weaker students, setting and marking of homework and examinations.",1,865,2013-11-11-T-046-S-00865
2013-11-11-T-046,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Because of our focus on holistic education, teachers also run Co-Curricular Activities and school-based programmes for the holistic development of our students, as well as devote time to pastoral care and parent engagement.",2,866,2013-11-11-T-046-S-00866
2013-11-11-T-046,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Our heads of department have slightly lower teaching load, at an average, over the entire year, of 11 hours per week. This is because they have additional administrative and leadership responsibilities, such as planning and coordinating departmental programmes, allocating resources, as well as developing and supervising departmental staff.",3,867,2013-11-11-T-046-S-00867
2013-11-11-T-046,Heng Swee Keat,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The annual resignation rate for teachers has remained low at around 3% over the past five years. In our exit interviews and surveys, workload has not been cited as a major reason for leaving the Education Service. Nonetheless, we will continue to monitor the workload of teachers through internal employee feedback channels to ensure that workload is maintained within reasonable levels.",4,868,2013-11-11-T-046-S-00868
2013-11-11-T-047,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs whether the police will impose licensing conditions on organisers of sporting events around the Nicoll Highway/Tanjong Rhu area or other parts of Singapore to ensure that organisers do not create noise nuisance or play loud music in the early hours of the morning that disturb the rest hours of residents living near the area.,1,869,2013-11-11-T-047-S-00869
2013-11-11-T-047,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Under URA's land use plan, the Marina Bay area, which includes Tanjong Rhu, the new Sports Hub and Gardens by the Bay as well as the bay itself, is being developed for the arts, culture and sports.",1,870,2013-11-11-T-047-S-00870
2013-11-11-T-047,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Organisers are required to seek URA's approval to hold sporting events in the Marina Bay area. In addition, if a sporting event involves the transmission of recorded music or performances of general entertainment, a public entertainment licence issued by the Police is required.",2,871,2013-11-11-T-047-S-00871
2013-11-11-T-047,Teo Chee Hean,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"In approving the public entertainment licence, Police will impose noise mitigating measures as part of the licensing conditions, such as restrictions on event hours and the number of audio speakers allowed. The organiser is also requested to engage the stakeholders in the area, including the Management Committees of nearby condominiums, to ensure that potential disamenities and inconveniences created by the events are kept within acceptable levels. Event organisers who fail to comply with the licensing conditions may be prosecuted. The licensee, if convicted, is liable for a fine of up to $10,000.",3,872,2013-11-11-T-047-S-00872
2013-11-11-T-048,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"asked the Acting Minister for Manpower what efforts have been taken to encourage service providers, like companies in the cleaning sector, to adopt best sourcing practices rather than cheap sourcing.",1,873,2013-11-11-T-048-S-00873
2013-11-11-T-048,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"With more companies outsourcing their non-core functions, the Government has been working closely with our tripartite partners to promote best sourcing.",1,874,2013-11-11-T-048-S-00874
2013-11-11-T-048,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Recognising that the business and employment practices of service providers are shaped by the outsourcing practices of service buyers, the Tripartite Committee for Low Wage Workers and Inclusive Growth (TriCom) has focused on encouraging service buyers to outsource responsibly and adopt best practices when doing so.",2,875,2013-11-11-T-048-S-00875
2013-11-11-T-048,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"To help businesses successfully implement best sourcing, the TriCom released the updated Tripartite Advisory on Best Sourcing Practices in 20128, which contains examples of best sourcing practices that can help draw out better outcomes from service providers and improve the welfare of their workers. This was accompanied by a step-by-step best sourcing implementation guidebook, which included examples of clauses that can be inserted in tender requirements, scoring templates for tender evaluations and sample employment contracts that service buyers can use to implement best sourcing. A Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) training module was also rolled out to build up the best sourcing capabilities of procurement officers.",3,876,2013-11-11-T-048-S-00876
2013-11-11-T-048,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Beyond these initiatives, NTUC's Unit for Contract and Casual Workers (UCCW) provides companies with grants of up to $150,000 under the Best Sourcing Initiative (BSI) funding scheme to help defray the initial costs of incorporating best sourcing into their procurement practices.",4,877,2013-11-11-T-048-S-00877
2013-11-11-T-048,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In addition, the Government has put in place accreditation and grading schemes that make it easier for service buyers to identify the better service providers and to promote higher service standards among providers. For example, NEA's Clean Mark Accreditation Scheme was enhanced in 2012 to encourage cleaning companies to aim for continuous productivity improvement and to adopt better employment standards. Government agencies have also taken the lead to only procure from accredited cleaning companies, as well as security agencies with at least a ""B"" grading in the Security Agency Grading Exercise conducted by the Singapore Police Force.",5,878,2013-11-11-T-048-S-00878
2013-11-11-T-048,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"There are real benefits to be gained through best sourcing. Service buyers can enjoy enhanced service quality, while service providers can attract and retain the manpower they need through providing better employment terms and conditions. Furthermore, the basic employment rights of workers can be safeguarded, while procurement practices that tend to depress workers' wages can also be curtailed. This is especially important for low-wage workers who are particularly vulnerable to cheap sourcing.",6,879,2013-11-11-T-048-S-00879
2013-11-11-T-048,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Going forward, we will continue to work with our tripartite partners to promote wider adoption of best sourcing practices.",7,880,2013-11-11-T-048-S-00880
2013-11-11-T-049,David Ong,Mr David Ong,asked the Acting Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider removing the need to reduce the employer's CPF contributions of our Singapore workers turning age 50.,1,881,2013-11-11-T-049-S-00881
2013-11-11-T-049,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We lowered CPF contribution rates in 2005 and 2006 for workers aged 50 to 55. This was done to improve their employability because seniority-based wage systems were common then, which discouraged employers from retaining and hiring older workers. However, since then, older workers' employment rates have improved considerably, with progress made in wage restructuring and other efforts to enhance their employability.",1,882,2013-11-11-T-049-S-00882
2013-11-11-T-049,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"In 2012, we consulted our tripartite partners and reached a consensus that the CPF contribution rate for workers aged 50 to 55 should eventually be restored to the same level as younger workers. We took the first step last year by raising the contribution rate for workers aged 50 to 55 by 2.5 percentage points in September, bringing their total CPF contribution rate up from 30% to 32.5%.",2,883,2013-11-11-T-049-S-00883
2013-11-11-T-049,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"We will continue to monitor the situation on the ground before taking the next step. While we remain committed to restoring the contribution rates of older workers, this must be done at a suitable time to moderate the impact on take-home pay for employees and business costs for employers.",3,884,2013-11-11-T-049-S-00884
2013-11-11-T-050,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair,asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry has plans to promote the use of electric vehicles in Singapore.,1,885,2013-11-11-T-050-S-00885
2013-11-11-T-050,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"LTA has been monitoring the state of electric vehicle (EV) technology and the costs of EVs as compared to conventional vehicles. EVs can be cleaner and more energy efficient than the typical internal combustion engine car. However, an EV's upfront costs are significantly higher. Even under the enhanced Transport Technology Innovation Development Scheme (TIDES-PLUS), where vehicular taxes are waived, the life cycle cost of an EV in Singapore would likely still be higher as compared to conventional vehicles paying full taxes.",1,886,2013-11-11-T-050-S-00886
2013-11-11-T-050,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Nevertheless, with improved battery technology and economies of scale, EVs could become cheaper over time. We have already started to try out EVs on a limited scale conducted by the multi-agency Electric Vehicle Taskforce (EVTF) co-chaired by EMA and LTA. The EV test-bed is slated to end on 31 December 2013, and will provide additional data for us to formulate our policies and infrastructure plans.",2,887,2013-11-11-T-050-S-00887

2013-11-11-T-052,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Currently, livestock for korban is imported from Australia because of the reasonable price and close proximity to Singapore. The Australian government introduced the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System (ESCAS) last year to ensure that livestock exported from Australia are treated in accordance to international animal welfare standards. I am pleased to say that the 16 mosques which took part in audit exercises last year satisfied the ESCAS requirements and were hence allowed to import livestock from Australia for the recent korban.",1,892,2013-11-11-T-052-S-00892
2013-11-11-T-052,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Australia will remain our primary source for livestock for korban, provided our mosques can continue to meet the ESCAS requirements. We will work closely with AVA to ensure this.",2,893,2013-11-11-T-052-S-00893

The Joint Korban Review Committee, comprising officers from MUIS, MCCY and AVA, had explored sources in Canada, the United States of America, Europe, New Zealand, China, Brunei, Indonesia and East Malaysia. A combination of different factors affects whether sources are suitable, such as cost, logistics, as well as animal and public health requirements. As part of a trial this year, the JKMS procured a small quantity of 500 lambs from Canada.",3,894,2013-11-11-T-052-S-00894

Some cities have implemented BRT as a lower-cost alternative to rail systems (RTS). A BRT system will require substantial additional surface land to accommodate the station platforms, and dedicated and overtaking lanes. Given Singapore's highly urbanised environment, and our existing rail network, our assessment is that a full BRT system is not practical.",1,910,2013-11-11-T-056-S-00910
2013-11-11-T-056,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"However, we are incorporating some features that characterise BRT to improve our current bus system. These include signal priority, which grants buses more green time at traffic junctions, and expanding our existing bus priority measures like more bus lanes and the Mandatory Give Way to Buses Scheme.",2,911,2013-11-11-T-056-S-00911
2013-11-11-T-057,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in light of the community reaction to the Ashley Madison website in Singapore, what is the Government's approach in dealing with societal agents and forces that harm the institution of marriage.",1,912,2013-11-11-T-057-S-00912
2013-11-11-T-057,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Today, we are confronted with content and messages over different channels – the mass media, television, Internet and, increasingly, social media – that may undermine the institution of marriage. Some of these may trivialise permissiveness, promiscuity and infidelity.",1,913,2013-11-11-T-057-S-00913
2013-11-11-T-057,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"MDA has a regulatory framework to act against such content that undermine social norms and public interest. For example, in the case of Ashley Madison, MDA has directed the Internet Service Providers to block their website.",2,914,2013-11-11-T-057-S-00914
2013-11-11-T-057,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Apart from MDA, ACRA has powers to reject an application to register a business entity in Singapore.

For example, we work with employers, community organisations and the media to run marriage preparation and enrichment programmes. This includes smaller scale programmes at individual organisations as well as large scale initiatives such as the annual Marriage Convention.",4,916,2013-11-11-T-057-S-00916

2013-11-11-T-058,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan,asked the Acting Minister for Manpower how will the Ministry adjust its public messaging to raise awareness on the importance of retirement adequacy if many Singaporeans do not find the schemes on unlocking the value of their HDB flats palatable.,1,918,2013-11-11-T-058-S-00918
2013-11-11-T-058,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"First, let me share that the CPF Board has been actively reaching out to CPF members to raise awareness on the importance of retirement planning and providing information to help them plan for their retirement. The CPF member education initiatives are conducted through various channels and platforms, such as public talks, events and online outreach via the CPF website. CPF Board also encourages CPF members to take advantage of the voluntary contribution schemes such as the Minimum Sum Topping-up Scheme (MSTU) where they can top up their CPF accounts or those of their loved ones to better secure their retirement adequacy.",1,919,2013-11-11-T-058-S-00919
2013-11-11-T-058,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Recently, the CPF Board launched its Are You Ready? Initiative to encourage Singaporeans to think carefully about their cash flow management, healthcare, home financing and retirement planning. For example, members who are getting married and buying their first home are advised and provided the tools to do their sums to buy a house within their means. To further extend its reach, CPF Board also works with other partners, such as MoneySENSE, the Financial Planning Association of Singapore and HDB.",2,920,2013-11-11-T-058-S-00920
2013-11-11-T-058,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,The Enhanced Lease Buyback Scheme (Enhanced LBS) and Silver Housing Bonus (SHB) Scheme were introduced earlier in February this year to provide more options to elderly Singaporeans who wish or need to unlock the value in their housing assets to supplement their retirement savings. We recognise that elderly Singaporeans today may not consider housing monetisation as the preferred option to provide for their retirement. Those who have sufficient savings or family support may also not feel the need to monetise their homes. The Government will continue to reach out to elderly Singaporeans so that those who need to monetise their homes are aware and understand the benefits of the schemes.,3,921,2013-11-11-T-058-S-00921
2013-11-11-T-058,Tan Chuan-Jin,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"At the same time, CPF Board will also continue to enhance its member education efforts to encourage and help CPF members to plan early for their retirement, to not overstretch themselves in their home purchase and leave enough savings in their CPF accounts for their retirement.",4,922,2013-11-11-T-058-S-00922

2013-11-11-T-059,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The purpose of the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) is to manage congestion on our roads by influencing motorists’ driving behaviour. ERP rates are adjusted periodically so that the speeds on our roads remain within the optimal range. With advanced knowledge of ERP rates, motorists can decide whether to travel as planned, take a different route, travel at a different time, or even change their mode of travel to public transport. If we freeze the rates as suggested, we will have more congested roads.",1,924,2013-11-11-T-059-S-00924
2013-11-11-T-059,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"At the same time, I want to reassure the Member that we are doing our best to improve public transport. With the Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP), waiting times have come down by three to five minutes for some bus services, and the number of persistently crowded bus services has also come down by about 40%.",2,925,2013-11-11-T-059-S-00925
2013-11-11-T-059,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The rail network will be expanded to improve connectivity and capacity. For instance, the first stage of the Downtown Line will open next month. In addition, more trains will enter service from 2014, and with the completion of the signalling system upgrade for the North-South and East-West Lines by 2016 and 2018 respectively, we can look forward to even more improvements in frequencies and capacity.",3,926,2013-11-11-T-059-S-00926

The re-tender is expected to take place at the end of the month.",1,928,2013-11-11-T-060-S-00928
2013-11-11-T-061,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,asked the Minister for Transport what impact is the $6 levy at selected ERP gantries in Singapore assessed to have on road traffic conditions on these roads.,1,929,2013-11-11-T-061-S-00929

Since the rate adjustments, traffic conditions on the ECP have improved and travel speeds have increased to within the optimal range of 45 km/h to 65 km/h. For the CTE, it is too early to tell as it will take time for motorists to adapt their travel patterns to the new rates.",1,930,2013-11-11-T-061-S-00930
2013-11-11-T-062,Yee Jenn Jong,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"asked the Prime Minister in 2012 (a) what percentage of total business credit goes to small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in Singapore in comparison to Germany, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan; (b) what percentages of financial institutions' stock of total outstanding SME loans are owed by SMEs with turnover above $30 million, between $1 million and $30 million, and below $1 million; (c) what percentage of the total stock is mortgage equity withdrawal loans; and (d) what is the estimated total stock of capital invested in SMEs by venture capital, private equity and angel investors.",1,931,2013-11-11-T-062-S-00931

2013-11-11-T-062,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"The differences across countries in the shares of SMEs in overall credit have to be interpreted in the context of different definitions of SMEs in each country. Further, different overall credit shares for SMEs do not necessarily mean different degrees of access to credit for SMEs. For example, large corporations in some countries may rely more on funding from the capital markets and therefore account for a smaller share of bank lending.",2,933,2013-11-11-T-062-S-00933

2013-11-11-T-062,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"The availability of bank funding for SMEs should also be viewed in the context of the various Government-financed schemes for SMEs. SPRING Singapore offers a range of financing schemes to cater to SMEs of different sizes – the Local Enterprise Financing Scheme is available to local SMEs with sales turnover of not more than $100 million, while the Micro Loan Programme targets small SMEs with turnover not exceeding $1 million. SPRING also provides schemes, such as the Angel Investor Tax Deduction Scheme, to encourage investments in local companies.",5,936,2013-11-11-T-062-S-00936

2013-11-11-T-069,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Government procurement rules require agencies to evaluate tender proposals against the set of criteria specified in the Invitation to Tender. For construction-related tenders, it is already a requirement for Government agencies to specify the price-quality ratio and the weighting of the main criteria that are used for tender evaluation. Under the Quality Fee Method for construction consultancy services, the weighting given to the quality of the proposal would range between 60% and 80%, and this would be clearly specified in the Invitation to Tender and made known to all suppliers.",1,995,2013-11-11-T-069-S-00995

Under the revised WTO-GPA, signatories are required to provide greater clarity on their tender evaluation criteria. This means that Government agencies will be required to not just spell out the criteria used for evaluating the tender, but also highlight the relative importance of each evaluation criterion. For instance, if a particular quality criterion carries more weight than price or another quality criterion, this should be specified upfront so that tenderers will know which criterion is more important when the Government agency is evaluating the tender.",3,997,2013-11-11-T-069-S-00997

Key information that is not available through administrative sources, such as relationships within the household and the religion of individuals, are gathered from surveying a representative sample of about 20% of households in Singapore.

2013-11-11-T-071,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Singapore's non-oil domestic exports (NODX) have been weak largely due to challenging economic conditions in the advanced economies, which have similarly affected the exports of other regional economies such as China, South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia. Barring downside risks to the global economic outlook, Singapore's NODX is expected to pick up modestly in tandem with a gradual recovery in global demand. There are early signs that our NODX may improve in the coming months.

Nevertheless, the Government is mindful of the challenges that businesses face in the interim, and has phased in the increase of foreign worker levies and the new Dependency Ratio Ceiling requirements so that businesses have time to adjust. To help businesses cope with rising costs, we have rolled out schemes such as tax credits and funding support for employee training to help businesses, especially SMEs, raise their productivity.",2,1004,2013-11-11-T-071-S-01004

2013-11-11-T-084,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Concerns have also been raised about the safety of e-cigarettes as they contain nicotine. International studies have shown that they can expose users to toxic and cancer-causing substances. A local study conducted by HSA found poor consistency between actual nicotine content in e-cigarettes and the amount labelled. In addition, e-cigarettes could potentially be a ""gateway"" for the young to become addicted to nicotine and lead to the use of conventional cigarettes and the development of a smoking habit.",2,1057,2013-11-11-T-084-S-01057

2013-11-11-T-086,Lui Tuck Yew,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"LTA and HDB have been working with car-sharing operators to provide parking spaces in locations where there is possibly higher demand for car-sharing services. We expect the operators to put up 18 more stations in the coming months, which would be about a 20% increase in the total number of stations, with two to three cars at each station. The process of identifying suitable locations is a continuous one, and LTA and HDB will need to take into consideration the competing demand for parking from resident car owners.",1,1065,2013-11-11-T-086-S-01065
