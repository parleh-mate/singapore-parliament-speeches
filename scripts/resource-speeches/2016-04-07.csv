2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Mdm Chairman, I thank the Members of the House for sharing their perceptive insights yesterday. I am gratified by our unity of purpose. The friends and protagonists that we have on the international stage will not be so much listening to what I have to say, but rather to the congruence of the discussions and the debates in this House. It is important that we demonstrate unity of purpose.",1,18,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00018
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Foreign policy begins at home. Singaporeans must have a realistic, coherent and collective sense of our place in the world. Singapore's fundamental realities have not changed. We are a tiny island in a tough neighbourhood. At the 8th Rajaratnam Lecture last year, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said, ""We have to take the world as it is and not as we wish it to be, but we believe that we can and must defend ourselves and advance our interests"".",2,19,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00019
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),What this means is that we must have no illusions about our significance in the world or our ability to influence global events. Our survival as an independent sovereign city state and our economic viability cannot be taken for granted. If we ever become disunited or unable to defend ourselves or an economic failure – we would rapidly become irrelevant.,3,20,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00020
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Since our Independence in 1965, we have assiduously forged national unity, we have achieved economic success and we have built strong partnerships at the bilateral, regional, and international levels. These partnerships, these relationships safeguard Singapore's external political and economic space. But, quite frankly, the world is becoming messier. And Singapore needs to become sensitive to changes in the global environment and global economy, and we must always nimble enough to respond quickly, and hopefully, in advance of these changes.",4,21,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00021
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Mr Vikram Nair and Mr Cedric Foo emphasised yesterday that we live in a region where the economic and strategic interests of major powers intersect. Indeed, as a small country, Singapore benefits when major powers focus on cooperation and constructive engagement in the region. Good relations among the major powers are essential for our continued stability and development.",5,22,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00022
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"The state of the US-China relationship is the key variable. This determines whether there will be peace and stability in our region. And their relationship is complex. There will always be elements of both cooperation and competition between the US and China. We hope that they will continue to cooperate effectively on global and regional stage. We hope that they will be able to effectively work together to resolve challenges involving nuclear security, climate change, piracy and cyber security, just to mention a few.",6,23,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00023
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"But we must acknowledge that there will always be some degree of competition, if not outright rivalry, between the US and China. China's emergence as a rising power has shifted the strategic balance. And China has also become far more assertive in recent years. We see this in our region, for instance, in the South China Sea. Fortunately, for us, Singapore is not a claimant state in the South China Sea. We take no position on the merits of specific territorial claims. But as a small state, we do have a vital interest in and we have to strongly support the maintenance of a rules-based international order and to support the peaceful resolution of disputes, with full respect for legal and diplomatic processes. This is of vital importance to us that the integrity of international law and international agreements, such as the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea or UNCLOS. We must make sure that these agreements, these arrangements are not in any way undermined. As a small state, Singapore cannot accept that ""might is right"".",7,24,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00024
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"In the South China Sea, China has conducted extensive reclamation works, constructed runways and port facilities, and it has deployed significant military assets on disputed features in the South China Sea. Whilst, to be fair, some claimant states have also conducted similar activities, but these activities by other claimant states have not been on the same scale or pace as they are conducted by China. And what a major power does inevitably carries a far bigger signature. China, for its own reasons, has become more assertive in East and South East Asian regions.",8,25,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00025
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Both the US and China recognise that a stable relationship is crucial for peace and security in East Asia, for regional economic growth and development, for prosperity and, indeed, for global stability. Despite their differences, there is one point worth noting, which is that never before in history has a rising power, in its engagement with an existing super power, had such an unprecedented level of economic interdependence. They are intertwined. And this means, they cannot embark on an all-out confrontation because the economic impact on both states will be too high. In addition to this, of course, the threat of mutually assured destruction will also ensure both nuclear powers have a powerful incentive to avoid direct confrontation.",9,26,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00026
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"I also agree with Mr Foo that the dynamics of the US-China-Japan relationship are complex. These are the top three economies in the world. They are major strategic players in their own right. Stable relationships amongst the three major countries are therefore vital for regional peace, stability and prosperity.",10,27,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00027
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"The US remains the world's super power, with major economic and strategic interests in the region, including alliances and treaty obligations with Japan, the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the Philippines, amongst others. Regardless of the outcome of the US Presidential Election, we expect the US to remain engaged in this region. Even though Sino-Japan ties are complicated by long-standing territorial disputes and historical baggage from the second World War, both sides have an interest in mending their relations. To address complex global and regional challenges, we hope the major powers would work closely together to tackle issues of common interest, and avoid direct and destabilising confrontations with each other even as they search for a new modus vivendi.",11,28,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00028
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),I agree with Mr Nair's assessment of the regional security challenges. The recent spate of provocative missile launches in the last few months by the DPRK has been unsettling. They are in clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions. The international community has imposed further sanctions on the DPRK.,12,29,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00029
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Some Singaporeans have asked me, ""Why do we bother? Why do we watch these developments in the DPRK with such interest?"" The reason we watch developments with such concern because tensions there will have a negative impact on the peace, stability and economy of the entire region, both in Northeast as well as Southeast Asia.",13,30,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00030
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"A nuclear-capable and unpredictable, unstable DPRK could also prompt countries like Japan and the Republic of Korea to go nuclear, and this will further raise tensions in the region. Given China's proximity and its influence over the DPRK, China will have to play a key role in any resolution of this problem.",14,31,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00031
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Ms Joan Pereira also asked about what we are doing to address non-traditional security threats including religious radicalisation and extremism. We, in Singapore, are adversely affected by the conflicts in Libya, Syria and Iraq. Groups like ISIS use the Internet and social media to attract followers from all over the world, including us. More than 1,000 men and women from Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and even Singapore are believed to have travelled to the Middle East to fight for ISIS.",15,32,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00032
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"There is even a battalion for Bahasa speaking fighters. If you go on the internet and search YouTube for ISIS and Bahasa, you will see slickly produced videos with beautiful Arabic scenery and music, English subtitles, spoken in Malay, Bahasa. Who else in the world are such productions targeted at? So, some of our people will go there, or will intend to go there. They will gain operational and combat experience. They will learn to make bombs. They will establish networks with other militants. And we know what has happened in Europe when these militants return. And we have to worry about what will happen in Southeast Asia as these militants, our own from our region, return to our region. This, therefore, poses a direct and serious threat to Singapore and our multi-racial society. It is, therefore, important that we stand up and we do our part to support the international coalition against ISIS.",16,33,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00033
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Ms Pereira also asked about how the increase in global terrorist attacks is affecting Singaporeans abroad. Singaporeans are some of the most widely travelled people in the world and many of us also have to work or travel overseas. This often means exposing us, our people, to some risks, both to natural disasters as well as terrorism. Members of this House will recall that we all grieved when the late Ms Lo Hwei Yen became a victim of the Mumbai terror attack in 2008; a completely innocent victim.",17,34,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00034
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Providing consular assistance is a top priority for MFA. Wherever possible, our officers will assist Singaporeans who experience difficulties overseas, including those in conflict zones as we did just last year in Yemen. We repeatedly urged Singaporeans to find out the facts before they travel and to exercise due care about where they will travel and how they will travel. We will continue to improve the range and quality of consular services for all Singaporeans. We will harness technology and we will also leverage on our partnerships with our ASEAN Member states, both in the public and private sectors, to augment our existing network of 50 overseas missions and 31 Honorary Consuls-Generals.",18,35,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00035
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"The point is MFA cannot be represented in all the 200 countries of the world. So, in places where we do not have a diplomatic presence, we will have to work behind the scenes with other government agencies as well as foreign governments to render the appropriate consular assistance. Senior Minister of State Maliki will speak more on consular services later on.",19,36,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00036
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Dr Teo Ho Pin also noted the global economic slowdown and asked how Singapore can increase and diversify our global economic partnerships. There are, quite frankly, many challenges ahead of us beyond this region. The US Federal Reserve has ended its monetary easing policy. Europe is still struggling to resolve its economic malaise and unemployment. The migrant crisis, the political uncertainties of the UK's possible exit from the EU, the conflicts in the Middle East – all these conspire to affect international political and economic stability, as well as the domestic stability in many countries, including those outside the immediate theatre of operations.",20,37,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00037
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Singapore's openness means by definition, that we will be exposed to external economic headwinds. But we have no choice. We have to remain plugged into the regional and international trade groupings and arrangements because this opens doors for our people and our businesses.",21,38,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00038
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"One example is the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Its ratification, despite the headwinds we are facing right now, but if and when it is ratified, will create even more trade and business opportunities for Singapore companies by providing access to new and existing markets. The EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is the first FTA between an ASEAN country and the EU. If this is ratified, it will also present numerous economic benefits for both sides and will strengthen linkages. We hope the EU will ratify this agreement soon.",22,39,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00039
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),Mr Ong Teng Koon sought an update on the ASEAN's community building and integration efforts. Dr Teo Ho Pin asked about the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC).,23,40,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00040
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"In a weakening global economy, the establishment of the AEC at the end of last year was timely. The AEC will integrate and transform ASEAN into a single regional market with a freer flow of goods, services, investments, skilled labour and capital. With 620 million people, a labour force that is the third largest in the world, and an estimated GDP of US$2.5 trillion, our AEC has huge potential. Foreign investors will come to Singapore and will use us as a launch pad, as an interface to invest in regional opportunities. Jobs will be created. Singaporean businesses and investors will benefit from these new opportunities. I need to emphasise that we must not view ASEAN integration with a zero-sum mentality. On the contrary, integration will create win-win opportunities for all ASEAN citizens by making us collectively more competitive vis-a-vis other continental-sized economies.",24,41,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00041
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"As ASEAN becomes more integrated, we must join hands to tackle some transboundary challenges, and to do so in a credible and coordinated fashion. For instance, on transboundary haze pollution, our Leaders have already endorsed the vision of a haze-free ASEAN by 2020. Quite frankly, as a former Minister for the Environment, I do not see why we have to wait for 2020 to see clear blue skies.",25,42,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00042
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"ASEAN has further established a Task Force to develop an ASEAN Haze-Free Roadmap, and we must continue to deepen cooperation to be able to do joint investigations, to collaborate with civil society and we must put businesses on notice that they must behave responsibly and engage in sustainable development and fair business practices.",26,43,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00043
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),Another emerging challenge is the need to strengthen cyber security and to deal with cyber threats because these threats have no boundaries. ASEAN-led platforms such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and the East Asia Summit (EAS) have enabled Singapore and other ASEAN member states to work with our dialogue partners to build capacity and enhance regional cooperation in cybersecurity.,27,44,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00044
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Mr Pritam Singh spoke about ASEAN-China relations and the South China Sea. Economics continues to be the centrepiece of the ASEAN-China relationship. China is already the largest trading partner for all members of ASEAN. ASEAN and China signed a protocol last year to upgrade the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA), and this will serve to further deepen the ASEAN-China economic cooperation and integration. We will also celebrate the 25th Anniversary of ASEAN-China with a Commemorative Summit this year.",28,45,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00045
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"China is keen to play a major role in the evolving regional architecture and the global initiatives. In fact, it has proposed several regional economic initiatives such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and this concept of a ""One Belt, One Road"". Singapore was an early supporter of both these initiatives because we saw a congruence of interests with the region's developmental needs. China's ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative complements ASEAN's existing efforts to promote connectivity and regional integration, and even our own latest bilateral project in China's Western Region, the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative. We welcome China's efforts in ensuring that these initiatives are open, are inclusive and consultative by involving all relevant stakeholders and we will work with China to explore possible synergies.",29,46,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00046
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"But while ASEAN-China relations are substantive and mutually beneficial and positive, the fact remains – as Mr Pritam Singh observed yesterday – that the situation is not so tranquil in the South China Sea. We urge all parties to commit to non-militarisation, to exercise self-restraint and to refrain from the use or the threat of use of force. We all stand to lose if tensions escalate. It is thus important to maintain open dialogue on issues of mutual concern to prevent contentious issues from overshadowing the overall ASEAN-China relationship. We believe that ASEAN and China should remain committed to work towards the full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties (DOC) in the South China Sea, as well as the early conclusion of the Code of Conduct (COC).",30,47,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00047
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Under the DOC, we are currently working on a hotline between ASEAN and China's Foreign Ministries for maritime emergencies. We also agreed to pursue the extension of the observation of the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES) and we hope that this will be expanded to all parties' naval vessels in the South China Sea. We believe this will help manage the situation, prevent miscalculation on the ground by young men manning ships and planes in the seas and in the air.",31,48,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00048
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"I have also suggested that the ASEAN-China CUES can be extended to cover both navy and coast guard vessels. This will send a positive signal of our joint commitment to prevent loss of assets and lives, and ensuring peace and stability in the South China Sea.",32,49,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00049
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"In fact, China, the US, and eight ASEAN Member States have already agreed to a CUES, under the ambit of the Western Pacific Naval Symposium in 2014, specifically for naval vessels. The US and China have also made considerable progress in agreeing on protocols for unplanned encounters both at sea and in the air, and have implemented them in practice. So, the point is  why not extend this to all ASEAN states? Why not extend it to go beyond naval vessels, but to include coast guard vessels, since we know that some of the coast guard vessels plying the South China Sea tend to be very large ships in their own right.",33,50,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00050
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"We have also had productive and frank discussions on the COC. We have agreed to a paper on the ""List of Elements of the Possible Outline of a COC"", and to a discussion paper on the ""List of Crucial and Complex Issues"" in the drafting of the COC. I apologise for all this jargon, but this is typical diplomatic foreplay – agreement not yet achieved.",34,51,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00051
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"On the ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting (ADMM) Hotline, the 10 ASEAN Defence Ministers have witnessed the set-up of a hotline between the defence establishments, but this has not been expanded to include China. As earlier explained, discussions on the establishment of an ASEAN-China hotline are underway on the foreign affairs track.",35,52,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00052
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"As for the ""no first use of force"" – this was a proposal raised by Vietnam sometime earlier, we have expressed support for this proposal. But quite frankly, there has been no progress since then. Nevertheless, China has signed on to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation which commits all parties to refrain from the threat or the use of force. So, amidst all these delicate negotiations, a one central challenge is to maintain ASEAN unity and preserve ASEAN's centrality in the evolving regional architecture.",36,53,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00053
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"I would like to reassure Mr Alex Yam that Singapore's political and defence ties with the US remain strong and substantive. Singapore will work with the next Administration, regardless of the outcome of the next Presidential Election. It is just worth reminding ourselves that we have no say, but we will have to work with whoever the Americans choose. This is the karma of a small state. The US is our largest source of foreign direct investment. It is our top trading partner in services, and our third-largest trading partner in goods.",37,54,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00054
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"There is much that we can learn from the US. Its strength in its economy and the society, especially its cutting edge research and innovation as we ourselves move to focus on innovation and in our journey towards creating a sustainable Smart Nation. We welcome the US' location of one of its three centres for the US-ASEAN Connect initiative here. As I mentioned earlier, the US has enduring strategic and economic interests in Asia. The historic ASEAN-US Leaders' Summit in Sunnylands in February this year reflects the US' continued interest in this region. We will continue to support the US engagement of Asia, including encouraging the US to quickly ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The significance of the TPP goes far beyond trade. It is an important signal – an icon of the US' commitment to engage the Asia-Pacific and we urge all Parties that have signed on this to ratify it quickly.",38,55,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00055
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Ms Sun Xueling has asked about Singapore-China relations. China indeed is one of our key international partners. We commemorated 25 years of diplomatic relations with China last year. This culminated in the exchange of State Visits by President Tony Tan and by the Chinese President, Xi Jinping. We established an ""All-Round Cooperative Partnership Progressing with the Times"" – it sounds better in Mandarin – to demonstrate that our long-standing, innovative and multi-faceted cooperation has kept up with the times and has evolved. Our bilateral cooperation has moved beyond the traditional areas of trade and commerce to include financial cooperation, social governance, sustainable development and food safety. Human resource development remains a key pillar of our bilateral cooperation.",39,56,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00056

Both sides have agreed to achieve a comprehensive and substantive upgrade of the China-Singapore FTA by the end of this year. This upgrade is timely and it reflects the strength and depth of our economic cooperation. Not only is China our largest trading partner, we have also been China's top foreign investor since 2013. This is a fact that I could not believe and had to re-read several times, that little Singapore has been China's top foreign investor since 2013. My colleague Senior Minister of State Josephine Teo will speak more about our unique relationship with China and its domestic implications after this.",40,57,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00057

Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked for an update on our relations with Japan. We continue to find ways to deepen our engagement with Japan, the third largest economy in the world. To commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Singapore-Japan relations in 2016, a slate of high-level exchange of Visits have been arranged. Japan remains Singapore's second largest foreign investor in 2014. We are also working with Japan to review the Japan-Singapore Economic Partnership Agreement (JSEPA) and the bilateral Air Services Agreement (ASA); and this, if we succeed, will raise our bilateral relations to new heights. We also enjoy warm people-to-people ties with Japan, best illustrated through the generous contributions by Singaporeans to the rescue and recovery effort coordinated by the Singapore Red Cross following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan.",41,58,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00058

The signing of the India-Singapore Strategic Partnership in November 2015 laid the foundation for us to step up cooperation in diverse areas, including finance, civil aviation, urban solutions and skills development.

Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, India has stepped up efforts to develop infrastructure and to attract foreign investments. A stronger India emerging from these successful reforms will inevitably play a more active role in our region. Prime Minister Modi's reaffirmation of India's ""Act East Policy"" allows us to further our economic cooperation with India, both on a bilateral basis as well as regionally. India is already quite involved in the ASEAN region as an ASEAN Dialogue Partner and as a member of the East Asia Summit (EAS), the ADMM Plus and the ARF. It is also actively participating in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which is the other big trading bloc which we are working on.

Progress is being made on the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail and the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link. Both governments are working to improve congestion at the Causeway and at our borders. We have conducted a joint study; the Malaysians. We have also done our own projections. The Causeway actually has sufficient capacity. Replacing the Causeway is not the solution.

My first overseas visit of this year was to Indonesia, and we look forward to Indonesia hosting the next Leaders' Retreat in the second half of this year. Economic ties remain strong. Singapore is Indonesia's largest foreign investor. Is that not amazing? We are the largest investor in China; we are largest investor in Indonesia. We have some US$5.9 billion invested in Indonesia last year, and we are Indonesia's third largest trading partner, as well as each other's largest source of tourists. Our companies remain keen on Indonesia, and besides Jakarta, Batam, Bintan and the Karimun Special Economic Zone, our companies are also looking at other regions in Central Java.

Year after year, the main victims of this haze are not Singaporeans; it is actually the Indonesians themselves, who live at ground zero. So, we want to do more with the Indonesian government and other interested stakeholders to promote sustainable agricultural practices, to strengthen our response to forest fires and to hold errant companies responsible for the fires that they start or allow to occur on their concession areas. Counter-terrorism is another common challenge, and we will continue to work very closely with Indonesia as well as our other neighbours to fight this common threat.",54,71,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00071

It requires our officers to work under challenging conditions and, quite frankly, at great cost to their personal lives and their family lives. In all my 15 years in politics through many incarnations, through many Ministries, I have always found MFA officers to be dedicated, passionate and professional. What keeps them going is not their Minister but their sacred mission to advance the interests of Singapore. They understand Singapore's vulnerabilities.

So, our officers are our key assets and I thank you for highlighting that yesterday.

What has changed is the global and regional architecture and emerging powers. Whatever happens, we have to remember that we are price takers, we are not price makers. So, we have to confront the headwinds from the global economic slowdown, the uncertain geopolitical environment and the security threats.

But we must always remember that there are many Chinese in the world, including [华侨]. A few undistinguished millions in a small island in South East Asia cannot be more than a curiosity. Ultimately, to be of special value, Singaporeans as a community must be outstanding, confident and cohesive.

Compared to China, we have a unique cultural make-up that is diverse and yet inclusive, and which we are tremendously proud of. When travelling abroad, Singaporeans have no difficulty identifying one another from among a sea of ethnic look-alikes – our Singlish infused with all sorts of local references is an endearing and immediate give-away.

It creates valuable opportunities for us to share perspectives with our Chinese friends that they are unlikely to find elsewhere.

They will continue to be interested in the Middle East given the volatile security situation, terrorism and the various conflicts in the region, including the Israeli – Palestinian conflict. And the current conflicts in the Middle East are likely to persist. The situation in Yemen, Libya, Syria and Iraq remains of deep concern, given the humanitarian toll and the threat posed by terrorist groups like ISIS.

I just want to caution that ASEAN works by consensus, so we would have to make sure that everyone agrees. But, generally, the point that he is making is a valid one, and we will work towards that.",1,160,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00160

2016-04-07-T-003,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"Mdm Chair, today's oil price based on the WTI is about US$38 per MT. Many of the Middle Eastern countries would require something like US$80-over, say, for Iran or Iraq to come out break even for their national budget. For Algeria, US$90-odd, for Saudi Arabia US$105. The Middle East may seem very far away from us, but if events there cause them to destabilise, or if the major powers of the world take their attention off the Middle East, I think it will be very bad for Singapore. So, I would like MFA's take on how low oil prices, if sustained, would affect the Middle East and, therefore, impact us.",1,162,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00162
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"I thank Mr Cedric Foo for asking actually a very profound question that will require a full lecture to fully address. Let me try to encapsulate the key ideas. I will start with a story. I asked the Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister and the Saudi Arabian Minister for Energy. I asked him, ""What is the cost of getting a barrel of oil from Saudi Arabia?"" He said, ""Well, the true cost, the real cost to us, depending on whose accounting standard is used, is somewhere between US$2-US$5 per barrel."" That is the cost of lifting oil out from Saudi Arabia, which means everything else is plus, plus.",1,163,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00163
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"What you are referring to, however, is the fact that for many years, oil producers have made certain budgetary assumptions about the revenue that they will derive from oil. What has happened in the more recent times, with the dramatic fall in oil prices, is that except in the case of the Singapore Budget, in many other countries, especially countries which depend on the prices of natural resources, they have suddenly found themselves in a big deficit situation.",2,164,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00164
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The first point we should make is that, fortunately for us, we are not dependent on natural resources. Secondly, we have got a good Finance Minister and we do not make these kinds of budgetary assumptions that lead us into a sudden deep hole. There are certain salutary lessons for us at the domestic level.",3,165,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00165
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"At an international level, you are absolutely right. Many countries, especially oil producers in the Middle East, and including some in our own region, now have to come to terms with very significant budgetary squeeze. This affects them in multiple ways. They will have to cut back on services, on benefits to their people. They will also have to trim some of their budgets on other more esoteric adventures which they have intended to pursue. I do not want to get into details.",4,166,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00166
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"But I think the more fundamental question you are asking is, ""What does this portend for stability in the Middle East?"" Even the answer to that question is not so straightforward. On one level, you could say, ""Well, there should be less liquidity to expend on an arms race."" But on another level, we know that the countries get into troubles, there is always a political temptation to draw attention to tensions elsewhere to distract your own people.",5,167,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00167
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"A third level of looking at this is, I think, you made the point yesterday. As oil prices fall and, indeed, as sustainable sources of energy emerge and even as the US itself has become de facto energy independent, does that mean the US would pay less attention to the situation in the Middle East. The answer is that, the energy and fiscal imperative may become less but do not under-estimate the political complexities of the Middle East and its propensity to entangle outside powers to its politics.",6,168,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00168
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"And I want to, again, emphasise the point that Senior Minister of State Maliki just made just now. The conflicts in the Middle East have their roots going back thousands of years. They are ethnic and pseudo-religious, sectarian conflicts, superimposed with regional rivalry. It is important that Singaporeans do not get caught up in these conflicts which, really, have nothing to do with us and, really, in fact, have nothing to do with religion. Religion is just being abused as a vehicle to further political ends.",7,169,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00169
2016-04-07-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The final point that I will make about oil crisis is to also bear in mind the fact that what can come down very quickly can also rise very quickly, the moment you get any supply disruptions. The domestic implication of that for Singapore is the following  (1) we have never subsidised energy and we should not do so; (2) whether it comes to utilities, transport and all those other things, we must always be prepared to pay the full international price, whether it is high or low; (3) we must make sure our economy continues to be built on sustainable, sensible, rational economic principles; and (4) when we have debates on budget like this, examine people's assumptions and make sure that the Singapore Government never gets into situations when we make rosy projections which then suddenly run out of steam and, literally, regulatory and legislative panic breaks out. Those are the more important lessons for us from a domestic perspective.",8,170,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00170
2016-04-07-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Mdm Chair, the question for the Minister  with the MAS looking into some of the investigations into 1MDB and other transactions here as well as the recent Panama Papers expose case, has that impact our relationship with Malaysia and other foreign counter-parties?

I also record my thanks to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Not only is Singapore a small country, I think the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also has a relatively small budget. Yet, despite that, it has punched well above its weight on the international stage, all the way from the Asia-Pacific to the Arctic Circle. I also understand that we are the largest investors for China, Indonesia and, I believe, second largest for India, the three most populous countries in the world. And I think it is quite extraordinary that Singapore has managed to achieve all this, given its size and scale. I am also heartened to note that even though the Minister has changed portfolios, he still takes a keen interest in the haze problem and will bring blue skies to Singapore, hopefully, in the next few years. With that, Madam, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.",1,176,2016-04-07-T-003-S-00176

2016-04-07-T-004,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Quite suddenly, for the first time in history, Singapore was left to take care of its own defence. There were many challenges at the time. We had barely been independent for six years and were still finding our feet as a nation. The withdrawal of the British forces also had serious economic implications. Asia, like the rest of the world was divided by the cold war conflicts and tensions with wars raging in Vietnam and Korea. Closer to the neighbourhood, Konfrontasi was still fresh in our memories, as were the communist and communalist riots on the domestic front.",3,182,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00182

The South China Sea tensions continue to escalate despite the fact that the legal dispute resolution process is moving forward – indeed, maybe it is escalating in response to this process.

2016-04-07-T-004,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Chair, the nature of warfare today has changed. Threats today come from states, organisations and individuals that seek to undermine our security. The threat of hybrid warfare is also emerging, as we have learned from the experience of Crimea, where there was a concerted effort to undermine the nation's defences through economic, socio-psychological as well as cyber warfare before taking them on militarily.",1,191,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00191
2016-04-07-T-004,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Last year, Minister Ng spoke extensively on hybrid warfare and he described hybrid warfare as the exact antagonist of Total Defence. Hybrid warfare integrates conventional and unconventional tools of warfare by both state and non-state actors. It is precisely because of the tools of coercion and aggression that these are wide-ranging and them being wide-ranging means it may be difficult for nations such as Singapore to even identify the source of attacks.",2,192,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00192
2016-04-07-T-004,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Furthermore, our world today is increasingly inter-connected. While traditional battlefields of the past were largely confined to air, land and sea domains, modern conflicts have moved into other domains that extend beyond territorial and geographical boundaries. So, what are some of these trends that MINDEF has observed and are we facing such threats in Singapore? Has Singapore been tested by such threats in recent months? What are some of these threats?",3,193,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00193
2016-04-07-T-004,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"It is clear that the military solution is not sufficient to address the threat of hybrid warfare. So, how is the Government responding to the threat of warfare on the various fronts and how do we bring in the stakeholders in Total Defence on board?

A recent Financial Times' article noted that beyond creating a caliphate in Iraq and Syria, ISIS is looking to strengthen its caliphate further afield and export terror to its perceived enemies beyond the Middle East. The recent attack in Jakarta and news reports of ISIS targeting locations in Kuala Lumpur have shown us that ISIS' global strategy includes hitting us, in our very own backyard here in Southeast Asia.",3,197,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00197
2016-04-07-T-004,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"Many continue to travel to Iraq to Syria to fight for the ISIS course in the Middle East. Most alarmingly, however, analysts have also pointed out that ISIS' tactics are also shifting. ISIS have been encouraging its supporters, some of whom had never travelled to the Middle East, to conduct attacks in their home cities. Without specific operational direction, lone wolves and small wolf packs have been inspired into action by ISIS' general call. Some have obtained weapons or explosives capable to causing mass casualties. This is clearly an alarming trend for Singapore.",4,198,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00198

2016-04-07-T-004,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair,"First, on homeland security. Traditionally, SAF has focused its preparations on external threats while the Home Team has focused on homeland security matters. Thus far, the Home Team has done an excellent job in keeping Singapore safe and has anticipated and foiled a number of potential terrorist threats by identifying and arresting key people in time.",1,202,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00202
2016-04-07-T-004,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair,"However, in the event of a major terror attack, say along the lines of Mumbai or Paris, which we hope will never happen in Singapore, but where the attack is large scale and the perpetrators are armed with firearms and bombs, and hundreds are killed or injured, it may be necessary for the military to step in both to engage and eliminate the perpetrators as well as to restore public confidence.",2,203,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00203
2016-04-07-T-004,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair,"I believe the military's role in homeland defence should be carefully calibrated, as deploying the military would send a clear message to the public that the threat is a serious one. If used for minor threats, the public may get the wrong message and get unduly worried or panic. On the other hand, if used in a situation where panic has already ensued following the attack, it may help calm the situation.",3,204,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00204
2016-04-07-T-004,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair,Are there any plans for SAF to step up its responses to homeland security to deal with threats such as terrorism?,4,205,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00205
2016-04-07-T-004,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair,"Second cut, on cybercrime. Recently, there was a shocking report that hackers had hacked into the Bangladeshi Central bank accounts in New York with the Federal Reserve and stolen some $101 million.",5,206,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00206

2016-04-07-T-004,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair,"We understand that the hackers had originally tried to wire out more than a $1 billion but the US Federal Reserve managed to block some $850 million of this from being transferred out. Sri Lanka has since managed to trace around $20 million and returned these sums. But the money channeled to the Philippines, amounting to some $80 million still remains untraced.",7,208,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00208

2016-04-07-T-004,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair,"So, it is very clear that states can become victims of cybercrime. An equally worrying trend is that the power of hacking is also being harnessed by state actors too, and including countries that are supposed to be friendly with each other. News, for example, of a German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone being hacked by the US National Security Agency created diplomatic tensions between countries that were otherwise very good friends. But this may be a microcosm of state-sponsored hacking that is probably happening elsewhere as well.",9,210,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00210

2016-04-07-T-004,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"Mdm Chair, let me add to Mr Vikram Nair's cut on cyber security. As we know, e-commerce and communications have increased relevance in Singapore and we are becoming more and more reliant on it in the way we work, play and even in many aspects of the activities that we undertake. And particularly in Singapore, with our vision of becoming a smarter nation, cyber security is increasingly of concern.",1,212,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00212

2016-04-07-T-004,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"An example is the SingPass hacking incident back in 2014 where a man cracked some 300 user accounts and sold personal data to a gang based in China – the purpose is to apply for visas into Singapore. This man had hacked into the user accounts simply by guessing, I guess through algorism the login passwords of these users. It is fortunate in this case that the incident did not result in even more damage. Had the cyber perpetrator be a terrorist network, more harm could be inflicted.",3,214,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00214
2016-04-07-T-004,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"I would like to ask the Minister how the various Government agencies, and in particular MINDEF, coordinate with the newly formed Cyber Security Agency (CSA) under IDA and MCI to strengthen Singapore's cyber security.

2016-04-07-T-004,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"First, I would like to ask if MINDEF can assure the public on the readiness of the SAF to handle cyber defence by explaining the types of threats it seeks to address.",2,217,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00217
2016-04-07-T-004,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"Cyber attacks need not simply be about conventional military operations. They can involve everything from gathering and corrupting sensitive information to disabling vulnerable civilian infrastructure such as public utilities, communications, financial systems, emergency and medical response, business infrastructure, and even transportation management systems. These actions can disrupt society and make it susceptible to pressure. How does MINDEF's cyber defence address these issues?",3,218,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00218
2016-04-07-T-004,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"Second, what further capabilities does MINDEF intend to develop? How does MINDEF intend to ensure that Singapore is well protected? Further, like other military systems, cyber defence capabilities may raise suspicions and tensions with neighbours that can ultimately make the nation less secure. How does MINDEF plan to mitigate this risk as it develops its cyber defence capabilities?",4,219,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00219

2016-04-07-T-004,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mdm Chairperson. Over a number of years, the publication of Defence's White Papers has become an increasing phenomenal in the Asia Pacific region. China issued its first one in 1998 and Japan in 2005. When informing the members of public about the immediate security environment, its strategic direction of the military and its core mission, such white papers are effective in answering why there is a need to have a strong and determined force that is able to defend the sovereignty of the country.",1,240,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00240

In fact, before the latest 2016, Australia's defence white paper was launched. Australia briefed China and Indonesia – two key partners – about its intention. In the RSIS commentary this year, a local researcher noted that Australia's 2016 white paper sent a strong positive signal to Southeast Asia and potentially contributes to the region's stability and peace.",2,241,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00241

It is my view that the wider publication of such initiatives through a white paper would serve MINDEF's interest both nationally and internationally.",3,242,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00242

But the current state of affairs is more than opaque, especially in an economic environment post SG50, which ought to be marked by greater fiscal prudence in light of multiple national priorities, all worthy of equal consideration. A white paper will put into perspective MINDEF's mission and requirement on hand, and its budgetary needs on the other, in the context of the needs of a small state.",5,244,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00244

Some years ago, the Taiwanese even released a comic book version of their white paper to cultivate an interest in military service among young readers. While I am not suggesting a need to do this, the point is that the white paper offers great flexibility for MINDEF to determine how best to get its message out. The Japanese's experience with white papers is quite telling, as it moves from a limited paper in 2015, into a much more comprehensive one last year. A MINDEF white paper can be even used to showcase the seriousness MINDEF takes in its safety regime, something I will talk about in my next cut.",6,245,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00245

2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Madam Chair, first let me thank the many Members who have highlighted the security challenges that confront Singapore today. I think they have made their points eloquently, many valid points and accurate observations. Collectively, they bring home this truth that as much as all of us want peace, work for greater cooperation and understanding among countries, neither the world nor the region we live in is Utopia; that each generation of Singaporeans will face threats, and each generation will have to renew their commitment to protect what they value or lose it; that we can only depend on ourselves to defend Singapore; that we will need to work with other like-minded partners to deal with potential troubles along the way. Singapore and Singaporeans will have to gear up for ""troubled peace"" in this new era after SG50.",1,266,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00266
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Each generation of Singaporeans will have to confront their own security threats. The founding generation, as Mr Vikram Nair pointed out, did not have it easy. Indeed, the 1960s and 1970s, as he said, were tumultuous times in Asia and, especially, for Southeast Asia. Whether it was Konfrontasi or the ideological battles against communism and communalism, these contests often led to violence or subversion. And because Southeast Asian states were newly-minted nations in the 1960s and 1970s, only recently freed from their colonial past, individual nations were more preoccupied with their national agendas, rather than cooperating as a region.",2,267,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00267

ASEAN has good growth and strong relations with other countries. But despite this progress, as Members have said, challenges exist. Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef noted that we live in an interconnected world. And, indeed, what happens in some other part of the world, many Members have said that it occurs very far away but comes closer to home, as Mr Zainal Sapari said, whether it is terrorism or technological warfare. And as Mr Vikram Nair noted, there have been numerous developments recently in the South China Sea, more terrorist attacks, and a sophisticated cyber attack involving the US Federal Reserve.",3,268,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00268

In summary, they asked  what are the main security threats to Singapore, and how significant are they when compared to previous years? How is the SAF responding to these threats? How can we keep Singapore and Singaporeans safe? How prepared are we? These are all important questions that can change our lives here irrevocably. I agree completely with Mr Zainal Sapari when he said that the consequences of failure will be great. So, I intend to answer these questions in the course of this reply for the COS.",4,269,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00269
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"First, terrorism. The clear and present threat upon us is terrorism. As of now, there is no specific intelligence of any imminent plot against Singapore, but the general assessment by our intelligence agencies indicates that almost all cities are likely targets, including Singapore. Members here already know of attacks in other cities in the past 18 months – Paris, Sydney, San Bernardino, Istanbul, Bangkok, Jakarta, Brussels and, most recently, Lahore. A few months later, you may have to add more cities to that list. Threat levels for Singapore from ISIS are higher than those posed by Al-Qaeda (AQ) and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) when they were active. So, if you'd like a simple number, what Al-Qaeda was able to attract − both sympathisers and operatives − in the last 10 years, ISIS has already exceeded the number in the last three years. So our assessment is that the threat levels from ISIS are higher than that from AQ and JI. Let me explain our reasons for this assessment.",5,270,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00270
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"First, ISIS has greater means. ISIS controls territories and oil fields in Iraq and Syria from which they can draw resources to fund tens of thousands of fighters and further its goals. ISIS even uses drones for its operations, like a military. In fact, they are a military. They can orchestrate and coordinate attacks far away, as they did in Paris, Brussels or even near us, Jakarta. Their tentacles can reach far. Just this week, the Malaysian Police revealed that ISIS had allocated around S$100,000 to Katibah Nusantara − a network that Mr Vikram Nair pointed out. It is a Malay Archipelago Combat Unit, and ISIS had given them S$100,000 to finance terrorist attacks and bombings in Southeast Asia.",6,271,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00271
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"ISIS operatives and sympathisers have already formed networks in our region, as some Members have observed. In the past year, close to a thousand people from Southeast Asia have travelled to Iraq and Syria to join the fight, including Singaporeans. And more have been radicalised without even travelling to the Middle East. Most recently, Members would have read that four Singaporeans were prevented from joining the armed conflicts in the Middle East. As you have pointed out, returning fighters will bring back their extremist ideology, share their experience in weapons, explosives and actual fighting. In addition, we know that they have linked up with existing cells, like the JI offshoot, Jamaah Ansharut Tauhid, and Abu Sayyaf. Greater means, as I said.",7,272,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00272
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Second, ISIS has motive. In our region, ISIS has declared its mission to establish a wilayat, a ""caliphate"", and Katibah Nusantara is leading the charge. This central ideology of a Southeast Asian ""caliphate"" binds Islamic militants who have already set up training camps in Sulawesi, Aceh and in the Southern Philippines. Even the Uighurs are known to have joined a training camp in Sulawesi, led by the Indonesian militant, Santoso. I am not sure what the tenuous connections had been previously between militants in Indonesia and the Uighurs, but here, you have it − that ideology binds them together.",8,273,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00273

Every shopping mall, every crowded place is an opportunity for violent extremists to target innocent civilians and cause as much suffering and mayhem as possible. ISIS operatives and sympathisers, especially what we call ""clean skins"" – those with no prior criminal record – can travel and smuggle components of arms and explosives.

2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Under these circumstances, can Singapore – or, for that matter, any city – guarantee its residents that no extremist attack will occur? I think the answer is an obvious one. Only a foolish and complacent government will provide that false sense of security. Instead, we must step up our defences, bring our citizens into confidence, and, more importantly, confront this threat and prepare to deal with the aftermath together.",11,276,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00276
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"I will elaborate how the SAF will respond to this. But even as we ask Singaporeans to prepare ourselves to deal with extremist threats, let me just say that we must be mindful, at the same time, of the trajectory of state-to-state relations surrounding us. As Members have pointed out, the disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea are increasing. They are symptomatic of a more powerful dynamic of strategic rivalry and rising nationalism. This state of flux, different from post-World War II, different from the Cold War, is creating tension. This dynamic will stress existing military cooperation and alliances; it will stress international agreements or laws, even the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Let me give a few examples to illustrate what I mean.",12,277,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00277
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"On a regular basis, Japanese fighter jets scramble in response to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) military aircraft that enter Japan's Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ). The PLA planes are flying into disputed airspace around the Diao Yu/Senkaku Islands. So, the Japanese would have to respond, and they scramble. It is a common occurrence.",13,278,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00278
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Let me give you a second example. The largest overlap in the South China Sea claims is between Vietnam's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and China's ""nine dash line"". You would recall that just two years ago, Vietnamese and Chinese vessels clashed over an oil rig in the South China Sea. And you would remember that, in Vietnam, they held protests and burned down foreign-owned factories, meaning to target Chinese-owned factories. Unfortunately, some Taiwanese factories also got burnt. They could not differentiate. They hear them speak in Mandarin, and so, they got burnt. Just recently, the Vietnamese coast guard seized a Chinese oil tanker allegedly operating in Vietnam's waters. And for the first time ever − if you have not noticed this − a Japanese submarine arrived in Cam Ranh International Port. It called in Vietnam last month for the first time.",14,279,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00279
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"An example closer to home  the Indonesian Government has also taken a hard stance against illegal fishing in its EEZ. Since President Joko Widodo took office in 2014, Indonesia has confiscated and destroyed approximately 150 foreign fishing boats. Just last month, there was a standoff between the Chinese coast guard and an Indonesian patrol vessel. Indonesia has since announced plans to deploy fighter jets to the Natuna Islands. And supposedly, as a show of strength, military ships of the Indonesian National Defence Forces (TNI) are used to blow up these merchant vessels. It is not the most cost-effective solution. Military munitions cost more, but as a show of strength, they will use the TNI to blow up the vessels.",15,280,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00280
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"As we observed, these incidents are occurring at an increasing regularity. We have to remember that they occur against the backdrop of Asia's highest military spending ever. In fact, collectively, Asia has spent more on its defence than Europe, in absolute dollars, since 2012. We have exceeded Europe. Rising nationalism and improving economies have fueled many Asian countries to spend larger and larger sums to modernise their militaries. In itself, this is not wrong. But with more capable militaries, miscalculations or missteps can precipitate serious tensions and even physical conflicts.",16,281,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00281
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"As we look around and look at our security challenges, this troubled peace around us reaffirms our policy on steady and prudent defence spending. Mr Zainal Sapari asked about this, as well as Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef. I want to thank Members from all parties here – NCMPs included – for their steadfast support for the defence budgets over the years. Together, Members in this House were wise not to have taken short periods of peace for granted. As some Members have pointed out, Singapore, too, could have gone down the path of European countries to reap our own ""peace dividend"" because the threat of communism had waned and we see ASEAN progressing. But if we had been so lulled into that complacent mood and under-invested in defence capabilities, then, just like countries such as Finland or the Baltic states, I think we would have regretted it now and rushed to catch up. But we avoided spikes or dips in our defence spending and maintained a strong SAF.",17,282,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00282
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"The next decade would not be easy for Singapore. In fact, I believe that the next few decades will pose to Singapore its greatest challenge since our independence. We have never had a situation where our factors of production are on the decline and our needs are going up. Even in the 1960s and 1970s, when our needs were going up, we reaped our demographic dividend. But in 2030, you will have nearly one million people above 65 years old, your workforce is declining and your social spending needs to go up.",18,283,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00283
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"But even as our population ages and social spending increases, we must maintain steady defence spending because that is the most effective way to stretch every defence dollar. It allows us to plan long-term. It allows us to avoid disruptive changes from fluctuating expenditures. It is very difficult, as Mr Sapari has pointed out, and other countries have discovered, to suddenly wake up and say, ""Oh, I need a stronger defence because the threats have gone worse"" and then quickly expect to build a strong defence. It will be too little, too late.",19,284,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00284
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"This PAP government will continue to invest wisely and spend prudently on defence. For MINDEF, we buy only what the SAF needs and after a robust and stringent evaluation process. We do not go around shopping for expensive or highly sophisticated stuff. We adopt the most cost-effective solution, looking clearly at what we need. And our first preference is to upgrade existing platforms, if we can do it. For example, like the F-16s, we are going to upgrade them. We only buy new equipment if Singapore needs them to maintain that defence edge.",20,285,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00285
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Some Members have asked how I see our defence expenditure going forward. Our defence expenditure has roughly kept pace with inflation, growing by about 4% annually in nominal terms over the past decade. I expect to maintain the same trajectory in the longer term, but we have to watch inflation and see if there is deflation or lower rise of inflation. Sometimes, it does not get passed on to the equipment we buy so quickly. So, we have to observe.",21,286,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00286
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Is this era of troubled peace hyped up? Some have said so. Some have questioned  do we really need that kind of defence? The United States, the world's most wealthy democracy with the largest and most capable military, can perhaps take that line and live with the consequences, if something goes wrong. But I think for Singapore, a little red dot in the middle of a region with extremist threats, rising nationalism and strategic rivalry, we should guard against the worst and prepare ahead.",22,287,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00287
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Indeed, some scholars and even world leaders have suggested that the face of ""war"" has already changed and is upon us. According to them, unlike in the past when wars were fought in specific localities, today's conflicts are increasingly borderless, and occur wave after wave. So, against extremism, first there was Al-Qaeda, 9/11. That was weakened. Now, ISIS. But if ISIS is defeated, I believe another group will rise to take its place. It may not be in Iraq or Syria but there is a host of failed states that an extremist group can gain a geographical foothold in and take the resources, whether it is Libya or other countries.",23,288,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00288

2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Mr Zaqy Mohamad talked about hybrid warfare that is ongoing. Indeed, it is the antithesis of Total Defence. And if you think about it, I think that generation was prescient and very clever in launching Total Defence – this was more than 30 years ago – because hybrid warfare is an orchestrated campaign to weaken and fracture the solidarity of a target nation. It is no laughing matter because it is actually being practised.",25,290,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00290
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"According to this doctrine, the aggressor targets a specific country or countries, and undertakes a long-term campaign to undermine the civil, economic, social, psychological and military defences. That is equivalent to our Total Defence. For example, ISIS employs hybrid warfare skillfully and exploits social media in sophisticated ways to target the young and innocent. Even online games, which seemingly are innocent, are used to socialise youngsters to their cause, and the shocking propaganda videos of beheadings and burning people go viral and attract more sympathisers.",26,291,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00291
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Members have talked about cyber attacks. Cyber attacks are integral parts of hybrid warfare.

2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Members here have asked how the SAF should respond in this new normal of troubled peace. I am glad to say that there was foresight in leaders in MINDEF and the SAF to have identified these broad challenges more than a decade ago. It was, as Mr Cedric Foo pointed out, that the previous SAF construct could not have addressed these threats decisively – this wider spectrum of threats – because the previous structures of the SAF, as the Members here know, centred on combined arms within the Army, with a competent Air Force and Navy. They would have been inadequate to deal with non-traditional security challenges – natural disasters or hybrid threats such as cyber attacks or terrorism.",29,294,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00294
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"But as Members here pointed out, the spectrum of today's threats continues to widen and evolve and the SAF must adapt. Let me share what the SAF is doing to respond decisively.",30,295,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00295

2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Since 9/11, the SAF has stood up task forces to deal with peacetime threats. These task forces are geared up in high readiness posture, fully manned to respond quickly even with little warning. Let me elaborate on these task forces. The Special Operations Task Force (SOTF) is drawn from the Commandos, the Naval Diving Unit and assets from across the three Services, and they will be our SAF's first responders in counter-terrorism and other contingency operations. There is another task force for homeland security and this is called the Island Defence Task Force, and it is operational. In other words, it safeguards our homeland security with active and NS servicemen protecting key installations. You would have seen them if you are in Changi Airport, if you are working in Jurong Island and Sembawang Wharves. They regularly conduct patrols with the Home Team and because they are tasked to deal with real threats, they are armed and given clear rules of engagement.",32,297,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00297

2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"We have assessed, as we said, the rising threat of terrorism. In the next few months, the SAF will re-double our efforts to gear up for counter-terrorism. First, studying what happened in Paris, Jakarta and Brussels, the SAF will enhance its incident response. The SOTF must have the capability to respond even faster when activated, and have the means to neutralise armed attackers, in addition to hostage rescue.",34,299,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00299
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Some of you have asked  can we use technology? Indeed, we have to and we must. The SAF is working with our defence engineers and scientists to equip these special forces with better tactical sensors like micro-UAVs, perhaps small enough to fit in your palm and well-suited for urban terrain. We will continue to develop new technologies and tools that will give the SAF an edge in this fight against terror.",35,300,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00300
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"In this, working with the Home Team closely and seamlessly is crucial if we are to bring to bear the full strength of our security capabilities. The SAF is working closely to share intelligence and develop joint operational command systems. We are conducting more joint exercises together. Last year, Exercise High Crest was conducted to validate our Whole-of-Government response to simultaneous maritime security threats. In that exercise, various agencies, the SPF, the Home Team, the SAF, the SCDF, ICA and MPA, worked together to intercept a terrorist speedboat, storm a hijacked merchant vessel, and deal with the aftermath.",36,301,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00301
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Second, more SAF units will be trained to take on a wider range of security tasks. We do not assume, as Ms Low Yen Ling says, that attacks will only be carried out by lone-wolves or wolf packs – smaller groups – like those which occurred in Jakarta. We must be able to deal with orchestrated attacks, like those which occurred in Paris and Brussels, where airports, MRT stations, shopping malls and town centres are targeted simultaneously. To deal with these scenarios, more SAF units will be trained to conduct deterrence patrols in populous areas. These units will be better equipped to perform their tasks. So, for example, we commissioned last year the Peacekeeper Protected Response Vehicle (PRV), which will give our responders greater mobility, protection, and more precise firepower to deal decisively with threats.",37,302,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00302
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"How do we train? I think that is a question that some Members asked, including Mr Cedric Foo. I agree with you – for SAF soldiers to competently undertake this range of missions, we will have to continue to invest in new and realistic training facilities. The SAF has decided to build a new high-density urban training facility and this will have features such as high-rise buildings, mock-up transport nodes and complex road networks. And that will provide a highly realistic training ground for counter-terrorism, as well as conventional urban operations.",38,303,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00303
2016-04-07-T-004,Ng Eng Hen,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"But as some of you rightly pointed out, beyond our homeland response here, we need to address the threat at its source. Because only when the source of the threat and recruitment is diminished or eradicated, can the situation here improve. It was so for Al-Qaeda. If we did not address or diminish the capability of Al-Qaeda, more cells like JI would flourish. This is why Singapore has been involved in multinational counter-terrorism operations since 2007, first against Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, and now against ISIS.",39,304,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00304

This IAT is tasked to monitor suspected terrorist facilities and activities, to help the coalition partners in disrupting supply chains that feed terror networks here. The commanders there have commended our efforts and asked the SAF to continue the IAT deployment which we have extended for another year this year.",40,305,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00305

Members, such as Ms Jessica Tan, have asked about this, whether they are important. I will tell you they are very important because that is where we can validate our capabilities. Singapore is not very large to train in. My Terrexes can go at 70-90 km/h. Training exercises might be finished in 15 minutes if you are going at that speed.",41,306,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00306

We will introduce a new SAF Engineering Scholarship to attract bright young individuals with the interest and commitment to join the SAF as military engineers. Just as with the recipients of The SAF Scholarship, those who take up this SAF Engineering Scholarship will be able to depart for their university studies earlier, so that on their return, they can apply their specialised skills and knowledge to the SAF as military engineers.

We will build greater security into our software design, shore up the defences in our network architecture to make them more resistant and resilient to cyber attacks. This includes hardware infrastructure. There will also be substantial investment into developing more and better trained cyber defence personnel.

It is foolhardy to try, and we will fail. For example, to stop the spread of terrorism globally, we are stepping up our intelligence-sharing with our neighbours in Malaysia and Indonesia, and partners such as the US and Australia, so that they can provide us with early warning and help us apprehend suspects that intend to do us harm. This is particularly important as militants have been using Southeast Asia as a transit point.",59,324,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00324

Last December, US Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter and I concluded the enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement. This agreement updates and deepens our defence ties to cover non-conventional security areas, such as counter-terrorism, biosecurity and cyber defence. It is that close relationship with the US which has given us access to much-needed training space and high-end defence technology. Whether it is our F-16, F-15, Chinook or Apache helicopters, our pilots train extensively in the US, and they are given access to training areas many times the size of Singapore.",61,326,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00326

Some of you have asked why we engage in these. To paraphrase Churchill, ""jaw-jaw is better than war-war"". Yes, this requires effort but, more importantly, coming together as a defence community promotes a rules-based security architecture, things that we can agree on, that are underpinned by international law and which create opportunities for dialogue and practical cooperation.

2016-04-07-T-004,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,One suggestion is to consider how more NSmen can be deployed to the NS units more quickly than before; ideally not more than two years after they are operationally-ready date.

2016-04-07-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Our compensation framework takes reference from and is more generous than the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA). Any compensation amounts are generally two to four times of that provided under the WICA. MINDEF also pays for all necessary medical expenses incurred at Government and restructured hospitals or clinics for the treatment of service-related injury, for as long as required. Beyond compensation provisions, our welfare frameworks provide additional support to the servicemen and their families through the SAF Benevolent Fund and the SAF Care Fund.",11,409,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00409

Mr Faisal Manap rattled off many suggestions. I was trying to catch them, after hearing them for the first time. But the impression I get is, I think, do not go down the road where recognition of NS becomes a valuation of the sacrifice. Any compensation counts to the dollar. Because it will never be enough. You lost a limb, you lost a loved one. It will never be enough. But we will have to do what we can that is fair and we hope that our compensation and welfare frameworks can provide adequate support when unfortunate incidents happen in the course of service.",12,410,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00410
2016-04-07-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Mr Pritam Singh also asked about the management of NSmen undergoing Operationally Ready NS (ORNS). Let us first talk about when ORNS starts. And I must say that it is also in the interest of the SAF for ORNS to start as soon as possible. But not in the first year, because those would have just ""ORD-ed"", and it is quite difficult to be called back in the first year.",13,411,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00411

But some NSmen may begin their ORNS training cycle later for a variety of reasons – they are overseas for work or study, deferred due to heavy commitments, academic or professional, or they are pending medical reviews. They may also be trainers or HQ staff who do not have a unit and need to be redeployed to another unit, and that accounts for the majority of the reasons why ORNS starts later for certain people.",14,412,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00412

2016-04-07-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"There are a few ways. One way is to ensure that the first few years of ORNS comprise shorter, low key trainings. And that facilitates the calling up. Second, we have tied up with local universities to facilitate the call-up of the students. This also ensures that ORNS training starts early. Third, is to make some changes to how we deploy NSmen. For example, trainers who went through full-time NS at the BMTC may be deployed as training instructors at our Training Institutes. These measures ensure that ORNS training starts early. More importantly, it holds the unit together, keeping the camaraderie going.",16,414,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00414
2016-04-07-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"And then, there is the issue of when ORNS ends. Since 2006, we were able to reduce the ORNS cycle from 13 years to 10 years. A great number were able to complete by their early 30s, when they have many more pre-occupations in life. There is a structure to the 10 years of ORNS – starting with low key, perhaps company-level training, before ramping up to high key, longer exercises.",17,415,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00415
2016-04-07-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"However, when an NSman misses a high key training due to health reasons, extended overseas assignment or, like Mr Baey Yam Keng just told the story, given an incentive trip, he may then disrupt his ORNS cycle. Some of us may have experienced that ourselves and we end up undergoing more low key ICTs and not fulfilling our high key ones. There are a couple of scenarios when that happens; when you miss high key ICTs. If he remains in the same unit, then he may be called up for other ORNS activities throughout the year, such as operational briefings, exercise preparations. These are typically low key ICTs, and they clock up. If he is deployed to another unit, he will then follow the operational requirements and call-ups of the new unit, which will include both low and high key ICTs.",18,416,2016-04-07-T-004-S-00416
2016-04-07-T-004,Ong Ye Kung,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Ultimately, this is not an easy issue. Deferments for various work, health, family reasons, they are ever rising. We are all getting so busy, and the SAF needs to be understanding to these competing life priorities – the point that Mr Baey had just made too. But, at the same time, this disrupts and affects the completion of the ORNS cycle.

We have been finding ways to show appreciation to our national servicemen, and those who support them – the NSman Tax Relief, National Service Housing, Medical and Education (NS HOME) Awards, SAFRA facilities. These forms of recognition are important to let them know that their sacrifices are deeply appreciated, and for the greater good of Singapore.

In the process, what we lose is that he is no longer in the unit. To many NSmen, that actually is quite important because your friends and comrades are all from that unit. So, while we try to implement that – make-up high key ICT, it is also in our interest to cater to young people and their many preoccupations. If they can finish their ORNS by early 30s, then start to have babies, get their flats and start to work hard and be more focused on their career, I think it is a good thing.

2016-04-07-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mdm Chair, should we be concerned about the state of our economy? The economy grew by 2% in 2015 and we are expected to grow between 1% and 3% in 2016. So, by the aggregate macro indicators, we grew slower but we are not in recession. Based on MTI's forecast for the year, we should not be in recession this year as well. But is this the situation on the ground? Based on sentiment surveys and many other anecdotal observations and feedback, businesses have reflected that times are bad and many are struggling to manage both top and bottom lines. Are we at risk of entering into a recession?",2,502,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00502

It recorded the weakest performance in the last quarter of 2015, with a contraction of 6.7%. This is extending the decline of 6% in the preceding quarter.

Their continued growth and vibrancy are of utmost importance to achieving our goal of becoming an innovative and value-creating economy. As we restructure the economy, we help to help our SMEs build capabilities, including improving productivity, and seek growth opportunities through internationalising. The risks of SMEs being displaced as we restructure the economy are real. While it is not possible to save any single company from failing, our economic agencies should do our utmost to help the SMEs transform, upgrade and to capture new growth opportunities.",10,510,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00510

We are not spared. But then on the defensive, we should gear ourselves to ride on this wave of change and seize the new opportunities. Obviously, it will require us to re-orientate and, more importantly, for the workers to reskill for the new types of jobs to come. Lifelong learning and continuous skills upgrading are the best defence against skills obsolescence and structural unemployment.",11,511,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00511

In this era of fast paced technological changes and never-ending innovation, it is increasingly challenging to predict product trends or to anticipate what the next big thing would be. In that regard, the CFE has a very tough job. Could the Minister also provide an update on the progress of the CFE so far?",13,513,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00513

On 4 February this year, it was signed by 12 member countries − Singapore, US, Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, Chile and Peru. Representing Singapore in Auckland for the TPP signing was Minister Lim Hng Kiang himself, and the Minister had spoken about the benefits to Singapore investors and businesses of a more open, predictable and transparent regional marketplace.",12,526,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00526

The leaders of the other TPP members also hailed the Agreement, with US President Barack Obama saying that the TPP would give the US an advantage over other leading economies, naming China, as one that the US would have advantage over, and it is a trade deal ""that puts American workers first"".",13,527,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00527

Yet, on the other hand, various US Presidential candidates have recently threatened not to recommend a ratification of the TPP by the US Congress. If anything, the views are indeed very varied and sometimes conflicting.",14,528,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00528

Is it true that the TPP is weighted in US's favour and provides less benefits to other countries and Singapore? Most importantly, beyond benefits for corporations, what are the benefits to Singapore workers? There are some, in our midst, that are worried that such free trade agreements may mean that Singapore will open its doors more freely to other professionals coming to Singapore to work. May the Minister clarify this issue, because I believe that these are quite are of concern to many Singaporeans, especially in light of the slowing economy?",15,529,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00529

The global economic recovery has been weaker than expected, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has again downgraded its global growth forecasts.

Besides rebalancing towards consumption and services-led growth, China has also been increasingly in-sourcing the intermediate goods and services required to produce its manufacturing output, rather than importing them. While China is making this transition, the countries which trade with China will also be affected because supply chains will have to adjust. In Singapore we will need to find new growth niches in order to remain relevant as China makes its adjustments.",4,632,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00632

The local workforce will continue to grow, but at a slower rate than before as more baby boomers approach retirement age. Overall workforce growth will be around 1%-2% per annum for the rest of the decade. While all sectors will have to adjust to the tighter supply of labour, labour-intensive services sectors such as food services will likely be more adversely affected.",6,634,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00634

When we are on a slow growth trajectory of 1%-3%, some sectors will grow more strongly than the 1%-3% range and some sectors will be below the 1%-3% range.

For example, despite the fact that we have the US-Singapore FTA (USSFTA), few of our automotive parts manufacturers would export to the US today. This is because the US also has the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which has created a very competitive automotive supply chain amongst the US, Canada and Mexico. However, when the TPP enters into force, Singapore will have direct access to all the NAFTA markets, and because the rules are applied commonly to all TPP countries, Singapore automotive parts manufacturers may become a competitive supplier of auto parts to TPP countries over time.",27,655,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00655

With the TPP, however, more of the raw materials that we process will count towards being ""TPP or Singapore made"". Our garment manufacturers can, therefore, look forward to sourcing more competitively from the TPP region and focus on keeping the high-value aspects of production in Singapore, knowing that their exports will now enjoy a comparative advantage because of this ""regional cumulation"" effect.

2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"Madam, the manufacturing sector is a key pillar of our economy that accounts for nearly 20% of nominal GDP in 2015. Though that is slightly lower than in 2010, largely due to the relatively faster growth of financial and insurance services and amongst others, the real value-added of the manufacturing sector, in fact, increased by $4.6 billion over the same period. That is a compound annual growth rate of about 1.4%. Some commented on the decline last year but that was due to the impact on one or two particular sectors, especially offshore and marine due to the oil-related impact.",11,675,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00675

In 2015, more than 60% – six out of 10 – of the resident workers in the sector were in skilled jobs. This is higher again than the overall economy. Median wages in the manufacturing sector are also higher than that for the overall economy.",13,677,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00677

Based on MTI's estimates, a $1 billion increase in manufacturing value-added due to an increase in final demand will generate about $300 million of value-added and 2,400 jobs in the rest of the economy. So, the spillover impact is substantial. For all these reasons, manufacturing remains important to our economy.",14,678,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00678

In elder care, the use of assisted technology can ease the burden on healthcare professionals and care-givers, and nursing homes such as Peacehaven are already exploring possible applications. Similarly, with STB's support, two robots will be deployed from July this year in Park Avenue Rochester Hotel for housekeeping and back-of-house functions, such as transportation of linen, refuse and bulky items. So, if you go there, you may not see it because it is operating at the back-of-house.

Precisely because of the human interface, a lot more effort needs to be done, in terms of how you calibrate these devices in order to serve their purpose and to be able to respond. But there are significant efforts being taken and part of it is, of course, what we are trying to do in some of these verticals.",20,684,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00684

Yet, if you look at our track record and our experience, we have always encouraged and nurtured close partnerships between quite diverse stakeholders in our economic system; some of them are ""natural partners"" and others could even be competitors. Let me illustrate what I mean.",4,696,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00696
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"We have supported ""natural partners"" through schemes such as the Partnerships for Capability Transformation (PACT), where large enterprises upgrade their suppliers' capabilities, through sourcing and qualification processes, and that is mutually beneficial. Last year, PACT was enhanced to support activities like joint product development between larger enterprises and their suppliers. So, there is co-development.",5,697,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00697
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"We have also brought together competitors in collaborative projects. An example of that is A*STAR's Aerospace Research Consortium which brings together Airbus, Boeing and Embraer to undertake pre-competitive research into complex problems facing the industry. This is not just about collaboration with the Government, but also within the private sector. More companies are embracing the idea of open innovation and working collaboratively. These partnerships are not dysfunctional. They are born out of the recognition that even competitors stand to benefit when they cooperate in certain parts of the business process, either because it is an area which is very complex or where the barrier costs are very high. So, a collective effort tends to achieve a much better outcome, and they can all share in it.",6,698,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00698
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Henry Kwek and Assoc Prof Randolph Tan asked how the Industry Transformation Programme differs from our current approach. At the enterprise level, the Government will continue to support our companies in their innovation, productivity, skills upgrading and internationalisation efforts. However, as I have mentioned and I think you have heard in the comments by many Members, the nature of the current trends and challenges is such that it calls for broader strategies at the sectoral level. We need measures which the market may not be ready to supply or adopt. Take for example the case of modularised robotics solutions. It may not quite be market viable yet. You could call this market failure or perhaps market gap. We will need to act proactively in order to generate the solutions which can be adopted.",7,699,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00699

Each will bring an important perspective. Centres of innovation, for example, will have a view on the technology landscape. The TACs will have a better grasp of industry trends and what the needs of their members are. Unions will have a view on how skills training and workforce development can take place. We need to bring all these together to address some of the most salient issues in the medium to long term for our sectors.",9,701,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00701
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"To coordinate and execute the Industry Transformation effort, we will appoint ""cluster champions"" from agencies like EDB, SPRING and IE Singapore. But they are not the only ones, because there are other agencies looking at different sectors. I understand Assoc Prof Randolph Tan's fears that this might impose excessive administrative burden. However, based on our experience, the plans that are being formulated should result in a tighter coordination of efforts and more effective use of our resources. We will have to implement and work on this, and I think it is going to be an iterative process as we go forward.",10,702,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00702
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Sir, the Industry Transformation Program will be complemented at the enterprise level with efforts to support businesses to adopt technology, and key to this is the Automation Support Package which was announced in this Budget. Over the next three years, $400 million of support will be available for more than 300 automation projects. This will comprise three elements – the enhanced Capability Development Grant (CDG) which supports 50% of full scale automation project costs up to $1 million; the new 100% Investment Allowance (IA); and the enhanced Local Enterprise Finance Scheme (LEFS).",11,703,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00703

Our start-ups have also attracted more investor interest, which is one measure of their quality. The number of venture capitalist deals doubled from about 70 in 2007 to 140 in 2013, with aggregate deal value increasing seven-fold from $120 million to $860 million. The number as well as the value of these venture capital funded transactions have been significant in the start-ups space.",16,708,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00708

2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"First on internationalisation. There are more and more opportunities for a start-up to scale through digital internationalisation. Indeed, you could say that many of these companies are born global because from the moment they start, they can access international markets. BeMyGuest (BMG) is a local start-up that recently became the first Singaporean company to be featured on Fast Company's ""World's 50 Most Innovative Companies List 2016"" for its online travel platform. IE Singapore supported this company in its digital integration with Ctrip, China's largest online travel agency. This has allowed BMG to establish tie ups with 25 other Chinese partners, and increase bookings by over 100 times in a period of nine months. That is the power of digital access to markets. And this year, the company is also working with IE Singapore to penetrate other Asian markets such as Japan, India, Indonesia and Korea.",19,711,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00711

2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Secondly on partnerships. What we see more and more are large enterprises embracing open innovation to access new technologies and ideas. EDB and SPRING have in fact been working with many multinational corporations (MNCs) and large local enterprises (LLEs) to undertake corporate incubation and venture activities, as well as co-innovation partnerships with our start-ups. What this means is that with such partnerships, our start-ups will have the financial resources, expertise and networks to scale.",21,713,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00713
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"On regulatory environment, let me use the Medtech industry as an example. The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has been adopting a risk-based approach to the regulation of medical devices by ensuring that the controls commensurate with the risk of the devices to individual health. HSA has also expedited approval for devices that have been cleared by reference agencies. More recently, they have introduced an online Medical Device Risk Classification Tool, which allows companies to quickly identify the risk classification of a medical device within five to ten minutes. This is important because the risk classification tells them the kind of regulatory hurdles they face. And this five to ten minutes, to put it in context, is much faster than the previous one to two weeks of paper-based processing. HSA and many of our other regulators are exploring how we can create an enabling environment without compromising their core regulatory objectives.",22,714,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00714

We will continue to provide support for mentorship through initiatives such as SPRING's Incubator Development Programme (IDP). Under the IDP, incubators and accelerators are supported with grants to enhance their capabilities and programmes, including the engagement of mentors. Through the 21 incubators and accelerators supported under IDP, about 90 industry professionals have been engaged to provide mentorship and expertise to our start-ups. This is something we can scale according to the needs and responses.",23,715,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00715
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Let me now move on to the point on innovation. I agree fully with Ms Foo Mee Har and Ms Chia Yong Yong who emphasised the need to ensure that value is created for Singapore from our $19 billion investment in RIE 2020, and our broader investments in R&D. Our investments in R&D, have strengthened our innovation ecosystem and created value for Singapore. One measure is the number of research scientist and engineer jobs in Singapore, which has increased from 19,000 in 2004 to 33,000 in 2014. That is a significant increase and importantly, 70% of those jobs are held by locals. So, we have been able to grow our local capacity as well.",24,716,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00716
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Another measure is the business spending on R&D, which has doubled from $2.6 billion to $5.2 billion over the same 10-year period, catalysed by public spending on R&D. So on one hand, the businesses have been catalysed to spend more on R&D, and we also see a commensurate enhancement in our capacity, especially in the local talent pool, to meet those needs.",25,717,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00717
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Importantly, our R&D investments have also enabled new industries to grow. Our biomedical sciences (BMS) R&D initiative, which was launched in the year 2000, has spawned a strong BMS sector contributing over $12 billion in value-added (VA) and employing more than 18,000 people in 2014. As a reference, if I remember correctly in 2000, the VA from the BMS sector was about $4 billion.",26,718,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00718
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"We also, to assure Members, have a framework to track key performance indicators of our R&D investments. These range from input measures such as R&D intensity and researcher intensity (relative to comparable economies so that we have some benchmarking), to measures of the quality of the research such as citations and papers published, and measures of value creation - which several Members have talked about - through commercialisation including licensing and spin outs.",27,719,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00719
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Ms Chia asked about the treatment of IP ownership arising from R&D activities. In general, A*STAR retains ownership that of the IP that it develops; where IP is jointly developed with the collaborator, including from the private sector, the IP may be jointly-owned. And we have multiple mechanisms to facilitate the use and commercialisation of that IP later on. Licensing is one but there are other mechanisms.",28,720,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00720
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Beyond the licensing of IP, we also have longer term initiatives to align our R&D investments with the needs of companies and the economy. The Industry Alignment Fund (IAF), which was introduced under RIE 2015, seeks to tighten the linkages between R&D capabilities and industry's needs. We are trying to bring the research in our institutes closer to industry and IAF is one mechanism to do that. IAF has supported about 600 projects to date. These projects were carried out in collaboration with industry by our public sector research institutes, and also pertain to developing capabilities needed by industry.",29,721,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00721
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Under RIE 2020, the IAF funding will be increased by $200 million to $1.8 billion. We are adding to that Fund because that is where we want to emphasise the R&D efforts in the way it is aligned with the industry.",30,722,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00722
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"The IAF is also being adapted to meet the changing needs of industry, which are becoming more complex and need to tap on a diverse spectrum of capabilities. For example, Nestle see opportunities in combining traditional food manufacturing with sophisticated biomedical knowledge, especially on nutrition and formulations. The Nestle Research Centre Asia was established here to leverage on A*STAR's research capabilities to develop new nutritional products.",31,723,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00723
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"We will allocate about $660 million to this form of IAF-Industry Collaboration Projects, which will draw on the best researchers and capabilities across our public sector research community. And this goes to the point about what do we expect in return – we require tangible contributions from industry partners in cash, in terms of the resources they commit and the longevity of that commitment, as a measure of their commitment to the projects and the projects' relevance to industry. Very often, these commitments are also in parallel with other kinds of activities the industry partners are undertaking in Singapore.",32,724,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00724
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"I just want to make one final point on this. I know this was not the intent of Ms Chia's comment. She qualified it but I want to restate it. We should be cautious not to adopt a parochial attitude towards innovation or the ownership of IP. That is a very important thing to bear in mind. Some of the best outcomes in innovation are produced when it is undertaken in an open and collaborative manner. We must preserve that environment in our R&D ecosystem. Hence, we must maintain an open innovation ecosystem that fosters collaboration between multiple stakeholders, whether they are public or private, large or small, local or foreign. Such R&D activities bring many other valuable benefits to Singapore which I have enumerated.",33,725,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00725
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Ms Foo, Mr Saktiandi and Ms Sun Xueling rightly pointed out that innovation should play a key role in the push for our SMEs to transform. And we will enhance SMEs' access to technologies and expertise. One way is through the Intellectual Property Intermediary (IPI) under A*STAR which has helped our companies source technologies locally and overseas. So far, they have matched, I am told, more than 70 companies.",34,726,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00726
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Recently, this intermediary was transferred to SPRING. Through SPRING's network amongst SMEs and the Trade Associations and Chambers, I think the level of technology transfer that is relevant to the needs of the SMEs is going to be significantly improved.",35,727,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00727
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,There is also an initiative to simplify licensing terms for SMEs. I was very pleased to learn that A*STAR's licensing agreements are now shorter and use simpler language – we can all do with simpler language – and it has reduced the time required for licensing significantly.,36,728,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00728
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"We will also do more – and I think this is something that is noteworthy for Members – to grow the in-house innovation capabilities of our SMEs. A*STAR and SPRING's GET-Up Programme actually seconds our public researchers in our Institutions of Higher Learning, (IHLs), research institutes and polytechnics to the SMEs to undertake innovation projects. So, they become the employees of that company in order to work on their research blueprint, in order to develop particular solutions. In many cases, they have gone on to become commercially valuable. To-date, we have more than 600 researchers who have been seconded to SMEs. Under RIE 2020, we will enhance the programme to second senior research scientists and engineers (RSEs) to SMEs.",37,729,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00729

2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Low asked about the Government's plans to enhance and diversify our energy sources. We have taken significant steps in this regard. Our liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal, which commenced operations in 2013, allows us to geographically diversify our sources of natural gas, which is our main source of energy. Just to take up Mr Low's point, you could say that we are intensifying our use of LNG, but what we are actually doing with the LNG terminal is diversifying geographically our sources of natural gas. That is a very important strategic step and something that should not be underestimated in terms of its value to Singapore.",39,731,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00731
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"We have been expanding the terminal capacity and the fourth tank could be completed by 2018, which would take throughput capacity to 11 million tonnes per annum. EMA is studying the need for more.",40,732,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00732
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"There are some questions on renewables which Parliamentary Secretary Ms Low Yen Ling will take up. We are also studying the feasibility of electricity imports in the medium to long term. That is where the ASEAN Power Grid (APG) is relevant. It is really a plan to have a network of the grid infrastructure for an integrated ASEAN electricity market. To date, Members may not be surprised to hear that six of the 16 planned bilateral interconnection projects have been completed, including one between Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia.",41,733,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00733
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Low asked about the potential impact to Singapore should our neighbours embark on a nuclear power programme. The pre-feasibility study, which he noted was completed in 2012, concluded that the currently available nuclear energy technologies were not yet suitable for deployment in Singapore. However, we are strengthening our capabilities to understand nuclear science and technology to allow us to assess the implications for Singapore of evolving nuclear energy technologies and regional nuclear energy developments.",42,734,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00734
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In April 2014, the Government announced the plan for a $63-million Nuclear Safety Research and Education Programme (NSREP) to support capability development in this space. It comprises the Singapore Nuclear Research and Safety Initiative focusing on research and developing capabilities in nuclear safety science and engineering, and the Nuclear Education and Training Fund to support education and training in these areas. It works on a wide range of areas and I am happy to furnish more information. But so far, four of the research projects have commenced in 2015 and the remaining five are expected to commence in 2016.",43,735,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00735
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"In terms of scholarships, so far nine scholarships have been awarded. Mr Low commented that it is lower than expected. Well, the only comment that I would make is that this is a rather specialised field. It is not so easy to get people in their applications to say, ""Let's take up the scholarship to go and do nuclear studies"". What we have done is outreach to try and attract students to take this up, and we will continue to invest in these efforts significantly. Importantly, it is also about working together with other nuclear technology partners in other established venues like in France and the US and so on, which adds to our knowledge and ability to build up the core of Singapore-based capabilities to understand this space.",44,736,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00736
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Finally, on the responsibility of countries that deploy nuclear energy. They have to be accountable to their population and to the neighbouring regions to ensure that high safety and security standards, based on those set by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and international conventions, such as the Convention on Nuclear Safety, are adhered to. This is both on aspects of operations as well as issues of disposal of nuclear waste which Mr Low mentioned.",45,737,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00737
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,It is important that our region collectively builds and strengthens our emergency preparedness and response (EPR) as nuclear and radiological emergencies have basically no boundaries. We are working with the ASEAN countries through the ASEAN Network of Regulatory Bodies of Atomic Energy (ASEANTOM) and the IAEA to strengthen cooperation in this area and to share radiation monitoring data.,46,738,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00738
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Mr Low has asked if electricity prices can be delinked from oil and linked to natural gas or LNG instead. It is quite ironic, because right now we actually have lower electricity prices because of lower oil prices, so you should be careful what you wish for. Having said that, the crux of the matter is not about picking which is going to be cheaper because at some points, oil prices may be low; at other times, it may be high, and you will see a similar impact on gas prices.",47,739,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00739
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"What we really want to do is to allow options in Singapore where the buyers of gas have the opportunity to create a portfolio which they think best suits their risk appetite and hedges against the movements that they are concerned about. So, SLInG which Mr Low highlighted is one possibility, but it is very new and not quite ready yet for that sort of indexing. But we think that it has potential and we have to see how the market responds.",48,740,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00740

2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Having said that, I want to make two points. First, we need to get the system right before we talk about communication. So that is what the work is on now. The system is not just about the technical aspects but also about the potential suppliers, how they will come in and what kind of packages they offer. Secondly, we also want to make sure that there is a default fall-back option for households, precisely because some of the households may not be able to fully appreciate the decisions or may not want to make those sorts of choices. These are some of the policy aspects that are being worked out. Once we are ready, we will embark on an education programme to socialise our households to the opportunities.",50,742,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00742

Many TA leaders are dedicating their services to their TAs while managing their businesses.

Would their TA be selected? I am wondering, how would the knowledge and experience of the 20 officers be applied to the TAs? According to a report by The Business Times, there are currently more than 350 TAs nationwide. How can other TAs participate in this project after the 20 officers have been assigned?",6,751,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00751
2016-04-07-T-005,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"To effectively promote the collaboration between the Government and TAs, I would like to highlight two dilemmas of TA leaders. Firstly, the sustainability of TAs. TAs are non-profit organisations, and have limited operational funds. With the support of Government, some projects which have shown initial good results would see government officers being over-eager to deliver the KPIs, to the extent of even bypassing the TAs and taking over the projects via setting up new entities.",7,752,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00752
2016-04-07-T-005,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"Secondly, the phenomenon of ""celebrity-chasing"" by government agencies. TAs which have performed well are overwhelmingly sought after and supported by different government agencies with various assistance schemes and incentives. However, those TAs with limited resources but which work hard in search of new directions can only fend for themselves although they need even more assistance. This situation takes place probably because government officers have a preconceived notion – supporting TAs that they deem promising and not wanting to waste time on TAs that they feel would not be able to make it.",8,753,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00753
2016-04-07-T-005,Thomas Chua Kee Seng,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"I need to reiterate that bringing up these two dilemmas does not affect TAs' support and expectations of government policies. As the President of the SCCCI, I am heartened that the Chamber's Trade Association (TA) Hub has received strong support of many government agencies and TA members.

Any schemes that support reduction of their fixed costs will be useful for them to manage their cash flow. Cost of labour and rental are the main components of their fixed costs.

The silver lining for businesses that survive tough situations is that their businesses would have stress-tested a differentiating edge −.one with an agility to adapt and to constantly keep abreast with the market trends. And the crust to this is the culture within the company and the mindset of the business owners. As a step to encourage more innovation and piloting some of these creative ideas, I think we need an open, flexible and trusting environment. To facilitate this, I hope that the Government could strengthen the framework for intellectual property protection, streamline some of the channels for the information search and their applications, as well as to leverage the trade networks that could assist them for future expansion as part of the transformation process.

Deputy Prime Minister Tharman has also said that our workers need to develop deep skills on several occasions, in particular, the finance and logistic sectors. He used the term ""deep mastery"" and he referred to the German model of Mittelstand companies. I cannot agree more.",4,777,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00777

They are very focused on doing something really well, very nimble and customer-centric. But what really differentiates the Mittelstand companies from Singapore SMEs is that they have a very strong system of apprenticeship that helps their workers develop deep skills. It is these deep skills, developed over time and generations, that give Mittelstand and, indeed, German Industry, their competitive edge in the world.",5,778,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00778

2016-04-07-T-005,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),Our SMEs hire two-thirds of the workforce and produce 50% of our GDP. That is not a very encouraging statistic in terms of productivity. And I suspect this is due to the fact that our SMEs do not have a robust apprenticeship system that engenders the development of deep skills. Job-hopping between companies and sectors almost certainly does not lead to deep skills.,7,780,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00780
2016-04-07-T-005,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Deep skills are needed not just for productivity but for innovation as well. Innovation is not about sitting around and having a ""Eureka"" moment. Innovation also requires deep skills and mastery. The beautiful fonts we associate today with Apple computers and iPhones were due to the fact that Steve Jobs attended calligraphy classes in college conducted by a former Trappist Monk called Robert Palladino who had mastery of calligraphy and fonts. Locally, the salted egg yolk croissant which has become very popular lately is also a result of deep skills. If you cannot make a decent croissant, you certainly cannot make a good salted egg version.",8,781,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00781

Companies in these sectors are also faced with constraints from a tight labour market to high business costs. Deputy Prime Minister Tharman also highlighted recently that there has been a divergence in productivity growth between outward-oriented sectors and domestically-focused ones. Even as outward-oriented sectors such as logistics and manufacturing saw productivity growth of 3.2% each year over the last five years, domestically-oriented sectors, such as retail and F&B, productivity has fallen by about 0.6% each year in the last three years.",1,783,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00783

Have we got to the root cause of this issue? How have our productivity initiatives been working in particular for the domestically-oriented sectors? Can MTI share the efforts to capture new measures of productivity that can be monitored for policy purposes? What is MTI's strategy to raise productivity growth, particularly in the most affected sectors; and if we already have one are we on track? The low productivity rates coupled with disproportionately high wages is worrying as this situation is not sustainable. It suggests that either wages will eventually have to fall as we price ourselves out of the market, or productivity has to go up. But the latter would need some concerted effort and focus, and current measures may need more time before we can see its benefits.",2,784,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00784

This is so as to mitigate any risk that the TAC ExCo members will use or will be perceived, rightly or wrongly, to be using any access to Government resources or information for the benefit of their own firms rather than for the whole TAC membership.

Like hon Member Mr Thomas Chua, I urge the Government to consider having a larger number of such officers as there is a large number of TACs. Secondment of public officers will enable the much needed depth of understanding of specific needs of the industries, and will empower them to be in a better position to design tailor-make support schemes and specialised infrastructural developments to spearhead transformation and innovation of the industries.",6,793,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00793

2016-04-07-T-005,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"Over the longer term, access to low rent premises has diminished, following the corporatisation of JTC assets as well as the commercial pricing of HDB rentals.

2016-04-07-T-005,Chen Show Mao,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"We call on the Government to not only keep commercial and industrial rental increases near or below inflation but also keep their absolute amounts manageable as part of the more serious effort to nurture SMEs as the third pillar. This may require actions to, first, take a long-term view on reducing business rentals and have JTC pick up, in part, their former approach of building lower cost industrial and commercial property, before many of their many properties were privatised. Based on indications of strong demand for existing low-cost facilities, like incubators, these will go a long way to stimulate the start-up and SME sector.",5,799,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00799

I am happy to hear that the Government stands ready to act if the economy continues to slow down. Moving forward, should our domestic economy worsen considerably to warrant an off-Budget measure, and should our market rentals not adjust accordingly, would the Government consider taking the lead in reducing business cost by lowering JTC and HDB industry and commercial property rental rates?

Some of these clauses are unfair or unreasonable. For example, one vendor made it compulsory for disputes to be referred to arbitration knowing well that most disputes involve smaller sums and consumers cannot afford the high costs of arbitration. It also means the ouster of the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal. Another case involves a vendor who introduced pre-ticked boxes for consumers, making them sign up as a member paying monthly fees without the consumer realising it.",2,804,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00804

Allow online consumers to be given a right to return goods within seven days and get a full refund. Ban the practice of having pre-ticked boxes whereby consumers are misled to agreeing to certain terms unless they know how to untick the boxes.

This has contributed to an increase in unit labour cost of 1.5% per annum over the same period. Therefore, we need to press on with increasing our productivity to keep pace with wage increases.",12,825,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00825

In the next two years, an average of 2.3 million square metres of industrial space will come on-stream annually. Similarly, for office and retail space, rents have fallen by 6.5% and 4.1% respectively in 2015, while a large supply of 993,000 square metres of office space and 808,000 square metres of retail space remains in the pipeline in the near future.",14,827,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00827

For example, since 2009, our finance and insurance sector achieved productivity growth of 4.7% per annum. Overall, labour productivity of the outward-oriented sectors grew by 5.1% per annum from 2009 to 2015. On the other hand, our domestic sectors, such as retail and food services, where the bulk of the companies are still heavily reliant on manpower, are not doing as well. From 2009 to 2015, the labour productivity growth of these domestically-oriented sectors remained rather weak, at 0.8% per annum. Therefore, we need to press on with productivity drives in these weaker sectors.",18,831,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00831

In this regard, TACs can play a critical role in leading the transformation of their respective sectors, by organising the industry players and set the direction for growth and transformation of the sector. The Government has to work hand in hand with our businesses. There is a saying that ""the business arena is like the battlefield""; businesses should work closely with one another to achieve greater results.

Ms Sun Xueling had asked about how SMEs can be alerted to business trends and opportunities. One effective way is through the TACs. Mr Leon Perera may also wish to note that Government support for TACs is carefully scoped out and meant to create as wide an impact as possible. Since 2005, SPRING and IE Singapore have worked with 35 TACs on various sector upgrading projects under the Local Enterprise and Association Development (LEAD) Programme.

2016-04-07-T-005,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Take the example of Ms Lilian Yeo, a 58-year-old Sales Supervisor for Decks. Decks is the retailer for Surfers Paradise and Island Shop products. Decks has adopted RFID for both its front- and back-of-house operations. Lilian's can-do spirit helped her adapt and learn this new technology. She is now adept at using RFID, and she appreciates how technology has eased her job and given her more time to focus on frontline duties like serving and interacting with the customers. So, like Ms Lilian Yeo, we need to be flexible and stand ready to be trained to develop industry-relevant skills.",1,880,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00880
2016-04-07-T-005,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"To stay ahead of the curve, we must continue to train and produce workers with skills that meet the demands of the industries. We can open the doors to a better future by embracing the spirit of lifelong learning. Please allow me to give the House a quick update on the various SkillsFuture initiatives that support Singaporeans on this constant journey, starting with our youths, then the working adults, and then the businesses.",2,881,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00881
2016-04-07-T-005,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"We fully agree with Mr Sitoh Yih Pin that one of the ways to engender the development of deep skills is through apprenticeships, particularly for our SMEs. To this end, MTI supports the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme (ELP). The ELP is a work-study programme matching our fresh graduates from Polytechnics and ITEs to suitable companies, including SMEs, in sectors related to their disciplines of study. This not only helps companies attract talent, it also allows participants to develop deep industry-relevant skillsets during their apprenticeships.",3,882,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00882
2016-04-07-T-005,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Besides apprenticeships for our youths, we must also nurture in them a curiosity and a desire for global exposure. This can certainly support our companies' internationalisation drive as we grow the pool of talents in our workforce ready with the necessary skillsets to support our external economy. The ability to work in international teams and harness cross-cultural capabilities are some of the skills that are offered in the Young Talent Programme (YTP) by IE Singapore.",4,883,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00883
2016-04-07-T-005,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"To prepare them for global careers, the YTP offers our students opportunities for overseas immersion through internships and work-study programmes. In November last year, IE officially extended the YTP-Market Immersion Programme to the Polytechnics. Since then, about 200 Polytechnic students have gone to China, Germany, US and the ASEAN countries. I am pleased to report that we will implement the Programme in the ITEs later this year as well. This will provide more opportunities for our students to gain international exposure.",5,884,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00884
2016-04-07-T-005,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Our young people will learn how to navigate across cultures and differences. This picture shows Mr Raiyan Muhammad bin Musa from Ngee Ann Polytechnic with some of the friends that he met during his internship at The Ascott Limited in Vietnam. Besides these friends, Raiyan shared with us that he had colleagues from France, UK, India and Malaysia. During the internship, Raiyan learnt how to connect across cultures and nationalities in the workplace. Such experiences during the formative years will give our young people a potential head-start into a global career.",6,885,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00885
2016-04-07-T-005,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"In addition to building young talent for global jobs, we are also grooming promising Singaporeans to take on leadership positions through the SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative (LDI). It aims to grow a pipeline of Singaporean leaders across all career levels. As part of the LDI, EDB has been partnering companies to design and implement leadership development roadmaps tailored to their business objectives and HR priorities. For example, MasterCard's Management Associate Programme has an overseas stint in emerging markets that provides fresh graduates with global exposure and in-market experience across key business units. Upon completion of the programme, the Management Associates will be better positioned to take on larger roles in the company.",7,886,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00886
2016-04-07-T-005,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"We all know talent is key for businesses, big or small, to grow and succeed. For SMEs that may not have the resources to build up their talent development and worker competencies, we have created the SkillsFuture Mentors Programme under SPRING Singapore. The agency works with industry partners to build a pool of mentors who support the development of SMEs' capabilities and help them participate in SkillsFuture initiatives. Since its launch in December last year, 70 mentors have been qualified and 15 SMEs have been matched in sectors, such as Retail and Engineering. Over the next three years, we aim to build up a pool of 400 mentors to support 2,000 SMEs across different sectors. Moving forward, the Government will continue to invest in SkillsFuture to ensure that our workers and companies are well positioned to meet the challenges of the future.

2016-04-07-T-005,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Upskilling is key to the vitality of our economy. It is not only a means to future-proof our workers, but also a key facet of industry transformation. As the Minister for Finance and Minister for Industry have explained, the Industry Transformation Programme will integrate our restructuring efforts in productivity, innovation and manpower development at the sector level to maximise impact.",9,888,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00888

Last year, SMPs were launched in sectors such as Hotel and Retail, setting out 5-year manpower strategies that support the growth of these sectors.",10,889,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00889
2016-04-07-T-005,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"The SMPs are developed and implemented together with Sectoral Tripartite Committees (STCs), consisting of unions, TACs and companies. The strategies under the Hotel SMP, for example, are being implemented on the ground in partnership with STB, WDA, hotels, National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), Food, Drinks and Allied Workers Union (FDAWU), and the Singapore Hotel Association (SHA).",11,890,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00890

2016-04-07-T-005,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Take for example Tee Hai Chem, a local company that sponsors high-performing employees on part-time Diploma studies. Tee Hai told us that they believe that people are their most important asset and that all their staff are given equal opportunities to upgrade their skills and knowledge. Mr Kelvin Ong joined the company in 2010. He started out not knowing much about logistics. But Tee Hai recognised his good performance and potential, and sponsored him to study a part-time Diploma in Logistics Management. I am heartened to learn that, after starting out as a storekeeper, Kelvin is now a Logistics Supervisor at the company. Indeed, Kelvin's success is not just his own, but also the company's.",15,894,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00894
2016-04-07-T-005,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Here, MTI would like to encourage our companies to be long-sighted as well as courageous to innovate and to transform, so that they will be well-placed to compete on the international stage. Besides using technology to improve efficiency, companies must be willing to redesign jobs, train their staff and help them upskill. In time to come, with increased productivity, their revenues will also increase.",16,895,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00895

2016-04-07-T-005,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,Companies that invest in their employees' training and development will be well-positioned to take on the new challenges of our new economy. We would like to see more companies like Tee Hai Chem who invest in their employees for the future. Allow me to conclude in English.,18,897,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00897
2016-04-07-T-005,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"(In English)  We understand skills upgrading takes effort and may not be easy for all, especially for mature workers. But successful upskilling is possible at any age when one is armed with a positive and can-do attitude. Take Mr Mohammad Romzi Bin Kassim, for instance. The 46-year-old employee at PestBusters has upgraded his knowledge and skills by attending several technical and WSQ training courses. In just six years, Romzi has been promoted three times from a Pest Control Technician to being an Executive. And he does not intend to stop learning. He is keen to hone his craft with technology and has been selected to learn best practices in pest control work in Melbourne under MediaCorp's sponsorship. Rozmi's proactive approach towards learning certainly exemplifies SkillsFuture's spirit of passion for lifelong learning.",19,898,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00898
2016-04-07-T-005,Low Thia Khiang,Mr Low Thia Khiang,"Mr Chairperson, the Government remains committed to supporting the development of our workforce. But we cannot do this alone. Lilian, Raiyan, Kelvin, Romzi have shown us that all of us can take ownership of our own training and career paths. We call upon our partners and every Singaporean to come on board the SkillsFuture movement. Together, we will build a future-ready workforce empowered to overcome challenges and stay on track for success in the global economy.",20,899,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00899

2016-04-07-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"Well, I applaud the Government's move to establish the cluster champions consisting of teams of officers from the Public Sector, rolling up their sleeves and fast track the transformation of about 20 sectors. That is a tremendous effort, account for about 80% of our economy. But also, it requires the officers to adopt a new approach of working beyond just within the service. As Government, you work in a Government agency, but now to work with the markets, you work with the businesses.",1,901,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00901
2016-04-07-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"So in terms of resourcing and organising, I would like to ask the Minister how does the Ministry at this stage set up the headcount that is needed, the changes in terms of the different agencies to be able to drive this sector roadmap that was introduced by the Finance Minister?",2,902,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00902
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"Sir, I thank the Member for his clarification. As I stated and as we all acknowledged, it is a major task and it will require a coordinated effort across various stakeholders – companies, TACs, Centres of Innovation, and also in terms of the unions. We will be appointing cluster champions from our various statutory boards for some of these key sectors.",1,903,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00903
2016-04-07-T-005,S Iswaran,Mr S Iswaran,"What we propose to do is, in the time-honoured tradition of financial prudence, we will start by working within what we already have. But, of course, where necessary and it may well be necessary, we will then seek assistance from the Ministry of Finance.",2,904,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00904
2016-04-07-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"Thank you, Mr Chairman. In my Budget wrap up speech, the Minister of Finance referred to the HIPS system that is run by the Singapore Business Federation (SBF), which provides a calculator of productivity and allows companies to log on the system, input some data, calculate the productivity level and benchmarks the productivity level against certain industry norms.",1,905,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00905
2016-04-07-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"If I recall correctly, the Minister for Finance said that there are roughly 80 companies currently using this HIPS system from SBF. He said this in response to my suggestion for a national productivity benchmarking system. So, I would like to ask MTI will they be working with SBF, perhaps to take this tool and push it out to all of the companies that we have. I believe that we have 180,000 businesses and companies. SBF's target is to get 30,000 of them onto the HIPS by 2020. So, that still leaves many, many more companies that have not been using the system.",2,906,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00906
2016-04-07-T-005,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"If the SBF actually achieves that target, will the Government actually work with the SBF to push out this tool, as a benchmarking tool, not just against industry norms and Singapore, but also industry norms globally, so that our SMEs can have a very clear quantifiable view what they can achieve, what they can aspire to achieve in terms of productivity.",3,907,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00907
2016-04-07-T-005,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Mr Chairman, I thank the Member for his question.

As far as productivity benchmarking is concerned, there are various benchmarks that can be utilised.",1,908,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00908
2016-04-07-T-005,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"The Government publishes labour productivity benchmarks such as value-added per worker and value-added per actual hour worked. The Government also publishes sector-specific outcome indicators such as site productivity for the construction sector. Other than the benchmark that the Member has mentioned, companies can also use the calculator on the ""Way to Go"" website to determine their productivity and compare it against other benchmarks.",2,909,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00909

2016-04-07-T-005,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har,"With the great initiative to second public officers to TACs to help them deepen their knowledge and to support the TACs, I would like to ask the Minister would the decision making and the empowerment for these officers be enhanced, so that they can truly do something meaningful, for example, to tailor make schemes for these sectors? Also, if they are empowered, what is the decision making so that they can get things through quite quickly, so that the TACs who have got a good plan, can get on with it?",1,911,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00911
2016-04-07-T-005,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"The key in seconding public officers to the TACs is to strengthen their secretariat because we recognise the key to a successful implementation requires the secretariat to be reinforced. We have to work very carefully because as we all know the TACs differ very significantly. Many of the TACs have adequately-resourced secretariats already. What we need to do is to work with them to strategise and to work out the sectoral plan. Some TACs require reinforcement. This is the area where the secondment of the 20 public officers will make some impact. Then we will have to see how it goes. Based on the experience of working with these TACs, we will have to then amend and adopt our plans accordingly.",1,912,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00912

2016-04-07-T-005,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,"The Minister did talk about the benefits of TPP. Clearly, quite list of things that our businesses can benefit from. We know that the TPP is now political football, as we observe the US elections. I would like to ask the Minister whether he still sees hope that we can get this ratified in the US administration and Congress, and whether we should now bank on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) instead, given that we are likely to have an agreement this year, and hopefully the smooth ratification as well. Given that we also have a US-Singapore FTA, with that FTA plus RCEP, without the TPP, does it impact us that much? I wish to hear the Minister's views on this.",1,914,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00914
2016-04-07-T-005,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"We have all been following the progress of the TPP in the various countries – all 12 of us.

2016-04-07-T-005,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"For the US, they have been telling us that they are very deeply engaged with the Congress leadership. They have very good experience taking the Trade Promotion Authority, the fast-track authority through Congress. They know roughly where the votes lie – both in the House as well as the Senate. They are having very close links with the Congressional leaders at the different groups to see whether this vote pool is still valid for the next step of ratification. So, we are watching the developments.",2,916,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00916
2016-04-07-T-005,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"As I had mentioned in my speech just now, although we have the bilateral US-Singapore FTA, the TPP adds on to this, because, for one, the TPP gives us a free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, which we do not have bilateral FTAs with thus far. But more importantly, the TPP gives us better market access because of regional cumulation. I gave the examples of automotive components and textiles and garments. Singapore companies can now source from TPP countries and this is then added on to qualify for the rules of origin to enter preferentially into the TPP markets.",3,917,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00917
2016-04-07-T-005,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"So, even though we may have the US-Singapore FTA, the TPP adds a new dimension and more market access.

2016-04-07-T-005,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"On the RCEP, it is a very different set of dynamics, because we have the ASEAN countries and the six ASEAN+1 dialogue partners. As we know, with the dialogue partners – Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, Korea and India – the dynamics are very complicated. For example, to get the RCEP resolved, you have to solve the bilateral dynamics between India and China, just to illustrate. So, it is not a simple task where we can get to a successful conclusion of RCEP by the end of the year. We still need many, many more steps to get there.",5,919,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00919
2016-04-07-T-005,Lim Hng Kiang,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"As to the dynamics between TPP and RCEP, it is quite obvious that when TPP was concluded, there was greater pressure on RCEP participants to get RCEP also concluded. If we do not ratify the TPP, then I am very concerned that the pressure on RCEP may be lifted. RCEP participants may not feel the same pressure to get it concluded. This is already in addition to the very complicated political dynamics within the 10+6 participants of RCEP.",6,920,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00920

Last year we just concluded an upgrade of the ASEAN-China FTA. Over and above this, we have the RCEP. The reason why I consider the RCEP very important is, as I had explained in my speech just now, in North America, you have NAFTA, and that makes it very difficult for us to break in NAFTA, because the supply chain of US, Canada and Mexico is very closely integrated.",2,923,2016-04-07-T-005-S-00923

So, it is very important for us to have RCEP, so that we are part of the 10+6, so that we are also part of a bigger market and a bigger ecosystem. As I had emphasised in my speech just now, our trade policy must be inclusionary.
