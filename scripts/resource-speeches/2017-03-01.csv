2017-03-01-T-002,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked	 the Minister for Defence (a) whether the Ministry has determined (i) how the used SAF uniforms came into the possession of the smugglers who were caught unloading them near Batam in November 2016 and (ii) the motive for smuggling the uniforms to Batam; and (b) how does the Ministry intend to prevent such incidents from happening again.,1,5,2017-03-01-T-002-S-00005
2017-03-01-T-002,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman) (for the Minister for Defence),"Mdm Speaker, the SAF has an established system for disposing of its used and unwanted equipment. SAF servicemen who need to dispose of their used uniforms can do so via collection points at all SAF eMarts. Our contractors for uniform disposal collect the used uniforms and send them to the incinerators. The used uniforms are then incinerated under witness by an SAF personnel.",1,6,2017-03-01-T-002-S-00006
2017-03-01-T-002,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman) (for the Minister for Defence),"Following the incident, the SAF has reminded our contractors to ensure that all uniform disposals are done in accordance with established procedures. The SAF will also be putting up more disposal bins at SAF eMarts and will establish used uniform collection points at entrances of selected camps near populated areas in the next two to three months to reinforce the system. NSmen will be reminded to dispose of their old uniforms only via authorised collection points. These measures will reduce opportunities for unauthorised vendors to obtain and then sell used SAF uniforms.",2,7,2017-03-01-T-002-S-00007
2017-03-01-T-002,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Senior Minister of State for his answer. Could I please ask him to answer part (a) of my question? I also have a few supplementary questions. Does SAF carry out any regular audits or spot checks to ensure that proper disposal is always carried out by the contractors? What actions will be taken to improve the current disposal process? What actions will be taken against the persons found responsible for causing or contributing to the uniforms being sold or smuggled into Indonesia?",1,8,2017-03-01-T-002-S-00008
2017-03-01-T-002,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Mdm Speaker, the handling and disposal of used SAF uniforms, we suspect, is due to actions of unauthorised parties. Our investigations have found that our authorised contractors have disposed uniforms in accordance with established procedures. As mentioned earlier, the collection points are all available at all SAF eMarts. To enhance the convenience of our servicemen, the SAF will be putting the disposal bins with a one-way non-return valve at the entrance of selected camps near populated areas.",1,9,2017-03-01-T-002-S-00009
2017-03-01-T-002,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"So, the point is, we will continue to engage and remind our servicemen and NSmen on where they should dispose of their used uniforms. We take this matter very seriously. We will ensure that should there be any individuals who have been found to have violated some of these regulations or procedures, they will be taken to task.",2,10,2017-03-01-T-002-S-00010
2017-03-01-T-002,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"I thank the Senior Minister of State. Could I ask again what actions will be taken against the persons found responsible for causing or contributing to the uniforms being sold or smuggled into Indonesia? And another supplementary question, given the answers that the Senior Minister of State has given, is or will Singapore be working with the Indonesian authorities to identify the persons who have been arrested or detained in Indonesia in connection with the investigation for the smuggling of these uniforms?",1,11,2017-03-01-T-002-S-00011
2017-03-01-T-002,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"It was reported by the media, that the Indonesian Navy is investigating. We are waiting for the outcome of their investigation, and should there be any need for us to work together with them, we will certainly work with them. I think it is premature to even discuss what actions we will take. We will look at the situation as it emerges.",1,12,2017-03-01-T-002-S-00012

2017-03-01-T-002,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Could the Senior Minister of State please share with the House what would be the likely or expected timeline for the investigation to complete such that MINDEF would be able to consider whether actions will be taken against the persons responsible?",1,14,2017-03-01-T-002-S-00014
2017-03-01-T-002,Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Madam, as mentioned, it was reported by the media that the Indonesian Navy is the one that is conducting the investigation. I think it is not in my position to set any timeline, because ideally, it is up to the Indonesian authorities, and we will leave it to them. When they complete the investigation and they share the information with us, then we will take the action, accordingly.",1,15,2017-03-01-T-002-S-00015
2017-03-01-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked	 the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Ministry will implement a ban on the domestic trade in ivory; (b) if so, what is the time frame for implementing the ban; and (c) if not, what factors does the Ministry take into account in not banning the domestic trade.",1,16,2017-03-01-T-003-S-00016
2017-03-01-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for National Development),"Mdm Speaker, the Government is looking into implementing a domestic ban on the sale of ivory. This is part of Singapore's broader commitment to tackle the illegal ivory trade and to support elephant conservation. The implementation details, including an engagement process with relevant stakeholders, are currently being worked out.",1,17,2017-03-01-T-003-S-00017
2017-03-01-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Can I check if there is a time frame for implementing this ban? Secondly, if we do implement the ban, can I check with the Minister of State what will they do with the ivory that is currently on sale in our shops? Would we be requiring the shop owners to surrender them or will we allow them to keep it? My fear of allowing them to keep it is that it may enter into the black market.",1,18,2017-03-01-T-003-S-00018
2017-03-01-T-003,Koh Poh Koon,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Madam, we will announce the time frame when we have sufficient time to engage with the local stakeholders, and we will notify the public accordingly. In terms of local ivory trade, the commercial import and export of ivory has been prohibited since 1990. Non-commercial import and export of ivory, for example, for museum display and for research, is still permitted with AVA's approval and documentation. Within Singapore, buying and selling of ivory is permitted until such a ban is in place.",1,19,2017-03-01-T-003-S-00019
2017-03-01-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"asked	 the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry will consider conducting a study to quantify the savings in healthcare costs that can be obtained from various possible levels of incremental improvements in air quality in the short, mid and long term.",1,20,2017-03-01-T-004-S-00020
2017-03-01-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"There have been several studies estimating costs associated with air pollution. The World Bank and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation published a study in 2016 which estimated the economic costs attributable to air pollution across various countries. Locally, a study was published in 2013 by Prof Euston Quah and Assoc Prof Chia Wai-Mun to estimate the economic cost of particulate air pollution (PM10) on public health in Singapore.",1,21,2017-03-01-T-004-S-00021
2017-03-01-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"While the exact figures may differ as they depend on the assumptions and methodologies in each study, it is clear that air pollution has direct impact on public health. To address this public health concern, my Ministry included in the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint 2015 a set of Air Quality Targets which we aim to achieve by 2020. These standards are based on the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Air Quality Guidelines.",2,22,2017-03-01-T-004-S-00022
2017-03-01-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"To date, we have already initiated several measures to reduce the emission of pollutants. We have recently tightened the emission standards for industries. We have also introduced measures to manage the emissions from vehicles. These include stricter standards for fuel quality and emissions standards for new vehicles, as well as incentive schemes to encourage the purchase of new and cleaner vehicle models. We will continue to review these measures as we work towards our 2020 Air Quality Targets.",3,23,2017-03-01-T-004-S-00023
2017-03-01-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the answer. Going forward, when the Government presents measures in the Budget or through other platforms in relation to air quality, will the Government also consider providing an estimate of the positive impact on healthcare costs, on MediShield Life and other components of healthcare costs, so that a better assessment can be made about the investments that we are putting into air quality and the likely savings that may result in healthcare costs on the other side of the equation?",1,24,2017-03-01-T-004-S-00024
2017-03-01-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"I thank the Member for his supplementary question. As I have noted, we have many local and international studies that seek to establish the impact of air pollution on health as well as healthcare costs. Depending on the methodologies and the assumptions used, the figures may vary. What we have done to inform policy review and formulation is to gather these various studies and have a holistic picture of the economic costs to health and healthcare, and then determine our policies.",1,25,2017-03-01-T-004-S-00025
2017-03-01-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"As I have said, we have set air quality targets based on WHO Air Quality guidelines in our SSB 2015. The WHO has established a set of air quality guidelines where health risk is largely reduced. Because every reduction obviously matters. WHO also acknowledges that when we set guidelines, we have to take into account local constraints such as mitigation costs, for instance, accessibility, affordability and availability of the technologies.",2,26,2017-03-01-T-004-S-00026
2017-03-01-T-004,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Hence when we regularly review our policies as well as develop new policies in order to reduce air pollution and improve air quality, we take these into account as part of the CBA analysis. But as I said, the figures can vary significantly and we have to look at it holistically.",3,27,2017-03-01-T-004-S-00027
2017-03-01-T-005,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan,asked	 the Prime Minister (a) whether the current purchase limits of Singapore Savings Bonds can be raised; and (b) whether Singaporeans can be allowed to use monies in their Supplementary Retirement Scheme Account to purchase the Singapore Savings Bond.,1,28,2017-03-01-T-005-S-00028
2017-03-01-T-005,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung) (for the Prime Minister),"More than 40,000 individuals now hold over $1.1 billion of Singapore Savings Bonds in aggregate. The Savings Bond is a good alternative to cash held in savings and fixed deposit accounts. Our efforts have therefore focused on making it convenient for individuals to apply for Savings Bonds through ATMs and internet banking channels.",1,29,2017-03-01-T-005-S-00029
2017-03-01-T-005,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung) (for the Prime Minister),"Mr Tay has asked if SRS monies can be used to purchase Savings Bonds. This is an idea we are open to and have been studying. There is of course a cost involved in making this channel available and we have to assess whether it can benefit a sufficiently broad segment of people. As of now, the additional benefits are not clear since SRS monies can already be invested in Singapore Government Securities (SGS), which offer the same returns as Savings Bonds if held to maturity.",2,30,2017-03-01-T-005-S-00030
2017-03-01-T-005,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung) (for the Prime Minister),"Mr Tay has also suggested raising the individual limits on purchasing Savings Bonds. Currently, the maximum investment amount for each Savings Bond issue, or ""Issue Limit"", is $50,000 and the maximum individual holding, or ""Overall Limit"", is $100,000. These limits ensures that Savings Bonds can be available to more individuals.",3,31,2017-03-01-T-005-S-00031
2017-03-01-T-005,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung) (for the Prime Minister),"The current limits are not cast in stone. However, so far, only a small minority of Savings Bond investors have reached the boundaries of these limits. Only one in five applicants, on average, requests for the maximum of $50,000 of a given issue. Less than 7% investors are near or have reached the $100,000 overall limit. We will monitor the take-up for some time before considering whether raising the limits would benefit a broad proportion of savers.",4,32,2017-03-01-T-005-S-00032

2017-03-01-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Minister for his answer. Just one supplementary question; maybe this is just a confirmation. The process that Factually follows to decide which issues to talk about, is that process fundamentally about collecting feedback from various Ministries, Government agencies and Statutory Boards? Or has Factually in the past and will it in the future, be open to feedback from other non-governmental organisations to address on the website?",1,37,2017-03-01-T-006-S-00037
2017-03-01-T-006,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Madam, the Member is correct that we do source the information and the claims from various sources within the Government and also from outside the Government. In fact, periodically, we do public engagement exercises and sessions and, during these sessions, some concerns may be raised by members of the public and we will look into them. If we think there is enough of interest in that subject matter that has purveyed some misperceptions, we will clarify.",1,38,2017-03-01-T-006-S-00038

2017-03-01-T-007,Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development),"Madam, the Government recognises that single parents, especially those who are from low- or middle income families, face additional challenges in caring for their children and elderly parents. Apart from shouldering the cost of caring for their family members alone, they also have to balance work and family commitments. Such challenges are faced by single fathers and mothers alike.

Whether the criteria are based on household income or per capita income, there will always be a few deserving cases that do not meet the cut-off. That is why HDB already exercises flexibility so that families who do not meet the eligibility criteria can still get a rental flat, if they have no other housing options or family support. This includes bigger families even if their household income exceeds the income ceiling.",1,51,2017-03-01-T-008-S-00051

2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Mdm Speaker, like many of my colleagues in this House, I sought and received feedback and comments from residents and many others about the Budget. There are concerns about rising costs of living and great discomfort with the uncertain times ahead and the changes that Singaporeans are expecting to go through.",1,60,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00060
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),I think it is clear to Singaporeans that it is not business as usual. People are more aware of the deep shifts in the world with the advances in technology and the disruptions to traditional businesses and jobs.,2,61,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00061
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"The shopkeepers in my estate know that business is dwindling partly because people now buy online. Most of them are old and their children are generally not interested in taking over the business. They are not sure whether to continue to invest in the business, especially as they are uncertain as to how long more they can sustain the lease. Some shopkeepers are concerned about future income.",3,62,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00062
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"A resident I met recently sought help to re-enter a course he signed up for to upgrade himself. He failed to meet the grades required of the school and was terminated a few months into the course. He knows he has to work hard to keep up, but picking up a new skill and studying while still working is challenging.",4,63,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00063
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I also know of a young couple with seven young children. The husband is the sole- breadwinner. He is keen to find a better paying job and his wife is also keen to work to supplement the family's income. However, they are saddled with bills and debts and have no alternative options for childcare. They are, therefore, struggling to survive and have difficulties making the time to upskill so that they can participate actively in the future economy.",5,64,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00064
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"These are some real day-to-day concerns and struggles faced by our fellow Singaporeans. I do not intend to paint a gloomy picture. In the cases I mentioned, some guidance and support are being given to the individuals and families. I also know of a lot of people who have overcome difficulties and I believe that people do need to take personal responsibility to improve their circumstances. But the point I would like to make is that we will always have to keep in mind the day-to-day issues people face and ensure that the translation of our policies can alleviate these concerns.",6,65,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00065
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Budget 2017 sets out a broad roadmap for the way forward as a nation. It has been described by some as a Budget for the Uncertain Future. In his speech, the Minister for Finance, Mr Heng Swee Keat, said that Budget 2017 outlines how we can thrive in an uncertain and rapidly changing world. It is a call for all of us to pull together − the Government, firms, unions, community organisations and individuals ‒ with everyone doing his part. He added that our bonds will help us develop greater resilience in the face of unexpected shifts and improve our ability to adapt.",7,66,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00066
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"There are gems within the Budget with regards to the plans to re-energise the economy. I have faith that the efforts in industry transformation, internationalisation, improving capabilities of businesses and workers will go a long way in building a stronger economy. However, the Budget is not just about the economy and fiscal needs but should also be a roadmap on society's values and support network.",8,67,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00067
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),I am happy to note that the Budget had also covered plans on building a caring and inclusive society. I feel that it is important that we give a little more attention to this aspect and consider the development of our social policies in light of the changing trends in the world.,9,68,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00068
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"In this regard, there are three main areas I wish to address.",10,69,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00069
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"One, how do we help the vulnerable and disadvantaged in our community survive in the competitive economy?",11,70,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00070
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Two, how do we rally people to care about one another and the environment while they face their own challenges?",12,71,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00071
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Three, how can we harness existing resources within the community, in particular, amongst the young, to work together to build Singapore's future?",13,72,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00072
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"My first point relates to those who may be vulnerable or disadvantaged in our community. It is important for us to ensure that they do not get left behind in our race to develop our economy. This may sound cliche, but it is real.",14,73,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00073
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),Who will be disadvantaged? I am referring to the elderly who have to struggle with the technological and digital developments; the children from low-income families whose parents may not have the time and money to send them to enrichment classes; persons with disabilities which may inhibit them from participating actively in the competitive job market; care-givers of elderly who have to stay home to care for their loved ones. There is a whole spectrum of people with varying needs. The Government needs to ensure that it does not lose sight of them in crafting policies and programmes.,15,74,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00074
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"The reality though is that it is unrealistic to expect the Government to extend help to every single individual. A more feasible way is to encourage the growth of a community network of support − with organised VWOs as well as organic groups. These groups or people can help fill in the gaps by looking out for those who need support and provide the help when needed. I, therefore, support the plans in strengthening community bonds by enhancing the funding and development of capabilities to VWOs, charities and self-help groups. I think it is important to extend the support and funding to organic groups as well. Last year, there was mention of Our Singapore Fund. I would like to hear about the usage of this fund and whether there are plans to develop it further.",16,75,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00075
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"This leads me to my second point, about rallying people to help each other. It is very easy for people to forget about others when they are caught up with their own issues and difficulties. I think most times though, people can support one another and there are always avenues to pay it forward. There should be efforts to create and promote a culture of giving back to the community through education and conversations with people in the community.",17,76,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00076
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),I laud efforts like SGCares and hope it gains stronger momentum amongst Singaporeans.,18,77,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00077
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"On the ground, we can continue to develop platforms for people to give a little time and support to others. For example, at Bukit Batok East, we have Project Giveaway Gateway initiated by the Youth Executive Committee. It is basically a platform for residents to make Requests and Offers and the Community Club will assist to match the needs and offers of support. At the end of last year, the team organised a Back-to-School edition and many residents came forward to purchase vouchers for school shoes which are then donated to children from needy families.",19,78,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00078
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"People should also be encouraged to continue taking care of the environment. In keeping with the theme of a Budget for the future, I am happy to see the initiatives which pave the way towards a greener Singapore. I trust there will be further efforts introduced to continue encouraging environmental consciousness. At this juncture, I declare that I am a board member of the Singapore Environmental Council. I am of the view that any future efforts need to be realistic and sustainable. The programmes need to connect with the people on the ground.",20,79,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00079
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),Two issues that have been raised in the past few years can be revived or rolled out in a more sustainable manner  (i) dealing with food wastage and (ii) the over-use of plastic bags. I would like to hear more about the Government's plans in these areas and any future efforts to sustain environmental awareness in Singapore.,21,80,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00080
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"My third point relates to harnessing our existing resources in the community. In the past one and a half years as a Member of Parliament, I have been approached by several young people, some of them living in my estate and who are looking to do projects to help the community. This is heartening and such enthusiasm should be nurtured and encouraged. I note there are many existing programmes for youth and platforms for them to express their views and obtain grants to carry out community projects. At the local level, I think more can be done. I think grassroots organisations, VWOs and charities can work together with youth within the neighbourhood to create solutions that can benefit the local community. Mdm Speaker, allow me to say a few words in Malay.",22,81,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00081
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Over the past year, I had the chance to chat with and engage many people, including students, grassroots leaders, professionals, volunteers and housewives from the Malay-Muslim community. Initially, I was worried because I observed a lack of concern or sense of urgency about the ever-changing economic situation, and the need to up-skill to tackle the new economy.",23,82,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00082
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"However, recently I have seen a change in the mindsets and attitudes of our community. Many of them frequently asked about opportunities to upgrade themselves and many have taken the step to acquire new skills.",24,83,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00083
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"This awareness should be increased and guidelines to understand and use the available resources should be made clear. In this regard, I feel that the Malay-Muslim bodies can play an important role in providing the assistance and platform for our community to prepare themselves in acquiring the knowledge and skills to face the new economy.",25,84,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00084
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"There are indeed efforts being done. For instance, the establishment of the Future Ready Unit at Mendaki and the SkillsFuture Service Touchpoint at Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP). These efforts must be continued and expanded. My view is that every Malay-Muslim body needs to be aware of our nation's development and direction at the national level. Programme planning and framework structuring must be in line with the direction that our country is heading to, so that we can help our community progress and be able to compete together with the other communities in this large family that we call Singapore.",26,85,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00085
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Another issue that I think is important for us to think about is the social changes sweeping across the world today. There are events happening in other countries that may have an impact on the lives of Singaporeans. For instance, and in particular, the spread of Islamophobia. Singapore is unlike other countries because our society is different. As a society, we treasure the harmony between different races and religions. Nonetheless, we cannot take this sense of comfort for granted. Constant effort is required to foster inter-racial relations. We must always maintain a good relationship with our neighbours and colleagues so that we can rely on the strong bond that we built when we are faced with challenges.",27,86,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00086
2017-03-01-T-009,Rahayu Mahzam,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"(In English)  I note that Minister Heng had said that we will take a learning and adaptive approach, try new methods, continue with them when they work well, cut losses when they do not and draw on feedback and experience to adjust and refine our plans. I believe this would also refer to our social policies as well. This is a practical approach and I think it is important in ensuring that we keep pace with the uncertain and changing world. I stand in support of this Bill.",28,87,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00087
2017-03-01-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mdm Speaker, I rise to thank the Minister for Finance for delivering a good Budget that can spur long-term growth in our economy during this challenging time. I am grateful to be given the opportunity to serve on the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE), whose recommendations are broadly reflected in this year's Budget.",1,88,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00088
2017-03-01-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"This era is marked by rapid changes in technology, which is exciting because this presents many new possibilities for productivity. Indeed, this bright spot is unfortunately slightly clouded by the growing push from globalisation. It was the emblem of the US Presidential Elections. We may see more of it when other European countries go to the poll later this year. Concerns were raised of their impact on an already dull economic forecast. For Singapore, the policies of the Trump Administration may contribute to a slowdown in foreign direct investments from the US. Thus, it is good that we look at other areas for growth. The CFE has rightly shifted its focus from just productivity to healthy sustainable growth by looking at new opportunities.",2,89,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00089
2017-03-01-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The CFE identified seven strategies to achieve growth. Charting our route ahead will enable us to steer our ship clear of the reefs. It is imperative that we develop and implement the Industry Transformation Maps (ITM) for important industries in Singapore. I am pleased to note that 23 industries, and about 80% of the economy, are set to benefit from these maps. I would now like to discuss three areas where we can add to these maps, particularly from a social point of view.",3,90,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00090
2017-03-01-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"First, inclusive and sustainable growth. Equality is key to promoting inclusive and sustainable growth. The political lessons from the US and UK elections point to a failure to reconcile the vast differences between the voters. Now, globally, policymakers will be hampered by widening chasms, how to meet the needs and aspirations of the middle class and the rise of populism. It is vital that we recognise and prioritise the need to reduce gaps in living standards.",4,91,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00091
2017-03-01-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In order to sustain public confidence in the various Government schemes, like the SkillsFuture Credit, that promote up-scaling skills and continuing education, as well as various technological advancements, we must assure everyday Singaporeans that the Government is working to support the aspirations of all Singaporeans to have higher living standards and no erosion in social mobility.",5,92,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00092
2017-03-01-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The World Economic Forum (WEF) commends Singapore for faring well in many areas. But we ranked low in gender equality in the workforce. We are still struggling to improve female participation in the labour force and narrowing the gender pay gap. Measures were introduced to encourage men to play a more active role in fatherhood, through paternity leave, for example. However, parenthood does not stop at the baby stage. More needs to be done in this area. Tax reliefs for working mothers are well and good, but ultimately, the root problem must be solved − in my view − by creating a family-friendly working environment, without compromising overall productivity and growth. We should lift some of the load off the mother's shoulders, so that she does not feel the need to resign or compromise her work to care for the child.",6,93,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00093
2017-03-01-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Other forms of assistance to alleviate childcare costs and measures to encourage enhanced flexible work arrangements in the corporate and public sectors for all mothers, including working single mothers with children, will go a long way to alleviate childcare concerns as they struggle to also bring food to the table.",7,94,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00094
2017-03-01-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My next point in this area is with regard to the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP). Even as we talk about help for SMEs over the past one day − SkillsFuture training, job matching and others − I believe one basic bedrock and core business of Government we need to enhance further, is TAFEP.",8,95,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00095
2017-03-01-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"As it is, most of us in Singapore or Singaporeans are employed, and not business owners. I am an active advocator of a stronger TAFEP. I believe it has greater potential to further eliminate workplace discrimination. In order to do this, the TAFEP must be equipped with more teeth. Due to the changing social and global labour trends, we have a few groups of people vulnerable to workplace discrimination. They include expectant mothers, the older workers aged 45 and above, the blue collar low-income workers and Singaporeans working for foreign companies.",9,96,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00096
2017-03-01-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I raised this last year and I reiterate my call to Government again to please give TAFEP more investigative and authoritative powers to keep errant employers in check, especially so in this current global labour market, and also one where the gig economy is taking form where we have a rising freelance and contract workforce of experienced specialised talents supporting businesses.",10,97,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00097
2017-03-01-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"We need to ensure that these contract or part-time staff are treated fairly and are not exploited by employers. Eventually, this rising number of contract staff should enjoy mandatory employment benefits, such as annual and medical leave and other medical benefits, if possible. We also need to introduce wider laws to make discriminatory hiring and workplace practices illegal and punishable by law. Also, as we raise the retirement age for the older workers, we must also look into how in this age of digital transformation, they can be retrained to stay relevant to the workforce. We are a country that thrives on meritocracy, and this must be reflected in our labour market and labour laws, which is one of our most crucial propellers for growth for Singapore.",11,98,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00098
2017-03-01-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The next point I want to talk about is on helping employees − still within inclusive growth. Minister Iswaran has elaborated at length yesterday that SMEs are central focus in transforming our economy. Minister Iswaran's speech yesterday has reassured SMEs, in my view. Indeed, some of the short-term relief and targeted help for some sectors were made in this Budget. However, broad social transfers to businesses are taking a backseat this year, as we all know, but I hope more can be introduced.",12,99,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00099
2017-03-01-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Over a decade ago, one of the measures included helping businesses to cope with various structural shifts and changes to key policies. This includes the SME Rebate Scheme, a two-year assistance to help registered SMEs to adjust to rising business costs due to − at that point in time − an increase in employer CPF contribution rate. I hope that in the future, some of these one-off measures can be rolled out to help SMEs.",13,100,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00100
2017-03-01-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In the past year, social transfer to SMEs has also been generous. Some SMEs are still struggling to make sense of the schemes though, and some do not have the pre-requisites to qualify for the schemes. For example, a lack of SME cash-flow visibility forces some of the banks and financial institutions to place greater emphasis on collateral requirements when assessing SME credit risk, but very often, SMEs are not able to provide such collateral, leading to their loan applications being rejected.",14,101,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00101
2017-03-01-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I applaud the new International Partnership Fund (IPF) to help SMEs scale up and internationalise, which is good, but the concern is that it would tend to invest in more established or initial public offering (IPO)-ready firms. It may not benefit smaller, less-established SMEs which are capable of going into the region as well.",15,102,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00102
2017-03-01-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I hope the relevant authorities can work closely with SMEs to help them realise their full potential. One direct area of help would be to defer the construction levy hike, and in the scheme of the working capital, to raise the SME loan minimum to $500,000 for Government co-funding, as I feel that the $300,000 amount is quite small for working capital these days.",16,103,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00103
2017-03-01-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The next point is about tax system. It has been a while since we last reviewed our tax system. In fact, one of the CFE's recommendations is to review and reshape our tax system to keep in step with the changing times. Tax incentives should perhaps be given to the sectors that are favourable for our growth.",17,104,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00104
2017-03-01-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"One question I have in relation to the tax review is the concern whether we are taxing the current generation disproportionately, relative to the savings set aside for future generations. The tax review mentioned in this Budget is timely as our funding for social spending is expected to continue to rise. In that sense, I hope the tax review will incorporate all options on the table. Also, the review should broadly not just include more taxes but also reserves accumulation and formulation of the net investment income. For example, how much flow or revenue is going into reserves each year and whether it is falling sharply?",18,105,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00105
2017-03-01-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"For example, the possibility of considering a proportion of land sales and recurrent revenue from extension of leases of leasehold land into operating revenue rather than into reserves, a situation we are seeing now.",19,106,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00106
2017-03-01-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I also hope there will be a similar Manpower Transformation Maps II for our Singaporean workers to get guidance and help. I note that the CFE has identified six favourable sectors that promote high growth − the digital cluster, advanced manufacturing, hub services, logistics, urban solutions and infrastructure, and healthcare. Will more jobs be generated in these sectors, especially for the younger generation? How about the older employees who are not technology or computer savvy, but wish to do a mid-career switch? How will they be helped?",20,107,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00107
2017-03-01-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The second area is PMET stress. Moving on to the next topic, there have been a number of high profile cases these couple of years whereby large companies have had to retrench some of their staff. Undoubtedly, there must have been more in smaller companies that flew under the radar. These are certainly tough times for businesses, but even more so for the retrenched employees. Our tax filing season is just around the corner, and this brings to mind that those who have just lost a reasonably well paying job due to retrenchment may find it tough paying for the income tax and other forms of taxes. I would like to suggest tax relief of say 20% to 30%, for those who are in such a situation. Alternatively, allow the period for tax payments to be spread out over a longer period of time, and allow for income tax payments to be deferred for unique circumstances.",21,108,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00108
2017-03-01-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),My final area of focus is on overcoming global protectionist tides and having diversity in policies.,22,109,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00109

I proceeded to order via the touch-screen and waited. The lady looked at me in anticipation. I looked back at her and tried to hint with my eyes that I have just ordered my dessert at the touch-screen system. There was a queue forming and she snapped suddenly and said, ""Ai see mi"", which means ""What do you want?"" So the touch-screen system was not broken but it was not much of a use.",9,130,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00130

It was more of a novelty than an enterprising productivity tool, as highlighted by the Minister. Madam, there is a lesson to be learnt in what the lady at the dessert shop asked me that day, ""What do I want?"" What does the Government want from the targeted sectors under the SMEs Go Digital Programme? Technology can cut both ways. It can be a productivity tool or a glorified novelty. This Government should not waste public fund on the latter. The fact of the matter is, for some sectors, going digital may not be the sole solution to improve productivity. Beyond automation and going digital, the cleaning sector, for example, needs a re-design of the way refuse and waste are being collected. The design of old HDB estates needs a serious relook because it takes too long to clear the many bin chutes for just one block of flats.",10,131,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00131
2017-03-01-T-009,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Going digital alone is not going to help the cleaning sector. It also needs the Whole-of-Government (WoG) approach to educate or incentivise the public to generate less waste, because no amount of productivity improvements is going to help if we keep on generating waste at the current rate. It is important to embrace the digital economy but going digital alone is not going to resolve the productivity issue. The digital economy needs ""brick and mortar"" support. It may need the Government to relook into all the compliance processes and to remove them if necessary. Getting SMEs to go digital is only one part of the equation. It needs a collective effort for the digital economy to function and flourish.",11,132,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00132

2017-03-01-T-009,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Madam, it is logical to harmonise the tax structure for all motor fuels including diesel, to be based on much it is used. Since the Government has taken the approach to incentivise users to reduce consumption and manufacturers to develop more energy efficient vehicles, the special tax on diesel cars and taxis should be scrapped completely upon the implementation of the volume-based diesel tax.",13,134,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00134
2017-03-01-T-009,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Likewise, now that the tax structure for all motor fuels is harmonised, the road tax for vehicles should also be scrapped in favour of the more equitable volume-based usage tax, which was already in place for the longest time. Road usage is tied to the consumption of fuel. The more road you travel, the more fuel you burn, and the more tax you will pay, be it petrol duty or diesel tax. So, why are motorists being slapped with a road tax that is based on the engine capacity of the vehicles? What has engine capacity got to do with road usage? The current road tax regime is beyond a misnomer to begin with. Let us compare two cars of the same engine capacity. If one owner uses his vehicle seven days a week while the other utilises his vehicle three times a week, why are both drivers paying the same road tax when one is obviously contributing more to road congestion and pollution? What is the relevance and purpose of keeping an engine capacity-based road tax which has no relation to road usage, on top of the volume-based fuel duty which, in my opinion, is the actual and fairer road tax?",14,135,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00135
2017-03-01-T-009,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Last, the quantum of the water price hike is the perhaps the most puzzling measure in the Budget. Can the authority share how much losses it has made supplying water to Singaporeans since 2000 to warrant such a hefty increase? Minister Masagos has stated in his reply to my Parliamentary Question that the current national average water consumption has dropped about 11% as compared to 10 years ago. The number of households that consume more water than the national average today remains stable in the past decade at 40%. If we look at the per capita usage, water consumption in Singapore is about 5% to 70% lower than that of London, Melbourne, Tokyo, Hong Kong and New York.",15,136,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00136

They basically say Singaporeans understand the scarcity of water and we have been doing our part to conserve this precious element all this while. The Minister also acknowledged that and he cautioned Singaporeans not to be complacent and to save more water wherever possible. Singaporeans have done that before and I am quietly confident Singaporeans will do just that, going forward.",16,137,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00137
2017-03-01-T-009,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"It was reported in the news that the cost of developing and operating Singapore's water supply system has more than doubled from $500 million in 2000 to $1.3 billion in 2015. The Public Utilities Board (PUB) said this cost included water treatment, reservoir operation, NEWater production, desalination, used water collection and treatment, and the maintenance of water pipelines. So, in short, it is the entire cost of supplying water to the masses. It was also reported that homes account for 45% of water use daily. Using simple ratio, the share of the cost of supplying water to households should be 45% of $1.3 billion or $585 million. This will roughly translate to an average cost of about $40 per month to supply water to each household in 2015. This is well below the average monthly water bill paid by households of 4-room and above and I am sure for most private housing as well, before the proposed price hike.",17,138,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00138
2017-03-01-T-009,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"As highlighted by the Government, water prices have remained unchanged since 2000. What that means is that the margin of supplying water to households could be even higher in 2000 than what I have estimated for 2015. Using the same assumption, it costs about $21 per month to supply water to each household in 2000.",18,139,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00139

His opponents at the time accused him of not doing enough to provide for water and promised to solve the problem by quickly expanding pipelines to run more water from Johor − disregarding the fact that it takes years to build pipes and that thirst kills in those days.

In simple terms, we could say that water is thus subsidised by at least 30%. At least 30% because prices charged do not reflect the capital costs of the water and the wastewater system. The PUB has said that it will be spending $4 billion from 2017 to 2021 on water infrastructure.",11,153,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00153
2017-03-01-T-009,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"The second objection is tied to the first − that raising the water price will hit the poor heavily while the rich will still be able to use as much water as they want. First, raising the price of water to reflect its true cost, I believe, is a fairer system than subsiding it willy-nilly. But we can and should raise tariffs without burdening the poor. In this case, the Government has proposed increasing prices in such a way that ensures burdens fall lightest on the poorest. One- and 2-room HDB flat owners will in fact see no increase in their bills at all.",12,154,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00154
2017-03-01-T-009,Seah Kian Peng,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Last, I want to address the limits of water pricing. As policymakers, we use price for many things − we use it as an incentive, as a tax, as a signal on how much we value things. But water and pricing is quite difficult. A household of five in Singapore pays $30 a month for water − 0.04% of the median income. Each month, for many of us, our handphone bill costs more than our water bill. Using price alone to motivate people to save water, I believe, is not going to work.",13,155,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00155

They are learnt by personal experience and emotions. I therefore ask the Government, the Minister, to consider introducing periodic water rationing. It is not a new suggestion but one that has a special salience in the light of this year's Budget. I suggest we do this, not during droughts, but during ""peace time"" as it were, following the footsteps of countries such as Australia, where they are called ""water restrictions"". This is an inoculation against the environmental realities that are to come.",21,163,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00163

We have enjoyed our entitlements of clean air and clean water for as long as we remember. But the unwelcome reality brought about by changes in our world is that not only are both in short supply, the two are growing sources of contention in an increasingly fractious world. Singapore has developed a lead in clean water technology and we can do the same with green technologies in general. A fundamental element in managing the competing access to clean water and air is to correctly price their availability. The long-term consequences of mispricing water and pollution are severe and incompatible with the direction we intend to take for our future economy, as well as for our society. We should not leave future generations unprepared to confront a problem that is developing now.",5,178,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00178

The issue is much broader and has to do with our collective responsibility for the environment and societal development. Hence, I would like to urge the Minister to consider price corrections in other areas in urgent need of attention as well. Areas, such as electronic waste generation, should be incorporated into a comprehensive strategy for responsible environmental advocacy. By ensuring that pricing is imposed on both water and pollution, Singapore is not just taking a responsible leadership role in pushing forward the agenda for dealing with climate change, we will also be putting in place incentives for nurturing the development of technologies whose global economic potential is rapidly expanding.

In the third quarter of 2016, the number of work permit holders in manufacturing and construction declined, contributing to a rare quarterly contraction in total employment in Singapore. As a result, preliminary statistics from MOM show foreign employment (excluding foreign domestic workers) shrinking over the course of 2016 as a whole, the first time this has occurred since the global financial crisis for the whole year. At the same time, labour productivity measures depict improving performance. Full year 2016 figures show real value-added per worker hitting 1%, after having remained stubbornly negative in the preceding two years. And the quarterly statistics show the improvement was sustained throughout, with fourth quarter real value-added per worker hitting 2.4%.

In recent years, including the current Budget proposal, the system has been used to moderate the impact of manpower cost pressures when economic conditions are poor. As a counter-cyclical tool, the system of levies and DRCs can be adjusted by sector. On this basis, levy rises in the marine and process sectors have been frozen, while those in construction have been allowed to proceed as earlier announced.

Whether we are prepared for the reality of competing against countries much larger than us, this is something that we will have to deal with as a result of the proposals set out in this Budget. This Budget makes a significant push for internationalisation. This will increase the companies and local talent being given greater exposure to global competition and will serve us well in the long run.

While some companies are afraid that workers might leave after acquiring new skills, other companies have established training centres, set aside dedicated training hours, and sponsored training courses to support their employees in their upgrading efforts. For example, OCBC is one such company that is pro-training. OCBC topped up their employees' SkillsFuture credit and provided employees time off to attend shortlisted training courses.

Multi-national Corporations (MNCs) or larger SMEs could help to champion sectoral productivity initiatives which other smaller sized companies in the same sector can leverage upon.

A motivated employee is obviously more innovative and productive, and many studies have proven this. A study conducted by the University of Warwick in 2014 found that happiness led to an increase in productivity by 12%. The same study also found that workers who are otherwise unhappy show a decline of 10% in their productivity level.

Mr Richard Branson, Founder of Virgin Group, in an interview in 2014, mentioned that one business strategy that he used is an employee-centric management, giving priority to employees. He said, and I quote, ""It should go without saying if a person who works at your company is 100% proud of the brand, and you give them the tools to do a good job and they are treated well, they are going to be happy.""

Although the Government has provided additional assistance through U-save rebates, the increase in the price of water does not only comprise domestic users or consumption at home, but it also involves all aspects of water consumption like industries and businesses.

The key difference between today's disruptive technologies is the frequency and nature in which the disruption presents itself. Intensive emergence of the new technologies renders less predictability in our future markets, but it is also able to bring about new economies and business opportunities for us. With digitalisation, the impact and reach of any new technology will be much larger as the market can react more responsively. New technologies that constantly emerge begin to dominate the market spaces within short span of months, not years, unlike in the past.

2017-03-01-T-009,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"First, innovate for growth. To me, innovation is a culture. It has to be reflected through our education system, the social environment and our workplace. It is not an object or a target that we create for a specified period of time. We have been investing in the past decade in R&D, creating more platforms to innovate. We have seen increase in number of innovative ideas as evident by the 1,469 patents that were filed by Singaporean residents in 2015. That is 12.7% year-on-year increase on the patents that is registered. But the corresponding number of ideas and patents from earlier batches that have borne tangible achievements, as in business returns, pale in comparison. I think the reason is we still lack innovation and value creation deeply entrenched as a culture in Singapore.",11,313,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00313
2017-03-01-T-009,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"If we review where this stems from, I think it begins from our education. I definitely agree that it is important to have adequate foundation and understanding of fundamentals in all that we learn. But often, rigorous practice to manage examinations are not indicators that we have learnt. Usually, the most effective results are seen in our ability to actively learn and to apply the knowledge that is learnt to real-life situations and challenges. Also, to create value out of limitations. Being adaptive, thinking out-of-the-box, accepting different ideas and challenges are all part of a process to innovate. We need to allow our younger generation to do so. There is no short cut to this. The challenge is  do we have the appetite to experiment and will the society accept different pathways in our education?",12,314,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00314
2017-03-01-T-009,Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"Our education and societal norms will eventually shape the workers in our workforce. The ability to continue learning and take risks reflect the will of our individuals. Without the culture, can we see the jewel in the rocks? Take for example, we often claim that technologies have replaced and made humans redundant or made sunset industries. Looking deeper, does the issue lie with a person's inability to transform with time or the emergence of improvements in the world?",13,315,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00315

With technology evolvement, the processes involved and the product variety that is available certainly has changed our views of possibilities in traditional form of manufacturing. Producing different car components can now be done using additive, or what we call 3D manufacturing, and less of moulding, welding and casting in the past. The industry does not go away, but the technology involved has advanced. Likewise, if we cannot foresee, innovate and integrate new pathways in our economy, it is unlikely for growth to sustain or even for new jobs to be created.",14,316,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00316

As the industries and economy undergo restructuring, workers who have skills mismatch due to inexperience or lack training opportunities must now try to pick up new skills. It is not easy to learn new skills, especially when one is used to some level of comfort or in the way of how we do things. SkillsFuture is a good starting point for people to embrace the need to learn, but that cannot be the only reason why we are learning. Everyone must recognise the need to continuously learn as they study and work, this is the only way to remain relevant throughout our changing environment.",15,317,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00317

I do not think that is what we are trying to achieve with SkillsFuture. In my opinion, every individual worker has core capability and basic skills. Through our lifetime, it is critical for us to develop two sets of skills  (i) to deepen our core capabilities that further enable our expertise or develop fortes; (ii) to develop broad-base skills that are transferable regardless of industry. Only with these T-skills will we be able to add on incrementally at each stage of our career and capture the new opportunities.",16,318,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00318

Employees, have to keep learning and up-skilling through their career and not only when the need arises. They must be participative and not hope to be valued due to seniority.

The willingness to change, adapt and be always prepared has to take place across generations. We must get our younger and the future generations ready to think and act for themselves. In the short term, we have to address the needs to assist our existing workforce to make sure that they remain employable. But on the long run, we have to consider  do we take bolder measures to evolve a new culture or do we continue to move ahead to reinvent through incremental changes? On this note, Mdm Speaker, I support the Budget.",24,326,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00326

I would like to respond to the points raised by Members, particularly on the issue of the water price revision.",1,327,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00327
2017-03-01-T-009,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"In Singapore, water is unlike any other ordinary commodity. We subsidise housing, healthcare, education, but not water consumption. Water is a strategic issue. It is a national security. We must price water fully. Even as we give targeted assistance to households, such as U-Save vouchers to help them pay for their utilities bills, we must price water correctly. The consumer must feel the price of water. Consumers must realise how valuable water is to us in Singapore, every time he or she turns on the tap, right from the first drop.",2,328,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00328
2017-03-01-T-009,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Let me take us back to the last time when the Government last revised the price of water, which was in 1997. We had not revised water prices for some time then. Elements in Malaysia were threatening to block our water supply from Johor. We were embarking on desalination to secure our water supply. We needed to register with Singaporeans the strategic importance of water, and the importance of saving every drop possible.",3,329,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00329
2017-03-01-T-009,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"The Government therefore decided to revise the water price substantially, to reflect water's true scarcity value. If we needed any additional water, where would it come from? How much would that additional litre cost? That is what we call the Long-Run Marginal Cost, or LRMC. That is the cost which consumers must see.",4,330,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00330
2017-03-01-T-009,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"At that time and even today, the Johor supply was fixed. Local reservoirs had been almost fully developed, maybe except for Marina Reservoir. NEWater was not even invented in 1997. It came way later in 2002. Apart from conventional methods of collecting water or rain water, the only proven technology then was to produce water through desalination. But desalination then was very expensive, $3 to $3.50, through what we call multi-stage flash (MSF) distillation. This number did not even include the cost of pipelines.",5,331,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00331
2017-03-01-T-009,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"There was no way for the Government then to move the water price to the true cost of the next litre − the price of desalination. So, it moved instead in steps, over the period of 1997 to 2000, to today's water price.",6,332,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00332
2017-03-01-T-009,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Since then, water technology has progressed steadily. PUB itself invested in R&D. This resulted in NEWater, which was much cheaper than desalination. Desalination technology has improved from MSF to membranes. As a result, we have been able to keep our costs down, the cost of water, and hold water prices unchanged for 17 years.",7,333,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00333
2017-03-01-T-009,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"But costs have gone up gradually over the years. At some point, a price revision became essential.",8,334,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00334
2017-03-01-T-009,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Let me give a few examples of how costs have risen in the recent review. Firstly, the LRMC is a mix of NEWater and desalination costs. Now, in the blend with NEWater and desalination, we have depended more on desalination for the next litre as water demand increases. There is also a limit to recycling used water in our NEWater plants. Therefore, to increase our water supply further, we must build more desalination plants. Indeed, we are building three desalination plants within the next three years.",9,335,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00335
2017-03-01-T-009,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Secondly, as we increase the proportion of water reclaimed for NEWater, effluent becomes more concentrated and indeed more difficult and more costly to process.",10,336,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00336
2017-03-01-T-009,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Thirdly, Singapore is becoming more urbanised, so it is costing us more to build new and replacement pipes to deliver water.",11,337,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00337
2017-03-01-T-009,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Here are some figures from our recent expenditures, which can give an indication of how it will be in the future. Looking at the first year of desalination, for instance, while the first-year price for our first plant, SingSpring Desalination Plant, was $0.78 per cubic metre, the first-year price of our latest plant at Marina East was $1.08 per cubic metre, some 40% increase.",12,338,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00338
2017-03-01-T-009,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"For conveyance costs, we now tunnel below the road to lay pipelines. This minimises inconvenience to road users and the public, but it costs two-and-a-half times as much as conventional pipe laying techniques. As our pipelines age, PUB will have to more than double the rate of renewal of old pipelines from the current 20 kilometres per year to 50 kilometres per year, to minimise pipe leaks and disruptions.",13,339,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00339
2017-03-01-T-009,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"All these point to the need to update the LRMC, which the 30% price increase has reflected. We are unable to provide details of its computation because of commercial sensitivities. We still need to build more desalination plants and NEWater plants; and as more desalination, NEWater and water reclamation plants are yet to be built or expanded, revealing the specifics of the LRMC could prejudice future bids. But rest assured that the LRMC reflects the best the market can offer.",14,340,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00340
2017-03-01-T-009,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Mr Pritam Singh asked whether technology is taken into account in the computation of LRMC. My answer is a definite ""yes"". It has always been and also the case for this review. Technologically, we have squeezed everything we can from the current water processing technology. It will take several more years to achieve the next breakthrough and bring it to a deployable scale.",15,341,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00341
2017-03-01-T-009,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"I also thank Members for reminding the House that we have had a serious problem in the depletion of the Linggiu Reservoir in recent years. It is not clear whether the current situation is due to climate change, but we cannot discount the possibility of dry weather to persist. And in the future, when climate change effects become more pronounced, it would be more severe. As Members are also aware, Johor is also drawing water from the Johor River, and Singapore is discussing this with Malaysia to ensure that Johor's actions do not compromise our ability to draw the 250 mgd that Singapore is entitled to from the Johor River under the 1962 Water Agreement. What is clear is that Linggiu is operating today at a level way below what we are comfortable with, and it will take years to build up to a reliable capacity again.",16,342,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00342

This is less than a dollar a day. Indeed, I am heartened that some businesses have taken this increase in context and have explicitly said that they would not increase prices. For households, the Government has provided additional U-Save rebates. 1- and 2-room HDB households will not experience any increase in their bills. For other HDB flat types, monthly water bills will go up by $2 to $11 per month. Overall, water will still be affordable because it will remain at about 1% of household income.

Many schools are participating this year to raise awareness of the value of water and the importance of water conservation among our young ones. Even during the prolonged dry spell in 2014, we did not face serious shortages because we had NEWater and desalination plants. There was no water rationing. But water conservation was something earlier generations of Singaporeans had imbibed. Singaporeans back then knew that every now and then, elements in Malaysia were threatening to turn off the taps. So, they bore with water rationing, supported water saving campaigns and even paid the cost of cleaning up rivers and their catchment areas.",29,355,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00355

2017-03-01-T-009,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Mr Pritam Singh, do you have a clarification?",1,357,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00357
2017-03-01-T-009,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Yes, Mdm Speaker. I have a few clarifications for the Minister. I thank him for the detailed speech that he gave. Firstly, I would like to ask the Minister how does PUB assess when to increase the price of water because according to the PUB's Annual Report, the net income of the PUB − after Government grants and contributions to the Consolidated Fund and tax − was actually higher between the years 2013 and 2015, as compared to between 2010 and 2012. Between 2013 and 2015, it was about $550 million and between 2010 and 2012, it was $339 million. Notwithstanding the improvements that are required for the transmission networks and so forth, some clarity on that would be appreciated.",1,358,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00358
2017-03-01-T-009,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second question pertains to a point that the Minister made in his speech, which was about the choice of building more desalination plants. How does the PUB make that determination; Whether it should construct more NEWater plants, as opposed to desalination plants, because NEWater is obviously cheaper. Some understanding on that will be helpful as well.",2,359,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00359
2017-03-01-T-009,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"And to that end, two follow-up clarifications  is the PUB considering a proposal which has been discussed in public before, which is to deepen local reservoirs to increase our own local catchment, and the possibility of directly supplying NEWater which, I understand, some years ago was raised in this House and the then-Minister clarified that only one country − I believe it was Namibia − which transmits such water directly. The reason is because it would save costs by just having NEWater supplied directly, as opposed to going through another processing exercise through the reservoirs.",3,360,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00360
2017-03-01-T-009,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"A few more quick clarifications, and I beg your indulgence. With regard to the Linggiu Reservoir, assuming that it does fail, can we anticipate a rise in water conservation tax? With regard to my suggestion about a differentiated tax regime to encourage savings among Singaporeans, in addition to water rationing that the Minister mentioned, would the Government reconsider how it prices water so as to encourage people to achieve real savings by conserving water?",4,361,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00361
2017-03-01-T-009,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I thank the Member for asking these questions. On the issue of the books in PUB, I think it is very complicated for me to attempt to simplify what the numbers really mean. Our books are in accruals and our budget is in cash, and we have to reconcile them. What we will do is I will ask the Minister for Finance to look at the whole-of-Government approach in funding our water infrastructure. I think that makes more sense. Because there are some parts which are Government-funded and some parts which are PUB-funded, and it does not add up, if we look at each book separately.",1,362,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00362
2017-03-01-T-009,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"On the desalination plant, why do we choose NEWater versus desalination? Desalination, as I have mentioned just now, is more costly than NEWater. But as you reclaim more of this used water to be processed, the concentration, as I have mentioned to you, becomes even more difficult to process and, therefore, more costly. There is a tipping point between when it is better to have a desalination plant, which is easier to convey the sea water to, and a NEWater plant where we have to convey the used water to. So, all these cost considerations give us a way to basically evaluate the best cost-effective model and also to spread our risks across technologies.",2,363,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00363
2017-03-01-T-009,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"There was a question on whether we can deepen our reservoirs. In fact, that was the first question I asked when I joined the Ministry. It is very intuitive. Why can we not just deepen our reservoirs? Unfortunately, the answer is not as simple as the question. We have done studies and, currently, the studies show that there is a particular yield from the reservoir if you leave it as it is, and there is a risk this yield can be reduced if you start disturbing the bottom of the reservoir. So, we do not want to do something adversely affecting our yield of the reservoir by doing something which looks intuitive. I have asked our experts to study this further. They are still in the midst of studying this, but, right now, the prospect is not fantastic, unfortunately.",3,364,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00364
2017-03-01-T-009,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The fourth question which the Member asked is about whether we can directly send NEWater to our homes. Theoretically, we can, but we do not have to right now. Certainly, when we need to, we will have to put the right processes to ensure this can be done, because we must ensure that it is safe for our house to drink from end to end.",4,365,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00365

2017-03-01-T-009,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Yes, Minister. If the Linggiu Reservoir fails and we cannot draw from the reservoir, would the water conservation tax go up because it is associated with not over-consuming water?",1,367,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00367
2017-03-01-T-009,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The price of water, as it stands today, that we have proposed to increase, is the LRMC, which is the price of producing the next drop of water. And, therefore, for whatever reason, the next drop of water that we need to draw will be coming from desalination as well as NEWater. So, it is already priced in. The problem is not the price. The problem is what will we do, what can we do, to prevent that from happening. Because it is not just an issue of supply; it is a very complicated issue should that situation ever occur to us.",1,368,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00368
2017-03-01-T-009,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Finally, on savings and water rationing, whether we can give a rebate to people who save water, it is a bit counter-intuitive because, in the first place, we want to make sure people pay for the cost of producing the water, which is the LRMC. And to give back that cost means we are subsidising the use of water. Any way we change the structure of water that we have today either involves cost or will be counter-intuitive to trying to promote conservation of water. I think what we have today is achieving its objectives, and I am glad that everywhere I go, water is one of the things that Singaporeans are very aware of. In fact, during the 93.8Live discussion on water, there was a caller who was very upset because one of his colleagues was using water in the shower after work. It was given for free for, I do not know, half an hour, or for a very long time. And he got very upset because you do not do this at home, why you do this over here? Because it is free? This is the right DNA for Singaporeans − even though it is free, we cannot bear to see water wasted. And I think that is how we should move forward. Continue to price it properly to reflect the scarcity value of water and, with that, hopefully, we achieve a DNA of always wanting to conserve the use of water.",2,369,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00369

2017-03-01-T-009,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"If I recall correctly, it was in 1997 when we decided to price water correctly. At that time, it was not only not priced correctly, the structure of the tariff was also very difficult to encourage conservation, conserving of water, to charge water according to its value. It was only in 1997 when we looked at really what we need to do to get that next drop of water, given the situation we were facing with our neighbours, given the expiry of water by 2060, that we consciously decided that we have to start thinking around how to make sure people understand the value of water. So, from 1997 onwards, we revised the water tariff and structure to reflect the cost of producing that water, the LRMC, and, therefore, to make sure users know the price of what they use.",1,372,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00372

How do we assure the worker that his welfare is front and centre of the Government's priority?

Of course, history shows us that as old jobs disappear, new ones will rise to take their place. But this is cold comfort for each individual worker who worries about his job being replaced by robots. There is a parallel to the rise of protectionism here. Free trade benefits the economy as a whole, but specific workers lose their jobs, as they see their wages being depressed. To them, ""the greater good"" is mere words, whereas their own pain is immediate and tangible.",8,450,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00450

There are even full-time part-timers who do a portfolio of different jobs. Already, in the US, 33% of workers are to freelancers, expected to rise to 40% in 2020. Singapore is not there yet, but we are certainly moving in the same direction. There are some local part-time job portals like Freeboh or MyWorkSG that are gaining a lot of traction, as even more workers report their willingness partake in the gig economy.",9,451,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00451

The first is that these freelancers may not develop and grow their skills, and end up doing the same role forever. There is nothing to incentivise them or there is nobody looking out for the freelancers in terms of their career progression. The other concern that I have is that the gig economy essentially transfers the risk from company to individuals. Freelancers do not enjoy statutory benefits like full-time work people do, such as annual leave, maternity benefits, In-camp Training (ICT), reimbursements or paid medical leave.",11,453,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00453

Although MediShield Life provides hospitalisation coverage, freelancers still lack accident, life and especially outpatient benefits that many companies currently provide. The trend towards part-time and freelance work is gaining momentum. The gig economy will allow workers to work in a variety of roles and pick up new skills. This supplements or bolsters, training or retraining like what we are trying to do in the SkillsFuture.

The role of Government here is to ensure that worker welfare is sufficiently protected in this brave new world. As The Straits Times recently argued, we need a future-ready social safety net for the future economy.

Amidst the economy slowdown, the number of workers who were retrenched last year had doubled as compared to 2015. However, there are still many growth sectors such as healthcare, social services and transport. Every year, these sectors need to hire a few thousand staff. Let me cite public transport as an example. As the demand for public bus services increases, the gross monthly pay of bus captains has improved dramatically from $2,000 per month in 2011 to more than $3,000 per month now. This is even higher than the $2,500 starting monthly pay of polytechnic graduates and $2,700 starting pay of private universities' graduates. The $3,000 gross monthly pay of a new bus captain is comparable to graduates from local public funded universities with median starting pay of $3,400. While a new bus captain's gross monthly pay is $3,000, the chief bus captain's gross monthly pay can be as high as $6,000. This is a perfect example of ""every trade has its master"". Hence, I urge those who are retrenched to seriously consider taking up jobs at the service sectors.",10,465,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00465

We need Sports Singapore to work with various agencies to make available more training venues for National players and amateur players alike as interest in sports grows. Take volleyball, for instance. The Volleyball Association has groomed our indoor women's team to win a SEA Games Bronze medal in 2015 after a 32-year break. And last year, our combined school boys' team won a Bronze medal during the ASEAN Schools' Competition for the first time in Singapore's history. And our beach volleyball Men's and Women's youth teams were invited to participate in the World Beach Volleyball Competition in Switzerland last year, again first time in our history.

We saw a record 19,000 layoffs in 2016 since the last peak in 2009.

Many have returned due to family commitments, such as because of elderly parents, or children's education, or to really come back home. One such example is a PME in his 50s who has been working for a European MNC in the oil and gas sector for 20 years in the area of project management. He was retrenched and was out of job for a year before finally landing a job as a Project Manager now based in Saudi Arabia. I know some who have been back for more than a year and still have not found any jobs despite lowering their salary expectations. Some have resorted to doing freelance work or short-term contract positions. This is an area we need to pay particular attention to, and I hope the enhancements to Adapt and Grow and the many SkillsFuture initiatives to be announced will address this problem.",14,561,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00561

The future jobs in demand and future skills in demand component can be built into this programme to ensure all Singaporeans stay able, adaptable and agile.

I have met workers who have shared how they have benefitted immensely from picking up new skills via tapping on their SkillsFuture credits. With the rapidly volatile business environment and job obsolescence, workers globally are now concerned that their skills are losing relevance or what I call the ""Fear of Skills Erosion"". To address this, I suggest for the Government to provide SkillsFuture Credit top-ups of $500 in intervals every three to five years so as to encourage Singaporeans to take personal responsibility in their continuing education and training, embrace a spirit of lifelong learning and stay ready, relevant and resilient. The credits can go a long way for not just skills acquisition, but should also include engaging professional career coach services.",17,564,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00564
2017-03-01-T-009,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Lastly, the Budget has announced proposed enhancements to Adapt and Grow funding, including the ""Attach and Learn"" programme which I welcome and look forward to hearing more during the Manpower COS. However, I hope as we execute the various funding, we must bear in mind the need to be flexible, responsive in terms of speed to market and also cater to all segments of the workforce, from low-wage workers to PMEs. With about 70% of those laid off last year being PMETs, I submit that we need to pay particular attention to this group and, especially those who are long-term unemployed and mature PMEs. I am glad that the Professional Conversion Programme (PCP), now supports re-deployment of PMEs within the company. However, one particular observation I have with the PCP is that when PMEs move into a new sector or totally new job, he or she enters at the entry point of that new sector or job. I find this sometimes unsatisfactory, considering many mature PMEs have accumulated one to as many as three decades of work experience and that their other innate skills are not taken cognisance of. At our U PME Centre, we observed many PMEs would prefer to stay within their industries where possible, or, at the most, move across into any industry by utilising their sets of skills and experience. There is strong inertia from many PMEs to explore new industries due to the high opportunity cost. It is with this mind that I hope the Government can look into helping PMEs transit into second careers more seamlessly by exploring the adjacency of jobs and the adjacency of skills so that these PMEs can move into, move across or move up into new roles which capitalise on their acquired skills and knowledge so that they can even enter mid-career and be given credits for their experience. The public sector has successfully done this for certain job types and I suggest we replicate this to other sectors and companies.",18,565,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00565

The ""killer app"" is how we can, as one country and one people, stay not just ready, relevant and resilient but have the necessary ability, agility and adaptability to navigate and ride on the ebb and flow.

How much more do I have to pay? Why the price increase for carbon, diesel or water? For businesses, their reactions have also been largely similar  How much would I get? How much more must I pay? Will there be more immediate pain relief? Even amongst some civil servants, they were surprised, ""Wow, you mean my Ministry's budget is going to be re-based, which means a cut of 2%?""

I have been observing this for the last few years. The top four revenue streams of our Budget are Net Investment Income, corporate tax, GST and income tax. This year, the number one income stream, out of these four, is Net Investment Income. This was not the position a few years ago. Net Investment Income has become the revenue stream that gives us the most to do for our Budget. And if we think a bit deeper, these top four buckets of revenue stream ‒ Net Investment Income, corporate tax, GST and income tax ‒ out of these four, how many of them are really under our control? Net Investment Income depends on the status of the world economy. Corporate tax and income tax will be similarly cyclical according to the world economy.

I always joke with some friends that our corporate tax rate and income tax rate are not set independently by the Minister for Finance. The Minister for Finance has to watch like a hawk what our competitors are doing. So, this is the context that we are in ‒ $1 in every $5 that we spend today comes from our Net Investment Income ‒ the four biggest buckets of our revenue stream, three of which are not entirely within our control.

Is this a real surplus? Even after accounting for the Net Investment Income, we have less than $2 billion budgeted for. The question is this  Will we realise this $2 billion surplus? And I hope Mr Leon Perera is right. I will be very happy if we are right and you are right. But what if we are wrong? What if the economy turns soft and we do not realise the full amount that we have budgeted for the Net Investment Income but, instead, we need more money to help fellow Singaporeans if the economy turns further south? How much can we afford and how much more do we have? One programme, like Workfare Income Supplement (WIS), costs us $600 million to $700 million.

We precisely design the system such that no Government will come in and promise to spend before it has earned its keep. This is unlike other countries. This is the reason why we have been able to get $1 out of every $5 to support our Budget. If our forefathers had done otherwise ‒ to spend first before the term of Government even earned its keep ‒ we can forget about that $1 out of every $5 that we are depending on for our Budget now.

This, I think, will require a national effort. We need to do much better and we can do much better. I have always never been entirely satisfied with our speed-to-market for generating new modules that are relevant to the industry needs. But this is not a finger-pointing exercise, this is a call for the Labour Movement to work closely with the Government agencies and the businesses to come together.

There are new forms of employment − freelancers, contract workers. We need new mental models to help these workers protect their legal rights, financial rights, help them to plan for their retirement, and so forth. This is why MOM is initiating a workgroup with the businesses, with the Labour Movement to study the implications of such long-term structural changes to our employment market, and we have to get this right. The Labour Movement will fully support the MOM initiative to review our system to make sure that all working people, regardless of workers, freelancers, or contractors can have the peace of mind for today and for tomorrow.",12,612,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00612

How do we make that statement that we as a society will lean forward to help those who need a bit more help − the weak, the vulnerable, and the poor? That we do not need to be apologetic. That we will lean forward for the weaker segment of our population.",18,618,2017-03-01-T-009-S-00618

When you do it three times, it is a tradition, and thou shall not violate thy tradition. But is that the correct way to do things? We have to look at it fresh every year.

The second question  do we agree that we should price water properly?

The answer is we have 17 reservoirs today. We used to have three. We have 17 reservoirs today. How many desalination plants do we have today? How many NEWater plants do we have today?

The most obvious choice was the PAP's performance in 2011 General Election. Then, some added, the Presidential Election of 2011.

2017-03-01-T-011,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"It is never easy to talk about price increases. It is never easy. But what is a responsible government? A responsible government is one that not only takes care of the short-term needs of our people but also the future. A responsible government is one that prices the essentials properly, and not distort the market, leading to more subsidies that will burden our future generations. A responsible government is not one that will raise the price and not take especially greater care of the poor.",6,654,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00654

2017-03-01-T-011,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Finally, a responsible government is one who knows what is not sustainable and will put a stop to it now. This is not a Wait and See Budget.

So, I submit to the House that this is a Government that has a heart of its people at its core. We know the pressures in the short term. We are doing what we can in a targeted manner. But more importantly, we know the long-term challenges facing our country, and we will do what is right, what is necessary to leave behind a better state for our future generations to build on.

I commend him for his far-sighted approach and the courage to take measures that might be unpopular.

2017-03-01-T-011,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"First, let me speak about Government. Minister Heng boldly introduced a permanent 2% cut on the budget caps for all Ministries and agencies. Can the Minister clarify − what will be the implication of this? How will Government ensure this makes it more effective?",2,659,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00659
2017-03-01-T-011,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Will this affect the budget for hiring and retaining civil servants, and thus the quality of the civil service? I think the civil service in Singapore is generally corruption-free and competent, and much better than many other countries. But there is room for improvement in some areas. Some civil servants focus more on the rules of their own agency, instead of looking at what outcome will benefit Singaporeans.",3,660,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00660
2017-03-01-T-011,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Let me give you an example. I visited a newly completed BTO recently, Khatib Court, which is beside Khatib MRT. It is a beautiful development, but it has one very strange feature. It has a covered linkway that is hanging, and not completed. To me, it is not completed. It comes from Khatib Court, and here is the MRT station, and there is a gap of 10 metres. So, I asked HDB what happened. Are you training my residents to be 10-m sprinters, especially during rainy days? Then, they shared with me that it is because they faced a lot of challenges and the requirements from LTA that they said they cannot meet. Therefore, they aborted that portion. I called a meeting, both sat together, and I told both parties. I told them, ""Regardless of what happens, I must have this covered linkway."" Every one forgot about the hassle-free first-mile and last-mile connectivity.

As usual, I asked HDB to construct a covered linkway from the nearest block to the nearest bus stop. HDB agreed, and the consultants submitted the plans. And what happens? Part of the covered linkway sits on top of a drain. So, PUB said, ""No. No structure is supposed to be on top of my drain. Shift your foot-path out into the grass verge."" And you know grass verge belongs to who, right? NParks. NParks said, ""Nothing is supposedly to sit on my grass verge."" So, I do not what innovation solutions that PUB and NParks can think of.",5,662,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00662

May be I should seek our Coordinating Minister's help. [Laughter] These are only small projects and we meet so many obstacles. In bigger policy decisions, I am sure there are even bigger roadblocks. Can our civil servants not be more result-oriented and objective-driven instead of just guarding your own turf?",6,663,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00663

At the back of my mind, I was thinking hopefully this would include a new swimming complex in Yishun which I have been asking for.",9,666,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00666
2017-03-01-T-011,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"But ultimately for the construction industry, $700 million is not really enough to make an impact. Can Government increase this number? The construction industry has been facing lots of pressure from the economic slowdown and Government requirements. I heard that some smaller companies could not pay their staff on time. In 2017, their foreign workers' levy will go up again, and they will be affected by the diesel tax too. Can the Government consider deferring their levy increase till better times, like marine and process sectors?",10,667,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00667

For example, the SSI's biomechanic who is assigned to the Singapore Swimming Association does not look after just the needs of SSA, but also has other NSA responsibilities. Likewise, for the physiotherapists. But this sports science support system must be almost round the clock, 24/7, including weekends, because the swimmers are trained and also taking part in competition during weekends.",16,673,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00673

In the domestically oriented sectors which hire more workers than export oriented sectors, productivity growth is understandably marginal.

With that, it also brings a caution that it requires us to understand what these challenges are, what the difficulties are, what they will morph into and what new ones will appear on the horizon, and how we may convert them into our strengths. That alone is already daunting.",2,715,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00715

We cannot think like we used to think. I submit that the Budget would not achieve its objectives if we implemented and relied on the Budget measures without a mindset change. Without discarding all that we have learnt and built in our individual and collective memories and achievements, we must nonetheless recognise that our success yesterday and today could be our failure tomorrow.

Last week, as I was driving, I was hearing some of the talk shows talking about this water tax increase. Of course, there was a lot of public unhappiness about this water increase. Quite surprisingly, we heard one academic from one of the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL) mentioning that the increase should be much more − it should be more than 30%; it should be 100% − to deliver a shock effect so that people will start to save water. I hope that is not the intent of the Government to deliver a shock effect. In fact, I think the Members of both sides of the House have helped to deliver this shock to everybody.

For domestic households, what percentage of their monthly utility bill does water consumption constitute on the average? And thanks to public education efforts, in fact, many domestic households, on the whole, are quite streetwise with their water usage. In fact, the water usage trend has been trending downwards in terms of water usage per capita. However, based on feedback from my residents, many are still concerned that water consumption cost will make up a significant portion of their monthly expenditure with this increase. So, I hope the Government would dismiss that notion.",7,745,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00745

Why was the water price not raised in between? Why wait until 17 years later, especially now when Town Councils have already revised their S&CC charges on households. In fact, the rise water price could have also pulled the rug under the Town Council, as they would be facing higher operating cost now arising from the revision of price of water. The inflationary effect may well negate the various rebates and other schemes that were spelt out in the Budget. I know it is a tough call for the Finance Minister but I hope at least there will be some explanation given to address the public concerns.",10,748,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00748

But many had ignored the fact that the Minister had also announced a permanent increase in GST Voucher and U-Save on top of the one off GST Voucher special payment. May I ask if the price revision could have been considered to phase out in a longer period such as increasing as 10% per year over the next three years? Or why not adopt an even more progressive water tariffs to tax those with higher water consumption?",11,749,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00749
2017-03-01-T-011,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"Major cities in many countries such as US, France, Australia and China have adopted the use of multiple tiered water pricing, alternatively known as progressive water tariffs or increasing the block tariffs. According to a research study from Stanford University's Water in the West Programme, tiered water pricing is a critical tool in incentivising water conservation. Under such a pricing system, the first block with the lowest pricing usually corresponds with the amount of water that a typical household requires for basic needs such as bathing, domestic cleaning and cooking. Each subsequent tier then commands a higher charge on excessive water usage that applies to luxuries like maintaining large gardens or swimming pools.",12,750,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00750
2017-03-01-T-011,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"China is a country with multiple tiered water pricing system. Like us, their price of water is state-controlled. Water prices are low on international standards, but there is a problem for them, because their water per capita availability is low. By raising water prices, the authorities feared, would intensify the income inequality, as water consumption represents a higher share of income for low-income households. The local governments experimented with multiple tiered pricing systems for urban households and industrial users, charging higher prices for higher water consumption. And these reforms have found to achieve its desired outcomes, and as such, from 2015, all localities started to adopt the new water pricing system for China.",13,751,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00751

2017-03-01-T-011,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"The next is the diesel tax. This is another inflationary impact on the people and on businesses as a whole. There are about 185,000 Singapore-registered diesel vehicles on the roads. They account for about 20% of vehicle population in 2015. Most are trucks, vans and commercial vehicles, rather than passenger cars. What can we expect? Another round of price increases by transport operators including school bus transport for school children? Many businesses use their vehicles to transport workers and equipment to and from worksites. Not just that, but many of the diesel vehicles are used for transporting and delivering goods, from wholesalers to retailers, from retailers to consumers especially for online purchases as well. These are diesel vans that are used for various purposes, as handymen also use them for delivery for plumbing services, carpentry and electrical services, even delivery of LPG gas to homes and eateries. I am worried that we may see an uptick in their fees when they are called upon now to do minor repairs for our households.",15,753,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00753

I know the Budget is giving help to businesses to adjust by providing commercial diesel vehicles with a 100% road tax rebate for one year, and a partial road tax rebate for another two years. There is an additional cash rebate for operators for diesel buses ferrying school children. I think we should reduce the road tax for diesel vehicle further to be on par with petrol vehicles. What will the Government be doing to ensure that all these rebates will be filtered down to the consumers?",16,754,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00754

I am deeply concerned about the impending carbon tax that has just been announced for 2019 which the Finance Minister mentioned. Although the proposed tax will generally apply upstream on power stations and other large direct emitters, it will have a knock-on effect on all electric users both domestic and commercial. We signed the Paris Agreement on climate change at the UN last April, and affirmed our support and commitment to the Agreement. Singapore ranks 123rd in emissions intensity out of 142 countries worldwide, but promised that the country will ""continue to do more"" to quote the MFA statement. The introduction of a carbon tax in 2019 is a good move to stay in step with international standards on environmental conservation. We pledged to reduce emission intensity by 36% from 2005 levels by 2030 and stabilise emissions with the aim of peaking around 2030. It is still in the early days, but I would like to know, what is the Government's take on how challenging it will be to meet this goal?",18,756,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00756

There will be a new Vehicular Emissions Scheme. The new scheme considers four other pollutants on top of carbon dioxide, so as to account more holistically for the health and environmental impact of vehicular emissions. The Budget states that the new Vehicular Emissions Scheme will run for two years, starting from 1 January next year and will be reviewed before it expires. In the interim, the CEVS will be extended till 31 December this year. How bad are we performing or how good are we performing, in terms of the area of carbon emission? How much more carbon have we emitted over the past two decades? Taking into account that we are a very small country with very limited potential to tap on renewable energy, what can we do to reduce our carbon emission? Is the Government considering the introduction of a Climate Bill in tackling this carbon tax?",19,757,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00757
2017-03-01-T-011,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"I feel that we should spend more resources to explore the use of solar energy. There is a lot of scope and potential for us now to tap on solar energy as the cost of solar panels has reduced over the years. Another positive outcome of implementing carbon tax would be that it serves as a motivation for companies and businesses to innovate with cleaner, greener energy sources. I hope the Government can use the revenue collected under this carbon tax to help businesses with this endeavour and also promote green innovation.",20,758,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00758
2017-03-01-T-011,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"I think solar technology is something that we should tap on a larger scale. May I ask what is what is the Government doing to encourage and incentivise commercial, domestic and public sectors to harness the potential source of renewable energy so as to lower our carbon footprint? We should also look at how to help home owners to use solar energy. And Town Councils should look at this as a source of energy for future.",21,759,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00759
2017-03-01-T-011,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"My last point − learning from overseas globalisation. In a globalised society, it is important to be exposed to foreign countries, whether it is culture, education system, the job market and so forth. I note that the Budget presents a slew of measures, under the Global Innovation Alliance to help businesses and employees to operate overseas. One such measure is helping students in Singapore universities getting work experience in foreign start-ups.",22,760,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00760
2017-03-01-T-011,Lim Wee Kiak,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"I would like to propose to the Government to help local universities to establish tie-ups with universities in Europe. This is a region with huge cultural diversity. They are also accomplished in many important sectors, including technology, finance, medicine, the arts, and so on. We should explore student exchange programmes with Grandes Ã‰coles in France, and also many other design and engineering institutions in Germany and Scandinavian universities which are also known for their innovation. In INSEAD Global Innovation Index 2016, Switzerland was ranked first, Sweden was ranked second, the UK was third, with the USA fourth and Finland fifth, and Singapore, the sixth. Currently, many university courses offer exchange programmes, but these programmes are often short term with a focus on academics. I hope partnerships can be developed with the aim of helping students establishing a longer term residence and also obtaining residency in terms of internship programmes and job opportunities in their host country",23,761,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00761

2017-03-01-T-011,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Sir, at first glance, the new ARF regime for motorcycles appears to be an additional tax imposed by the Government on higher end, more expensive motorcycles. Motorcycles with an OMV, or Open Market Value, in excess of $10,000 are liable to pay additional ARF on a 100% basis for every dollar above $10,000. This is in addition to the $3,250 that is now payable on the first $10,000.",7,788,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00788
2017-03-01-T-011,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),This represents a significant increase in price for higher end motorcycles. There have already been media reports that estimate that this will put prices of higher end motorcycles close to that of small cars.,8,789,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00789
2017-03-01-T-011,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Motorcycle enthusiasts say that they have been unfairly ""targeted"" by the revised ARF regime.

2017-03-01-T-011,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"The gist of their argument is clear. Motorcyclists who purchase higher end motorcycles come from all walks of life with varying financial means. Owners of super cars, however, belong to the top 0.1% of income earners in Singapore. As such, why not increase the ARF regime on consumers who can better afford to pay?",10,791,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00791

2017-03-01-T-011,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Minister Heng alluded to two reasons in his Budget Statement for the revised ARF regime for motorcycles. First, that there is a small but rising number of motorcyclists buying expensive motorcycles, and, second, after the change in the ARF regime, more than half of motorcycle buyers will continue to pay the current ARF rate of 15%.",12,793,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00793
2017-03-01-T-011,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"The inference is clear. The rising number of motorcyclists buying expensive motorcycles is pushing up the overall costs of all motorcycles. The rising trend of COE prices for motorcycles bear this out. COE prices have risen from $889 in January 2010 to $6,412 in February 2017 ‒ a multiple of more than six times in seven years.",13,794,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00794

2017-03-01-T-011,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"The revised ARF, therefore, serves this further purpose ‒ to reduce the demand for expensive motorcycles and, consequently, to lower motorcycle COE prices and lower cost for purchasers of smaller motorcycles.",15,796,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00796
2017-03-01-T-011,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Sir, the restructuring of the diesel tax is another controversial item for transport in this year's Budget Statement. Reducing reliance on diesel fuel to reduce pollution is an admirable objective. However, this policy has drawn considerable concern from some quarters. The loudest voice amongst them belongs to the class who consumes automotive diesel to make a living. Taxi drivers make up a significant group in this class.",16,797,2017-03-01-T-011-S-00797
2017-03-01-T-011,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Taxi drivers consume a larger quantity of diesel fuel than all other diesel-run automotive because they travel around continuously to pick up customers.

2017-03-01-T-011,Sitoh Yih Pin,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"The Government has offset this with a permanent reduction of the Special Tax for taxis.

2017-03-01-T-013,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"The near term measures announced in this Budget, together with existing schemes, are helpful in relieving some of the living cost pressures. But I hope the Government will do more by proactively identifying families showing signs of distress, such as escalating arrears in rent, utilities and Service & Conservancy Charges (S&CC). Identifying distressed families early will allow the appropriate interventions to be made in a timely manner before the situation gets out of hand, when it would be even more challenging to resolve.",7,811,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00811
2017-03-01-T-013,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Over the years, I have seen families coming to seek help only after their arrears have compounded for many, many months. By then, the interest would have compounded, late payment penalties would have been slapped on and, perhaps, some families would have even taken personal loans which would just only add on to the liabilities that the family faces. Some of these families did not know that help was available, some simply panicked and went into denial when they saw their escalating arrears. And some were struggling to juggle multiple jobs and did not even have time to seek help. Hence, proactively seeking them out and offering timely interventions will help Singaporeans to focus on their jobs or studies, both of which are essential in ensuring their families' long-term independence and success.",8,812,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00812

Even as we transform and apply resources to transforming our economy and workforce, let us not forget to take steps to help elderly Singaporeans live well into their old age.

Not forgetting, infrastructural spending will also have to increase as we accommodate an ageing population. These translate into greater cost burden on working Singaporeans in the future.",11,815,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00815
2017-03-01-T-013,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"We cannot be building new nursing homes or hiring new people to do the caring on an indefinite basis. It is unsustainable and neither is it the best solution. But the demand for institutional care for elderly, including elderly who can actually be independent with a little bit more support in the community, keeps rising, partly because of shrinking family sizes and partly because of the changing family values. Therefore, we need to change our thinking about eldercare, and there are several points that I would like to raise in this respect.",12,816,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00816
2017-03-01-T-013,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"First, on manpower. The Ministry of Health has estimated that it would need an additional of about 30,000 more healthcare workers by 2020, and of this 30,000, about one-third is estimated to be dedicated towards the aged care sector.",13,817,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00817
2017-03-01-T-013,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Currently, in 2015, about 75% of the healthcare workforce are Singaporeans. But looking ahead, as we need more healthcare workers with this projected increase of 30,000, I wonder if we can continue to maintain this 75% from now till 2020 and beyond?",14,818,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00818
2017-03-01-T-013,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"With more Singaporeans leaving than entering the labour market, will we have enough to meet the rising demand for eldercare? How many and for how long more can we top up with foreign manpower? Could we find ways to recruit more volunteers and organise ourselves in the community better so that the community can step in to supplement manpower demand and fulfil needs?",15,819,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00819
2017-03-01-T-013,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Second, on Digital Eldercare.

2017-03-01-T-013,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"We should consider leverage more on technology. As it is, we know that there are technology solutions such as sensors, assistive devices and telemedicine. Leverage technology to enable independent living at home, even for those who have moderate disabilities and little or no family support. There are already pilots being done with the deployment of the Elderly Monitoring System (EMS), for example. But this is just one aspect of an elderly's daily living. Could we look into a more concerted, holistic concept of using digital technology to enable independent living for elderly? Some solutions are still being developed. Could we then accelerate the lab-to-market process? Could the Government take a point position and lead a nation-wide implementation of smart homes for seniors? Could we facilitate the integration of these solutions, so that the elderly can enjoy the services at home in an easy and seamless manner?",17,821,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00821
2017-03-01-T-013,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"In addition to enabling a more independent living for elderly at home and ageing in place, we should also consider providing and encouraging the provision of digital platforms to link freelance healthcare professionals and care-givers, or those with spare capacity, to facilitate on-demand provision of home care or other related elder care services. With the emerging gig economy, such platforms are the next new norm. But some of these platforms are privately run and elderly who wish to utilise them may be deterred for fear that the subsidies that they may be eligible for cannot be applied via these platforms. Therefore, could the Government look into enabling this?",18,822,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00822
2017-03-01-T-013,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"So, instead of investing money on building new institutions, could we redirect some of this investment to enable more elderly to live independently in their own homes, so that they can continue to go about their daily lives, continue to be part of the neighbourhood that they are so familiar with, and truly age in place?

It is not possible to predict what tomorrow will be like. Singapore is a small red dot. Of course we cannot change the world based on our efforts alone. We can only go with the flow. However, we are not completely helpless. We can help equip companies and our people with the means and capability to keep up with the change. This year's Budget, which will help companies continue their transformation and the people to upskill, is one that takes care of our long-term interests. However, as the Government is working very hard to build our economy for tomorrow, I hope that the Government will not forget to continue assisting Singaporeans who need help, so that they can also keep up with the economy and continue on this journey together.",20,824,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00824
2017-03-01-T-013,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Let me now talk about our care of the elderly. As our society ages rapidly, our needs on this front will increase dramatically. Medical costs and infrastructure expenditure will inevitably rise. Rather than regarding these as costs that cannot be recouped, why do we not look at how we can help the elderly live more meaningfully? For example, the Government can quicken the pace of building smart homes for the elderly and promote technologies that the elderly will find friendly to use. This will allow the elderly, even those who are not very mobile or in good health or live alone, to continue to live independently and age in place. The Government should also expand programmes similar to that of the Pioneer Generation Ambassadors, to encourage more elderly to be volunteers as well. As they become active in voluntary work, they will also keep their mind and body healthy. The elderly will not only live well but will also help ease the manpower shortages in the community. This will help ease our own worries and allow us to concentrate on working hard for our future. As the saying goes, having an elderly person at home is like having a treasure in the house. This also holds true for the community.",21,825,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00825
2017-03-01-T-013,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"(In English)  The Government clearly can do much to address the challenges we face and the needs we have. However, relying on the Government alone is not enough. Manpower shortage cuts across various sectors. Even with new workforce entrants, there will always be a stiff competition for manpower. There is demand for people in industries that drive Singapore's economic development and there is also demand for people in sectors that provide care for people. With the manpower shortage, what gives?",22,826,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00826
2017-03-01-T-013,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"The community has so far demonstrated how we can organise ourselves and achieve many things without over-relying on the Government or basically, paid workers. If manpower shortage is likely to be permanent and there are still needs to be addressed, perhaps we should look more to the community as a new resource pool − gig volunteers, perhaps?",23,827,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00827
2017-03-01-T-013,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"We have residents who have diverse sets of skills and knowledge and they may also have the capacity outside of work and family time to help. Can we leverage on them more? How can we rally them together and better organise ourselves to address unfulfilled needs? For example, can young retirees who drive help to ferry the older and frailer seniors to their medical appointments? Can housewives with spare capacity help to fetch children whose families are for some reason unavailable to and from school? Can well-performing students help to run enrichment and reading programmes for children of low-income or dysfunctional families on a weekly basis? Can physically fit residents form Citizens on Patrol to ensure the security, peace and quiet of the neighbourhood? Can neighbours step forth and be ready to respond to calls for help through the Elderly Monitoring System? These are not difficult things to do but impactful if done.",24,828,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00828
2017-03-01-T-013,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Of course, these propositions are impositions on Singaporeans who may prefer spending more time on activities they enjoy. But if everyone could just set aside a little of their time for the community, we will have a wealthy bank of volunteer man-hours and, in turn, achieve much more than what we see in the community today. Perhaps, on top of the grants to charities and schemes to encourage donations, we need to identify areas of unfulfilled needs, clearly articulate the roles that volunteers can assume, and devise a better way of recognising individual efforts in the community so that Singaporeans will find no reason to say no.",25,829,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00829
2017-03-01-T-013,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"There is much that we can do at the Government level and across the different sectors of our society. But, ultimately, it is also the individual willingness of Singaporeans to do something, to give our best shot, that will keep the momentum going and make the difference. Our economy, our security, our defence − all of these need each and every one of us to work together in order to succeed. And, most importantly, if we truly desire a caring and inclusive society, then let us show it through our actions. Let us give Singapore our best shot.",26,830,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00830

2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Mr Deputy Speaker, this Budget follows closely after the report by the Committee on the Future Economy. In the course of our five decades since independence, we had to reinvent ourselves many times, with the Government playing a pro-active role in enabling the process. The CFE Report marks the plan for the next phase of our development.",1,832,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00832
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The focus of the CFE is rightly on economic growth, as this is the only way to meet the expectations of our future generations for better jobs and opportunities in an increasingly competitive and volatile global landscape.",2,833,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00833
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The CFE includes a broad range of plans to ensure Singapore remains linked to the global economy, our people develop the deeps skills needed to stay relevant, and our enterprises develop the means to compete. There are roadmaps tailored for the different industries, too. All these are welcome, and I look forward to the upcoming initiatives and changes to execute against the plans by the CFE.",3,834,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00834
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Equally important though is to ensure that our growth is equitable and sustainable, and, on this, I would like to deal with a few matters.",4,835,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00835
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The first is a sustainable fiscal base. In this Budget, we already see some of the strains that will face us in coming years. Our spending on a wide range of areas is expected to rise, including, in particular, on health and social spending as our population ages. At the same time, our working population is likely to fall, creating a double whammy as our income tax base grows narrower and our spending needs rise.",5,836,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00836
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"There are also limits to how much we can raise taxes, as we need to remain attractive as a business destination for the best companies and global corporations can simply choose to do business elsewhere if Singapore becomes unattractive, relative to other destinations.",6,837,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00837
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"We, therefore, have to be very prudent in our spending. Many sectors, for example, SMEs were also expecting more support from the Government. While I fully support the Government helping businesses to tide over difficult times, I am concerned about subsidies becoming entrenched.",7,838,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00838
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In many other countries, subsidies to different sectors of the economy become entrenched, allowing them to continue operating inefficiently and preventing the redeployment of resources to sectors where they are more likely to produce more value.",8,839,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00839
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In fact, I think the only principal justification for a subsidy to any segment is if greater welfare arises from that subsidy. Thus, if giving a business a small subsidy to tide over a difficult cyclical setback prevents substantial numbers of jobs being lost, then it is probably defensible. In short, there should be what are called positive externalities arising from Government support to businesses and not just private profit for the business itself.",9,840,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00840
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Let me now touch on three very specific measures that relate to this. The first is support for seniors. In this context, one of the schemes that I support in principle is the Special Employment Credit scheme which encourages the employment of older workers. With the rising quality of healthcare, many of our workers are able to work even though they are older and, often, it is with some sadness that older employees tell me they have been ""retired"" by their companies.",10,841,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00841
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The unspoken reason for this is often higher costs associated with hiring older workers, particularly in relation to matters, such as workplace insurance, as well as the availability of younger and cheaper workers.",11,842,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00842
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Yet, there are numerous benefits with allowing older workers to continue working for as long as they wish. For the individuals, it allows them to remain economically active and independent, and there many studies showing that there are mental and physical health benefits for seniors who remain active in the workplace. From the country's perspective, this would ameliorate the strain on our fiscal base as economically active seniors will remain more able to take care of themselves.",12,843,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00843
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Indeed, I would go even further on this front and suggest that both the Government and the unions look into the specific concerns employers have to employing older workers so as to eliminate structural factors contributing to age discrimination as much as possible in the work place. Ultimately, it is my hope that older workers will be more able to stop work at a time of their choosing, rather than being forced into retirement that may be against their will.",13,844,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00844
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The second aspect of the Budget that I am heartened by is the manner in which it deals with environmental concerns. In fact, this Budget specifically takes into account environmental consequences. One of the fundamental causes of environmental pollution and damage is that businesses, in their determination to maximise profits, do not adequately take into account the damage caused to the environment by their business practices.",14,845,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00845
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The costs of environmental damage and pollution are often felt by the entire community, while the profit is enjoyed by the businesses themselves. This is a classic example of what economists call a ""negative externality"" where society pays the price that is higher than the benefit the company receives.",15,846,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00846
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"A carbon tax is one way to ensure that businesses pay a price for polluting as well. This will, hopefully, incentivise businesses to innovate or invest in green technologies to reduce their carbon footprint. I am also heartened that the revenues raised from these taxes will be used to support the growth of green businesses, as this is one way of reducing the private costs for socially useful innovation, and if these technologies are effective, they could also be something else Singapore could export to other parts of the world.",16,847,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00847
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"One matter that has received a lot of attention is the rise in water prices. This has been extensively discussed in many forums as the headline rise of 30% was seen as high by many Singaporeans. Following clarifications, I think most households have realised that the net impact on them will be manageable. For example, I think people mostly understand now that for most people living in 1-room and 2-room flats, the average water bill will actually be lower by around $1 a month. For those living in 3-room flats, it may rise by around $2 a month; for those living in 4-room flats, around $5; and for those living in 5-room flats, around $8. So, although this is an increase, most people I have spoken to believe that this is manageable.",17,848,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00848
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Everyone also agrees that water is a precious resource for Singapore and people should be encouraged to conserve as much water as possible. While nobody likes to pay more for water, I think everyone agrees in principle that water must be priced at a level that is sustainable for Singapore in the long term.",18,849,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00849
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"One suggestion I have in this regard is whether we can relook at water pricing to make it more flexible, so that, like energy prices, it, too, may go up or down depending on the costs of production. This may mean that we have small gradual increases every year, rather than a one-off lump sum increase after 17 years.",19,850,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00850
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In fact, anecdotally, a few people I have spoken to were actually surprised that their water bill had not increased in 17 years. As many people received their water and power bills together, they had assumed that both prices were going up when, in fact, it was only the power component that was changing and the water component had remained the same in their bills for the last 17 years. So, what I would suggest is, in order to prevent sticker shock or surprise every 17 or 20 years, as the case may be, that we find a way to make the water price more flexible as well so that people can adjust their consumption patterns along with the rising cost, and our usage of water will remain sustainable.",20,851,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00851
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"One last area I wish to touch on is added support for parenthood. I should declare my interest here as I recently joined the Club of Parents with my first child, and I have to say that it is a wonderful joy to be a parent. But the reality is that many young people hesitate in taking the step both towards marriage and towards becoming parents, and the demographic time bomb I mentioned is a very real one, and the best way to diffuse it or at least reduce some of the pressures on it is to encourage more people to take on the challenge of becoming parents.",21,852,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00852
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The other benefit, of course, apart from the personal joy of becoming a parent is that society as a whole benefits because, ultimately, the children are the ones who will take Singapore forward over the next 30 or 50 years, and they will be the ones to support the older generations, to support us when we are no longer able to work.",22,853,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00853
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"And there are tremendous benefits to society for encouraging parenthood. Of course, with parenthood, the economic issues are a bit reversed because the cost of parenting is largely borne by the individuals themselves, whereas the benefits are not only to the individuals but also to society as a whole. This is why I have always believed there are strong justifications for socialising the cost of parenthood more.",23,854,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00854
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"There are many measures in place already, assisting parents to defray the cost somewhat. But there is always more that can be done, in particular, childcare is one of the areas where there is a great deal of demand. And if you go before childcare, there is infant care. So, in this Budget, we have a doubling of places for infant care over the next four years, which is a measure I welcome. This will help to take more of the strain off working families and working parents and grandparents.",24,855,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00855
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"But as we go forward, my suspicion is that there will be a correlation between the more we socialise the cost of parenthood and the more willing people become to take this plunge. I think costs are often a consideration for people considering marriage and parenthood and, sometimes, there is misinformation about the costs as well. But in countries like France, which is one of the few developed countries where they do not have a major issue with the population, we find the cost of parenthood being heavily socialised. So, I think this is one area we can look more at in future Budgets as well.",25,856,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00856
2017-03-01-T-013,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Broadly speaking, Mr Deputy Speaker, I think this Budget will put Singapore on the right foundation for sustainable growth in the coming years.

2017-03-01-T-013,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines),"MediShield Life, which currently covers all Singaporeans, has a deductible and co-insurance portion. In recent years, more Singaporeans are enhancing their coverage with Integrated Shield Plans (IPs) for additional private insurance. Riders are available to cover both the deductible and co-insurance portion.",7,868,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00868
2017-03-01-T-013,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines),Here comes a potential problem  are Singaporeans with better IP coverage more likely to spend substantially more and consume more healthcare than those who merely have basic MediShield coverage? Let me give you two examples.,8,869,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00869
2017-03-01-T-013,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines),"A resident in his 40s, recently hurt his knee while playing soccer. He was sent for an MRI scan at a reputable private hospital. The scan revealed a Grade 1 sprain of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL). He was given two options by the doctor. One, was to undergo physiotherapy. Two, he could go for a relatively quick minor keyhole surgery with a night stay in an A-class ward. He went for the second option − Surgery. The bill came up to $24,000. He paid nothing because he had an IP rider.",9,870,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00870
2017-03-01-T-013,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines),"Another spoke of his father's cataract day surgery for one eye. He showed me the bill. The MOH website shows that the 75th percentile bill size in private hospital for this surgery is between $4,000 and $9,000. His bill was $27,000. I verified with two other eye specialists and they commented that from the bill, it looks like a standard cataract surgery. I am afraid some people might wonder, if doctors are charging more because the insurance companies are footing the bill, and not the patients. With IP riders and patients paying next to zero dollars, the patients are less likely to scrutinise their bills as thoroughly and this is not helpful.",10,871,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00871
2017-03-01-T-013,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines),"I do not doubt that doctors are specialist in their field and do offer the best medical advice. My point here, is not to question their competence. It is also not a bad thing if wider and more comprehensive health insurance means patients could have more treatment options. What worries me is that additional treatment options are sometimes made available to the patients not because they are essential but because the patients are now able to afford them; thanks to their insurance coverage. If this happens on a large scale, will this over-burden our healthcare system and infrastructure, and increase costs? Over-consumption and increased medical cost will definitely lead to an increase in insurance premiums.",11,872,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00872
2017-03-01-T-013,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines),"Another concern will be, is this result in a widening of disparity between private and public hospital bills? If so, this disparity might cause more people to shift to public hospitals, leading to overcrowding and longer waits. May I therefore suggest that the Government look into the following? One, have more checks in place to control healthcare cost inflation. I understand there is no straightforward and easy solution. Perhaps the Ministry of Health and Singapore Medical Council can study and regulate doctors' fees and hospital charges. Two, educate patients on healthcare options so they can be more discerning in their choices. Three, improve hospital productivity. During last year's Budget debate, I spoke about coordinated care. We should streamline some of this care from hospitals to primary care for more efficiency and effectiveness. Our family doctors can play a greater role in the long-term care of the patient.",12,873,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00873

You do not care about the facts of the policies − debates over what makes sense or does not make sense is all Greek to you.

I would like to request for additional course subsidies for them, on top of the SkillsFuture Credit, because many of them do not have much savings and would hesitate to ask for money from their husbands or children to attend classes. This is typical behaviour for many homemakers who are used to putting the needs and wants of their family members above their own. Since they have already embraced personal responsibility in picking up new skills, let us help them by lowering the barriers to learning as much as possible.",17,976,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00976

It is not easy to convince some of them that learning is good for their mental and emotional health, and would enhance their quality of life. How do we motivate them and get them excited about trying out new things? I hope the Government will conduct a study into the psyche of our local elderly to find what motivates them so that we can use the information to formulate attractive ways to run our courses.",18,977,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00977

Both companies have been viewed as disruptors in their sector. It would be good if they would consider giving back to the community through volunteer services such as driving vulnerable seniors to and back from hospitals or dialysis centres. This is already done by taxi companies such as ComfortDelgro that have programmes in place to provide ferrying services for the elderly and the disabled. Grab and Uber should likewise consider doing so, and the Agency for Integrated Care can work with these car hiring companies to make good use of their spare capacities, instead of relying solely on ambulances.

He also said that the healthcare spending will continue to rise as our population ages. Elderly healthcare costs here are projected to rise 10 times over the next 15 years to more than $66 billion annually. This means an average of $45,000 will be spent on healthcare for each senior by 2030. This is according to a report by Marsh & McLennan. This estimate also assumes that there will be continued ready access to cheap foreign labour, which may not be the case in the future. So, going forward, how do we care for our seniors better and at the same time reduce this steep cost curve. Let me suggest the following ways.",6,985,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00985
2017-03-01-T-013,Lily Neo,Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar),"The concept I am suggesting is based on the tenet of prevention is better than cure. In this instance, it means it is better to prevent mobility difficulty and maintain independence, rather than treating the disability. For example, it is better to prevent fall and getting fractures, or having uncontrolled hypertension and getting strokes, rather than curing the fractures and strokes to gain back independence. The purpose is to facilitate independent living for the seniors, till ripe old age, in their usual dwelling places, without having to be admitted to nursing homes, community or acute hospitals. Presently, this is the only option available for many, although not all of them require the intensive nursing care. This is a pity, as it is not making wise use of our limited resources, which are increasingly expensive. Many older adults express the desire to age-in-place for as long as possible. Thus, the aim is to enable seniors to age gracefully in their own homes despite their frailty or medical conditions by preventing disability and to better manage disability.",7,986,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00986
2017-03-01-T-013,Lily Neo,Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar),"How do we prevent disability among our seniors? The most common causes of disability among older adults are chronic diseases, injuries, mental impairment and visual impairment. Physical activities and keeping active can make our seniors stronger and lower their chances of falling, reducing fractures and injuries that result in disability. It is never too late to exercise even for seniors. The good control of chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes can prevent disability such as stroke. Regular eye check-ups for seniors to diagnose cataracts and other visual impairments for early treatment. Facilitating social wellness to seniors helps prevent mental illness such as depression that can cause disability. All the above should be practised as early as possible before disability sets in.",8,987,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00987

2017-03-01-T-013,Lily Neo,Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar),"Technology-assisted centralised-control health monitoring can be deployed to check on the well-being of seniors. These monitors can screen many seniors for hypertension, pulse rate or heart rate, temperature and so on, from seniors wearing medical technology wrist-bands. Monitoring devices using advanced sound event technology and long-range passive infrared motion sensors, to detect abnormal sounds and motions inside the house are useful for detecting falls at home. Remote monitoring systems allow the care required by seniors to be significantly reduced, alerting caregivers to intervene early when necessary. The ideal scenario is to have one central monitor overseeing hundreds, if not thousands of residents. The main aim is to have good preventive medicine in detecting emergency health conditions and preventing disability. Information technology can ensure a real time flow of data between care recipients and providers and make administration, record keeping and reporting of data more efficient.",10,989,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00989

The suggestion is to help seniors overcome their intrinsic disability through either the removal of environmental barriers or the provision of environmental modifications. The environmental hazards at home are situated about 60% in the bathrooms and 40% in the other rooms. Common hazards are the absence of grab bars in the bathrooms, dim lighting, slippery tiles, and absence of kitchen work surface at a height suitable for sitting and so on. The use of smart technology is useful for a safe kitchen that will help seniors to function with automatic turn-off for stoves and other electrical appliances. Thus, modifications and adaptations of the home environment or elderly-smart home for those with disability, according to the individual's need, will improve functional ability-related outcomes.",13,992,2017-03-01-T-013-S-00992

Today, those living alone with no family members to depend on are the ones that usually require nursing homes when they face disability. In 2012, about 7% of seniors older than 65, or 35,000 seniors, live alone. This will go up to about 90,000 by 2030. Living alone per se may not be such a bad thing.

Instead of using the whole high rise blocks, using the lower half of the blocks will suffice for ease of service delivery. The upper block of flats can still be used for younger families and so on. The ground floors of such flats should cater for community services, for example senior activity centre to enable those well seniors to come down daily for physical, social and mental wellness to prevent disability, and to monitor their chronic diseases. This venue also serves as a coordinating centre, enabling concept partners like the grassroots organisations, VWOs and various corporations to volunteer their services.

When this process starts and ends with a social problem, then a new vicious social problem cycle exists and even starts, unless we intervene. Simply saying, a family with a sound and stable financial position will have a better chance to be not dysfunctional, hence will also mean a higher chance to stay out of the social problems, hence lower social issues.

However, we have to accept that as a developed economy with labour force constraints, our target long-term growth of between 2% and 3% will be slower than what we have experienced in the past. Against a backdrop of slower growth and thus flat Government revenue, our spending on Infrastructure, health and social support have increased and will continue to increase significantly especially as the baby boomer generation is reaching their 60s and 70s.",2,1029,2017-03-01-T-013-S-01029
2017-03-01-T-013,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),Minister Heng mentioned that additional investment in our public transport infrastructure is expected to cost the Government more than $20 billion over the next five years. Our annual healthcare spending has more than doubled over the past five years to around $10 billion a year.,3,1030,2017-03-01-T-013-S-01030
2017-03-01-T-013,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Over the past few years, we have also introduced and strengthened various social support schemes, all of which are necessary and welcomed by residents. For instance, the Silver Support Scheme, which gives up to $750 every three months to the elderly, has really helped reduce hardship for some of our most vulnerable elderly staying in 1- to 2-room flats.",4,1031,2017-03-01-T-013-S-01031
2017-03-01-T-013,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"The truth is our overall expenditures will continue to grow with an ageing population and we have to prepare for it. As a responsible and prudent Government, we must maintain a balanced budget and ensure that the Government's revenue can match the increasing social and health spending as our population ages.",5,1032,2017-03-01-T-013-S-01032
2017-03-01-T-013,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"As Minister Heng mentioned in his speech, we may have to raise revenues through new taxes or raise tax rates in future to meet the rising domestic expenditure needs.",6,1033,2017-03-01-T-013-S-01033
2017-03-01-T-013,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"On this front, I would like to talk about our stamp duties related to residential properties, which I believe there is room for us to be more progressive.",7,1034,2017-03-01-T-013-S-01034
2017-03-01-T-013,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Buyers of residential properties are required to pay Buyer's Stamp Duty. There is also Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty, or ABSD, which was introduced in December 2011 and revised upwards in January 2013 to cool the residential market.",8,1035,2017-03-01-T-013-S-01035
2017-03-01-T-013,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Sir, I have two suggestions for consideration. First, I would like to suggest replacing the ABSD with a tiered Buyer's Stamp Duty. I understand that the objective of ABSD is to moderate demand for residential properties, and to promote a stable and sustainable property market. Private residential prices in Singapore have slipped for 13th straight quarters and have fallen by 3% last year.",9,1036,2017-03-01-T-013-S-01036
2017-03-01-T-013,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Because the ABSD scheme is seen as a cooling measure, it is viewed as a temporary measure which will be removed when the market has indeed softened. But we always run the risk that the property market may spike up when ABSD is removed.",10,1037,2017-03-01-T-013-S-01037
2017-03-01-T-013,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Sir, to solve this conundrum, my suggestion is to remove the ABSD for Singapore citizens and add an additional tier to the Buyer's Stamp Duty. ABSD for non-citizens should remain but be adjusted to take into account the revised tiering of Buyer's Stamp Duty.",11,1038,2017-03-01-T-013-S-01038
2017-03-01-T-013,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Allow me to explain. As it stands, the rates for Buyer's Stamp Duty is computed on the purchase price or market value of the property, whichever is higher. The Buyer's Stamp Duty rate for the first $180,000 is 1%, followed by 2% for the next $180,000. Stamp duty payable for amounts above $360,000 is 3%.",12,1039,2017-03-01-T-013-S-01039
2017-03-01-T-013,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"I would like to suggest adding an additional tier of 10% for transaction value above $1 million. With the higher threshold of $1 million, I believe this will not significantly affect most middle income families and HDB upgraders. This would also be similar to having ABSD of 7% on top of the current Buyer's Stamp Duty of 3%. This change would also be seen as a permanent change to the stamp duties structure rather than the current ABSD scheme which is seen as a temporary scheme.",13,1040,2017-03-01-T-013-S-01040
2017-03-01-T-013,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Sir, my second suggestion is for the Government to review its concept of ownership on residential properties which currently only applies to the registered owner but not the beneficial owner.",14,1041,2017-03-01-T-013-S-01041
2017-03-01-T-013,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Currently, if a residential property is held under a special purpose vehicle, or SPV, and if the SPV is transferred from seller to buyer, normal residential stamp duty is not payable. This is because the registered owner of the residential property still remains as the SPV and does not change. I think this is an anomaly which needs to be addressed since for all intents and purposes the beneficial interest of the property has changed hands.",15,1042,2017-03-01-T-013-S-01042
2017-03-01-T-013,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"In this type of situation, not only does the buyer of the SPV avoid paying Buyer's Stamp Duty and Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty, he also avoids paying Seller's Stamp Duty which would have been payable if the new buyer then flips out the underlying residential properties within the four-year period.",16,1043,2017-03-01-T-013-S-01043
2017-03-01-T-013,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Most of the time, transactions of such nature are carried out by property developers and property investment companies, and this change is unlikely to affect individual buyers and sellers of residential properties.",17,1044,2017-03-01-T-013-S-01044
2017-03-01-T-013,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Moreover, the nature of such stamp duties is that they are discretionary in nature as buyers and sellers already know the stamp duties payable beforehand and would have a choice of whether to enter into the property transaction.",18,1045,2017-03-01-T-013-S-01045
2017-03-01-T-013,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"I hope that with these additional revenue sources, we will not need to increase other taxes which may impact low- to middle income families.",19,1046,2017-03-01-T-013-S-01046
2017-03-01-T-013,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Sir, in conclusion, the initiatives for Budget 2017 are balanced and forward-looking, but we need to see how we can meet the fiscal challenges ahead while minimising the tax burden on the man in the street.
