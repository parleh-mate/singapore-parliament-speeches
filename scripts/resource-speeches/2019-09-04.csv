2019-09-04-T-001,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng,asked the Minister for Law (a) what is the income criterion for citizens seeking pro-bono legal services from the Legal Aid Bureau; (b) what are the avenues by which average-income families can access legal services at an affordable cost especially if they do not qualify for the pro-bono legal services; and (c) whether the Ministry can communicate these avenues of access to all citizens.,1,1,2019-09-04-T-001-S-00001
2019-09-04-T-001,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Minister for Law),"Mr Deputy Speaker, an applicant must be a Citizen or a Permanent Resident of Singapore to qualify for civil legal aid. The qualifying criteria for legal aid are two-fold. First, the applicant must satisfy the means test. Second, the applicant must show that he or she has a good reason to bring or defend the case under the law, otherwise known as the merits test.",1,2,2019-09-04-T-001-S-00002
2019-09-04-T-001,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Minister for Law),"To pass the current means test, an applicant’s disposable income cannot be more than S$10,000 per year and his disposal capital cannot be more than S$10,000.",2,3,2019-09-04-T-001-S-00003
2019-09-04-T-001,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Minister for Law),"Last November, Parliament passed the Legal Aid and Advice (Amendment) Bill. MinLaw intends to adopt the Per Capita Household Income (PCHI) and the Annual Value of the applicant’s residence, savings and investments, as the new criteria to replace disposable income and disposable capital. The changes will simplify the means test, align the criteria with those under other social support schemes and shorten the application process time. There will be no material impact on the number of households eligible for legal aid provided by the Legal Aid Bureau. The Bill also gives us greater flexibility to help applicants with extenuating circumstances. So, there is an element of discretion that is built into the amendment Bill, as the Member might recall from the debate. We target to announce the detailed means criteria and effect the changes by the end of this year.",3,4,2019-09-04-T-001-S-00004
2019-09-04-T-001,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Minister for Law),"Applicants who fail the means test may seek help from the Law Society Pro Bono Services, the Community Justice Centre and more than 50 other legal clinics run by various community, religious and voluntary welfare organisations.",4,5,2019-09-04-T-001-S-00005
2019-09-04-T-001,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai) (for the Minister for Law),"The Ministry provides applicants who do not qualify for the means test, as well as members of the public who enquire about avenues of legal assistance, with a list of legal clinics and online resources which the applicants may use to find a suitable lawyer.",5,6,2019-09-04-T-001-S-00006
2019-09-04-T-001,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for his response and for being always very helpful when we write in for such support. My question is this  the current access to legal aid seems to be very limited for many of our residents, especially for those who are not wealthy. Those who are very low-income have better access. Those who are wealthy probably do not need so much of this aid. But for those who are in the average income band, this is not so.",1,7,2019-09-04-T-001-S-00007
2019-09-04-T-001,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"I want to know if MinLaw would be able to provide even more details on how it will assist families with such needs, especially in areas like the Letter of Administration that is required when somebody passes away. Things like Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) and so forth. Is there a way, as technology advances, that we can offer more DIY help so that ""mortals"" like us can actually help them sign up for some of the required legal documentation?",2,8,2019-09-04-T-001-S-00008
2019-09-04-T-001,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I thank the Member for the comments. On the first point, certainly, with the advent of the amendments and the criteria that we will use, we expect that the process will be easier to use, simplified. And we believe also that with the discretion portion, that there will be a more judicious use of that discretion to apply to needy cases. So, there is a bit more latitude.",1,9,2019-09-04-T-001-S-00009
2019-09-04-T-001,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We expect, on our estimate, that with the new amendments, looking at the PCHI and the other criterion, that approximately 25% of all households in Singapore would qualify under that criteria. So, there is a fair breadth of coverage with the new means test in place.",2,10,2019-09-04-T-001-S-00010
2019-09-04-T-001,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On the Member's second point, I agree. And I think we previously said in this House that matters such as estate administration, especially for smaller estates where the value is not significant, sometimes, the cost of having to apply for the Letter of Administration outweighs the benefits. So, as I have said previously in this House, we are looking at ways of simplifying estate management and administration, including making the process a lot more straightforward. I am not sure if it can be DIY, but it will be a lot more straightforward so that it will be easier to manage, easier to navigate, and one does not have to incur significant resources to spend on getting the Letter of Administration.",3,11,2019-09-04-T-001-S-00011
2019-09-04-T-001,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"We are also looking at how to help families upstream in terms of the estate planning, upfront, before we even get to the stage. I have also previously announced that we have a Moments of Life portal. The beta version of that will be launched at the end of this year. There will be a lot more assistance and it is a lot more intuitive use of the portal to help families to navigate this process and also to make planning ahead of the End of Life moment.",4,12,2019-09-04-T-001-S-00012
2019-09-04-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"I just want to clarify – does the assistance rendered by the Legal Aid Bureau also extend to various miscellaneous administrative fees? For example, with certain court fees, does the Legal Aid Bureau extend financial aid to cover those fees as well? And if not, what avenues can the applicants go to, to get aid for those fees?",1,13,2019-09-04-T-001-S-00013
2019-09-04-T-001,Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"The Legal Aid Bureau looks at each case on its own merits. As I mentioned earlier, the criteria are set out there. We look at it in terms of valuing legal services, deciding what is the right kind of lawyer or legal assistance that is needed and this may on occasion also extend to the fees that are necessary. The bigger chunk of the resourcing that is needed, which Legal Aid Bureau helps with, would be the cost of the legal service as legal representation itself.",1,14,2019-09-04-T-001-S-00014
2019-09-04-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the current percentage of workers in the online food delivery industry who are foreigners; (b) how do the foreigners qualify to work in this industry; and (c) whether the Ministry will take steps to ensure that these jobs in the delivery services are restricted to only Singaporeans.,1,15,2019-09-04-T-002-S-00015
2019-09-04-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Deputy Speaker, it is illegal for foreigners to work as self-employed delivery riders for food delivery applications such as Deliveroo, Food Panda and Grab Food.",1,16,2019-09-04-T-002-S-00016
2019-09-04-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"MOM has taken action against social visit pass holders working illegally as self-employed food delivery riders. Under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, they can be fined a maximum of $20,000, or subjected to imprisonment of up to two years, or both. Anyone with information on such illegal workers should report this to MOM.",2,17,2019-09-04-T-002-S-00017
2019-09-04-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"I would like to ask the Minister of State, during the last three years, how many get caught? The second question is, my residents told me that quite often, they see persons on Malaysia-registered motorcycles delivering food. So, it looks like we need to step up enforcement. Because they are competing with our Singaporeans who are earning pocket money and those are our jobs. We do not need them to come here to moonlight or do things that are illegal. So, I would like to know how many have been caught and if residents see them delivering food, what can the public do? How can they report? And what actions will the Ministry take?",1,18,2019-09-04-T-002-S-00018
2019-09-04-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Sir, I thank the Member for her questions. In April this year, we caught two Malaysians who were working for the food delivery business. Both are being investigated, not prosecuted yet. So, I cannot give too much details of the cases. At the same time, regarding the Member's concerns, we need more people to report. If her residents come to know of such cases, please ask them to report to MOM. We will take action.",1,19,2019-09-04-T-002-S-00019
2019-09-04-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"As I mentioned earlier, those who are caught under the 	Employment of Foreign Manpower Act will face a $20,000 fine, or an imprisonment of two years. If the person is also abetting – as a Singaporean, allowing them to use your accounts – you can also be prosecuted and be fined a maximum of $20,000 as well as be subject to imprisonment of up to two years or both. Both offences carry the same terms.",2,20,2019-09-04-T-002-S-00020
2019-09-04-T-002,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,Perhaps the Minister of State can take this opportunity to advertise the telephone number to call.,1,21,2019-09-04-T-002-S-00021
2019-09-04-T-002,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,I think the Member can come to our website to find the number to call.,1,22,2019-09-04-T-002-S-00022
2019-09-04-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will consider making it mandatory for all bicycles and PMDs to be fitted with laser lights which project a symbol of a bicycle or PMD on to the path five metres ahead, to warn pedestrians that there is a cyclist or PMD approaching them.",1,23,2019-09-04-T-003-S-00023
2019-09-04-T-003,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Transport),"Mr Deputy Speaker, we require all bicycles and personal mobility devices (PMDs) that are used at night to display a white light in front and a red light at the back. If the rider of the PMD is unable to fit such lights onto the device, the requisite lights would have to be worn by the person. The purpose is to increase visibility of the rider to other path users.",1,24,2019-09-04-T-003-S-00024
2019-09-04-T-003,Lam Pin Min,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Transport),"We will study the practicality and effectiveness of the suggestion of using laser lights, bearing in mind the costs and safety implications.",2,25,2019-09-04-T-003-S-00025
2019-09-04-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, I do understand the cost implications. But I am just wondering whether we could start this with the delivery drivers. Because at night, the bulk of the PMDs on our paths are the delivery drivers when there is an increase in the number of food orders. A lot of the issues are with the delivery drivers. So, maybe, we can start with them, where the food delivery companies will bear some of the cost of installing these laser lights. I understand the white light as well, but that can only be seen when you are facing the PMD. What I am suggesting is the laser light, which means that even if the PMD is behind you, you can actually see your path, in front of you, that there is a PMD about to approach.",1,26,2019-09-04-T-003-S-00026
2019-09-04-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I actually experienced this in London, where it was very useful. All the time, I could see that there was going to be a bicycle that was approaching me and I can then take whatever necessary action to make sure that I do not get hit.",2,27,2019-09-04-T-003-S-00027
2019-09-04-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"I would like to thank Mr Louis Ng for the suggestion to extend that requirement, firstly, to a particular group of PMD users. Just to share with Mr Louis Ng, we did look at the initiatives that were implemented in London. We understand that the key benefit of the laser projection light is to aid on road cyclists, in their interactions with other motor vehicles that may have blind spots. In the context of Singapore, there are key considerations that we have to look into.",1,28,2019-09-04-T-003-S-00028
2019-09-04-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"First, there really has not been any conclusive study about laser projection lights' visibility and effectiveness on shared paths and footpaths. Bear in mind that what was done in London was actually on roads shared with motor vehicles.",2,29,2019-09-04-T-003-S-00029
2019-09-04-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Secondly, because Singapore is generally quite brightly lit, whether the laser projection light will be sufficiently visible and provide that kind of effectiveness to pedestrians, cyclists and drivers, is also something that we have to study carefully.",3,30,2019-09-04-T-003-S-00030
2019-09-04-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,"Thirdly, the glare from the laser beam. As we know, the laser beam is a Class 3A or 3R laser. There is a certain element of risk when it is shone into the eye. This could potentially harm path users, especially children who may be at that particular eye level with the laser projection.",4,31,2019-09-04-T-003-S-00031
2019-09-04-T-003,Lam Pin Min,Dr Lam Pin Min,We will definitely look at the suggestion and see whether it is indeed effective and worth implementing.,5,32,2019-09-04-T-003-S-00032
2019-09-04-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what proportion of Government documents that are more than 25 years old and hence are part of the public archives are contained in the publicly accessible NAS Archives Online; and (b) what proportion of Government documents declassified each year for the past five years have become part of the publicly accessible NAS Archives Online.,1,33,2019-09-04-T-004-S-00033
2019-09-04-T-004,Sim Ann,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Ms Sim Ann) (for the Minister for Communications and Information),"Currently, the National Archives of Singapore (NAS) has about 2 million Government records in its custody that are more than 25 years old and are deemed as public archives. Not all Government records can be released for open access, especially those that relate to our national defence, foreign relations and internal security, as well as documents which may be bound by confidentiality obligations or personal privacy reasons.",1,34,2019-09-04-T-004-S-00034
2019-09-04-T-004,Sim Ann,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Ms Sim Ann) (for the Minister for Communications and Information),"At present, the metadata of 160,000 records are publicly accessible on the NAS Archives Online portal. This number will grow as we work with Government agencies to progressively declassify Government records. All declassified records are publicly searchable on the Online portal.",2,35,2019-09-04-T-004-S-00035
2019-09-04-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for her answer. Just a few supplementary questions. Firstly, when records that are declassified – and here, I am also referring to the answer that the Senior Minister of State gave previously to a Parliamentary Question by Mr Kok Heng Leun and that was also helpful – and released into the NAS, I understand the agencies would have already gone through a process to make sure that they can be released into the NAS, as opposed to there being sensitive information that would prohibit that. So, when the record is already on the NAS, I would like to ask if the Government can consider making it available to everyone on the NAS Online. I understand right now that there are still some conditions or restrictions. People have to write in, people have to seek approval. That approval is sometimes conditionally given on the basis of whether they are using it for research, on the basis of whether they are publishing it or just using it for personal reference. Can documents that have already been declassified – presumably, those sensitivities are not there or there has been redaction – can those be made more freely available to everyone who would like to view it on the NAS Online?",1,36,2019-09-04-T-004-S-00036
2019-09-04-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"My second supplementary question relates to a time frame. I believe that after 25 years, these documents are released and they go through a process of review for whether they can be released. At the point of 25 years, there could be certain personal sensitivities, confidentiality obligations but is there a process to review documents further down the line? Because those personal sensitivities may not be there, say 50 years, down the line. Is there a process to review documents which have been held back from the NAS Online, but perhaps, if there were reviewed again further down the line, they could be released, say, in 50 years' time?",2,37,2019-09-04-T-004-S-00037
2019-09-04-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"My last supplementary question is on the definition of researcher. I think some of the access is given on the basis of whether you are doing research, whether you are a researcher. I would like to ask what is the operating definition of that? Does one have to be a faculty member in a relevant discipline at a university or can one be, for example, a private citizen, who has an interest in the matter who wishes to write a book on the matter? Can one be an undergraduate or a graduate student? What is the operating definition of ""researcher"" that is used to give access in cases where access is given only for research purposes?",3,38,2019-09-04-T-004-S-00038
2019-09-04-T-004,Sim Ann,Ms Sim Ann,"I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. First, to the question about – if I understand it correctly – he is referring to whether more declassified documents can be made viewable to everyone on the online portal. In fact, on the online portal, if you do a search, you will find that there are quite a number of documents there that are already viewable in full and they can also be seen in PDF form. Our intention is to make more of these available.",1,39,2019-09-04-T-004-S-00039
2019-09-04-T-004,Sim Ann,Ms Sim Ann,"To the Member's question on time frame, if I understand him correctly, what he means is that  for even older documents, will there be a review process to look at those that have not at first been deemed suitable for public access and then to re-look at them again. I should explain to the Member that our priority is to declassify – I have shared the numbers just now. So, there is quite a lot of work to go through for the current number of records that are 25 years and older. I think, we will take his suggestion into consideration but really, the priority is to declassify as many documents as we can and to encourage our agencies to do so and to help us in doing that. In fact, we have in recent years, sent 750 officers from different Government agencies for basic declassification training in the hope that this will help more officers understand the importance of declassification, and to do it well and to do it quicker.",2,40,2019-09-04-T-004-S-00040
2019-09-04-T-004,Sim Ann,Ms Sim Ann,"In terms of definition of researchers, this is based on our common understanding of what they do. This is also explained in our NLB Act.",3,41,2019-09-04-T-004-S-00041
2019-09-04-T-004,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the answer. Just one supplementary question. In relation to my first supplementary question, actually my question was on those documents that have been declassified and released already on to the NAS Online. I think there are 160,000 of 2 million. For those documents that have already been declassified and already on the NAS Online platform, can they be made available more freely? Because, from what I understand, when you go online to this platform, you can view documents and if you click on it, you will not actually get the document. In some cases, you have to ask for written permission and in some cases, conditional permission is given. Not all the documents are actually made freely available on the NAS Online – there is 160,000 or so - without conditions to everyone who just wants to access it online. So, can that be considered?",1,42,2019-09-04-T-004-S-00042
2019-09-04-T-004,Sim Ann,Ms Sim Ann,"Sir, to answer the Member, we hope to make as many documents and records publicly viewable and also searchable as possible. So, all this is on-going work. Also, to add on to my reply to his earlier question, Members of the public can also make requests for these information and our National Archives staff will also facilitate.",1,43,2019-09-04-T-004-S-00043
2019-09-04-T-005,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira,"asked the Minister for Education (a) what measures are in place to detect, minimise and combat bullying based on sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, at educational institutions; (b) whether these measures differ by the level of the educational institution, from Secondary schools through post-Secondary institutions; and (c) whether teachers, staff and administrators receive training to handle such incidents sensitively.",1,44,2019-09-04-T-005-S-00044
2019-09-04-T-005,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Education),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, MOE takes a serious view on bullying. We have zero tolerance for bullying in any form and every student has a right to feel safe and secure in all our schools and post-Secondary educational institutions (PSEIs).

When such cases are reported, they are promptly investigated and followed up with counselling support for victims and appropriate disciplinary action against the perpetrators.",1,45,2019-09-04-T-005-S-00045
2019-09-04-T-005,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Education),"It is also very important for parents to reinforce the same values and expectations on their children's behaviour. Therefore, schools also work closely with parents to help the perpetrators take responsibility for their actions and restore relationships with whom they have hurt. We have professional counsellors and also trained teachers, academic mentors and peer helpers, trained to look out for students in distress and be proactive in attending to and also addressing all hurtful behaviour, including acts directed against students due to their sexual orientation, gender identity or expression.",2,46,2019-09-04-T-005-S-00046

Students are also taught to speak up against and report bullying to school authorities. These education efforts are continued in the PSEIs which create and raise anti-bullying awareness with modules such as teaching lifeskills, lunchtime talks and also student outreach initiatives.",3,47,2019-09-04-T-005-S-00047
2019-09-04-T-005,Low Yen Ling,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Education),"Instilling good values in our students is a shared responsibility between parents, schools and the community.

2019-09-04-T-005,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for her reply. The reason why I am asking the question is that, the NGO Sayoni has documented bullying against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) youths in the schools. This bullying often takes the form of humiliation, punishments when youths do not conform to gender stereotypes. Such youths are isolated at an early age because of their sexual orientation and stigmatised by society. What I am worried about is that teachers and staff, sometimes, inadvertently, reinforce the bullying by requiring youths to conform to stereotypes or by disclosing their stigmatised identity to the parents or the peers.",1,49,2019-09-04-T-005-S-00049
2019-09-04-T-005,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"I just have two supplementary questions. First, are there plan to develop any initiatives to combat gender stereotypes and roles in both our educational curriculum as well as in anti-bullying measures? Second, are there plans to develop anti-bullying guidelines or programmes including sensitivity training for staff and teachers that specifically addresses this type of sexual orientation or gender role identity kind of bullying.",2,50,2019-09-04-T-005-S-00050

2019-09-04-T-005,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Allow me to talk about what happens when the counsellors work with students with sexuality-related issues. When working with students with sexuality-related issues, our school counsellors understand the sensitivity and they adopt an objective approach to ensure the overall best interest of the students. At the heart of everything, it is the interest of the students.",2,52,2019-09-04-T-005-S-00052
2019-09-04-T-005,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"We know, sometimes, they do not feel that they are ready to share their inclination with their parents as yet. So, the counsellors provide a safe environment – the word here is a ""safe environment"" – for the students to discuss their experiences, to receive support regarding social and emotional issues. Maybe they are at an age where they are processing it themselves, they are not quite clear; and also issues related to communications with parents and lack of understanding from peers.",3,53,2019-09-04-T-005-S-00053
2019-09-04-T-005,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"The counsellors support the students by equipping them with problem solving skills, emotional regulation skills and also normalising help-seeking – that it is all right to seek help. School counsellors also facilitate school and – where relevant and when the timing is right – family support for the students, which will help to prevent the students from being ostracised in a social context or even prevent further mental health issues from emerging. When these parents are eventually engaged, the school counsellors also facilitate discussions that enhance the parents' understanding of the students' concern and issues. The counsellors, where relevant, will also share suggestions to help the parents to talk to and also better support their children.",4,54,2019-09-04-T-005-S-00054
2019-09-04-T-005,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"So, I want to assure the Member that MOE, our schools and PSEIs are committed to very high standards of discipline and we have put in place systems and a series of measures to create a safe, secure and conducive learning environment for our students. Teachers are given very extensive training. For example, teachers are trained to handle bullying. Teachers are also equipped with the strategies to address actions that are mean or hurtful. They are also trained to manage behaviour such as those targeting gender identity or sexual orientation. The teachers are also taught in NIE, how to foster a positive classroom culture without imposing their own prejudice. Such training is actually core in all the teachers' preparation programme in NIE.",5,55,2019-09-04-T-005-S-00055
2019-09-04-T-005,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Furthermore, the teachers are also supported in student management matters by senior school staff and also very experienced educators. For example, the Year Head will facilitate holistic development and also encourage peer support amongst students. In the PSEIs and schools, we have now percolated the Peer Support Group because sometimes, it takes the best friend or close friend to approach the teacher and share observations that their friend is suffering, not behaving in a normal way and may need some help. In so doing, the teacher will make sure they protect the identity of the student who came forward to share the information.",6,56,2019-09-04-T-005-S-00056
2019-09-04-T-005,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"MOE also provides schools and teachers with resources and information on how to instil good character and discipline. So, I want to assure the Member that MOE will continue to look at how we can improve our systems and measures to make sure that we provide a safe, secure and conducive learning environment for all our students.",7,57,2019-09-04-T-005-S-00057
2019-09-04-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what measures are being taken to nurture local start-ups and talent in electronic game development and E-sports; and (b) what results have been associated with these efforts to date.,1,58,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00058
2019-09-04-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, video games and e-sports are rapidly growing industries. They generated over US$140 billion globally in 2018, of which almost half was from the Asia Pacific region. In Singapore, the development and distribution of video games contributed S$1.95 billion in 2017. This includes activities by foreign companies with operations in Singapore, such as Ubisoft and Bandai Namco, as well as local firms such as Sea and GoGame. On the community engagement front, events such as e-sports tournaments have also been organised in the heartlands to bring our youths together. An example is the ""Yio Game On"" event, that was organised at Yio Chu Kang Community Club in May this year, which was well received.",1,59,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00059
2019-09-04-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Government agencies have been supporting local start-ups and companies in this space. Sea, formerly known as Garena, is one of Singapore's unicorns and first made its mark through its platform for video games. The games industry has also catalysed the growth of other companies in the eco-system, such as Razer and Secretlab, which are globally prominent lifestyle brands amongst gamers today.",2,60,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00060
2019-09-04-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"We are building on such successes through several approaches. First, we are helping our companies to grow. Launched in 2017, the Startup SG initiative provides local companies a range of financial and non-financial support such as mentorship and start-up capital support through the Startup SG Founder programme. In addition, companies can leverage sector-specific initiatives such as the IMDA's PIXEL innovation space, which offers incubation and co-working spaces for digital start-ups so they can develop their projects with the right technical and business support.",3,61,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00061
2019-09-04-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Second, we are deepening capabilities. We are building a robust talent pipeline for the video games industry. Local game schools such as DigiPen Institute and Nanyang Polytechnic offer courses for aspiring game designers and artists to develop their skills. IMDA also works with EDB to attract internationally-acclaimed studios, providing a platform for our entrepreneurs to gain valuable experience before starting their own studios.",4,62,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00062
2019-09-04-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Third, we are building a vibrant and enabling eco-system. For example, game engine company Unity Technologies has been supporting gaming startups at PIXEL with mentorship, workshops, and technical support since 2018. This ecosystem has supported companies like BattleBrew Productions, founded by a DigiPen graduate, and whose first mobile game IP won the Visitor’s Choice Award at the GameStart Asia 2018 convention.",5,63,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00063
2019-09-04-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chun Sing),"Finally, we are building international mindshare. During our ASEAN Chairmanship last year, the first ASEAN e-sports and music festival, Hyperplay, was held in Singapore. The event was well-attended by over 8,000 youths of different backgrounds and featured the first League of Legends ASEAN tournament. Singapore will also host the first Asian edition of Gamescom in 2020. Gamescom is the world’s largest video games industry event and business platform. The Singapore edition will also let our video games companies showcase their capabilities and connect with prospective investors, collaborators and buyers. STB will continue to be on the look-out for other major events which can be hosted in Singapore, to further augment our position as a video games and e-sports hub in the region.",6,64,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00064
2019-09-04-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),I thank the Minister for his reply. Just a few supplementary questions in relation to electronic game development and e-sports.,1,65,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00065
2019-09-04-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Firstly, I understand that there are graduate courses, diploma courses such as DigiPen, as the Minister mentioned. What avenues and platforms are available for Singaporeans to get post-graduate training? Because in order to develop sophisticated and successful games, post-graduate training in the necessary skills should be available. I know some big multinational companies do provide training. I believe that, in general, this training is provided to their own employees and it is not open-sourced and available to everyone. So, what are the avenues that are available for post-graduate training?",2,66,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00066
2019-09-04-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Secondly, does IMDA or other Government agencies still provide start-up grants to electronic game development start-ups or e-sports start-ups in Singapore? If so, what has been the trend in the grants given and what has been the success associated with that?",3,67,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00067
2019-09-04-T-006,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Thirdly and lastly, is support given to game developers to market their own games directly to customers independently of a publisher? I ask this because a game development company can go through a publisher in order to market their game, and the publisher then takes a large part of the margin. That is value that otherwise the game development company could capture. Is support given to game development companies and, if necessary, grants? Are they given without requiring them to be allied to a publisher, to be endorsed by a publisher, to work with the publisher, but instead just encourage them to actually market their games directly to customers through platforms like Steam or App Store, or so on, and, therefore, capture a lot more value and become more financially self-sustaining?",4,68,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00068
2019-09-04-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me respond to the three questions in more generic terms of how we spend money and when we spend money.",1,69,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00069
2019-09-04-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"First, on the issue of post-graduate training. Whether we start any post-graduate course, whether for e-sports or any other thing, depends on the demand for the course and curriculum. In today's world, the mental model of just going for post-graduate courses is a bit passé. In many of these areas that are fast evolving, the best training is not in a post-graduate course. The best training and the best exposure is actually with the leading edge companies.",2,70,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00070
2019-09-04-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"So, while post-graduate courses are important, we will continue to monitor whether we need to start a post-graduate course and have the critical mass to do so, and if there is a market demand to do so. At this point in time, it is still early days. But what we should really do is to make sure that our aspiring e-sports gamers, designers or developers have the best opportunities to work with the best around the world. So, getting them into companies to have the necessary exposure is important.",3,71,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00071
2019-09-04-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The Member's second and third questions are related to how should the Government spend grants and who do we give the grants to, and should we interfere in the commercial arrangements between developers and some of these gaming houses?",4,72,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00072
2019-09-04-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In general, I would state this  we are using public money, we are not in the business of choosing winners and losers, and that is not the way we develop our industries. Any entrepreneur who wants to start up a new business can obviously get various forms of help from the Government, but it will not be the appropriate role for the Government to pick and say that this is better done than another thing. In fact, actually the best test of where to apply the funds will certainly be the markets. A good idea will always have opportunities with the venture capitalists and so forth.",5,73,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00073
2019-09-04-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Whenever we spend Government money, which is actually the public's money, then we have to be very careful and ask ourselves this question  where is the market failure that we are trying to address? The Government agencies and the taxpayers' money should not be used to displace the market mechanism and the general workings of the market.",6,74,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00074
2019-09-04-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"So, anybody, be it in this particular sector or any other sector, if they would like to get help from the economic agencies, they can always contact Enterprise Singapore, they can always look at the various schemes that the Government has to help our companies to grow.",7,75,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00075
2019-09-04-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"As to your third question, that is best left to the commercial arrangements. It is not possible, and neither do I think is right, for the Government to intervene in the commercial arrangements between different companies and different games developers.",8,76,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00076
2019-09-04-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I understand where the Member is coming from but I think there is a market mechanism that can work and I will be very careful to intervene, to disrupt or displace the market mechanism.",9,77,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00077
2019-09-04-T-006,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Mr Deputy Speaker, as the Minister was sharing about how we are developing the e-sports market, it is very exciting, but I cannot help but also worry about the announcement that WHO made last year that has classified gaming disorder as a disease. I am just wondering, just like the way we were developing the casinos, what are we doing here in terms of combating gaming disorders and addiction, as we alongside develop this e-sports area?",1,78,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00078
2019-09-04-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with any new technology, any new games, as Ms Anthea Ong said, it comes with associated dangers and there will always be a certain, albeit small proportion who might get addicted to such things.",1,79,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00079
2019-09-04-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"So, this is where MSF together with the National Addictions Management Service or what we call NAMS, is working closely to monitor this issue. It is not exactly the same as the e-sports that we are talking about. We are talking about another part of the spectrum, which, of course, we are concerned about if there are such things. There are help channels available. We are also working with the schools to make sure that people who get involved in electronic games are properly guided and they maintain a certain sense of discipline, so that they do not get into trouble at all.",2,80,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00080
2019-09-04-T-006,Chan Chun Sing,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Like many of these addictions, the best thing for us is to invest our resources in prevention rather than just post-issue management.",3,81,2019-09-04-T-006-S-00081
2019-09-04-T-007,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) whether the Government's procurement process has criteria to encourage businesses to undertake environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices and, if so, what are they; (b) whether there is a national framework for businesses to track and measure the performance of businesses in ESG practices and, if not, whether there is consideration for one; and (c) what are the tax and non-tax incentives and schemes for businesses to undertake ESG practices such as inclusive hiring of persons with special needs, rental of premises to conduct social businesses, capital investment improving ESG practices.",1,82,2019-09-04-T-007-S-00082
2019-09-04-T-007,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"Mr Deputy Speaker, the Government's public procurement processes seek to encourage environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices amongst businesses. For example, Government agencies practise green procurement by purchasing ICT equipment and electrical appliances that meet energy efficiency standards, and printing paper that are environmentally friendly; they are certified with the Singapore Green Label. In addition, events and functions organised by public sector agencies are to be held in venues with at least a Green Mark Certified rating, unless there are specific reasons why this is not possible.",1,83,2019-09-04-T-007-S-00083

The criteria for the awarding of construction contracts for these building and other infrastructure projects includes the use of productive construction methods which are typically also more sustainable.",2,84,2019-09-04-T-007-S-00084
2019-09-04-T-007,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"Besides procurement, there are various national frameworks in place for ESG practices in the private sector. Large industrial energy consumers are required to track and report their energy usage, including greenhouse gas emissions annually. Similarly, industrial and business water consumers need to track and report their water usage annually and submit Water Efficiency Management Plans.",3,85,2019-09-04-T-007-S-00085
2019-09-04-T-007,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"MTI's Business Excellence programme, through the Singapore Quality Award (SQA) and the Singapore Quality Class (SQC) requires awarded organisations to have well-defined corporate governance systems to ensure business continuity and risk management, as well as accountability and transparency that are consistent with statutory and regulatory requirements. They are also required to have well-defined policies and programmes to contribute to the sustainable development of the community and environment which they operate in. So, ESG criteria are embedded within the SQA and SQC criteria. Enterprise Singapore also actively promotes ISO standards related to ESG practices for the industry to adopt.",4,86,2019-09-04-T-007-S-00086
2019-09-04-T-007,Lawrence Wong,The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"Since 2016, the SGX has implemented sustainability reporting for all publicly-listed companies on a ""comply or explain"" basis, and it has a number of sustainability indices to guide listed companies. We welcome other non-listed companies to consider and model their corporate practices on this guidance. In addition, there are various industry-led standards and certifications related to ESG practices, where companies are required to consider the impact of their decisions on their workers, customers, suppliers, community and the environment.",5,87,2019-09-04-T-007-S-00087

2019-09-04-T-008,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"In so doing, we can, therefore, insulate our young people a little longer from media coverage of their offences and our efforts to rehabilitate and reintegrate them will be far more effective.",3,100,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00100
2019-09-04-T-008,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),How so? Research from the US shows that media coverage of juvenile offences that fails to protect the identities of young offenders can have various detrimental consequences.,4,101,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00101
2019-09-04-T-008,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"First, the public shaming of young offenders can heighten tensions within their families and fracture the very unit of society that can play a pivotal role in these youths’ rehabilitation.",5,102,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00102
2019-09-04-T-008,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"Second, media coverage can lead these youths to be ostracised by their peers and teachers, thus crippling community-based rehabilitation measures.",6,103,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00103
2019-09-04-T-008,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"Third, negative media coverage can also lend offenders a semblance of celebrity status. In an era where it seems to be cool to go viral whatever the reason, media coverage of juvenile offences may encourage the tendency to re-offend and, possibly, influence other youths to commit similar crimes to attain notoriety and peer affirmation.",7,104,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00104
2019-09-04-T-008,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"Indeed, my own research on the social media practices of juvenile offenders in Singapore reveals an interest among some youths to project a cool and tough image online by boasting of their misdemeanours on social media.

2019-09-04-T-008,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"Finally, public records of these offences severely compromise these youths’ future chances for education and employment.

2019-09-04-T-008,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"Extending identity protection to the age of 18 is, therefore, a timely and enlightened move, given that our public identities assume an oversized importance in our digitally-connected society as we concluded in our debate on the Protection from Online Harassment Act in May. With two additional years of confidentiality for young offenders, we can derive considerable social and developmental returns in our Internet-saturated society.",10,107,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00107
2019-09-04-T-008,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"Indeed, given our society’s growing technologisation, I would like to take this opportunity to raise the issue of the digital rights of children. At first blush, you may find it laughable to speak about digital rights for young people in Singapore since, wherever we turn, it seems like every toddler, teen and young adult seems to be attached to a digital device of their own. Access is clearly not the issue here. In fact, a Google survey found that Singaporean children get their first Internet-connected device at the age of eight, below the global average of 10, making them among the youngest in the world to go online.",11,108,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00108
2019-09-04-T-008,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"What is of urgent import is that children be accorded rights to the necessary protections in a rapidly and ferociously digitalising world. By that, I refer to how young people are increasingly the target of commercial exploitation in the online world. Principally, our society needs to ensure that children enjoy rights to privacy and not have their data harvested and mined for profit. The same Google survey found that teachers here are more worried than parents about cyber bullying, while parents are most concerned about their children’s privacy and security online.",12,109,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00109
2019-09-04-T-008,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"Children’s privacy and security online are, indeed, a matter that requires closer attention. Take the example of the Internet of Toys. In January 2018, American electronic toy company VTech was fined $650,000 by the US Federal Trade Commission for failing to protect the privacy of children using its gadgets. Children use the company's Kids Connect app in conjunction with these electronic toys. Through this app, VTech collected a vast trove of information, including children’s names, contact information, photographs and audio files, without seeking consent from parents or even informing them. A security breach revealed that the company had failed to secure their young users’ data, allowing hackers untrammelled access.",13,110,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00110
2019-09-04-T-008,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"As children are using digital devices at ever younger ages, we need to hold companies to task for their data collection processes, especially those pertaining to children, by introducing requirements for greater care and transparency in their practices.

2019-09-04-T-008,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"Even for companies that do have adequate data protection measures, we must consider how such data is used to develop algorithms to create or serve up more content targeted at children. Gaming, online shopping, content sharing and social media platforms profit significantly from the digital native market. However, the companies behind them often fail to take into account the responsibilities they have towards these young users and simply find more ways to engage them, for longer periods and with ever more alluring content that resonates with their interests. Young people then find themselves irresistibility drawn to these platforms, often using their digital devices excessively. The burden is then shifted to schools and parents who must persuade or even coerce young people to better manage their use of digital media.",15,112,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00112
2019-09-04-T-008,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"In such a climate, we must exhort technology companies to do more to create a safe and edifying digital environment for young people. In February this year, Instagram head Adam Mosseri met with the British Health Secretary Matt Hancock to discuss new measures the company would introduce to handle content promoting self-harm and suicide. This meeting arose in part from the suicide of 14-year-old British teenager Molly Russell. Her family believed she took her own life because her Instagram account was replete with material about depression, self-harm and suicide. Instagram has since pledged to better identify content relating to self-harm and hide it behind ""sensitivity screens"". Closer to home, a survey by international research agency YouGov found that a third of young adults here have self-harmed, with one in 10 doing so frequently. So, young Singaporeans' exposure to such content and their effects should also be more closely investigated.",16,113,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00113
2019-09-04-T-008,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"When our children go online, they are, indeed, vulnerable to risks – risks of commercial exploitation, exposure to inappropriate content, cyberbullying and online sexual abuse, and we must do our best to shield them from these dangers. Thankfully, Singapore has not experienced such high profile incidents relating to the breach of children’s digital privacy or adverse exposure to online harms.",17,114,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00114
2019-09-04-T-008,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"As avid users of technology however, young people in Singapore are susceptible to such risks, even as we embrace the distinct benefits they can gain from the digital world. Another key tranche to young people’s digital rights must, therefore, be ensuring access to digital literacy education to empower them with the skills to minimise digital risks and maximise gains. In this regard, Singapore has done well through efforts by the MOE, MCI, IMDA, NLB and the Media Literacy Council. I urge technology companies to do even more to support these public education efforts and consider the duty of care they owe to their young users.",18,115,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00115
2019-09-04-T-008,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"Mr Speaker, our children are born into a heavily digitalised environment. Many have a digital footprint even before they have sprung from their mothers’ wombs, with their ultrasound images being shared on social media. That is but the beginning of their digital journey.",19,116,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00116
2019-09-04-T-008,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"In light of this prevailing reality, we must take concerted steps towards ensuring that children's digital rights are respected, supported and championed. In 2014, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child held a Day of General Discussion on digital media and children’s rights. It concluded that  ""States should adopt a national coordinating framework with a clear mandate and sufficient authority to coordinate all activities related to children’s rights and digital media and ICTs at cross-sectoral, national, regional and local levels and facilitate international cooperation.""",20,117,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00117
2019-09-04-T-008,Lim Sun Sun,Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member),"Given our whole-of-Government approach to tackling our national priorities, I believe that protecting and advancing children’s digital rights with a national coordinating framework are a task Singapore should actively undertake. Indeed, given our extensive experience with digitalisation, Singapore can also be a key advocate of this movement on the world stage. Such efforts will be in the best interests of the healthy and positive development of children in Singapore and beyond.",21,118,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00118
2019-09-04-T-008,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I stand in support of this Bill, which seeks to provide more extensive protection and better and fairer provisions for young persons up to the age of 18 years, in their best interests.",1,119,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00119
2019-09-04-T-008,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"First, I would like to speak on clause 4 which amends section 4 of the Act. I support replacing ""emotional injury"" with ""emotional harm"". ""Injury"" tends to suggest that the abuse is rather tangible or explicit and is visible, while ""harm"" is more all-encompassing and suggests that while it may not necessarily be visible, the damage the abuse has caused is much more far-reaching and may manifest itself in ways other than that which is visible.",2,120,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00120
2019-09-04-T-008,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"There are cases where parents or guardians, in their fervour to bring out the best in their children, end up subjecting the child to emotional abuse or acts of degradation that erode the child’s feeling of self-worth, self-esteem or overall well-being.",3,121,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00121
2019-09-04-T-008,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Some parents see their scoldings and nagging or even acts of punishment as necessary acts of discipline for their children. Where and how do we draw the line? And when do the authorities step in? Do we intervene when a member of public complains? Or do we wait until a significant adult in the child’s life, such as a school teacher or an adult relative, takes notice and informs the authorities? Or do we need to wait until the child who is a victim of emotional or mental abuse speaks up or seeks help?",4,122,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00122
2019-09-04-T-008,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"I seek clarification from the Ministry as to where and how do we draw the line with regard to a child or young person being in need of care or protection, as well as when do the authorities step in?",5,123,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00123
2019-09-04-T-008,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"I am a parent, too, and I do understand the expectations some parents have on their children, in wanting them to realise their full potential and do well in school and later on in life. But we should not condone authoritarian or even authoritative parenting that revolves around scoldings or punishments or persistent nagging or acts of degradation, which are, essentially, abuse towards the child. As a parent, love should always be the basis of our care and discipline towards our children. We can certainly discipline our children and be firm with them in order to instil good values, but this should be done on the basis of love and care, and not on the basis of hate or wanting to inflict fear or pain.",6,124,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00124
2019-09-04-T-008,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Some children do suffer as a result of their parents' style of parenting. Some suffer in silence while some start to develop a facade of indifference, while some of these emotionally or physically abused children would, in turn, inflict pain on others who are in a position more vulnerable than they are, such as a younger sibling or a classmate or schoolmate.",7,125,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00125
2019-09-04-T-008,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Hence, I support the amendments to section 4 to expand and set out the circumstances in which a child or young person may be regarded as being subject to emotional or psychological abuse and would need care or protection beyond that which can be given by their biological parents or legal guardians. With these amendments, I hope more protection and the necessary care can be extended to the children or young persons who have otherwise been subject to abuse or harm by those who should have been protecting them.",8,126,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00126
2019-09-04-T-008,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Next, I would like to speak on the fostering of young persons. I am supportive of the formation of the Committee on Fostering. I believe this will help provide a more objective and fairer platform for the review of foster care to be provided to young persons who have to be removed from the care of their biological parents, or even foster parents.",9,127,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00127
2019-09-04-T-008,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Within the last one year, I have had two families living within my constituency who came to seek help regarding their foster care arrangements. One of them, a couple with grandchildren, had been foster parents to a young girl since she was only a few weeks old. The gentleman of this couple who are foster parents – let us call him Mr C – had alleged that MSF had acted in a biased and unfair manner towards him and his wife, and had, what he claimed, listened to and sided unfairly with the girl's biological father. As a result, the girl was taken away from their foster care to be reunited with her biological father.",10,128,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00128
2019-09-04-T-008,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"As expected, Mr C was furious. He claimed that MSF had taken decisions on the matter ""with no regard to the child's well-being"". I had asked MSF to review the appeal made by Mr C to return the girl to his and his wife’s foster care. MSF had reviewed the case extensively and I learnt that it was Mr C's wife who had decided to discontinue care as a foster parent to the child in the first place.",11,129,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00129
2019-09-04-T-008,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Another couple, Mr S and his wife, have been foster parents with MSF for about nine years. They have cared for three children since then, with two of them still living in their care. A third child, the youngest of the three, was under their care for about six years, until he was removed from their care recently.",12,130,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00130
2019-09-04-T-008,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr S and his wife were distraught and claimed that MSF had taken the boy from their care with little notice and without considering their inputs and views on the matter. They also claimed that the boy did not want to return to his biological mother who had recently been released from prison. Again, as expected, Mr S and his wife blamed MSF and claimed MSF had acted unfairly and did not consider the best interests of the child.",13,131,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00131
2019-09-04-T-008,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"In both instances, I can fully understand the feelings of the foster parents. They had given their time, care and love towards the child they had fostered and cared for over several years. And, inevitably, a strong emotional bond would have been formed between the foster parents and the child over those years. To let go of the child once their foster care is no longer needed is not an easy thing to do. At the same time, I must state my support for the work that MSF does. As a Ministry, it has to look at each and every foster care case with objectivity and fairness, and in the best interest of the child in question.",14,132,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00132
2019-09-04-T-008,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"It is unfortunate that when a foster care case does not turn out the way that the foster parents or even biological parents expect, it is somehow expedient to blame the MSF and the MSF officers working on the case for it. This is very unfortunate and unfair, indeed.",15,133,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00133
2019-09-04-T-008,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Hence, I feel that the insertion of clause 23 in the Bill to include a new Part IIA on Fostering will be useful in delineating the rules and provisions for fostering, particularly in setting up a Committee on Fostering made up of individuals appointed by the Minister who may be able to provide inputs and opinions from a seemingly more neutral and balance perspective.",16,134,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00134

Eventually, these different inputs of important information can be put up as recommendations to the court dealing with the particular foster case if need be.",18,136,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00136

2019-09-04-T-008,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"One aspect of this Bill that I would like to seek clarifications on is clause 48 with the introduction of section 68A. I am somewhat concerned with the provision to allow the person-in-charge of any home for children and young persons, or any other authorised persons in that home, to use a mechanical restraint on a person detained in the home, called a detainee, in order to prevent the detainee from escaping from custody, or to prevent the detainee from inflicting any bodily injury on themselves or on others. What forms of ""mechanical restraints"" are allowed to be used? To what extent are these mechanical restraints used? And what if the mechanical restraints used inflict even more injury on the detainee than that it was first meant to prevent in the first place?",21,139,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00139

M3 was established to specifically help families within our Malay/Muslim community and this also involves a collaboration with MSF. This is a good initiative that has an encouraging and positive effect in strengthening our families, enhancing our skills and job opportunities, improving access to quality and affordable education, as well as rolling out initiatives that focus on our children’s well-being. We must continue to support the Government’s objectives and initiatives like the M3.",24,142,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00142

Can the Minister share what the current staff to children ratio is at the ""place of safety""? What was it in the past? Has it improved over the years? Can the Minister share if MSF has studied the optimum staff to children ratio?

2019-09-04-T-008,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Lastly, the new section 68A allows persons-in-charge of homes for children and young persons to use mechanical restraints such as handcuffs. I understand this is intended to prevent children in the homes from escaping custody or inflicting bodily injury on themselves. This seems incompatible with our shift to a more rehabilitative approach. I understand that there might be circumstances where there is a genuine need to physically restrain the children. Our children's homes are already staffed by auxiliary officers. They are in a better position to step in, if necessary. There should be a clear distinction between the roles of the staff and auxiliary officers. Staff of the children's homes should be nurturing figures who are there to protect, not restraint the children. Imagine the psychology effect on children to see the staff using handcuffs on them and their friends. Can we maintain this separation by increasing the number of auxiliary officers if necessary so that the MSF staff do not have to take on this role?",22,165,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00165
2019-09-04-T-008,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, it is often said that our children are our hope for the future. Children who are put in ""places of safety"" because of circumstances beyond their control have the same potential as any other child, and are no less deserving of care and attention. Let us make sure that we can give them the safe environment to break free of their unfortunate circumstances and to grow into their full potential. Let us make sure we help the children and also improve support and resources provided to the VWOs running our ""places of safety"".",23,166,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00166

2019-09-04-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of this Bill. First off, on behalf of foster parents, I would like to thank MSF for allowing foster parents to benefit from childcare leave. This is something that many in the VWO space, including myself, have asked for. Second, over the years, we are aware of good progress that MSF and our VWOs have made to resource our home that serves our vulnerable children and youth.",1,168,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00168
2019-09-04-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"As such, I would like MSF to comment on the current state of affairs. Can MSF share on the progress made? On average, how many of our children are currently based in the home-based care, such as Government and VWO-based orphanage, as well as and boys' and girls' homes? Have we seen a decrease over the years?",2,169,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00169
2019-09-04-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Most of us will agree that family-based care is a better model compared to home-based care for child and youth, as long as the foster or adopted parents have the means and the care and concern for them. Therefore, can MSF share whether we have been able to put more of these children and youth into family-based care situations such as through adopted and foster parents?",3,170,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00170
2019-09-04-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Thirdly, can MSF share on how more we can encourage more people to move forward as foster parents? I understand that there is a certain number of Singaporeans who would like to adopt children. Is there room for us to encourage them to consider fostering instead?",4,171,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00171
2019-09-04-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Next, is there a way for us to streamline the adoption process so as to reduce the cost of adoption? For the needy, there is of course the free legal aid. But adoption cost goes into thousands of dollars and this is a big cost to the sandwich class who are trying to adopt. And on the ground, I see some cases of grandparents from the sandwich class who want to adopt their grandchildren because the parents are not able or available to provide care. And the legal cost takes precious resources away from the grandparents.",5,172,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00172
2019-09-04-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Lastly, under CYPA, we have expanded on the definition of ""emotional harm"" to include ""danger to oneself or to other persons"", and ""severely withdrawn, anxious or depressed"". I welcome this move. In this context, there is one particular group of children and youth I would like to take about – those with extreme online addiction that has handicapped their ability to cope with life.",6,173,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00173
2019-09-04-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"On the ground, I have seen a few of these cases who suffered such situations. Recently, I had a distressed parent coming in regarding this person's son who has suffered severe online addiction issues. The Secondary school youth has stopped going to school, has gone beyond parental control and has started exhibiting violent behaviour. The youth's school and parents were not able to persuade this youth to go back to school. Yet because this youth has not committed a crime, has not yet done something that is deemed as traditionally high risk, the mandatory intervention mechanism could not kick in. In this case, for this resident what I did was we brought in a volunteer who was a game developer and we tried to go in and persuade this person that if he likes to game, maybe he can a game developer one day and from then on we try to encourage him to go back to school. We are making some progress but I would like to see whether there is a systematic way where we can deal with this emerging issue.",7,174,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00174
2019-09-04-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Therefore, I hope that MSF and the compulsory education unit within MOE can work together to explore whether, in extreme and only extreme circumstances, can we put the children and our youth into mandatory therapy to deal with this online addiction? In all likelihood, the online addiction may be rooted or compounded by other behaviours, emotional or even mental issues. But a mandatory therapy will give us a chance to diagnose the situation and do the necessary course correction. One may argue that this may not constitute as severe self-harm in the traditional sense. But in this day and age, if a child or young person is not able even complete his basic education due to online addiction, in my view, I believe his or her future will be seriously compromised.",8,175,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00175
2019-09-04-T-008,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"In conclusion, based on the feedback that I hear from various VWOs, this Bill is progressive and balanced. I would also like to thank MSF and the officers from the various VWOs for their tireless work to care for our vulnerable children and youth. With that, I support the Bill.",9,176,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00176

2019-09-04-T-008,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"First, strengthening the coordination and integration of care. Despite the immense many efforts by volunteers and agency staff, I found the outcomes for these children at risk and young persons at risk are often still less than ideal. It is definitely not for lack of heart and hands because I know how much each volunteer and staff care and put in. These partners on the ground have told me the following needs that, if better addressed, would surely improve the life outcomes for the young people they care for.",4,180,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00180
2019-09-04-T-008,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"These needs are  one, the need for a safe environment where children feel secure; where they can learn and even rest without a constant heightened feeling of fear, anxiety and disruption. Such an environment can be found in both mainstream and special schools; but much depends on the kindness of the adults in charge. In the mainstream First Toa Payoh Primary School, there is a programme called Home @ School to provide such a safe environment for after-school. In the special school Pathlight where I volunteer, the OHANA after-school programme offers such a safe setting.",5,181,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00181

Each of them working within their own scope of duty and doing their very best – the youth worker taking care of the youth services for the young; the drug counsellor taking care of a parent; the social service officers delivering financial assistance.

Another young girl I know whose mother is in remand for drug offences became worse off when there was no effective hand-shake between her counsellors as she transited from Primary to Secondary school. One student with special needs I know very well is facing transition challenges and he is preparing to leave school after special school. As his foster mother ages and is having cancer, there is not enough confidence amongst all the parties working with him that there is a good transition and handshake. Hence, I feel there is a strong need to invest more resources to MSF to strengthen the coordination and integration of care.",10,186,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00186

Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have mixed feelings as I go through the Bill. On one hand, it is a comprehensive one covering many needed gaps. On the other hand, I cannot help but feel that in our efforts to protect the child, we are seeing things a lot through the lenses of the adult and not enough through the eyes of the children and young persons we are trying to help.",11,187,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00187
2019-09-04-T-008,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"How do we incorporate the voice of these young people whose lives we attempt to shape for the better? In matters that impact them such as the change of school; admission into children’s homes or foster homes; in identifying their adult supervisors, are there measures installed to take into account the feelings and preferences of these young persons? How can the long and onerous process of gathering evidence, determination and implementation of Court orders for children caught in parental disputes, the process be improved so that their feelings are considered? In the new section 68(A), for instance, that authorises the use of ""mechanical restraint"" such as handcuffs or leg braces on a child or young person, how do we ensure that the least damage is done on them? Are affected children and young persons involved in the numerous decisions made for them incorporated in this Bill?",12,188,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00188
2019-09-04-T-008,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),I therefore seek clarification from the Ministry on how the voice of these young persons can be sought and strengthened in this Bill.,13,189,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00189

I am pleased that foster parents are officially added in this Bill as key partners to support children and young persons in need of protection and rehabilitation. Foster parents, if properly selected and trained, provide a more natural and desirable setting than a group home for these young people. I have studied the Ministry’s Fostering Scheme and found it to be useful and structured.

2019-09-04-T-008,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"In conclusion, Sir, the CYPA is an important Bill and is overdue. In its implementation, there is a need to especially strengthen the coordination and integration of care to ensure the children and young persons receive the better outcomes they deserve. The mission of ensuring a better life for them, however, cannot be left only to the Government and the social service agencies. Those of us in the rest of society, whether as neighbours or relatives or volunteers, must join in the efforts to support this effort.

This is especially with regard to raising the age limit for protection from abuse or neglect from the age of below 16 years to below 18 years. Those who are within this age group can be very impressionistic and be quite easily swayed by adults. Sometimes, they are unable to comprehend the wider implications of their decisions which may result in their underestimating the risks of their actions or behaviours. And, this group of our young can be exploited by criminals and we have also seen how girls and boys alike have fallen victim to sexual predators.",1,193,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00193

As the Order will provide the care-givers with powers to make decisions for the child which would otherwise require parental consent, who are the care-givers that the Ministry has on its list, and would this be expanded further?

This is important especially in multi-racial Singapore, because there may be caregivers who are over-enthusiastic in trying to promote their own religion, and perhaps this is done with good intentions, but they should respect the fact that the child should be allowed to make his/her own decision after reaching 18 years of age.",4,196,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00196

At the very least, we should have some mechanism or provision to show that we value the rights of the parents. We do not want to cultivate a parenting culture that is afraid to discipline their children when the need arises. I hope that we can focus more on counselling both children and parents, and that taking away parents’ rights should only be the last resort, or if their actions endanger the child's life or has lasting severe impact on the child.

Are they properly represented in Court? Are they aware that their rights as a parent are being taken away in their case? How might they mount a defence against the implied charge that they are incompetent and incapable parents?

2019-09-04-T-008,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),I would like to touch on resources and staffing now.,11,218,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00218
2019-09-04-T-008,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"With the increased need to provide step-up care to a larger number of children and youths, and the demand for greater resources to support more victims of abuse and harm, it seems likely that the Government will need to increase staff resources to ensure that there are sufficient number of professionals who can provide interventions to children.",12,219,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00219
2019-09-04-T-008,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"I would thus like to urge the Government to concurrently enhance the capabilities of staff who are already working in Government-run homes for children and strengthen the capabilities of those homes to provide holistic care. As such, could the Government consider reviewing the knowledge, skills, abilities and other competencies of professionals who are working with children, enhance the career prospects of the profession and perhaps even reconsider the remuneration and benefits of these professionals to attract a larger number – especially potential mid-career switchers – to enter this field.",13,220,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00220
2019-09-04-T-008,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Deputy Speaker, working with children and at-risk youth is meaningful and important work because it impacts the next generation of Singaporeans. We need to ensure that we are able to entice and retain and more people with the right passion to enter this field. The Government could also perhaps consider tapping on those looking for re-employment – perhaps full-time parents or even grandparents who are looking to return to the workforce. If these happen to be parents or grandparents of children and youths of a similar age, they could likely have the aptitude and skill-sets to successfully work with these children and at-risk youths.",14,221,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00221
2019-09-04-T-008,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"And finally, the topic of foster parents, Mr Deputy Speaker. I believe that foster parents provide children and at-risk youths a second lease of life and another shot at life that their biological families and parents may not necessarily be able to provide. I am glad that the Bill now also considers them as ""parents"" and recognises that they provide an important duty of care to the children they foster by according them childcare leave. This gesture is a significant one, and I am sure that it will be well-received as the childcare leave will accord them with greater flexibility at work for them to provide the necessary care for the children they are fostering.",15,222,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00222
2019-09-04-T-008,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Emotional bonds between foster parents and the fostered child will inevitably grow over time. I would imagine that it would be emotionally painful for a set of foster parents to be separated from their foster child once the child reaches a certain age or when the foster child leaves their foster parents to go back to his or her biological homes. I would thus like to know if there is the option for foster parents to adopt their fostered child, provided both parties are open to the arrangement? And are such arrangements typically common? Also, would the biological parents' consent be needed, even if they have shown themselves to be unfit parents through their actions and behaviour which sometimes have been deemed as criminal?",16,223,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00223
2019-09-04-T-008,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to conclude my speech with quotes from John Baptist de la Salle, who is often acknowledged as the patron saint of teachers.

2019-09-04-T-008,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"The move to support foster parents is another positive evolution. Foster parents are important in the network of support for vulnerable children. They are no different from the children's natural parents in having to balance their careers and families. The extension of childcare leave benefits to foster parents to help them care for their foster children who may have been abused, neglected or abandoned recognizes the contribution of foster parents and allows for time and flexibility to care for foster children.",3,228,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00228

2019-09-04-T-008,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),The Labour Movement has been a strong advocate to improve support given to families. We are happy that the Government has responded to the call over the years and have now progressed to the foster parents.,5,230,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00230

In 2013, the Labour Movement advocated for the Government to accord the same level of benefits that married mothers get to unwed mothers. In 2017, the Government announced that unwed mothers would be entitled to the same maternity leave, childcare and infant leave as married parents, and enjoy CDCA benefits. Yet, more can be done for them.",6,231,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00231
2019-09-04-T-008,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"First, we should revisit allowing unwed mothers to purchase HDB flats before 35 years old. Housing is a practical issue that families must deal with. Currently, unwed mothers can only buy their own HDB flats if they are 35 years old and above, under the Singles Scheme. This means that unwed mothers will have to rent a place if they are not living with their family or relatives, increasing the cost burden on such families on top of the cost of raising children. Can we re-consider this fundamental need for lodging as they are often younger, and allow concession in consideration of their plight and circumstances, to purchase a flat even before the mother turns 35?",7,232,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00232
2019-09-04-T-008,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Second, there should be tax relief for unwed mothers and foster parents – such as Working Mother's Child Relief and Grandparent Caregiver Relief. Today, unwed mothers are not eligible for such relief.

Mr Christopher de Souza touched on the definition of ""emotional harm"".

We do not intend to unduly intervene with parents' rights to discipline their children. And we do not intend to overly intrude into the private lives of families. The vast majority of parents are responsible and do their best to care for and raise their children. Within the private lives of families, within the bounds of parental authority, there is a wide berth or space for parents to nurture, raise and discipline their children.

When we receive reports that raise concerns about the safety of children, we first undertake a comprehensive social investigation. Often, our social services move in, rather immediately, the Child Protective Service.

In doing so, we are aided by evidence-based assessment tools.",8,243,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00243

We then work quickly to ensure that the child can be placed in a safe place, whether under the care of his grandparents or other relatives such as aunts and uncles, foster parents or a children's home.

2019-09-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"The reality is that we do not have enough foster parents for every child in need of protection. As a foster parent, you have to open not only your hearts, but also open your homes. And the care is 24/7. This challenge is especially so for older children. There are also children with more complex needs whose interests are better served in a residential care setting.",16,251,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00251

The age, gender as well as the care and intervention needs of each child, availability of foster families especially those who can care for more than one foster child and the resident profiles in children's homes, are taken into account when deciding a child's placement.

Where the expected duration of the out-of-home care placement is short or the child will soon be taking a national exam, or the current school provides good support for his needs, we prefer to let the child continue in his current school.

My colleagues have recently checked on Allie and I am told that she is progressing well in her placement, despite initial adjustment difficulties. And I think we understand that she was caught between a rock and a hard place. Her family situation was none the better and that is why she had to be removed in the very first place.

The childcare benefits that we are proposing to extend, if this Parliament endorses it, will give them more time to spend with their foster children. Financially, foster parents receive fostering allowances to defray expenses for the children. The quantum is higher if the children have special needs.

Our approach is to try to divert youth offenders, including those between the ages of 16 and 18 years, away from the Court wherever possible. Youth offenders who are not diverted are assessed whether they are suitable for probation. Probation focuses on community-based rehabilitation and the Court may order accompanying conditions depending on the needs of the youths. This means that youths who are required to reside in places of detention and juvenile rehabilitation centres (JRCs) generally have higher risk behaviours, more complex needs or a weak family environment that does not support rehabilitation.

Ms Lim asked yesterday whether it is a case of discretion or whether it is mandatory when a youth offender has committed or is suspected of having committed serious offences in the Schedule or is a repeat offender, whether or not there is a discretion, the answer is yes.",35,270,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00270
2019-09-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"In terms of protecting the identity of young offenders, the State Courts continue to be able to issue gag orders to ensure the identity of the youth is not revealed by the media.",36,271,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00271
2019-09-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"The Youth Court, in making any order, must consider the needs of each youth and their risks of re-offending in future. The Youth Court typically calls for a pre-sentencing report to determine if the youth is suitable for probation or otherwise and weighs several factors, such as whether the youth has prior offences, the youth's behaviour in school, his relationship with peers, family circumstances, the availability and strength of familial and community support, are also important. Where there is adequate supervision, appropriate discipline and consistent parenting are also considered. After taking into consideration the risks and the needs of the youth, the Court can order a youth offender to undergo rehabilitation under a probation order or in a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre.",37,272,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00272
2019-09-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"In considering whether a youth requires reformative training, the Court would call for a suitability report to determine whether the youth's physical and mental condition is suitable for a Reformative Training Centre (RTC). The Youth Court would also consider whether the youth has demonstrated aggressive or violent behaviour, such as when the youth was remanded at the MSF Youth Homes. The youth may be assessed to have such a high risk of aggressive behaviour that it may not be safe for the youth to be detained in the JRC, especially if it may affect the safety or disrupt the rehabilitation of other youths in the JRC.",38,273,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00273
2019-09-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"The assessment of individual risk levels and the needs of the youth determines the regime and environment that best support his rehabilitation. Hence, in incidents involving more than one youth, it may be possible that the Youth Court may grant different orders as is needed for their rehabilitation. At the same time, parity in sentencing is vital to preserve and protect public confidence in the way justice is administered.",39,274,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00274
2019-09-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Sir, I cited yesterday the case of a 15-year-old resident with unruly and aggressive behaviour. While he was at the Singapore Boys’ Home, he repeatedly threatened youth guidance officers and intimidated other residents. He is burly, well-built at about 1.83 m tall – a head taller than I am – and, in one instance, he held his dormitory mate by the neck and lifted him off the ground, choking him. Fortunately, staff witnessed it and intervened immediately. And this is one out of many scenarios where our officers find it essential to be able to deploy the use of restraints and other measures quickly to safeguard other residents.",40,275,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00275
2019-09-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Let me share another example. Members may be aware that a serious incident took place at the Singapore Boys' Home last year. Seven residents physically assaulted an Auxiliary Police Officer and two MSF officers, inflicting serious injuries. The Auxiliary Police Officer suffered serious eye injury, while the two MSF officers suffered head injuries. Though all three officers are back at their workplace, we must reduce the risks of such incidents repeating. The Homes are places of rehabilitation, yes. I have described the complexity and the behaviours of the youths who are residing in the JRC. Because it is a rehabilitative environment, we have many youth guidance officers, psychologists, counsellors and therapists who need a safe environment to provide that rehabilitative support. Other youths there also need to be assured of their safety.",41,276,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00276
2019-09-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Mr Darryl David asked, therefore, whether we have the capability to handle older and bigger-built youths and much taller youths in MSF's Youth Homes. Ms Rahayu Mahzam and Ms Anthea Ong asked about the necessity of mechanical restraints. I think almost all Members raised this issue and I can understand your concern. Like I mentioned yesterday, they will not be used as a punitive measure. But Members will appreciate that there are, indeed, real-life situations where the use of such restraints is necessary to prevent escalation, escape or harm.",42,277,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00277
2019-09-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Let me assure Members that the MSF Youth Homes adopt a range of approaches to de-escalate and manage the youths of aggressive or violent behaviour when encountered. Youth home staff will attempt to verbally de-escalate tensions, calm down any aggressive residents and persuade them to cease aggresive behaviours. When suitable, the Youth Homes also use therapy or padded rooms to help calm agitated residents down. If a youth remains aggressive or the situation escalates despite our efforts to calm him down, MSF Youth Home staff will first verbally issue a warning. And if the youth persists, MSF staff will apply de-escalation techniques based on their training on management of actual or potential aggression, or MAPA, as mentioned by Ms Anthea Ong yesterday.",43,278,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00278
2019-09-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Only when absolutely necessary will our officers use restraints to manage the resident so as to minimise risks of injury to other residents or staff. As far as possible, it would be the Auxiliary Police Officers who will do so. But Mr Louis Ng will understand that, in some instances, given the situation, our officers may also have to respond to take appropriate action for the safety of residents and staff. MSF will put in place stringent procedures and processes in the use of restraints. This includes recording each use of the restraint and removing the restraint once the need has passed.",44,279,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00279

When we raised the age limit to below 18 at point of admission, some youths may remain in our care or custody till they are about 21 years old. There are various considerations in how we group the residents in the MSF Youth Homes. Their risks and needs are considered. Given the differing levels of maturity, the young ones are generally housed separately from the older youths at the MSF Youth Homes.",47,282,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00282
2019-09-04-T-008,Desmond Lee,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"As the older youths are at a different stage of development from the existing younger youths, our officers need to have adequate training and experience to address the different risks and needs of older youths. This includes being able to supervise and guide the youths in day-to-day activities, such as attending educational classes or playing sports in a group setting. This helps the youths to gain soft skills, which are important in interacting with youths of different ages. Ultimately, our intent is to facilitate their rehabilitation and reintegration with family and society at large.",48,283,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00283

In particular, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, Ms Anthea Ong and Ms Denise Phua spoke about providing early support for at-risk families, before their situations worsen. And I fully agree. Vulnerable individuals and families sometimes face complex challenges and require the support of multiple agencies and community organisations to help them regain stability. MSF has been working with our partners to transform our social services, integrate service delivery and strengthen last-mile support. The objective is to provide more comprehensive, convenient and coordinated support for these families.",49,284,2019-09-04-T-008-S-00284

Since KidSTART was piloted in July 2016, 1,000 children from low-income families have benefited.

She also wanted to know what options are available for children and families who are unable to engage lawyers. I would like to first emphasise our starting point that legal recourse ought to be a last resort. This is why we have programmes that divert youth offenders away from the Court system and why we are requiring families to attend the mandatory family programme before applying for a Family Guidance Order. But for cases that are before the Court, it is important to keep the law accessible and easy to understand.

I wonder if he could comment on whether the Ministry observes that cases where the authorities have had to intervene with alternative care arrangements, is this a phenomenon that is predominantly found in those with lower income?

As for whether there is segregation of children who are there for care and protection or there because of youth offending, that line is not drawn hard and fast, because, often, the underlying challenges that result in them having to reside in these homes are similar. The therapy, support and rehabilitation may be customisable for each child, but overall their services and programmes are run for all the youths in the home.

We must overcome global resource constraints, and ensure a safe and secure supply of critical resources such as water, food and other materials. Closing resource loops and turning waste into resource will reduce our vulnerability to global supply shocks. One way that this can be done is through urban mining. A research group from Tsinghua University in China has found that recovering resources like gold, copper and other metals from e-waste is 13 times cheaper than mining them. In the process we do not need to go back to nature to exploit and restore it. The World Economic Forum estimates that 50 million tonnes of e-waste, equivalent to 120,000 jumbo jets, are produced globally each year.

For Singapore companies to continue to thrive in the future economy, they must adapt to the growing constraints on carbon and other resources. Globally, a number of businesses are already taking the lead to adopt a more circular supply chain. This could entail using recycled materials as raw materials, extending the life of products or recovering resources from products at the end of life. Unilever has introduced post-consumer recycled waste materials into products such as dishwashing liquid detergent bottles, with some of their brands using 100% recycled PET packaging.

A main source of such packaging waste is made from plastic and, looking at the statistics over time, plastic waste disposed has gone way up from 540,800 tonnes in 2003 to 908,600 tonnes in 2018.

Therefore, the earliest this information will be reported will be in 2021, as noted in the news. In the meantime, how will NEA work to ensure that between now and 2021, the companies will actively work towards less packaging? Has there been any companies that have given information to the relevant agencies on this? Will this data be made public?",9,408,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00408
2019-09-04-T-009,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member),A clear benefit of releasing such data is to let relevant organisations use it for a Green Score system that allows companies to be judged on their efforts and targets to reduce packaging waste.

Mr Deputy Speaker, food waste looks to be a costly and big problem that we have yet to find an effective way to handle. The Singapore Environment Council indicated in a recent study that food loss contributes to an estimated $2.54 billion from farm to market within Singapore. Key waste statistics from NEA indicate that while food waste stands at 10% of all waste generated, recycling stands at 17% of the food waste generated in 2018.

As clause 4 of the Bill binds the Government on the provisions of the Bill, we could start from the Public Service to signal the seriousness that this Government takes in tackling a fundamental issue. How would the Public Service support efforts to reduce food waste internally? I have seen in a Straits Times Forum reply that SAF tries to keep food waste to a minimum. This could be extended to the whole of the Public Service, with a firm public commitment to lead by example and reduce food waste that it produces.

How about the ""karang guni"" men who also provide collection services? I am of the view that NEA should encourage ground-up initiatives from members of the public, NGOs and small shops to enable such recycling in conjunction with industry stakeholders.

As the small but burgeoning e-waste recycling industry will be boosted by the introduction of this framework, I hope some insights and assurances can be given on regulating precious metal recovery from e-waste. At this point, how do we ensure that the export of our e-waste for recycling purposes, such that the Basel Convention is compiled with, and that the e-waste do not end up in a black market overseas?

When something is thrown away, it does not disappear – it has to be disposed of somewhere or somehow.

We have already used up substantial areas in Choa Chu Kang, Lim Chu Kang and Lorong Halus as landfills. Pulau Semakau is currently a key landfill and we cannot afford to waste it. The current 157-hectare plot that we are using in Pulau Semakau can hold approximately 6,680 Olympic-sized swimming pools worth of ash. Last year, before incineration which reduces the volume by about 90%, we generated 15,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools of waste. Over the past 40 years, the amount of waste increased seven-fold, with food waste increasing 30% in the last 10 years. In fact, the current projected lifespan of Pulau Semakau is 2035 – 10 years earlier from previous estimates and only about 16 years from now.

2019-09-04-T-009,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Clause 14 requires retailers who deliver products to accept and dispose the old item. This would be especially useful for bulky electric products such as washing machines and fridges. Not only would this reduce the toxicity of waste going to our landfill, it will also be able to extract valuable minerals and materials from these used products, finding treasure in the trash. This will reduce the demand on mining and make these limited resources on the earth last longer.",5,430,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00430
2019-09-04-T-009,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In essence, we have a duty in Parliament to ensure we entrench a sustainable plan to protect our green environment, reduce plastic-usage, increase recycling, enhance upcycling. If done correctly, Singapore can be a global thought leader on this. It must be a united effort across all sectors of our society.",6,431,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00431
2019-09-04-T-009,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),Collection is the first step and there is a need to encourage and promote collection. This is done by requiring operators of the responsible producer scheme to hit a target collection in clause 30(c) and by requiring them to promote awareness of electronic waste disposal in clause 30(d).,7,432,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00432
2019-09-04-T-009,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"After collection, the waste needs to be dealt with properly. clause 12 requires producers to manage electric waste by becoming a member of a responsible producer scheme, which is regulated by Part 6 of the Bill. Furthermore, clause 17 makes it an offence for non-individuals to dispose regulated products as waste instead of through the licensed producer responsibility scheme, licensed waste collector or licensed e-waste recycler, or someone approved to collect e-waste. Even as the consequences are quite serious for non-compliance, would the Minister explain how will they work with and assist those arrested and affected understand how to comply with this legislation?",8,433,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00433
2019-09-04-T-009,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Furthermore, as this Bill addresses regulated products, would the Minister explain how this might affect e-commerce of electronic products and how are concerns that those required to accept or collect waste might become inequitably burdened by waste that they were not responsible for producing; that is, how are these concerns going to be addressed?",9,434,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00434
2019-09-04-T-009,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Besides electronic waste, another important source of waste that this Bill seeks to address is packaging waste. Part 4 institutes a reporting regime relating to packaging which requires producers of specified packaging to monitor its packaging waste and to think about ways to reduce, reuse or recycle packaging. These reports are to be submitted according to the years that the producers hit the prescribed limit.",10,435,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00435
2019-09-04-T-009,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The flexibility in such a scheme is good. It encourages producers to be aware of what they are producing, why they are producing it and how they can reduce it. Yet, on the other hand, producers figure out for themselves how to get to the end goal of reducing packaging waste, allowing them to prioritise what they are looking for in packaging, accommodating the variety of purposes packaging may serve for that product. For instance, drink powder sachets apportion the powder, make it portable, differentiate sachet contents and protects it from getting wet. Yet, on the other hand, more environmentally-friendly packaging such as paper-based packaging may serve similar functions instead.",11,436,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00436
2019-09-04-T-009,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Relating to recycling packaging, I have three questions. Firstly, does biodegradable plastic help our landfill problem or are they treated the same way as non-biodegradable plastic. If so, is it feasible to tweak our waste management system to better tap into the biodegradable ability of these biodegradable plastics? Second, what plans are there to increase our capability to recycle our own waste product, especially plastic waste. This is especially important since there are reports that recyclable waste is ending up incinerated. Thirdly, because trash can be treasures for a different product, how can Singapore tap into upcycling our waste and promoting a circular economy even though Singapore may not have a very big manufacturing sector ourselves?",12,437,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00437
2019-09-04-T-009,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The third kind of waste this Bill addresses is in Part 5, being food waste. Clause 26 requires building managers of certain kinds of buildings to provide their own food waste management facility within the premises. If that building is an existing building, clause 27(2) allows the food waste management process to be outsourced instead of being situated onsite but the food must still be segregated and treated. Although the building manager needs to provide such a facility, the duty is not left to the building's management alone. An occupier is compelled to make use of it through clause 25 which creates an offence for an occupier of such buildings to dispose food waste together with other types of waste if the food waste was generated in that building.",13,438,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00438
2019-09-04-T-009,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"While compelled by law to manage food waste, processing food waste on-site may actually save cost for management. This is what happened in Our Tampines Hub (OTH) where only one garbage compactor truck is needed daily, compared to three previously, saving the management about $40,000 annually. Because food was not left exposed overnight, pest and rodent problems are minimised. Food compost are used as fertilisers and non-potable water used for cleaning the eco-digester, rubbish bins or bin centres.",14,439,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00439
2019-09-04-T-009,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Would the Ministry kindly elaborate on who are the intended prescribed buildings? Would they include shopping malls and hawker centres? Additionally, since there is great benefit in composting food waste, does the Ministry have plans to extend food waste management systems to residential estates or make such food waste management facilities accessible to non-occupants of the prescribed building?",15,440,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00440
2019-09-04-T-009,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Besides dealing with food waste through a food waste management system, there is a need to minimise food contaminating recyclable items. Perhaps the Ministry could consider requiring regular dustbins be situated near recycling bins so that the inconsiderate actions of a few will not hamper the recycling efforts of the majority. What is being done to increase recycling literacy and how effective has it been?",16,441,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00441
2019-09-04-T-009,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, in conclusion, while we increase efforts to reduce packaging and recycle food and electronic waste, what we need is renewed mindsets. For example, is the measure of unusability whether something is old and faded rather than spoilt and inoperable? Instead of reusing old mindsets, maybe we should discard them to have new ones – new ones that help us be content with what we have; new ones that help us prioritise responsible disposal over personal convenience; new ones that promote conscientious stewardship of our landfill over more short-sighted enjoyment of the temporal, without caring about the future. We need to change the way we conceptualise, handle and create waste. This Bill provides the important infrastructural support for that change, and therefore, I support it.",17,442,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00442
2019-09-04-T-009,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, alarm bells have been ringing around the world about the Climate Emergency facing our planet. The Prime Minister addressed the Climate Emergency in his National Day Rally speech recently. Even before this Climate Emergency, Singapore has been facing a Waste Emergency for decades now.

2019-09-04-T-009,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"There is a lot of discussion about the circular economy approach to addressing the problematic waste streams.

2019-09-04-T-009,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),Is this ambitious enough for the Waste Emergency we are facing?

2019-09-04-T-009,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),The first is that the treatment of the three waste streams does not address the issue of transnational waste cycles.,6,448,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00448
2019-09-04-T-009,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The second is that the treatment of the food waste stream is too focused on the waste itself and neglects the upstream causes of food waste, including the way we eat.",7,449,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00449
2019-09-04-T-009,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),The third is that our public education approach is still stuck in the communication campaign model and neglects the more effective model of targeting problem areas smartly by social nudging.,8,450,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00450
2019-09-04-T-009,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The first issue is transnational waste streams. With regard to e-waste, the current framework targets producers of electronic and electrical goods with retail presence here in Singapore and also retail companies selling these goods. This is still based on the brick-and-mortar economy.",9,451,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00451
2019-09-04-T-009,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"However, the trend is for consumers to order their electronic goods online. And it is not uncommon for small to medium-sized goods to be shipped from overseas these days through micro-retailers utilising online platforms to connect with consumers. How would the Extended Producer Responsibility framework apply to these micro-retailers and overseas producers? How would the e-waste from these production-consumption streams be audited and factored into the EPR system? These are not trivial questions as we should expect online shopping and transnational delivery to increase in scope and scale as technologies improve and society evolves.",10,452,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00452
2019-09-04-T-009,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),The same applies to packaging waste. Online shopping and transnational delivery mean more packaging would be used to ensure goods are not damaged by extended shipping. The current framework targets producers of packaging and packaged produces with annual turnover of more than $10 million.,11,453,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00453
2019-09-04-T-009,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),What percentage of packaging waste do these producers account for?

2019-09-04-T-009,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The other major problem is the fact that we export 30% of our recyclable waste to countries including Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand for processing. Some of these countries are closing their doors to waste import, while there have been cases of waste dumping and e-waste pollution hurting local communities that give a bad name to countries that export waste like Singapore.",13,455,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00455

2019-09-04-T-009,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Food waste also has a transnational dimension. The recent study by the Singapore Environment Council shows that one-fifth of total food in Singapore, over 390,000 tonnes of fresh produce, is wasted in the food supply chain.

2019-09-04-T-009,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The second issue is that we need to go upstream to tackle the food waste, from tackling wastage in the food supply chain to the way the nation eats.

2019-09-04-T-009,Daniel Goh Pei Siong,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"I mentioned the significant amount of food lost in the importing food chain. One solution is to increase local production to supply food. To this end, the Government is targeting to increase local production to meet 30% of local nutritional needs by 2030. Increasing local food production will create other problems of food lost and wasted during the production process. MEWR should therefore look at this area and encourage the reusing of food lost during the production process as animal feed or their recycling into compost for farming.",18,460,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00460

I understand that when the Tuas Nexus comes online in 2025, food waste and used water sludge will be co-digested to produce biogas for energy production. Does this mean the trade-off is that we will not be benefitting from composting food waste instead? Are the options for food waste treatment either co-digestion to product biogas or composting to produce fertiliser? If so, what are the calculations of MEWR in choosing co-digestion rather than composting, since the production of compost fertiliser could benefit local farming?",19,461,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00461

Convenience has become the norm that need no explanation when it comes to demand for Government and municipal services. To reduce littering, we make throwing rubbish convenient by placing green rubbish bins all over the city. To promote a hygienic environment, we make garbage disposal convenient by building rubbish chutes in each home or on each floor.

It is not a populist move with little systemic impact.

2019-09-04-T-009,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),Time is not on our side. Please allow me to propose further measures that must be implemented to signal the urgency.,5,482,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00482
2019-09-04-T-009,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"First, Mr Deputy Speaker, smart targets and goals. Having companies simply report on their plans to reduce, reuse or recycle products in the Bill is insufficient. Reporting obligations have no bite if it is not accompanied by waste production limits and recycling targets for producers. We must set SMART goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound so the producers can plan and prepare accordingly.",6,483,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00483
2019-09-04-T-009,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"For example, the European Union Packaging Directive 2018 sets that by 2025, 65% by weight of all packaging must be recycled, with specific recycling targets for each material, such as 50% for plastic and 75% for paper and cardboard. By 2030, the target for recycled packaging is increased to 70%, including 55% for plastic and 85% of paper and cardboard.",7,484,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00484
2019-09-04-T-009,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Such reduction targets can be achieved with ingenuity. In 2018, Unilever launched a 3-litre bottle for their Omo laundry detergent brand in Brazil, with a formula at six times the concentration of the original, so it can be diluted in people’s homes. This has reduced the volume of plastic used by 75%. Companies must also inform customers about maintenance and repair services, environmental impacts and materials. Retailers should also actively inform customers of sustainable products. We can emulate the ambitious target setting and look to have companies report their progress on waste minimisation year-on-year via a measure of waste per unit of product output.",8,485,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00485
2019-09-04-T-009,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Second, we must encourage public accountability and corporate stewardship by mandating these reports to be made public. Currently, the Singapore Exchange listing rules already has sustainability reporting guidelines but with no specific metrics prescribed. If we would like to see resource sustainability as a core part of doing business, it would seem sensible to stipulate the targets above as a standard reporting requirement for all listed companies. I understand that the Hong Kong Stock Exchange had a recent consultation on ESG reporting to one, ""require disclosure of significant climate-related issues"" and two, amend the ""Environmental"" key performance indicators to require disclosure of relevant targets.",9,486,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00486
2019-09-04-T-009,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Third, to escalate the adoption of sustainability mindset and ensure affordability, we could incentivise producers and retailers with tax rebates, so that these obligations do not merely end in increased costs for reporting and collection, and the possibility of penalty – all of which will ultimately be passed on to the consumers. In China and Thailand, the EPR schemes introduced subjected companies producing non-biodegradable goods to taxes and offered tax credits as incentives for companies that used waste as raw materials.",10,487,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00487
2019-09-04-T-009,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Finally, if we want to reduce our resource footprint, we need to broaden the notion of sustainability. Singapore's Earth Overshoot Day for 2019 was 12 April 2019. This means that if the world consumed like us, we would be consuming three times as much resources as the earth can regenerate in a given year.",11,488,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00488
2019-09-04-T-009,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"If we were to drive true resource sustainability we not only have to compel producers to reduce packaging, and have mandatory take-back programmes, we need electronics producers and retailers to be truly incentivised to extend product lifetimes, ensure maintenance and repair services availability. This is an area where legislation is fast moving in the EU. For example, in France, planned obsolescence of an electronic product is a criminal offence. There are also on-going discussions in the EU that expected product lifetime be labelled.",12,489,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00489
2019-09-04-T-009,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Mr Deputy Speaker, as we discuss these measures to address the climate crisis, we must not miss the tremendous opportunity to reduce and redistribute the phenomenal 763,100 tonnes of food waste generated every year can provide for a more climate-just outcome for the 400,000 food-insecure people in Singapore. Let me caveat this number as an estimate deliberation from the 2017/2018 household expenditure survey.",13,490,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00490
2019-09-04-T-009,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Let me illustrate why I think this is a tremendous opportunity and that the Zero Waster Masterplan must not be looked at in solo from the social challenges we have. Of the 763,000 tonnes of food loss a year, let us assume conservatively that half of them, or 382,000 tonnes, can be salvaged and redistributed. One meal, conservatively, uses 1 kg and, therefore, we will get about 382 million meals from the redistributable food loss. Each person eats 1,095 daily meals a year, which is to say, we can safely feed about 390,000 people a year. That means, Mr Deputy Speaker, this food loss every year could provide food security for all our vulnerable groups! I shared this in my speech during the debate on the Singapore Food Agency Bill as well. I know this is a simple calculation but I think we get the point.",14,491,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00491
2019-09-04-T-009,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Prime Minister Lee sounded a clarion call for Singapore to recognise the threat that climate change poses to us. We must never forget that for most of the world, Singapore included, the most vulnerable amongst us will be hit hardest. Climate change is already affecting rice production in the Mekong Delta. As temperature rises changes agriculture productivity and sea level rises, food availability will inevitably be affected. For the 400,000 food-insecure people in Singapore, any price increase is detrimental.",15,492,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00492

Its volunteers collect a staggering 1,500 kg of unsold fresh produce once a week from Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre. Sometimes, they collect twice a week for a total of 2,500 kg of unsold fresh produce. Five hundred to 700 kg of that goes to charities, namely, Free Food For All, Beyond Social Services and St Theresa's Home that feed the needy, while the rest is sent to a soup kitchen in Little India, Krishna's Kitchen. The soup kitchen processes the vegetables and turns them into meals to feed the hungry, especially migrant workers in the Little India area. About 200 kg ends up with a community initiative in Marine Terrace – just down the road from where I live – and one of the six public community fridges, benefiting low-income residents.",16,493,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00493
2019-09-04-T-009,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"And we can do even more, and we need to do so urgently and systemically. We can shape food-loss-reducing behaviours by changing our food labelling policies and also enacting the Good Samaritan laws. In Singapore, ""use by"", ""sell by"", ""expiry date"" and ""best before"" all mean expiry date, according to the Singapore Food Agency. Products are not allowed to be sold or distributed in Singapore past that date. This is, therefore, a huge source of food waste.",17,494,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00494

2019-09-04-T-009,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,  Singapore has had a long-standing commitment to sustainability. In fact, our journey towards sustainability started in the 1960s, when our late Mr Lee Kuan Yew laid down the foundations for a clean and green Singapore, even before it was trendy to be green. Even as we grappled with a fledgling economy and uncertain times, we consciously moved towards cleaner sources of energy, dedicated our resources to cleaning up our major waterways, as well as growing our Garden City. We must continue this legacy.",1,509,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00509
2019-09-04-T-009,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Sustainability is anchored in our ability to identify solutions that creatively minimise the trade-offs we have to make. And yet, allow us to achieve longer term goals in multiple domains. In Singapore, it is a commitment to balanced growth that benefits both the current and future generations, as well as a commitment to creating a high-quality living environment. Often, such sustainability solutions require that we are able to see different, seemingly disjointed parts of our economy and society function as part of an integrated, inter-connected ecosystem. Therefore, changes to the law to better manage how Singapore handles waste, and to help businesses that reduce and recycle electronic waste, packaging waste and food leftovers are a good first step.",2,510,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00510
2019-09-04-T-009,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Singapore is particularly vulnerable to global disruptions caused by climate change. The Amazon – a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming – has seen more than 80,000 fires break out so far this year. It is a 77% rise, compared to the same period in 2018. A change in weather patterns likely contributed to this. Urgent action is, therefore, needed.",3,511,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00511
2019-09-04-T-009,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"While we cannot solve the Amazon problem, we can and still must play our part here in Singapore. The Resource Sustainability Bill is a good attempt to create a long-term solution to complement individual efforts in the 3Rs by placing more responsibility on businesses and producers in the supply chain to reduce, reuse and recycle. This aim is also in line with the Government’s international obligations and reflects our support for the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals which were adopted in 2015.",4,512,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00512
2019-09-04-T-009,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"The Bill could also positively impact workers in providing new avenues for job creation.

2019-09-04-T-009,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"However, we note that this Bill could also affect businesses negatively through changes to existing jobs and companies' processes. In the short term, companies could face increased compliance costs. This could be especially challenging in today’s global economy. This could potentially translate to cost-cutting measures felt by workers or consumers. In the longer term, companies may have to restructure their internal processes to reduce costs and promote innovation and sustainability.",7,515,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00515
2019-09-04-T-009,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"So, I would like to check with the Minister how will the Ministry support businesses and workers through these short-term and long-term changes. Specifically, should there be extensions and/or staggering of timelines to encourage compliance by companies and time for workers to adapt? Do we expect to provide time also for workers to take on the necessary training? We should aim to enable workers to keep their jobs while ensuring that this process continues. In addition, we also cannot leave our SMEs behind. Can more assistance be provided to the smaller one who might struggle to afford the resources for compliance? Could grants be provided to smaller companies to help them comply? The Labour Movement will support workers through this transition. It is prepared to work with the Ministry to help our workers and companies adapt to this change.",8,516,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00516

How does the Ministry intend for these retailers to provide these physical collection points when they do not have any physical stores?",8,529,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00529
2019-09-04-T-009,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"In addition, the stipulations of paragraphs 14 and 15 are likely to cause large retailers of electrical and electronic appliances to incur additional costs.

2019-09-04-T-009,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"First, the Government should consider providing grants or tax breaks.

2019-09-04-T-009,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Second, the Government can look into the possibility of renting industrial buildings to these retailers at subsidised prices if they are used for waste disposal processes, such as consolidation or sorting. We can learn from the state government of Victoria, Australia, which provides grants and funding for programmes contributing to sustainability, including infrastructure. In particular, one of the grants, known as the Resource Recovery Infrastructure Fund, aims to improve the collection, sorting and recycling of processed materials. It has allocated A$19.1 million since 2017. It has proven successful, with an estimated reduction in 900,000 tons of landfill waste per year. We can learn from the Victorian government in incentivising the creation of waste disposal infrastructure in our nation.",12,533,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00533
2019-09-04-T-009,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Third, the Government should set up an online National Registry of Producers and Regulated Products. This will not only help businesses in reducing costs associated with developing their own systems to monitor and track these products, but will also help the Government in aggregating data on a national scale. This will help it to identify ways in which schemes can be improved upon, and programmes introduced, in order to ramp up sustainability efforts.",13,534,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00534
2019-09-04-T-009,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"It is not sufficient to simply assign the responsibility to businesses. The contributions of businesses in efforts, such as carrying energy-efficient appliances, promoting the purchase of these, providing attractive trade-in deals to incentivise consumers to use energy-efficient products, and setting up more e-waste recycling points are bound to aid in sustainability. However, the pursuit of sustainability should be a collective effort by Singaporeans from all walks of life.",14,535,2019-09-04-T-009-S-00535
2019-09-04-T-009,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"There are drawbacks to imposing the bulk of responsibility on the retailers. First, this will result in rising business expenditures for the retailers. In turn, they will pass on these increased costs to consumers.

2019-09-04-T-011,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"This Bill takes an important step towards greater sustainability for our environment in legislating better ways of tackling ever increasing amounts of waste generated in Singapore, with the biggest groups being the ones targeted in this Bill, namely e-waste, packaging waste and food waste.

Can the Ministry review processes and facilitate cooperation among stakeholders to take advantage of economies of scale to minimise duplication of routes, maximise storage efficiency and so forth? In addition, the expected high prices on goods are not quite fair to consumers who are not disposing of any items. Can this be rectified? Sir, in Mandarin.",4,603,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00603

In order to ensure that recovery costs remain at an affordable level for businesses and consumers, can the authorities assist all parties to cooperate fully to reduce costs? Customers who do not need recycling should not pay a higher fee. Can this be rectified?",5,604,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00604

I am astounded by the amount of unnecessary packaging used at supermarkets.

2019-09-04-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Sir, I took a look at the history of recycling as a topic of debate in Parliament. If you exclude the recycling of water, the first time Parliament debated the merits of recycling was in the 1983 Budget debate. The hon Member Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee suggested that EDB set up industries to recycle industrial waste. Recycling was quiescent for some years after, but has been resurrected of late. I think the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources must feel that recycling has been debated at nearly every other Sitting in the last few years.",2,636,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00636

2019-09-04-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"I submit that recycling was hardly discussed from independence through the 1980s because we were not rich yet. Recycling is both the necessity of the poor and the luxury of the rich. It was obvious to the post-Independence Singaporean that our appliances – our TVs, radios, fridges and stoves, had to be repaired, refurbished, reused for as long as possible. It was obvious that letting food spoil today meant less food on the table tomorrow. Within our lifetime, many of us remember a vibrant, privately organised recycling industry for many of the wastes targeted by this Bill. The karang guni men had a good trade in fixing and recycling scrap. Even food waste was collected for use by the pig farmers.",4,638,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00638
2019-09-04-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"So, why did that grassroots recycling system break down? The problem is the economics. The value of scrap materials are low and the costs of new manufacture are also low. Meanwhile, the cost of labor required to repair, refurbish, or re-purpose waste has increased significantly. Consider the problem of plastic bottles. Members will remember when soft drinks were sold in glass bottles. When you finished your drink, the glass bottle would be collected and it would be washed and refilled at the factory. This practice has ceased because the costs of refilling have become too high, compared to the cost of providing single-use plastic or glass bottles.",5,639,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00639
2019-09-04-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Sir, it is really a problem of prices. The goods that we consume – from consumer appliances to bottled drinks to food – they have no price attached to reflect the problems that their disposal will create. Even in countries where bottle deposits and other taxes are applied to encourage recycling, the prices appear to be incorrect and too low.",6,640,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00640

As the Economist pointed out in an article on June 15, 2019, and I quote  ""There is no point collecting recyclable waste unless someone is willing to buy it and actually do the recycling. Until late 2017 China was the world’s biggest importer of scrap by far.

2019-09-04-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"So, what is heartening about this Bill and the Masterplan is that it confronts these economic realities squarely for the most part.

Now, I wish to discuss the three areas of focus in the Bill – Electrical and electronic equipment waste, packaging and food waste.",9,643,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00643
2019-09-04-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"First, let me commend the Extended Producer Responsibility Framework. Electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) producers simply have little incentive to consider seriously how their products will be disposed off at end of life. It is efficient that they should bear responsibility for managing the life cycle costs of their products.",10,644,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00644
2019-09-04-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"My only concern here, is how the regulatory cost will affect competition in this sector. Sir, the retail sector for EEE is very diverse, ranging from large branded retailers to small and medium enterprises. Many retailers now operate largely or exclusively online. Many of them are foreign retailers. The distribution channels are also diverse. While many brands only have a few authorised retailers in Singapore, parallel imports are common. This competition has been good for Singaporeans. We should ensure that regulation preserves competition as far as possible, while ensuring that retailers live up to their responsibilities.",11,645,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00645
2019-09-04-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"The question is how the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Framework can be customised for the needs and business models of the different stakeholders in the EEE retail space. At the moment, large EEE retailers are the focus of regulation. They will be expected to facilitate the disposal of e-waste for any products they supply. For example, section 15 provides that large retailers must offer in-store collection facilities.",12,646,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00646
2019-09-04-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Because collection of e-waste is not – and should not – be tied to new sales, large retailers are essentially providing a public service by using their scarce retail space. If all retailers were large, this would not distort competition, because all would be facing the same burden. But smaller retailers and online retailers appear that they will escape this particular responsibility. How, then, can we ensure that all retailers face the same regulatory costs?",13,647,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00647
2019-09-04-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"One possibility is to impose the appropriate, pre-paid disposal fee on new EEE products at the point of sale in Singapore, regardless how they are supplied. While the administrative burden may at first seem significant, especially for smaller retailers, the economics of scale of market platforms today means that a high proportion of EEE products are actually retailed or sold through only one of a few websites. While I understand there may be reluctance to impose new Government fees, the EPR will in any case result in costs for retailers, which will be passed on to consumers. What is more important is that competition is preserved for consumers as this could more than offset any increases in cost.",14,648,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00648
2019-09-04-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Next, the problem of excessive packaging. I see the problem of excess packaging, at least for consumer goods, as essentially a coordination failure. Packaging is cheap, but branding is valuable. Retailers would prefer to use less packaging but, because, we often believe attractive packaging is a sign of a product's quality, we encourage retailers to compete on how elaborate their packaging is. Those who have visited Japan know that the Japanese, despite their attention to recycling, are completely buried in excessive packaging.",15,649,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00649

Sir, it is common to frame the problem of sustainability as one of a consumerist culture, as if changing our culture, or refusing plastic straws, is the obvious solution to the sustainability problem. I think we need to recognise the central role of prices and regulation, in setting our behaviour on a more sustainable path.",23,657,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00657
2019-09-04-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"I agree there are some cultural practices that resist economic explanation, that harm sustainability. For example, our preference for meat products instead of vegetable or insect protein, that is a leading factor in unsustainable consumption. Impossible Foods and Beyond Burger, which market meat-free burger patties that taste like beef made headlines in Singapore and throughout the world. I found this incredible, because Chinese vegetarians have been producing all manner of mock meats for centuries. There is nothing new there, but clever marketing. There is potential, therefore, to change our food culture, but I daresay the Government will not want to be the one to tell us to order ""Mee Siam, mai (or minus) cockroach"". Perhaps, it is best to leave that to the private sector.",24,658,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00658
2019-09-04-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"There is also much interest in behavioural interventions to promote recycling and more consideration for the environment. These are all valuable interventions. Consumer recycling, for example, seems to be strongly driven by social norms, since recycling rates vary widely across the world, even in the absence of strong local regulations. The planned improvements in recycling signs for our blue bins will no doubt enhance recycling rates by providing more salient information to households on how to recycle. Social norms interventions, where people are told how their consumption patterns compare with that of their neighbors, have also been shown to generate sustained reductions in energy usage in large-scale randomised trials.",25,659,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00659
2019-09-04-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"But we should resist the temptation to believe that education and behavioural interventions alone can generate sustained change in consumption habits or eliminate a ""throwaway culture"". The throwaway culture exists because it is cheap, Sir. This basic underpricing and lack of regulation of unsustainable resources must stop. We should not believe that sustainability branding can overcome basic economics. At some point this year, I think every organisation gave out a reusable bag or a reusable bottle. The problem, of course, is that this is inefficient if we do not re-use such bags or bottles often enough. The UK Environment Agency in 2006 estimated that a cotton bag requires reuse 131 times in the best case scenario to equal one single-use plastic bag. So, let us replace branding exercises with hard policy decisions.",26,660,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00660
2019-09-04-T-011,Walter Theseira,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Sir, we will always have the true believers who do everything they can to minimise waste. We must salute them. We would benefit tremendously from increasing their numbers. But for the rest of us, it is a price effect. I admit to failing to set an example in how I live. I may care about the environment but I drive, I fly and I use air-conditioning. I would do this less if the prices went up. To try to make amends I bought solar power, which is more expensive. I have tried to eat less meat but I cannot bring myself to eat insects just yet. I am only human but I am trying to be better.",27,661,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00661

2019-09-04-T-011,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Mr Deputy Speaker, it is timely that we discuss the issue of waste management and resource sustainability today. The Prime Minister highlighted the importance of climate change during the National Day Rally. In fact, there is enough evidence to suggest that the threat is bigger and sooner than 50 to 100 years away.",1,663,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00663
2019-09-04-T-011,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Climate science is imperfect in its predictions but all their errors have been to consistently under-estimate the negative impact.

2019-09-04-T-011,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Climate change is a complex issue with many facets. For Singapore, we may think that as a small nation, what we do would not really have an impact on the global stage. But that is not to say that we can afford to ignore the consequences of our own actions. Climate change and rising seas are existential threats to Singapore. We need to do the right thing so that we can have the moral authority to voice out in international fora for bigger nations to also do their part to fight climate change.",3,665,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00665
2019-09-04-T-011,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"The first issue I wish to touch on is e-waste. Minister Masagos Zukifli rightly pointed out and I quote ""e-waste is very toxic, people underestimate the toxicity of the e-waste that we dispose of and for the longest time we were not processing it."" According to a UN report, only 20% of e-waste is recycled; 80% of e-waste is dumped in landfills. But even for the 20% that is supposedly recycled, they are not actually recycled, but shipped overseas to be treated instead. This is a hypocrisy that many governments will not admit to because they are busy winning the green voters. But this comes at an enormous environmental cost to the importing countries and to their populations.",4,666,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00666
2019-09-04-T-011,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Prior to 2018, most of the world's e-waste ended up in China. However, China's National Sword policy kicked in in early 2018. The policy bans various types of plastic, paper and solid waste from being exported to China. It sent shock waves through the global recyclables market. Waste started piling up in exporting countries, even in parking lots. The changes resulted in waste being diverted to Southeast Asian countries, whose ports and facilities were ill-prepared to receive them in such high volume. This created massive challenges for their environment. As a result, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia begun to enact their own restrictions.",5,667,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00667
2019-09-04-T-011,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"So, the National Sword has several important implications for Singapore. To the extent that we are unable to recycle our own waste and rely on exports, this creates a bottleneck in the system. Can the Minister assure us that Singapore has the necessary facilities to treat e-waste and will not be exporting our problems to the rest of the world? A second risk is pollution incidents resulting from the increased volume of waste being treated, particularly in Malaysia. Can the Minister also assure us that a pollution incident in Johor will not easily threaten our water supply?",6,668,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00668
2019-09-04-T-011,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"My next point is on packaging. Reducing packaging waste should be a win-win for all. As a consumer, I am often amazed by the almost comical amount of packaging that can surround one small device. One computer mouse or one thumbdrive can be surrounded by packaging four to five times its size. This has consequences. We see increasing reports of fish or whales that are dying because their stomachs are full of plastic. According to the World Economic Forum, there will be most plastic than fish in our seas by the year 2050. Reducing waste would help producers save money while also saving the earth. Everybody wins.",7,669,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00669
2019-09-04-T-011,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"So, while it is great that there is a requirement for producers of waste to submit plans to reduce, recycle or reuse the waste that they generate. I hope the Minister can go further by prescribing a hard limit on the amount of waste to be reduced. We do not seem to mandate reductions in the amount of packaging waste per dollar of product. Should we be doing more to move the needle and aggressively drive down the amount of packaging waste produced?",8,670,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00670
2019-09-04-T-011,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"For example, when the US introduced fuel efficiency targets for US car-markers, they pushed for an aggressive improvement. They wanted to go from around 30 miles per gallon in 2011 to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Will the Minister consider mandatory waste reduction guidelines?",9,671,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00671
2019-09-04-T-011,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"My last point is on food waste. It is another area that is causing a big concern. According to the UN Food and Agricultural Organization, around 30% of the world's food production is lost or wasted annually. Apart from the economic and human cost, this has massive environmental impact as well.",10,672,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00672
2019-09-04-T-011,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"In this Bill, the focus is on building managers to provide separate food waste disposal, to treat the food waste or send it to a licensed waste disposal facility. Would it be cheaper and more effective for the Government to provide this service in bulk through a regulated service provider and charge for this service? If this is instead done piecemeal privately, is there a risk of higher costs? Even worse, would we be creating a bigger carbon footprint if transport is not efficient?",11,673,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00673
2019-09-04-T-011,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Overall, I laud this Bill as a good first step as it makes it easier to extract usable bio-resources from our waste, which can then be used to produce biogas or electricity. But the same question applies here  can we not be do more to reduce waste?",12,674,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00674
2019-09-04-T-011,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"In conclusion, as the father of two young children who could live to see the turn of the next century, I feel that have to ask ourselves if the measures in this Bill are necessary, but ultimately, not sufficient. Are we merely arranging deckchairs on the Titanic, while accelerating towards an iceberg? Yes, as a small country, our total waste is relatively small compared to the global total. We need to ask if we can do more to help the rest of the world reduce or deal with waste.",13,675,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00675
2019-09-04-T-011,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Technology and innovation are two assets that Singapore can leverage on. Can we encourage our companies to develop technologies to help to manage waste? These can range from better biodegradable materials to solutions to help manage waste at source, for example, distributed gasification system to treat waste locally at each HDB precinct. As the waste problem grows globally, mastering technology in this domain can create a competitive advantage for Singapore businesses looking to expand globally.",14,676,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00676
2019-09-04-T-011,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"I remember past stories of companies being lauded for launching sustainable businesses, such as local food waste recycler IUT Global.

As a nation, this is also an opportunity for us to take the lead on the international stage.",15,677,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00677

There are real trade-offs, impacting real lives, today. Therefore, we must be practical in implementing it, focus on the most impactful ones, instead of the most fashionable.

For example, one of the largest usage of global energy is for heating and air-conditioning. And investing in better insulation and air-flow design is not just impactful in reducing emission, but it even pays off financially, factoring in the investment cost. In financial terms, it is Net Present Value positive. And even better so if Singaporeans can think about how to minimise the use of air-conditioning.",6,685,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00685

2019-09-04-T-011,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"First, the call to recycle large electrical and electronics equipment is a good move. These may not be a very large source of waste, but they contain very toxic components. I agree with the Government's effort to focus on larger sellers, get service providers to provide recycling service and to provide our businesses with sufficient time to adapt.  The definition of larger sellers seems to be focused on larger retailers with more than 300 sqm space and this is a reasonable definition.",9,688,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00688

And whether large online sellers, such as Dell, Lazada, Alibaba, or those e-shops within these platforms, are they included in this? Because it is not fair to put all the burden on the retail sellers.",10,689,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00689

2019-09-04-T-011,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"One way to ensure careful implementation is to get the inputs from international environmental experts as well as major packaging companies, retailers and logistics players on what is practical and what can be reasonably done, because sometimes, there are real trade-off involved. For example, many fresh produce that we see in Singapore from Malaysia, they are pre-packed into smaller packs prior to them being sent to Singapore. However, if we take the view that we should reduce packaging and discourage smaller packs from being imported, then we have to do the bulk-breaking in Singapore. And given our high cost of labour, it will mean higher cost, which the consumers will end up paying for.",12,691,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00691

2019-09-04-T-011,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to focus on the food waste part of this Bill. In preparation for this speech, I researched on some information regarding food waste in Singapore; particularly at the NEA website. And like Members who have spoken before me, I do find the food waste situation very worrying.",1,713,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00713
2019-09-04-T-011,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Firstly, I was very disturbed to learn that the amount of food waste generated in Singapore has increased at an alarming rate of 40% per year over the last 10 years. And this is expected to increase further with our growing population, economic activity and affluence. Despite earlier efforts to promote conservation of food, food waste is still mounting year by year.",2,714,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00714
2019-09-04-T-011,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The second worrying fact is that only 17% of the food waste that we generate gets to be recycled. In other words, the main bulk of our unconsumed food ends up mostly in our usual rubbish trash and is eventually sent for incineration. Whether from the food resource optimisation or from public health standpoint, the current state of affairs on food waste is not sustainable. We are not doing justice to our precious food source. I am glad that the Government is making policy moves now to reduce and manage food waste.",3,715,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00715
2019-09-04-T-011,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In my view, the key contributing factor to this situation is, firstly, the lack of awareness to prevent and reduce food waste at its source; and secondly, the lack of food waste treatment infrastructure in Singapore.",4,716,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00716
2019-09-04-T-011,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, let me touch on the second point first, which is primarily addressed by this Bill, that is, to require mandatory food waste segregation by large food waste generators. The approach is to initially target commercial and industrial buildings that generate large amounts of food waste, such as large hotels, malls, as well as industrial facilities that house food manufacturers and caterers. I agree with this approach, as a start, essentially focusing on the big food waste generators where it can move the needle in terms of food waste recycling. The industry needs to comply with this new requirement by 2024.",5,717,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00717
2019-09-04-T-011,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"While I support these new measures, I would also like to ask the Minister  how difficult would it be for the businesses to implement these regulations? Are the costs likely to be very high to the businesses? Can I also ask if there are already existing premises that adopt food segregation practices onsite? What are the results and benefits so far? For example, how successful have we been to recover energy from food waste? Beyond expanding the practice to the industrial and commercial spaces, does the Government intend to expand the practice of recycling food to residential areas as well?",6,718,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00718
2019-09-04-T-011,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Back to my first point with regard to the lack of awareness in the area of prevention and reduction of food waste, I strongly believe that more can be done. I read in some studies that, on average, about one-third of all the food produced for human consumption is not consumed but actually wasted. This is not only a waste of money for businesses and consumers, it is also costing the earth and worsening global warming.",7,719,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00719
2019-09-04-T-011,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"When food is wasted, even more food is needed to be produced to meet the demand. Consequently, the resources used to cultivate, deliver and distribute the food will also go to waste.",8,720,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00720
2019-09-04-T-011,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Every one of us contributes to this wastage in some way  the food producers, the food businesses, as well as all of us individually – the consumers.

2019-09-04-T-011,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Whilst today's Bill would in a large way address the food waste recycling and treatment issues, more can be done in the area of prevention and reduction of food waste, and I hope that the Government can play a more instrumental role here and continue to look at more game-changing policy measures to reduce food waste, working closely with the industries and community stakeholders.",11,723,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00723
2019-09-04-T-011,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"We have read about the many ways and ideas how we could reduce food waste. I am sure we will continue to come up with and discover more new ways. For example, with the advent of technology and data, we should leverage on more digital means to better match the supply and production of food with the demand and consumption of food. Often, there is over production of food due to misreading or misjudging of consumers' demand. If there are more digital channels to place order for food, mobile apps to plan our meals and so on, businesses and producers would be able to better right-size their production and reduce food wastage. Hopefully, this could lead to cost reduction, possibly benefiting consumers when there is sufficient competition.",12,724,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00724
2019-09-04-T-011,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, the foremost priority here, hence, must be to minimise the food produced that is not consumed. If we can reduce food waste as a major thrust of our efforts, it is half the battle won. The other half of the battle would be to look at how we can reuse and recycle the food where possible.",13,725,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00725
2019-09-04-T-011,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Cutting food waste requires both system and regulatory changes, as well as lifestyle and cultural changes. For example, mooncake was just mentioned by Members – we tend to give and receive multiple boxes of mooncakes from one another. It is really a waste in most cases. Also, the 10-course dinners that we have – do we really need an eight- or 10-course dinner? Often, it would lead to more food waste, as well as over consumption – both undesirable.",14,726,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00726
2019-09-04-T-011,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Earlier in the year, I read in the news about this year-long drive as part of the Towards Zero Waste campaign where consumers are encouraged at food outlets to, firstly, order what we eat; secondly, ask for less rice or noodle if unable to eat that much; and thirdly, say ""no"" to side dishes that we will not consume.",15,727,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00727
2019-09-04-T-011,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"While I applaud this worthy initiative, I have not seen this message reaching out to enough people. Many people that I saw at food centres continue to not practise the three suggestions mentioned. There has been actually no noticeable impact in my view. I urge the Government to do more and step up the campaign so that more people are conscious of this effort that we should do our part to reduce waste. Sir, with that, I add my support to the Bill.",16,728,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00728

On the one hand, doing more and moving faster will allow us to better care for the environment as the threat of climate change is ever growing. Members like Mr Louis Ng and Ms Anthea Ong have given various ideas that we can consider moving forward. On the other hand, we need to be mindful of costs to businesses and consumers.",2,731,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00731

Hence, we have adopted a pragmatic approach to achieve our environmental goals, while managing the impact on businesses and consumers. Let me outline this approach.",3,732,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00732
2019-09-04-T-011,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"First, in developing the regulatory framework, we have worked closely with our economic agencies to consult over 250 companies and relevant stakeholders. Many gave us useful inputs which we have incorporated. For example, to minimise the reporting burden, NEA will centralise all reporting and submission of documents on one common online platform.",4,733,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00733

2019-09-04-T-011,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"In response to industry feedback, we have built in greater flexibility in the implementation of these regulations. For example, producers of non-consumer Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE) can collect unwanted products from their customers within a reasonable amount of time after receiving their requests, instead of doing so immediately. The same flexibility is also given to retailers in providing the free 1-for-1 collection service when they deliver products to the customers.",6,735,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00735
2019-09-04-T-011,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Second, we have sought to minimise regulatory impact on smaller businesses. Government regulations often impact these businesses more, as they are less able to benefit from economies of scale. This is why, as asked by Mr Louis Ng, we have set thresholds to exclude smaller producers from joining a Producer Responsibility Scheme (PRS) or reporting on their packaging use.",7,736,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00736
2019-09-04-T-011,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Third, we have sought to keep our regulatory framework consistent with other jurisdictions. For example, our e-waste EPR framework has incorporated best practices adapted from the systems in Sweden and South Korea and is customised to suit Singapore's context. Our economy is an open one. We import most of what we consume. Many of the companies which will be covered by this Bill also have global presence, including in countries where EPR is implemented. This will allow them to adjust more easily to our EPR system and minimise business costs.",8,737,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00737
2019-09-04-T-011,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Fourth, we will provide sufficient time and support for companies to adjust. As Mr Desmond Choo has suggested, we will stagger the timeline for the regulatory requirements to come into effect. For example, producers of EEE who have exceeded the threshold will have up to six months to join the PRS, after they have registered and reported their put-to-market data to NEA. We are also working with industry associations to educate and assist companies with the mandatory reporting requirements for packaging waste and the implementation of their 3R plans. NEA also supports companies through grants. For example, NEA has co-funded 24 onsite food waste treatment systems at premises, such as Parkway Parade, Resorts World Sentosa and InterContinental Singapore Robertson Quay, under its 3R Fund.",9,738,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00738
2019-09-04-T-011,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Fifth, our regulatory framework must support the development of the Environmental Services Industry to take advantage of the circular economy. Besides ensuring environmental and resource sustainability, this will allow us to maximise economic benefits by developing the local recycling industry and allowing our companies to export their solutions overseas. At the same time, greater economies of scale and the development of new solutions will help to bring down costs at the systems level. According to a 2015 study by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and McKinsey, adopting a circular economy approach could boost Europe's resource productivity by 3% by 2030 and generate cost savings of €600 billion a year.",10,739,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00739

2019-09-04-T-011,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,I will now address specific points of clarification raised by Members on the three waste streams.,14,743,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00743
2019-09-04-T-011,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Firstly, e-waste. Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked about the current e-waste collection and recycling landscape in Singapore. Based on NEA's 2016 study on e-waste disposal patterns, only 6% of our consumer e-waste is recycled. Thirty-five percent, comprising bulky e-waste, such as washing machines, is carted away by the deliverymen when new appliances are delivered. Twenty-four percent is traded in or re-sold; another 9% is donated; and the remaining 26% is simply thrown away. This is why we are putting in place a formal EPR framework to ensure that e-waste is properly collected and recycled.",15,744,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00744
2019-09-04-T-011,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Mr Louis Ng and Mr Desmond Choo asked about the thresholds and coverage of producers. As I have explained earlier, we have sought to minimise regulatory impact on our SMEs. The threshold levels have thus been set to cover about 90% of regulated products that are put-to-market by weight. The remaining 10% of regulated products are sold by small producers with small individual market shares. We will monitor the implementation of the EPR framework and ensure that these thresholds remain relevant.",16,745,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00745

In the first three years, the collection targets will be 60% of Large Household Appliances and 20% of the other consumer products put-to-market by weight. These targets were determined based on consumer e-waste disposal patterns in Singapore and referenced targets set by the EU in the early stages of their EPR implementation.",21,750,2019-09-04-T-011-S-00750

Currently, there is sufficient recycling capacity for ICT equipment and televisions. Singapore faces limitations in recycling large appliances, such as refrigerators and washing machines. The EPR framework will play a pivotal role in developing the recycling industry, by financing and driving the demand for recycling services, and by aggregating e-waste into more viable volumes. This will encourage entrepreneurs to enter the market and set up recycling plants and facilities in Singapore. In fact, we are already seeing interest. Several recyclers, both local and overseas, have indicated interest to expand or set up facilities to recycle large household appliances, batteries and lamps.

We cannot take a one-size-fits-all approach, as the use of packaging is dynamic and varies across sectors and companies, which Mr Henry Kwek has also highlighted. Companies may have different approaches in implementing 3R initiatives which can help them save on costs. They also need time to build up their capability.

While there are costs associated with the installation of on-site food waste treatment systems, businesses are able to reap cost savings from reduced waste disposal costs. Typically, the payback period of a one-tonne per day on-site food waste treatment system is five years. In addition, there are other benefits, such as a cleaner environment, increased value of dry recyclables due to less contamination by food waste, and potential resources generated through the treatment process.
