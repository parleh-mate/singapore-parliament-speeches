2020-08-31-T-004,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Mr Speaker, Sir, following the General Election on 11 July 2020, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that Mr Pritam Singh would be formally designated as the Leader of the Opposition in the Fourteenth Parliament of Singapore and that he would be provided with staff support and resources to perform his duties. This has been reported in the media and Mr Singh has since been briefed on his duties and privileges as Leader of the Opposition, as was announced on 28 July 2020.",1,18,2020-08-31-T-004-S-00018
2020-08-31-T-004,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"However, it is proper that the duties and privileges of the Leader of the Opposition been also stated in Parliament. The position of the Leader of the Opposition is not provided for in our Constitution or in the Standing Orders of Parliament. Singapore’s legislatures have not previously formally recognised or ascribed specific duties and privileges to the leader of the opposition, even in the late 1950s and early 1960s, when there were many Opposition assemblymen in our Legislative Assembly, there was no Leader of the Opposition. For example, Mr Lee Kuan Yew was not formally designated the Leader of the Opposition even when the People’s Action Party (PAP) formed the largest party in the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly between 1955 and 1959.",2,19,2020-08-31-T-004-S-00019
2020-08-31-T-004,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Still, leaders of the main Opposition parties in past Parliaments have, from time to time, been referred to informally as leader of the opposition during parliamentary debates. And it has been the consistent practice of the PAP Government to liaise with them as the defacto or unofficial leader of the opposition. For example, at the Opening of Parliament in 1991, when there were four Opposition Members of Parliament (MPs), then Leader of the House Mr Wong Kan Seng said he would deal with Mr Chiam See Tong as the unofficial leader of the opposition and that Mr Chiam would be given due courtesy and precedence among Opposition MPs.",3,20,2020-08-31-T-004-S-00020

2020-08-31-T-004,Indranee Rajah,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"As Leader of the Opposition, Mr Pritam Singh will be accorded appropriate privileges and duties. The leader of the main Opposition party typically takes the seat directly opposite the Prime Minister in this Chamber during Parliament sittings, similar to the practice in other countries that formally recognise the role of the Leader of the Opposition. He will be given an office in Parliament, staff support and resources and additional allowance.",5,22,2020-08-31-T-004-S-00022

2020-08-31-T-006,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Over the past few decades, our economy has grown from third world to first world. Accordingly, the expansion of business needs has generated demand for workers with specialised skills such as in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.

2020-08-31-T-006,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"I cannot help but wonder if, as a result of unchecked conscious and unconscious bias, there may still be instances of nationality bias in hiring and promotion and in today’s context, retrenchments?

2020-08-31-T-006,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"In that same vein, I welcome the policy announcements last Thursday by MOM in (a) adjusting the Employment Pass (EP) and S Pass qualifying salaries, (b) imposing new Fair Consideration Framework Requirements, and (c) applying greater scrutiny on EP and S Pass applicants. This will go some way in levelling the playing field for our Singaporean PMEs and providing our Singaporean PMEs fair hiring opportunities.",12,58,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00058
2020-08-31-T-006,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"I am equally glad that Minister Chan Chun Sing, in his capacity as Minister of Trade and Industry, has emphasised – over the weekend – three very important points. First, that there must be fairness and zero tolerance for discrimination of any kind and tough action has to be taken on firms with hiring bias. Second, the importance of diversity and inclusion, something that I submit is crucial for a developed country and democracy like ours. Third, the efforts of localisation by transferring of skills to develop a pipeline of local talent.",13,59,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00059
2020-08-31-T-006,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"I therefore submit that Strengthening our Singaporean Core requires a two-fold approach  First, the hiring of foreign PMEs must be based on merit – on their contribution to Singapore and how they complement our local workforce.

2020-08-31-T-006,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"First, ensuring Singaporean PMETs are not left behind by the raising of EP and S Pass qualifying salaries. Raising the salary criteria for EP and S Pass is timely. Although the EP salary minimum was just raised in May 2020, I am heartened that MOM has raised the qualifying salaries of both Employment Pass and S Pass holders to further level the playing field for our Singaporean PMETs.",16,62,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00062
2020-08-31-T-006,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"While we raise the qualifying salary of EP holders, I am glad that MOM has put in a place a differentiation of the EP qualifying salaries for sectors such as the financial services sector. In the same vein, MOM should also consider raising the bar for sectors such as Infocomm Technology and Professional Services, where there are generally more companies on the Fair Consideration Framework watchlist.",17,63,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00063
2020-08-31-T-006,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Since the announcement of these changes last Thursday, union leaders and PMEs I have spoken to have raised concerns that employers would merely raise the salaries or repackage the compensation and benefits of their foreign PMETs, to keep within the boundaries of the rules and retain them – something that is easily done in sectors which traditionally have higher-earning EP holders. To compound matters further, our Singaporean PMETs working alongside these foreign PMETs performing similar or same jobs may not get a similar pay hike, thereby resulting in serious parity issues. It does not help that many of our PMETs are now confronted with wage freezes, restraints and cuts.",18,64,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00064
2020-08-31-T-006,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"For unionised companies, our unions will closely watch the actions of the employers. For workers in non-unionised companies, I strongly urge them to join as union members and organise themselves, so that we can protect them and ensure that they are fairly treated.",19,65,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00065
2020-08-31-T-006,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Second, strengthening the Singaporean Core at all Levels through strengthening hiring culture, practices and changing mindsets. Strengthening the Singaporean Core of PMETs must be at all levels of the hierarchy and not merely addressing entry or lower level PMETs. In large corporations with deep pockets, hiring more Singaporeans at the bottom balloons the denominator to make them look less culpable in actual percentages and numbers. Our efforts must be to address this at all levels and have a tiered approach in our policies and laws, according to different sectors’ needs and circumstances.",20,66,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00066
2020-08-31-T-006,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"While we introduce new policies to further tighten the various levers, strengthening the hiring culture, practices and changing mindsets across the various organisations which hire foreign PMEs must be at the backbone of these efforts. HR leaders I speak to say they may be supportive of the Singaporean Core but in some cases, the hiring managers may have the final say in the eventual choice of the candidate. In many of these organisations, complex reporting structures and matrix reporting mean that the HR sometimes have little or no say. In short, it is imperative for not just a change of mindset for the CEO or CHRO but also the mindsets of hiring managers and everyone from end to end in the value chain that are involved in the various HR processes.",21,67,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00067
2020-08-31-T-006,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"While foreign PMEs are employed in Singapore, there needs to be more intentional reciprocity by multi-national corporations (MNCs) to offer similar regional and global opportunities to our Singaporean PMEs. In this way, our Singaporean PMEs will be able to gain international experience and in turn, add to the calibre of our Singaporean workforce.",22,68,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00068
2020-08-31-T-006,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"I urge the management within MNCs to groom our Singaporean PMEs as part of their leadership identification and development processes. By the same token, our Singaporean PMEs must step up, step forward and readily accept these opportunities to take lead and uproot to remote parts of the globe for regional and international exposure and opportunities. Increasingly, all Singaporean PMEs must embrace overseas opportunities as possible opportunities and be open to them regardless of where they are at, in their career life-stage.",23,69,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00069
2020-08-31-T-006,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Third, augmenting the Fair Consideration Framework. I am glad that MOM has heeded my call to enhance the FCF to include S Pass and doubled the duration of the mandatory job advertisement.

2020-08-31-T-006,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Fourth, strengthening enforcement against Triple Weak companies. We can further safeguard the Singaporean Core through stricter enforcement against companies that treat the Fair Consideration Framework as mere window dressing or who continue to be ""triple weak"" – in other words, companies with highly disproportionate number of foreign PMEs, weak commitment to nurture and strengthen Singaporean Core, and weak relevance to Singapore’s economy and society.",27,73,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00073

2020-08-31-T-006,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Many of our economic incentives appear to be granted based on total headcount created in Singapore, with little mention of support for proactive and sustained local hiring. Likewise, there should be proactive and sustained knowledge and skills transfer to Singaporeans by the foreign PMEs. A structured mentoring must be put in place to ensure that skills are transferred from foreign PMEs to our local PMEs. Potential abuse can arise without a tiered approach, for example, economic incentives to expire without more senior Singaporean PME hires within a certain period of time or when there is a failure to transfer skills and knowledge.",30,76,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00076

With the current added measures and above suggestions, I expect to see an eradication of nationality bias and a shrinking watchlist.

Against current weak economic conditions and employment outlook, strengthening the Singaporean Core is a critical mission for the Labour Movement and an area that needs to be watched carefully and conscientiously.

Indeed, it is imperative to introduce the right policies in the face of an evolving economic and domestic environment. We must be mindful of our uniqueness as a city-state and balance our national interests such as the employability of our workers.

With rapid disruption, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the next normal, I suggest we embark on an ITM 2.0; to refresh and relook these strategies so that both workers and companies can transform in tandem to meet the challenges ahead.

However, as we have seen, there are still some 1,200 firms on MOM's Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) watchlist. Clearly, market failure exists in our current employment framework. We can, and must, improve this – by knowing where to flex and where to tighten measures. We need to guard against abuse of our system, by giving Singaporean PMEs a fair chance at local job opportunities, which will also mitigate any potential brain drain. A healthy dose of market intervention is essential to ensure fair play. This also instils loyalty and fosters a sense of belonging and identity amongst Singaporeans.

A rising tide lifted all boats and most Singaporeans saw their lives improved by leaps and bounds. We invested in our people so that they could adapt and grow with our economy. High home ownership also gives Singaporeans a share in the fruits of our progress.",29,122,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00122
2020-08-31-T-006,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"As our economy matured, we also strengthened our social safety nets. For example, we improved healthcare affordability through MediShield Life and CHAS and provided extra support for the Pioneer in Merdeka Generations.

2020-08-31-T-006,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"We must, therefore, take an integrated view of our economic and social policies.

The Government will continue to invest in our people, match them to new opportunities and bring out the best in all Singaporeans. This way, we will keep social mobility alive.",33,126,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00126

More workers will fall on hard times and we need to enable them to adjust and bounce back through this crisis and beyond. Some Singaporeans are taking part in the gig economy, taking on a wide range of jobs, either part-time or full-time. So, our support for self-employed persons will have to evolve accordingly. We must continue to uplift our lower wage workers and enable our older workers to continue working if they wish to.",34,127,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00127
2020-08-31-T-006,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Various ideas have been proposed on how we can do this, such as minimum wage, universal basic income and unemployment insurance. The Government will keep an open mind to all these ideas. But we must also recognise that there are no magic bullets. Each of these ideas has its merits as well as unintended effects. We have to consider the trade-offs and be clear about what works for our context and our time.",35,128,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00128
2020-08-31-T-006,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"Demands on our social safety nets are increasing at a time when our revenue base is growing more slowly and with sharper competition for tax revenues across countries. So, I must caution against looking for what may appear to be cost-less solutions. Somehow, someone else will have to pay for these schemes. There are trade-offs. If we want higher social spending, taxes will have to go up, or it will mean spending more at the expense of future generations by what many countries are doing – by raising their debt.",36,129,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00129

2020-08-31-T-006,Heng Swee Keat,The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"At the same time, while we must strengthen our social safety nets, we must do so in a way that reinforces and not undermine an individual's efforts. A strong compact maintains a balance between the roles of the individual, family, community and the Government and helps us better cope with change together. Indeed, social safety nets cannot become a set of shackles. It should not hold down those we started with less. It should not create a dependency such that people who get fish for today never learn how to fish for food tomorrow. It should not breed an entitled class who ask, ""What more can you do for me?""",38,131,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00131

The longest serving is Mr Goh Chok Tong who served for nearly 45 years, including almost 14 years as our Prime Minister. Mr Goh's years as a Prime Minister, from 1990 to 2004, are remembered as a time of stability, peace and growth during which we became a kinder, gentler society and a more confident people. He steered us through two major crises – the Asian Financial Crisis and SARS. He continued to contribute in many areas, even after stepping down as Prime Minister. Over the years, I had the privilege of working closely with Mr Goh, including on many trips at ASEAN, ASEM and APEC, where his easy rapport with leaders around the world enabled us to forge many new agreements and many new partnerships.

Emeritus Senior Minister Goh was then our Chairman and banks around the world were in trouble. So, when we had to make a momentous decision on whether to seek the approval from the President for $150 billion guarantee on all bank deposits, backed by our past reserves, I was very glad to have his wise counsel and his support for us to take difficult decisions head-on.

In the past, popular reference to the Opposition was almost always pejorative, usually centred around the points that the Opposition was out of Government, did not have a mandate, could only talk and as such was ultimately irrelevant.

The information provided was far narrower, specifically that about 15% of PRs have been PRs for 20 or more years. Sir, the additional details that were not provided are important so the Opposition can consider and put forward alternative approaches to population and immigration policies. The data will also put into stark relief the relevance of referring to someone as a local in our statistical data when it is clear that some PRs do not want to become Singapore Citizens or the state has no plans to extend citizenship to them.",18,179,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00179
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, I accept that such matters are sensitive and the Government's unwillingness to provide the data in the format or detail requested, may arise not because of an unwillingness to disclose information. Instead, there could be genuine concerns about how information will be used or perhaps misused to rile pockets of the population since the PR policy is closely tied to immigration and jobs. But it is my case, Mr Speaker, that the Government will have to find a new way of dealing with such difficult matters. And I strongly believe Parliament is an important safety valve and a potential moderator of extreme conversations found offline and online on immigration and population issues. To that end, later in my speech, I will suggest some alternative approaches for the Government's consideration.",19,180,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00180
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"As for resources, I would like to share my understanding of the resources that will be provided to the Leader of the Opposition. This is important for the public to know in formulating their expectations. Every elected Member of Parliament is given a budget to hire a Legislative Assistant and Secretarial Assistant. The Legislative Assistant is paid an allowance of $1,300 per month and the Secretarial Assistant is paid an allowance of $500 a month. Based on these sums, these positions are of necessity, part-time ones.",20,181,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00181
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I should highlight that these are the same resources depended on by PAP Members of Parliament (MPs) who are not political office-holders. Each PAP backbencher also has only one Legislative Assistant and one Secretarial Assistant, although I should add that they can avail themselves of the additional resources of the People's Association, including the staff at Community Clubs for their grassroots work.",21,182,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00182
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"For completeness, let me say that neither Non-Constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) nor Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs) are given these resources. This would be an opportune time to thank the Legislative Assistants or LAs, both of the PAP and Opposition parties, who have over the years supported Members of Parliament.",22,183,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00183
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"For the office of the Leader of the Opposition, the Government has allocated a budget for three more LAs. Applying the standard allowance for LAs, each of the three additional LAs for the Leader of the Opposition will be paid $1,300 a month. Again, these have to be part-time positions. An administrative assistant has also been made available to the office of the Leader of the Opposition by Parliament.",23,184,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00184
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"By contrast, it is useful to remember that a sitting Government has at its disposal the resources of a Singapore Public Service, a very good one – I might add – of 146,000 full-time officers. Of these, 85,000 are members of the Civil Service.",24,185,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00185
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Leader of the Opposition's office will not have the breadth and depth of the Party in Government in coming up with alternative policies. Nonetheless, the Workers' Party will continue pursuing alternatives we feel are important for Singapore, an example being the proposal for redundancy insurance for workers as put forth in the last term of Parliament. We will continue to advance meaningful alternatives for deliberation and debate, and will strive to improve on the quality of the alternatives suggested.",25,186,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00186
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),Another change that has happened that led to the appointment of the Leader of the Opposition is that there are more Opposition MPs in Parliament than at any time since the years following our Independence in 1965.,26,187,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00187
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, Members of Parliament are vox populi – the voice of the people. To raise in Parliament what the people cannot do directly is the duty of the Government ruling party and the Opposition. The Workers' Party intends to raise matters in Parliament that are important to the people of Singapore that the Government and PAP backbenchers may not. We intend to scrutinise policies to the best of our abilities. To that end, let me set out how the Workers' Party's Members of Parliament will be organised.",27,188,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00188
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"With just 10 Members of Parliament – far from the more than one-third necessary to check the PAP's supermajority – it is not feasible for the Workers' Party to set up a shadow Cabinet in the tradition of Westminster parliaments. There are 16 Ministries in Singapore, including the Prime Minister's Office. These 16 Ministries have the resources of 37 political office-holders from Parliamentary Secretary upwards. Of these 37, 20 are full Ministers.",28,189,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00189
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Despite not being able to shadow each Ministry, we intend to organise our MPs to look into five areas that are critical for Singapore and of huge importance to Singaporeans. The five areas are  (a) health, ageing and retirement adequacy; (b) jobs, businesses and the economy; (c) education, inequality and the cost of living; (d) housing, transport and infrastructure; (e) national sustainability – a broad-ranging area that looks at policies and proposals to ensure we leave behind a thriving Singapore that lasts far into the future for successive generations.",29,190,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00190
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The next change that has happened is the first-time presence in Parliament of the Progress Singapore Party.

2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"What is the relationship of other Opposition parties to the Leader of the Opposition? In other Westminster parliaments, the Leader of the Opposition is not considered a the leader of all Opposition parties in Parliament. This must be so in Singapore as well. The Progress Singapore Party has its own principles and ideology, that are distinct from the Workers' Party. Mr Leong and Ms Poa may propose policies and promote ideas very different from, and even in disagreement to those of the Workers' Party. It is possible that they may support Government policies that we disagree with or vice versa.",31,192,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00192
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"However, where our positions match and are in the best interests of Singapore, I look forward to collaborating with the Progress Singapore Party's NCMPs. Taken together, this would make for healthy debate in this House where policies are debated on their merits and principles, rather than in support or opposition to the Government.",32,193,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00193
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Before I leave the subject of the Opposition, I would add that in the United Kingdom, the Leader of the Opposition is sometimes styled as the Leader of Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition. The term ""Loyal Opposition"" was coined in the Nineteenth century to make clear that opposing the Government was not considered disloyalty to the monarch, or to the state. I note the Prime Minister also used this term in the aftermath of the last election.",33,194,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00194
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Workers' Party has always taken the position that when it is in the Opposition, it owes its loyalty to the President, the Republic of Singapore and the people. We have proven that we do not oppose the Government for the sake of opposing. We back the Government when national interests are at stake. Shortly after COVID struck in January, I said to the House from this very Table  ""Workers' Party Members of Parliament agree with the Government when we have to, disagree where we must, in the knowledge that we endeavour for the best outcomes for Singapore and for a unity of purpose when politics must take a back seat, like during the current COVID-19 crisis.""",34,195,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00195
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"That position made in the context of the debate on the Unity Budget is a convenient point for me to transition to the second area I will speak on. That is, things that must not change in Singapore.",35,196,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00196
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"First, Singapore's historical position as a trading nation. Second, the Government's policies and actions on defence and foreign policy.

2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, Singapore has always been a trading nation and open borders are a fact of our lives. Investors should know that Singapore will never close for business, no matter how many Workers' Party MPs there are in Parliament. We make a living by being relevant to the world and separately as a trustworthy and reliable interlocutor. Our Police and security agencies keep our country safe. Our teachers are excellent educators. Our doctors and nurses staff a healthcare system that provides quality care. These are but some of the reasons why foreign investors put their trust in Singapore.",37,198,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00198
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Opposition politics and advocacy for Singaporeans cannot ignore Singapore's place in the world and what we offer to the world. We must still look outward, even as we continually search for a lasting modus vivendi which accommodates the domestic pressures of being economically open, and the reality of a Singapore identity that evolves and crystallises as our nation matures.",38,199,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00199
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Singaporeans do feel patriotic, nationalistic and protectionist even. These are forces that are not intrinsically negative, but they have to be empathised with and understood by this House. In turn, Singaporeans should consider Singapore's relevance to the world from a broad perspective. After all, all of us, no matter what our political preferences, want our country to be thriving and successful and with a big heart.",39,200,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00200
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Moving on to the second thing that must not change. The Workers' Party supports the Government's positions on defence and foreign policy. These must continue as they are. These policies are well-considered and they place primacy on Singapore's interest while seeking long-term mutual cooperation with other countries and international organisations. They also take into account the realism of international politics and the reality of not just a small state, but our peculiar circumstances too.",40,201,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00201
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Workers' Party backs the Government in involving Singapore in United Nations initiatives, and those of the World Health Organization, the World Bank, UNESCO, the International Labour Organization and other multilateral initiatives. We support the Government's efforts in working with our neighbours to bolster ASEAN. We believe that a successful ASEAN boosts regional security through economic, political and security cooperation. In particular, we support Singapore's efforts to work with ASEAN and other countries to finalise the South China Sea Code of Conduct. As a small maritime nation and separately, a trading nation, the sanctity of international agreements and adherence to the rule of law is necessary to discourage arbitrary behaviour by more powerful states.",41,202,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00202
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Next, we support the Government's work in continuing various things that have become a part of Singapore's DNA.

Our founding Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew was able to lead the achievement of something that many thought impossible at the time – the rooting out of endemic corruption from Singapore society.",42,203,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00203
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"We are proud of Singapore's success in doing so and support the Government's continuing work in this area. If anything, Singapore's position on stamping out corruption should be strengthened so that extra-territorial corruption by Singaporeans is discouraged with as much diligence as domestic corruption.",43,204,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00204
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Equally important is Singapore's emphasis on racial and religious harmony. These words are almost a cliche in Singapore, and we should be grateful for that, because in many other countries, it is a source of intractable problems. The Workers' Party strongly believes in Singapore's multiracial, multi-religious and multi-cultural community. It is important that all communities support, respect and accommodate each other.",44,205,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00205
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, my Workers' Party colleagues and I look at Singapore as a glass half-full or one that can be topped-up. There is much that is right and which should remain the same. But there is also much that can and should change. This brings me to my third area – things that should change in Singapore. It is my conviction that these changes would improve governance and better look after the needs of Singaporeans.",45,206,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00206
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"First, to leverage an independent Organ of State, namely Parliament, the Workers' Party proposes the formation of more Select Committees. Some conversations in Singapore can continue to be divisive unless we decisively create a framework for reasoned conversation. Parliament, using the platform of Select Committees, can operate as an important safety valve and an agent of positive conversations that ought to have a direct impact on policies and laws.",46,207,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00207
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"More significantly, in the information ecology of today's world, misinformation and disinformation campaigns are run online and offline, usually in combination, to manipulate content and hijack narratives.

2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In many countries today, even the mainstream media cannot moderate the conversation without significant public funding.

2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"By forming Select Committees that meet regularly on the most sensitive and difficult issues for Singapore, Parliament can play a bigger role in leading the conversation and championing the truth.",49,210,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00210
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"There are two possibilities for Select Committees. One possibility is for more Standing Select Committees to be set up to scrutinise the spending, policies and administration of each Ministry. The members of these committees would be drawn from a mix of Members in this House, including PAP backbenchers, elected Opposition MPs and NCMPs.",50,211,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00211
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Such committees are part of the normal political fabric of other democracies.

Those who follow American politics would also be familiar with the various Senate and House committees that are drawn from both Democrats and Republicans.",51,212,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00212
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"This suggestion is not meant to be a blind copying of the British and American systems, but is made because such committees are an example of parliamentary institutions our democracy can benefit from.",52,213,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00213
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Such Standing Select Committees are not to be confused with Government Parliamentary Committees (GPCs). GPCs are partisan – only PAP Members of Parliament sit on them. GPCs were conceived in 1987 when Mr Chiam See Tong was the only Opposition MP left after the removal of Mr J B Jeyaretnam in 1986. There were no NMPs at the time, nor NCMPs. Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong introduced them as a method of PAP self-checking.",53,214,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00214
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Now, with the presence of 10 elected Opposition Members of Parliament, Standing Select Committees are feasible and indeed desirable for greater accountability. If not for all Ministries, then perhaps for some of them. Of course, certain Ministries such as MINDEF and MHA may require the discussion of classified information. In such cases, cross-party committees could review matters at closed door hearings.",54,215,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00215
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"A second possibility for Select Committees would be the formation of more ad hoc committees. Such committees are already a part of Singapore’s Parliamentary processes, but the Workers' Party recommends that more of them be empanelled. The purpose of ad hoc Select Committees is to investigate a specific issue and report back to Parliament. In time, and given their importance, they can be repurposed into permanent Standing Select Committees. These Select Committees must function as investigators, with no pre-determined agenda, hidden or otherwise. They must go where the evidence, obtained through submissions and witnesses, leads them.",55,216,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00216
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods, of which I was a member in the last term of Parliament, was a good start. But there is scope for further improvement. For example, by giving a longer lead time for submissions to be made; publishing written submissions at least two weeks before the hearings; scheduling hearings over more days; and releasing an interim report for public scrutiny that can prompt more written submissions and additional hearings.",56,217,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00217
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To this end, the President in her Address alluded to potentially difficult conversations that Government would need to have with Singaporeans.

2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The next thing we need to change in Singapore is how we manage and accommodate foreigners in our economy. Their presence gives Singapore a vitality that keeps us economically relevant and also provides jobs and opportunities to our fellow Singaporeans. Many of us count the foreigners in our midst, regardless of race, language or religion as our friends. That openness and friendly attitude must continue as a manifestation of the Singapore spirit and the Singapore we leave behind for future generations of Singaporeans.",58,219,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00219
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"But it is precisely because we need foreigners to help power our economy that we need to pay more attention to Singapore workers, some of whom feel excluded, some of whom feel excluded from opportunities created in their homeland. In recent weeks, letters in The Straits Times Forum have been published, one by a retired senior Singaporean banker and another by the Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore or MAS, in reply. These appeared after MOM placed 47 companies on the Fair Consideration Framework watchlist. Of the 47 companies, 30 were financial and professional services institutions. On the MOM’s website, examples are given of one wealth management firm where almost three-quarters of their PMET or professional, manager, executive and technician jobs are held by persons of the same nationality. Another example is given of a bank where almost two-thirds are of the same nationality.",59,220,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00220
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The obvious question is  how did those two companies get to those stages without MOM taking action before this? MOM’s website states at one point and I quote, “MOM does not tolerate unfair hiring practices and employers who do not give locals a fair chance in hiring and promotion will face scrutiny and stiff penalties if found to have unfair hiring practices.” However, for three-quarters and two-thirds of the PMETs of two companies to be non-Singaporeans of the same nationality, Singaporeans may be justified in asking if MOM has tolerated their unfair hiring practices for some time.",60,221,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00221
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"To be fair, this is a complex issue. For example, there may be some justification if the bank’s customers are not in Singapore, but are from the same country as the PMETs, and if these customers do not speak any of the languages widely used in Singapore. Some have argued that this is what it takes for Singapore to be a global financial hub.",61,222,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00222
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The problem is that we simply do not know enough. And the vacuum has given space for a more toxic conversation to ferment. We should nip this forthwith and some details earlier this week from MTI about inter-corporate transferees and remarks by the Minister for MTI have been important. To this end, more information, and not less, is certainly most helpful. One way for us in Parliament and for the public to know, is for MOM to publish the names of recalcitrant employers. We can then understand the operating paradigm of such businesses and understand how they intend to make the transition to fair hiring practices.",62,223,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00223
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Government also needs to raise its signature in this regard, especially since this is such a hot-button issue, one generating a lot of heat but very little light.

2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Beyond this, a far more purposeful way to prevent companies from hiring unfairly would be for Parliament to pass anti-discrimination legislation and impose penalties for discriminatory practices by egregious offenders. This should be considered alongside a more activist approach by the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP) in the immediate term. At the moment, the penalty for employers who breach TAFEP’s fair hiring requirements is a debarment of up to two years from hiring or renewing foreign workers, including work pass renewals – and that is for the most serious offenders. There are no criminal penalties for individuals who are responsible for unfair hiring practices. Surely this tempts recalcitrant employers into trying their luck. If they practise unfair hiring, all that happens is that they are stopped from hiring unfairly for two years.",64,225,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00225

2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Tied closely to the issue of the hiring of foreigners is whether the education system is adequately preparing our citizens for the jobs that are available. The big banks – OCBC, UOB and DBS – all have workforces that are made up of at least 90% Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents. It is unclear what proportion are Singapore Citizens. Standard Chartered has said that 70% of its local subsidiary’s staff are Singapore Citizens. Are these really high numbers? What are the reasons why these banks cannot be staffed by even more Singaporeans?",67,228,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00228
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The two main justifications given for the hiring of foreigners are first, that they are unable to find Singaporeans with the expertise; and second, that foreigners do jobs that are undesired by Singaporeans. As it is unlikely that well-paying banking jobs are undesired by Singaporeans, the justification of these banks in hiring foreigners must be that they are unable to find enough Singaporeans with the needed expertise. If that is true, then we need to ask where the gaps are in our education and lifelong learning training systems. These gaps must be found and plugged as soon as possible.",68,229,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00229

I agree with MAS that falsehoods on fair hiring are unhelpful and unfair. On the point of the number of Singaporeans at financial institutions, however, MAS did say that there are some functions and some firms where there is scope to increase the proportion of Singaporeans. MAS has also said that it would like to see more Singaporeans move into the senior ranks of the financial sector. MAS added that there is an urgent need to build the local talent pool in technology-related areas to meet increasing demand.",69,230,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00230
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),I was glad to see that MAS made the same points I have made above – that a greater proportion of Singaporeans can be employed at financial institutions and that Singaporeans need to be appropriately educated and trained to take up jobs in the financial sector.,70,231,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00231
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Mr Speaker, I have spent some time on these matters which are on the lips of many Singaporeans because I believe that in spite of COVID-19 and the changes taking place in the world, opportunities are arising that Singapore can take advantage of. For example, the seismic political changes in Hong Kong may prompt some international businesses to move to other jurisdictions. We should aim to welcome those looking to move. But if we do not move purposefully to consolidate and position the Singaporean PMET in a competitive position vis-a-vis the work pass holder, the Government will not be able to secure support or adequate support for its economic agenda and take advantage of opportunities while maintaining social harmony.",71,232,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00232
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Let me now move away from foreign professionals to discuss local tradesmen. Another thing that we should change in Singapore is raising the value of the work of the Singapore tradesmen. In places like Australia, New Zealand and Germany, tradesmen make good wages that match or even outstrip those of university graduates.",72,233,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00233
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In Singapore, although our educational institutions train our citizens for such vocations, not enough is done to protect their trades. The way to protect our tradesmen is to regulate who can practice each trade. Medical professionals, accountants, quantity surveyors, insurance practitioners and even real estate sales professionals have to be properly qualified and certified. This enables them to earn a wage that is protected from undercutting by the unqualified. For example, for trades such as air-conditioner servicing and plumbing, anyone can offer such services.",73,234,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00234
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Uplifting our tradesmen will require a paradigm shift in how workers are viewed and trained. If it succeeds, it will raise the self-esteem and incomes of Singaporeans who may not be academically inclined but who have acquired valuable skills that many of us in this House would not be able to fully master. It is my view that such a decisive shift will fundamentally alter our understanding of meritocracy.",74,235,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00235
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The final point I would like to make on things that should change is on greater help for those who need it most. The Workers' Party believes that the Pioneer and Merdeka generation schemes, for example, are good ones. Indeed, we ourselves proposed policies along these lines, years ago. However, we believe more can be done.",75,236,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00236
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"We know that there are trade-offs. Extending more health and other social benefits comes with a cost. Could this result in higher income taxes for many Singaporeans and those who work here, for example? Yes. But the benefits will go beyond mere financial help for those who need it. Will there be a price to pay in terms of higher costs for the end-consumer? This must be expected. Increasingly, there will be a price to pay if we wish to be ""One United People"" and move beyond the phrase as an aspiration or worse, a platitude.",76,237,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00237
2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Many Scandinavians are content to pay higher taxes because they know this would mean that others in their society will be able to live with greater dignity. For those who earn higher incomes, to pay higher taxes is a point of pride for many of them. The Singaporean identity which sees community as a central pillar of its DNA should imbibe such thinking with those better-off paying more. Let us build a kinder and gentler Singapore.",77,238,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00238

2020-08-31-T-006,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"However Singapore pivots or evolves in the years to come, I believe a reasoned conversation before choices and decisions are made, or not made, will be critical. These will take time and consume much energy, and we will have to guard against conversations which are hijacked to advance sectional interests that demonise those who have reservations or a different perspective.",80,241,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00241

From my house-to-house engagements with residents, many expressed their anxiety over their jobs. Mid-career residents shared that its harder to find equivalent job opportunities when they lose their jobs, that is, quality jobs. I am also hearing from younger residents – their concerns of finding employment. I met several young residents last week who had recently lost their jobs or had their pay or job scopes reduced due to COVID. Many are concerned about losing their jobs and livelihoods as the companies they work for are not seeing the same demand for their services and hence need to cut back.",5,248,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00248

For small businesses, the ability to adapt and adopt digitalisation has accelerated virtual connectivity and access to new business. A simple example is how stalls in our wet markets and hawkers have overcome the physical access restrictions by adapting and selling online. With access to new customers, some of these businesses are doing better than pre-COVID-19 times.",8,251,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00251

These are quality jobs, but we do not have enough Singaporeans equipped with the requisite skills. We must train our younger Singaporeans and reskill our mid-career workers to be ready for the recovery. Programmes such as traineeship, placements and various skills upgrading initiatives in the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package allows learning beyond just knowledge to real experience and learning from others to prepare and develop people for these roles. Effective execution of these programmes is key.

While they are not the majority of companies, there are companies hiring a higher proportion of foreign PMETs than their industry peers.

2020-08-31-T-006,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"I want to share a little bit about my experience. Although I currently work for a Singapore company, a large part of my commercial career was with two foreign MNCs in Singapore. My tenure with these two companies was for almost 30 years. During my time with both these companies, I worked closely with Singaporeans and foreigners from many countries. I and many of my Singaporean colleagues had development and many good job opportunities. Working with a diverse group of colleagues enabled me to learn and develop both in Singapore and in other markets overseas. Having access to a network of expert talent in and outside of Singapore gave us the ability to compete effectively, build centres of competencies in Singapore or quickly scale up for large projects. We would otherwise not have been able if these specific skills required had not been available, or we just had not had them available in sufficient numbers.",14,257,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00257
2020-08-31-T-006,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"So, I asked myself what is different from the experience many are feeling today? One factor could be that despite some periods of challenging business climates, most times the economy was growing. The other factor which I did not think much about even though it was there was the deliberate People Strategy and Plans that both these MNCs I had worked for had. Even when there were foreigners in key skilled or leadership positions, and I worked for many of them, there were clear development plans and identified succession plans or pipeline for local talent to fill these roles over time, and that was deliberated every single year. I myself held many key leadership positions managing business in Singapore and in the region taking over from predecessors who were foreigners and managing both local and foreign teams across the world. With clear succession planning in place, when I left my last role in the MNC that I was with to pursue new opportunities, the successor to my role is also Singaporean.",15,258,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00258

To prepare local mid-career workers as well for new or transformed roles, MAS is closely working with the Institute of Banking and Finance and Workforce Singapore to train and redeploy workers. Having jobs is not good enough; we need to have the right support for our workers so that they are ready for the recovery.

COVID-19 has shown us what happens to many of our businesses and jobs when demand and supply of both products and manpower is shut off. It is just so stark. It is frightening.

Members of households could draw substantially different wages. In such situations, the person drawing a lower income is disqualified from receiving financial support from the Government even though he or she may not have access to those resources that the income on a household per capita basis attributes to him or her.

2020-08-31-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"My third suggestion on broadening support for Singaporeans is to consider removing the Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD) for Singaporeans. The Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) already helps to ensure that a Singaporean will not overextend himself or herself but will only get a credit line within his or her means. Revenue can still be raised by retaining ABSD for foreigners. There looks to be demand for Singapore properties by overseas investors due to Singapore being seen as a stable environment. Hence, demand from foreigners may not diminish even if ABSD is removed only for Singaporeans. This means that the property market is kept somewhat stable.",9,278,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00278

Failure to comply with requirements imposed by a compliance directive is an offence with penalty of a fine not exceeding $50,000 or to imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or to both.

Many Singaporean students have had to return from universities overseas due to COVID-19 and want to make their first few years done overseas count towards a degree in Singapore. Singapore can use this opportunity to attract an even larger talent pool through Singapore Universities, both with Singaporean students and international students.",16,285,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00285
2020-08-31-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Through online tutorials, students not in Singapore can participate in courses that count towards a Singapore university degree. The supply of students is no longer limited to geography. This can enhance Singapore’s reputation around the world and ensure the collection of ideas through the enhanced tapestry of students – Singaporeans and overseas students alike. In this way, we could look to becoming a global thought-leader in online pedagogy.",17,286,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00286
2020-08-31-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In this time of disruption, a second area that Singapore could advance in is in industries that produce virtual products. These include not only biotech and biosciences but also media and technology, for example, animation or film.",18,287,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00287
2020-08-31-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Firstly, we have a strong infrastructure to support these industries. For example, we have Biopolis which is specially built as a research and development hub at One-North, situated in a place that fosters collaboration between private companies and public scientific and educational bodies.",19,288,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00288
2020-08-31-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Fusionopolis was designed to create an environment conducive to growth in information and communications technologies, media, physical sciences and engineering industries. The Metropolis in Buona Vista was meant to be a gateway to One-North with research facilities and business parks situated there and designed to be the headquarters for multinational companies.",20,289,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00289
2020-08-31-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"From what I have listed, Sir, we have custom-built state-of-the-art facilities for these sectors situated in places that promote collaboration and generate innovation. Hence, we have a sturdy foundation to ride the waves of biosciences, biotechnology, animation, film and virtual technology.",21,290,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00290
2020-08-31-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Secondly, we have a strong Intellectual Property or IP framework that supports the development of virtual products. We have accelerated and robust application-to-grant pathways for certain IP rights. For dispute resolution, the Intellectual Property (Dispute Resolution) Act passed in 2019 will streamline IP dispute resolution in the Court system and has clarified the arbitrability of IP rights in Singapore. At this stage, Sir, I should declare that I am a practising lawyer at the Singapore Bar.",22,291,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00291
2020-08-31-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Internationally, Singapore is known as an IP hub, with a strong IP office and enforcement working closely with other countries to enable smoother and faster IP protection globally. Indeed, IPOS’ strong reputation likely had a positive impact on Mr Daren Tang’s candidature as Director-General of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), which he will commence on 1 October.",23,292,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00292
2020-08-31-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Having a strong IP framework is important to encourage innovation in Singapore as it helps generate and protect income from virtual products. Hence, the point that I am getting at, Mr Speaker, is that there is a regulatory framework to protect inventions squeezed out during the COVID-19 pandemic period. This makes Singapore attractive and exceedingly relevant to the region and the world. So, we have got good foundational structures to ride the post-COVID-19 wave.",24,293,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00293
2020-08-31-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Our Bicentennial exhibition last year and especially the five excellent Acts performed at Fort Canning, reflected how Singapore has always been at the crossroads of history and was always enveloped by a time of change in a changing world. But, even as we are ever surrounded by change, one thing must remain constant and, that is, unity.",25,294,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00294
2020-08-31-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Will Singapore remain exceptional? Will we, as legislators, lay aside our differences to forge a stronger and brighter future for Singapore together? How can we forge a better and stronger Singapore together? As legislators, we come together to debate and refine policy, to lead constructive conversations on what is best for Singapore. The policies and the shaping of them – both the result and the process are important. Often times, especially for fiscal policies, neither extremes are the best, with pitfalls for both. We cannot pigeonhole ourselves or others as ""right-"" or ""left-leaning” but must have the flexibility to be politically ambidextrous, not being a slave to rigid ideology but always with an eye for doing what is best for Singapore and making sure it works for Singapore.",26,295,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00295
2020-08-31-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Furthermore, we should also be cautious about divisive politics. That, in my view, is not beneficial for Singapore. Divisive politics occurs when we are so entrenched in our position that there is no negotiation for middle ground. I do not think this would work in Singapore nor would it be beneficial for Singapore. We need to resolve disputes for the best of our country – even if we agree to disagree, the process and the debate allows for a fine-tuning of the points of view. And if a way around can be found, it places Singapore in good stead.",27,296,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00296
2020-08-31-T-006,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The ideas proposed earlier regarding foreign worker dormitories, how to engage the seismic shift in tertiary education or ride the waves of a post-COVID-19 world with an excellent IP regime are all aimed at bettering Singapore. What is essential, if we are to ride this storm, is that Singapore’s best interests must always be our goal when advancing our points of view as legislators. If we are united in that cause, then Singapore wins. I support the Motion.",28,297,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00297

2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Speaker, I thank Mdm President for her Address and I stand in support of the Motion. The COVID-19 crisis has affected societies and economies around the world. As the situation continues to unfold, many try to make sense of what a post-COVID-19 world will be like. Mr Speaker, I will share three imperatives for change and my concerns on three medium to long-term challenges in my speech. The first would be in English and the latter three will be in Malay.",1,299,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00299
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"First, long-term unemployment concerns and possible need for workforce reallocation. Change is never easy, we fight to hold on and we fight to let go. In letting go, we also struggle with making sense of the new norm. Making a mid-career change, especially to a new industry, will not be easy. For many of us, it will be one of the most challenging times in our careers.",2,300,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00300
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Today, we face the possibility of another large-scale job reallocation. The pandemic has a significant impact on our economy. We are facing our worst recession in 55 years. Our economy has shrunk 13.2% in the second quarter, retrenchments have doubled and resident unemployment rate has risen to 3.9%. However, the impact is highly disproportionate across different industries. For now, finance and technology sectors are still doing well, and essential services like healthcare and education are always in demand.",3,301,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00301
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Through SGUnited, the Government seeks to help divert those who are seeking employment to the industries that are in high demand. Yet learning new skills for a new industry is time-consuming and challenging, more so for those that require specialised skills, such as in healthcare and technology.",4,302,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00302
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"To continue for the long-term or make a switch to move on to a more fulfilling role, further investment in upskilling and education would have to be required. Would the Government consider more incentives for the acquirement of deeper knowledge, including subsidies for full-time degree courses, for example? And in sectors like healthcare, would the Government look into modified courses so that more people could be quickly trained to get into the jobs and be allowed to upgrade their skills as they serve in the various institutions?",5,303,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00303
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The lower income groups are bearing the brunt of the pandemic. Many of them have lost their jobs and we may expect more job losses to come in the near future. Does the Government intend to conduct any form of structured job reallocation beyond nudging towards the Professional Conversion Programmes or PCPs? Can we take this opportunity to direct them to sectors that have been conventionally less popular among Singaporeans and more heavily reliant on foreigners, such as early childhood education, nursing, construction, skilled trades and so on?",6,304,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00304
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Also, what is the Government doing to weed out employers who offer higher pay to foreigners to qualify them for workpass but yet clawback the salary once they get into Singapore? This malpractice must be stopped. I am told the employers would make this clawback clause as part of the terms of employment and often, they are verbally negotiated. F&B businesses run by foreigners are one of the culprits.",7,305,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00305
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Second, coping with the challenges of rising prevalence in remote working and protectionism.",8,306,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00306
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Rising prevalence in remote working and protectionism threatens our survivability as an open economy. In the most recent issue of Harvard Business Review, American economist Willy Shih shared his projection on the state of global supply chains in a post-pandemic world. Manufacturers worldwide will be under greater political and competitive pressure to increase domestic production and grown employment in their home countries. They will have to reduce or even eliminate their dependence on sources that are perceived as risky and re-think their use of lean manufacturing strategies to minimise inventory held in global supply chains. The Japanese government, for example, has set aside S$2.2 billion of funding to encourage companies to shift their production out of China.",9,307,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00307
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"With the need to diversify, and rising tensions between US and China, firms are shifting to a ""China plus one"" strategy of spreading production between China and a Southeast Asian country. Our affordable tax regimes, fair and corruption-free business practices and political stability make us an attractive location for start-up companies, and regional headquarters to oversee new supply chains in the region. I note that Mr Shih also mentioned Singapore's efficient and high-capacity trans-shipment hub as part of the recommended Southeast Asian strategy for moving goods to the major markets.",10,308,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00308
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"As part of a longer term strategy, we should continue to build on our manufacturing capabilities, particularly in high-tech and healthcare and biomedical industries. Moving forward, the demand for comprehensive logistics strategies will be necessary for companies to make sense of post-pandemic production and movement of goods and services. The question next is, what plans does the Government have to nurture local talents in logistics and even in the maritime industry?",11,309,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00309
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In the meantime, we must continue to remain attractive to global corporations. It remains uncertain if remote working will reduce the need for MNCs to hire locals, but MNCs stimulate the economy through taxes and creating opportunities for SMEs.",12,310,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00310
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I wish to record my appreciation to our Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and A*STAR for ensuring the availability and continued review of effective and efficient COVID-19 test kits, which would facilitate business travel without the need for prolonged quarantine measures across the board.",13,311,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00311
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Third, Mr Speaker, is building a Singapore Core in a tight labour market. Remaining open to global talent is not mutually exclusive to building a local core. We now have a tight job market with an oversupply of workers chasing too few jobs. It becomes more urgent and imperative than ever to strengthen the Singapore Core and enhance our fair consideration framework as mentioned by many speakers before me. I have raised this in my maiden speech five years ago, focusing on job discrimination practices and had requested for more teeth for TAFEP and also anti-discrimination legislation, five years ago. Back in November last year, I had also raised a Motion on the importance of building our Singaporean Core and tightening our job hiring and employment practices for older workers and minorities.",14,312,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00312

Now is a good time to focus on transferring capabilities from currently employed foreign employees to local workers, with the aim of localising jobs.

2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"With mounting retrenchments and job losses comes rising household economic insecurity. Adding on to these challenges is the possibility of rising inflation. It is true that there is little concern about the risk of inflation, but market strategist and financial historian Prof Russell Napier projects that inflation in the next 10 years will be between 4% and 8%. Singapore has no net debt and would have no need to engage in financial repression, but we are an open economy and a price taker, and so we will certainly be impacted by global policies.",18,316,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00316
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"For young couples who are planning to start or grow their families, how will this rising household economic insecurity influence their decisions?",19,317,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00317
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Additionally, what will all these mean for our plans to raise the GST and other economic policies? Many young couples cite the cost of living in Singapore as a deterrence from having children. So, how can Singapore be an affordable and conducive place to build a family?",20,318,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00318
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Second, housing costs and healthcare.",21,319,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00319
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Housing costs remain a key concern for young Singaporean couples who want to remain in Singapore and settle down. With inflation, the cost of raw materials will only go up. How will the Government ensure housing remains affordable for young Singaporeans?",22,320,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00320
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Third, economic implications. I will speak a bit more on this issue.",23,321,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00321
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"A key question in the minds of many economists is  what would be the long-term costs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic? Even if a vaccine, or more than one vaccine, is developed, and everyone is back at work, but what would be the impact on the nature of economic activity? There is certainly widespread discussion whether the discovery would lead to a U-shaped, V-shaped or L-shaped economic recovery.",24,322,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00322
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The key thing is whether companies and consumers would be able to regain their confidence to embark on a spending pattern. Or would they hesitate, hold back and become risk-averse? And this would become the so-called “scarring effect” that would leave a lasting impact on the economy. It is like a person who, after going through a trauma, recovers but suffers from a scarring effect on his personality and loses self-confidence. We would never know which sector of the economy would be more scarred than others, perhaps it is the travel industry (air and cruise) and the entertainment sector, and many other sectors.",25,323,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00323
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Small businesses and households are reeling from the pain of closures and bankruptcies. More than 8,600 businesses have already ceased and filed to cease operations in April and I am worried that this is only a forewarning of an unforgivably harsh and prolonged pandemic.",26,324,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00324
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Over the last six months, I have met and listened to residents either in-person or virtually, ranging from professional photographers, media professionals and Grab drivers, who sought help, and the Government has provided SIRS and COVID-19 support for them. All these measures are good. More recently, I have seen residents, who are currently restaurant and now karaoke owners, coming to obtain assistance as well as regulatory changes to allow them to utilise their business spaces for more productive purposes.",27,325,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00325
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"So far, in the short term, our multiple Budget measures provided the interventions and a kind of insurance to help protect the most vulnerable sections of society and help businesses survive. But what about the long-term effects of such measures? A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis recently showed that policies that help prevent capital depreciation or obsolescence, even if it has only modest immediate effects on output, can have substantial long-term effects. Although Government policies cannot prevent people from believing that future pandemics are more likely to occur compared to what they thought previously, good policies can, however, affect how long the on-going crisis will drag on. The important thing is that we should mitigate the costs of what is known as “belief scarring”. For example, widespread bankruptcies can lead to destruction of specific investments and a permanent erosion in the value of certain types of capital.",28,326,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00326
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I hope that the Government will not just view the prevention of bankruptcies as important, but also place importance on the method of prevention and not underestimate its long-term effects on businesses and families.",29,327,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00327
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"However, we may see more investments in the safe industries like healthcare, food and groceries, and technology. Health and safety regulations will likely remain. Global health experts have warned of more possible pandemics to come and we want to stay prepared. So, we will more than likely see less efficient use of commercial space in malls, F&B establishments, tourist attractions, on public transport and planes and so on. That brings me back to my earlier point on risk-taking behaviour. Would firms and businesses be willing to take risks, if they fear that another pandemic may wipe out their hard work and even livelihoods? How can we ensure that this fear does not lead to further decline in investments and, therefore, jobs in the long term?",30,328,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00328
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"(In English)  Mr Speaker, this scarring effect was seen previously before the 2007/2008 Financial Crisis, few would think of the possibility of a financial collapse. Today, the fear of a financial collapse has always lingered at the back of the minds of many. It is not uncommon to hear or people talking about nothing is too big to collapse after the debacle. So, policy planners would need to address how businesses will be making decisions with the added element of what is the risk to them, should there be another pandemic, not necessarily the COVID-19 pandemic, and how this will impact the appetite for investments for venturing into new businesses for expansion and how to grab opportunities now if possible.",31,329,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00329
2020-08-31-T-006,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In conclusion, Mr Speaker, as the saying goes, where there is life, there is hope. While other modern economies are battered by high infections and death rates, we have been able to keep these numbers low in the community here in Singapore. We must resist from the temptation of making comparisons, but take charge of what we can control, such as our own lives and our own health. In the meantime, the Government must look beyond labour issues and take steps to cushion the potential impact of future inflation and sectoral issues, as we pick ourselves up in a post-pandemic world.",32,330,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00330

COVID-19 has exposed significant risks in Singapore’s over-dependence on foreign manpower. Now, more than ever, in an increasingly protectionist world, our employment policies must tilt towards giving priority to Singaporeans for jobs they can do, and put in place proactive development plans to nurture Singaporeans for the skills and experience they lack.",3,333,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00333
2020-08-31-T-006,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"I have met many middle income Singaporeans, working as PMEs, who do not feel secure in their jobs. They feel intense competition from the influx of foreign talent and describe incidents of unfair employment practices by employers who display a clear preference for foreigners. Why? Many Singaporeans believe that they are being passed over for jobs that they can do because foreigners come cheaper, without the employer having to pay for CPF contributions and deal with National Service obligations, or simply because employers prefer to bring their own friends and families from overseas to fill vacancies.",4,334,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00334

2020-08-31-T-006,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Such a “Singaporean first” employment policy is consistent with other Singapore Government policies where we accord significant benefits and priorities to citizens, whether it be housing, Primary school balloting, school fees or healthcare subsidies.

2020-08-31-T-006,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"During my 20 years as an international banker, I have seen how various jurisdictions around the world enforce employment policies that promote the hiring of local talent even as they recognised the need to judiciously tap the international talent pool. Similarly, even as Singapore continues to welcome the brightest and best from around the world to help our country reach our standards of excellence in every field, we must promote the hiring and training of locals. Both objectives can be achieved concurrently.",8,338,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00338
2020-08-31-T-006,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"To ensure our economy is undergirded by our strong Singaporean Core, our manpower policies must ensure it happens. I urge the Government to put in place four key measures.",9,339,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00339
2020-08-31-T-006,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"First, enforce transparency of selection requirements. Apart from requiring that the job vacancy be posted for 28 days, the selection criteria must be completely transparent. The employer’s final hiring decision must stand up to the scrutiny of others – including the firms’ own employees as well as the authorities. Hiring based on transparent and objective selection criteria is good for business as it fosters a sense of fair play at the workplace.",10,340,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00340
2020-08-31-T-006,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Two, implement dependency ratio or quota for Employment Passes, with differentiated ceilings and salary levels for different sectors. This will certainly galvanise the necessary action on the part of employers to reduce reliance on foreigners.",11,341,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00341
2020-08-31-T-006,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Three, ensure capabilities and skills transfer to local employees. For selected sectors, there may be a need to require employers to systematically develop succession plans and capability transfers to locals and have these linked to EP approvals. Sectors with high concentrations of foreigners should then have their renewals of work passes be contingent on the firms meeting local succession and capability transfer KPIs.",12,342,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00342
2020-08-31-T-006,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Four, hold senior management accountable – require the most senior executive to sign off on employment offers to EP holders, including a declaration that the firm has complied with the above-mentioned requirements. False declarations should carry penalty under Singapore’s laws.",13,343,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00343
2020-08-31-T-006,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),The current negative sentiment against foreigners will ease when Singaporeans believe that the system takes care of their interests and it means something to be a Singaporean when applying for a job. They will be more amenable to hosting international expertise in their midst when they believe that they will benefit from a systematic transfer of skills and knowledge from foreign colleagues. Singaporeans’ attitudes toward foreigners will be more welcoming and the Government can aid this effort by putting the right systems in place.,14,344,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00344
2020-08-31-T-006,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Sir, during one of my international assignments to Canada 25 years ago, for a recruitment drive to source for bankers of Asian origin to return to Asia, I chanced upon Canada’s Equal Employment Opportunities framework. Even then, 25 years ago, it was against Canadian law to ask candidates about their age, gender, race, maritial status and disabilities – all things we do routinely in Singapore, as part of our employment process. To comply with Canadian laws, HR changed the application forms, removing all reference to these factors and focused the selection completely on job-related skills and experience. This experience left a deep impression on me – that candidates should indeed be assessed purely on their competencies, skills and experience to do the job – and nothing else.",15,345,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00345
2020-08-31-T-006,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"In Singapore, despite numerous Government schemes encouraging the employment of older workers and mid-career Singaporeans, I often hear our citizens’ frustrations that their age and previous pay act as barriers to securing new career opportunities. This, despite genuine effort on their part to lower their expectations of rank and pay. We have also often heard of discriminatory practices against mothers and minorities.",16,346,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00346
2020-08-31-T-006,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"I call on the Government to consider implementing an Equal Employment Opportunities framework to stem discrimination in employment practices. Employers should institute hiring practices that engender blindness in the workplace towards age, gender, race, disability and everything else that they may discriminate against – for a more diverse representation across all groups. Employment equity is a matter of dignity – everyone should have an equal opportunity to work and contribute to society. At the same time, employers stand to gain from a diversified and competent workforce, one that promotes inclusion in the workplace.",17,347,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00347

Whilst I support the need to preserve our core capabilities in key sectors such as aviation, I question the sustainability of extending JSS indefinitely. It is about time that the Government transition to a much more differentiated level of support for companies. Well-intended assistance to prop up firms who are not viable in a post-COVID-19 world, may inadvertently provide them with artificial life-support to extend their decline, thus hindering the reallocation of labour and resources.",18,348,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00348

2020-08-31-T-006,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Instead of sinking millions into JSS for these companies, why not help affected workers from distressed firms directly? These workers could benefit from the Government’s direct financial assistance – start afresh to seek new careers and undergo training to move to more promising sectors and occupations. Their future should not have to be so inextricably linked to their companies’ ability to rebound. Empower the workers to seek a better future for themselves.",20,350,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00350
2020-08-31-T-006,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Sir, the poor and vulnerable have been the hardest hit by the pandemic. When lower- income residents lose their jobs or experience salary cuts, they have little savings to fall back on. Every week, I witness the hardship endured by self-employed gig workers, first-hand. I see the difficulty of many laid-off residents to secure employment and feel their frustration. The introduction of COVID-19 Support Grant to help the unemployed and SIRS to help the self-employed are steps in the right direction. At this time of great uncertainty and disruption, we owe it to our people to provide some universal safety net in the form of support for basic income, medical coverage and retirement adequacy, so that families can cope.",21,351,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00351

2020-08-31-T-006,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Sir, as Singapore faces a challenging fiscal environment given the poor economic outlook, I would like to repeat my call to the Government to consider an even more progressive personal income tax and consider introducing wealth taxes and estate duties – all aimed at building a fairer and more equal society.",23,353,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00353
2020-08-31-T-006,Foo Mee Har,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"In the past, reluctance to do so has been down to the fear of driving away wealthy investors. But I believe that, in a world made more turbulent and uncertain by COVID-19, Singapore’s unmatched proposition of a world class infrastructure, rule of law, financial and political stability and now, best-in-class healthcare, is made even stronger.

To be sure, COVID-19 affects everyone, but for lower income citizens, the impact could be devastating. Our people are frightened and worried – they need our help and they need our assurance. We, in this House, must lead with compassion, wisdom and courage.

2020-08-31-T-006,Lim Biow Chuan,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Take workers, for example. We all want a Singaporean Core; we want Singaporeans to be employed first and to get the best jobs. But yet, if we do not open our doors to allow skilled and talented foreign workers to Singapore, we risk losing out to international competition for foreign investment. If foreign investors face severe manpower restrictions and they cannot get the best workers to work here and to grow their companies, why would they come to Singapore? Why not invest in another country where manpower cost is lower and there are less restrictions?",7,362,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00362

The People’s Association had done a wonderful job in promoting social harmony and integration, racial and religious harmony. But come election time, as a people, we are no longer united and instead have become divided. Debate on policies is supposed to result in better policies for Singapore. But instead of debate on policies, the social media goes on a frenzy as political personalities are attacked during the election.

I also applaud the Government for recognising the Leader of the Opposition. I urge the Government to be more open to constructive criticisms and rational debate. I would submit that the Government must not treat politicians from other parties as enemies. They too are fellow Singaporeans.

He may not be able to sell his home during a financial crisis. During good times, he pays all his taxes dutifully. But when times are hard, should the Government decline to help these people just because they have a house with a higher value? Is the COVID-19 crisis something that they could have predicted?

In this climate of COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to see more business disruptions. Some entrepreneurs will fail because their business models have been destructed if not disrupted by COVID-19. We need to help these entrepreneurs restart much like how we help budding entrepreneurs to start up.",17,392,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00392
2020-08-31-T-006,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Seasoned entrepreneurs have years of experience, knowledge and networks that can be potentially wasted if they are unable to restart fast. We need to help them with a tangible rebound by assisting them with seed capital and public financing to restart. With this approach, they can contribute to our economy and society quickly, thereby creating new jobs and benefiting Singapore to emerge faster and stronger. To help our entrepreneurs restart quickly, our regulatory agencies will need to process new applications faster as it is important to consider the opportunity cost to our society.",18,393,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00393
2020-08-31-T-006,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"To help our entrepreneurs rejuvenate, we need to be more targeted in manpower policies towards different industries. MOM's recent announcement of raising EP and S Pass minimum salary impacts industries unevenly. Industries, such as offshore and marine, travel and hospitality, construction, retail and F&B are already reeling from the impact of COVID-19. The additional cost levied on these industries are hard to bare. We need companies to survive and thrive. In this way, we continue to help our Singaporeans by preserving their jobs and their livelihood as SMEs employ close to 70% of our workforce.",19,394,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00394
2020-08-31-T-006,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Thirdly, we need to further enhance support for businesses who face financial challenges. The reality is this  as many businesses re- start, they face a mountain of old debt, be it rental arrears or owing to suppliers. Cashflow remains a challenge. The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act and the new rental relief framework for SMEs have been beneficial and provided some peace of mind for our entrepreneurs. However, it is temporary and the hard reality kicks in after the COVID-19 measures are lifted. Some businesses may want to restart but they have a problem of getting fresh credit. Many also worry about their old debts having snowballed. In the case of rental arrears, these businesses must now cope with repayments due under the rental relief on top of their already strained cashflow situation.",20,395,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00395
2020-08-31-T-006,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"As such, I would like to propose that  (a) a repayment scheme be extended for more categories of debts. This can be patterned along the lines of the COVID-19 re-payment scheme for rent arrears. The new categories can include other obligations, such as liabilities under personal guarantees or insurance bonds, trade financing and term loans. There should be an instalment plan outlining a clear debts repayment schedule with capped interest rates; and (b) we should make it clear that Directors should not be liable for insolvency trading if the insolvency period arises from 1 February 2020. Currently, this relief is only temporary. These additional moves would provide entrepreneurs more runway to pay their debts, ensuring their mental wellness while attempting to restart their businesses.",21,396,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00396
2020-08-31-T-006,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Fourth, more innovation can take place when companies look beyond its specific vertical and sector. Cross sectoral collaborations provide opportunities where skillsets can be combined synergistically to create new business products and services. To enable more of such cross-industry collaborations, we need to add horizontal layers in our current way of structuring industry verticals. Government officers will need to have horizontal exposure and skill sets to better support our companies. We will need to promote more networking opportunities and collaborations between trade associations. We need to promote more Joint Venture opportunities. Let us keep finding more ways to integrate all our efforts further so  that there is more collaboration between partners so that we achieve higher network effect for our enterprises.",22,397,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00397
2020-08-31-T-006,Edward Chia Bing Hui,Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah),"And, last but not the least, beyond support measures, the Government needs to also foster the best environment for our SMEs and entrepreneurs to succeed. I am heartened that MTI has convened a Fair Tenancy ProTem committee. COVID-19 brought structural imbalances of the landlord-tenant relationship to bare. For many SMEs who are tenants, they rely on an equitable partnership with their landlords to thrive. Those who are fortunate to have landlords who adopt a partnership mindset have a higher chance to thrive and as they grow, their landlords benefit too as they take up more space. As with all types of relationships, there needs to be trust and trust is built on transparency. We need to ensure a fair and transparent relationship between landlords and tenants so that both can grow in a sustainable manner with the end goal of providing societal well-being.",23,398,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00398

As such, we need to broaden and recalibrate our performance indicators when supporting them; (b) we need to enhance our existing grant schemes to enable our entrepreneurs and their enterprises to revive, rejuvenate and re-start; (c) we need to provide an assured legal framework on insolvency and debts repayment for targeted companies and entrepreneurs to enable them to restart now and after COVID-19; (d) we need to develop an eco-system to enable more cross sector collaborations; and (e) through a Fair Tenancy Framework, provide a conducive and fair environment for our SMEs to thrive in Singapore.",24,399,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00399

This pertains to his reference to my speech and specifically the bit on fair hiring. I would like to refer, for that purpose, to an article that was in The Straits Times on 21 October 2019, entitled ""Ensuring Level Playing Field for Singaporean Job Applicants"". And reference was made there to a local IT firm found to be unfairly favouring job applicants who are foreigners. The firm was barred in mid-2017 from hiring foreign staff until it improved its practices – which is the standard form of what happens to employers of who practise unfair hiring.

Can the Minister share what really this entails, going forward, in light of unfair hiring practices, how is the system going to change from what it is, what it has been? FCF was introduced in 2014 – it has been five over years. Is the Ministry still seeing employers who are errant and who essentially do not cooperate?

As the competition for scarce jobs heats up, re-looking at our Employment Pass policy is necessary. I therefore welcome the announcement revising the minimum salary requirements for Employment Passes and S Passes.

By way of an example, I know a small to medium size insurance outfit with a UK Head Office and international ownership. It has established its Asian office in Singapore more than 10 years ago, dealing with largely Singaporean and Asian customers. From the beginning a large number of employees were expatriates from its UK Head Office who variously ran the office and took charge of various business functions such as claims in underwriting. These expats were on expatriate packages. The people who ran the office heading the various business functions here, were mid-level executives with qualifications and experiences comparable to their Singapore PMET counterparts. In my view, there is no lack of local talent in Singapore who can run this outfit and its various business functions.

Singaporeans are highly dependent on our public transport system as we seek to build a car-lite society.

The Minister for Transport has mentioned on social media the subsidies needed for maintaining the affected MRT and bus services. While I see the need to ensure a degree of sustainability of our public transport, without those subsidies to build the connectivity require for a car-lite society, how can Singapore achieve the goals to reduce the reliance on cars and properly connect Singaporeans to the places they want to go in a reasonable and efficient manner?",27,502,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00502

So, as I said in my speech, my volunteers went to rectify it and they informed ELD that after the first complaint, the rectification had been made. Two days later, another complaint was made to ELD and we were told about it. Our volunteers went to inspect the complaints directly and made the necessary rectification.

And this is something that I think back in 2015, I would never envisage planting Workers' Party flags around the Fengshan Block 85 market or around the coffeeshops in Fengshan. I mean, that was unthinkable to me. My point really is that having seen what happened recently, if this is going to be a precedent that is going to be set by the PAP, perhaps the team in Hougang maybe, then really it raises the wider question of where do you want to draw the line with this kind of behaviour.",2,510,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00510

I understand the banks' current reservations in lending to seniors. Perhaps we can mandate the banks to lend against housing equity if that senior, who is Singaporean, have a Lasting Power of Attorney, so that the banks have somebody they can work with, without involving expensive legal remedies, should their clients fall ill and are mentally incapacitated.

2020-08-31-T-006,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"In areas of defence and foreign policy, foreign and domestic intelligence matters, and reserve management, we must maintain confidentiality, as we are living in an increasingly dangerous world. But in most other areas, we can do more to open up the processes, empower our people with facts, so that Singaporeans can make tough choices together.",32,550,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00550
2020-08-31-T-006,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"One particular area for co-creating with Singaporeans is climate change. There is this African proverb, “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” And the longest term challenge that Singaporeans must face together is climate change. Therefore, I propose that our Government open up the hoods of the Government workings on Climate Change to Singaporeans, so that our citizens have the information and incentive to co-create policy, including making difficult policy trade-offs.",33,551,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00551
2020-08-31-T-006,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"As a start, we can level up our environmental groups and our youths with the latest policy research and technology innovation through high-powered forums. By that, I mean going beyond the occasional consultation exercise. It means ensuring that all stakeholders have access to the same set of core facts.",34,552,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00552
2020-08-31-T-006,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"The Government can also publicise, apart from a white paper spelling out the details of our emission tracking framework, the mechanism for regulating emissions including administrative measures and on how we arrive at carbon taxation. We can also regularly share how are we faring, at a programme level, not just at the whole national level, against our ambitious targets.",35,553,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00553
2020-08-31-T-006,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Having spoken to various Government officials, I am aware of the tremendous efforts and resources that our Government is pouring into this area. Our Government is actively pursuing changing our energy imports for power generation away from natural gas and towards cleaner sources of energy, not just solar energy, but also green hydrogen. We are also examining how to reduce and transform industrial emissions through carbon sequestration, and through mineralisation of carbon so as to transform emissions into sand or ammonia. We are also adopting electric vehicles.",36,554,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00554
2020-08-31-T-006,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"These are concrete and exciting plans. I am proud to say that Singapore is one of the few countries in the world that has real political will and resources to meet our climate change obligations. Therefore, why not we share the nuts and bolts of these exciting plans, including the implementation cost and expected emissions reduction, with our people?",37,555,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00555
2020-08-31-T-006,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Despite our Government’s best efforts, however, it is likely that our current plan can only allow us to meet a bulk of our long-term emission targets.

2020-08-31-T-006,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"I hope the Government can share the gaps openly and transparently, and then work, in the spirit of SG Together, with our environmental groups, industry, and our people to close these gaps. This could also include putting up more calls for industrial collaboration and to elicit solid proposals from our environmental groups and our youths.",39,557,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00557
2020-08-31-T-006,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"But whatever ideas that we gather must hold up to the highest standards. We must make sure that these ideas are implementable and cost effective. In fact, I further believe that Singapore should set up an independent environmental impact assessment and audit outfit, perhaps in collaboration with the UN Secretariat for Climate Change, or with a think-tank with deep expertise such as the McKinsey Global Institute. This outfit can assess the cost and benefit of emission reduction efforts from not just the Government, but also the proposals from the industries, environmental groups and Singaporeans.",40,558,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00558
2020-08-31-T-006,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),Having an independent body to evaluate the impact will allow us to make the trade-offs so that we can decide how to best meet emission targets while preserving economic opportunities and quality of life.,41,559,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00559
2020-08-31-T-006,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"And also, we must also give our environmental groups, the industries and Singaporeans who have come up with these ideas the opportunity to see them through because they care.",42,560,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00560
2020-08-31-T-006,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"Indeed, there are ample opportunities on how our Government bring passionate people to deliver on Government objectives.

2020-08-31-T-006,Kwek Hian Chuan Henry,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru),"If we can achieve all that, I am confident that the vast majority of Singaporeans, including our youths, will be proud of not just achieving our Climate Change obligations to the world, but also how we can do so together as one Singapore.",44,562,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00562

2020-08-31-T-006,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Prior to the crisis, our economy was already facing immense structural challenges and shifts. Examples include an ageing population, the shift towards the gig economy and the increasing use of automation driven by Industry 4.0. COVID-19 has merely accelerated the pace of this transformation, at an unprecedented pace, causing our future workplace, which many had thought would happen in decades to come, to become a reality much sooner.",2,565,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00565
2020-08-31-T-006,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"All jobs and all workers will have to transform, or risk becoming obsolete. No job is safe. In recent years, much of the work traditionally done by accountants, lawyers and even doctors have been automated and accomplished with greater accuracy. Real estate agents and financial planners are already starting to be phased out by digital apps. Our work and our workplaces are transforming. But are our companies, our workers and the Government ready?",3,566,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00566
2020-08-31-T-006,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Let me first start with the shape and form of the future workplace. In my view, it will be smarter, leaner and more connected.",4,567,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00567
2020-08-31-T-006,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"In the manufacturing sector, artificial intelligence and automation will mean that mundane jobs will be phased out. As technology redefines existing job roles into smaller tasks, more jobs will be increasingly taken over by robots. As Minister Ong Ye Kung once aptly put it, “If you work like a robot, you will be replaced by a robot”. Our workers of tomorrow will need to learn the latest technologies and be able to work with them.",5,568,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00568
2020-08-31-T-006,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"One example is how autonomous vehicles (AV) will drastically redefine our land transport industry. Locally, AV technology is already being trialled in areas with complex traffic conditions and we will soon see large-scale trials in Punggol, Tengah and the Jurong Innovation District. What will happen to the livelihoods of more than 10,000 bus drivers? What about the 100,000 Singaporeans who hold a Taxi or Private Hire Car vocational licence, many of whom rely on driving today as their source of income? Since 2016, I have been highlighting in this House the impact of autonomous technology on the livelihoods of our transport workers.

2020-08-31-T-006,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"I am glad to see that some forward-looking companies are already taking steps to gear up their workforce for the future. DBS, for example, has partnered with Amazon Web Services to equip 3,000 employees with basic knowledge in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The bank, which was one of the first to embrace digital banking, has also invested significantly in its digital learning tools to enable their employees to upgrade their skills and acquire new knowledge, even while they work from home.",8,571,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00571

2020-08-31-T-006,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"We would also need to move upstream to prepare our future workforce. Data literacy and coding will be important skills that our young will need to be familiar with. We should make Computer Science a compulsory subject in Secondary schools. I am not suggesting that we train every Singaporean child to be a coder or an IT expert, but to understand computers and to be able to work with robots in the future workplace. Countries, such as Japan, South Korea and the UK, have already taken steps in this direction, with coding and programming incorporated into the mandatory education for students.",11,574,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00574

Competition for jobs will truly become globalised, blurring the divide between local and foreign workforce. So, while I welcome the recent announcement by MOM to further adjust the Employment Pass and S Pass qualifying salaries, my question is  will our work pass and Employment Pass system continue to be relevant when companies no longer need employees to be physically based in one location to perform the work?",12,575,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00575

PMETs, particularly in their 40s and 50s, tell me that it is not easy to juggle between the many responsibilities that they must shoulder every day – looking after their young children, managing the healthcare needs of their elderly parents and trying to set aside funds for their own retirement needs. With this overwhelming ""sandwiched"" feeling, many are unable to think beyond their daily struggles. I hope that the Government will recognise this and look into how we can better support and alleviate these burdens.",14,577,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00577

These past six months have taught us that blurring the lines between home and office has its challenges. A recent study by the National University of Singapore found that those who work from home faced higher levels of stress than our frontline workers. I hope that the Government could expand the list of Occupational Diseases under the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA), to include mental health illnesses related to work stress. I also hope that the Tripartite Advisory on Mental Health can be expedited, so that those who are currently struggling with mental health issues related to work can get the necessary support that they need.",17,580,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00580

Freelancers do not enjoy the same WSH statutory benefits as employees, such as coverage under WICA, medical group insurance and medical leave. The lack of adequate WSH protection effectively means that freelancers are cheaper to hire, which pushes more companies to adopt such self-employed arrangements to avoid costs.

Whether the company is ""major"" would be defined in terms of specific turnover, profit and/or number of staff in Singapore.",21,665,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00665
2020-08-31-T-006,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Second, the gathering and sharing of data gives us an effective platform to discuss meaningful strategies moving forward. It is said, ""We don't know what we don't know."" By gathering data on PMET workforce composition in major companies will give us an early warning indicators before the situation gets out of hand. After all, just like when it comes to disease management, it is much easier to prevent, than to rectify.",22,666,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00666
2020-08-31-T-006,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"We do not want a situation where MOM starts to place employers on the watch list for possible discriminatory hiring practices after discovering that they have many Employment Pass and S Pass holders, outnumbering local PMEs. I am referring to the news in early August where 47 employers were blacklisted by MOM and majority were from the financial and professional services sectors.",23,667,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00667
2020-08-31-T-006,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"The third objective is the active dissemination of best practices. The Committee could work with these companies to share best practices that develop Singaporean core at the middle and top management levels. The sharing of data and best practices could push companies to level up. For instance, knowing that a company in a particular sector hires 60% to 70% of Singaporeans for its mid and top management levels, might compel other companies in the sector to do some soul-searching.",24,668,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00668

2020-08-31-T-006,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Over time, the National HR Committee could develop guidelines and blueprint based on the best practices across the industries. For instance, if a company has a regional HQ in Singapore, it should have a plan to give their Singaporean executives regional exposure, which might open up opportunities for promotion later on. This is important because I realise that Singaporeans sometimes lack regional or global exposure, as they are not given opportunities to get it. As a result, they are side-lined.",26,670,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00670
2020-08-31-T-006,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"The same committee can also receive feedback from these companies and work with institutions of higher learning or training providers, to train Singaporeans who can take on higher level jobs in the near future.",27,671,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00671
2020-08-31-T-006,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"In short, we do not want to impose a strict quota on recruiting foreigners in leadership positions for companies based in Singapore as that will stifle Singapore’s competitiveness. Neither can we remain status quo where we allow more than 1,200 companies to flout the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF), because they might have bad discriminatory hiring practices.",28,672,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00672
2020-08-31-T-006,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"We need to take the bull by its horns. We do not want major companies in Singapore to be able to hire foreigners in leadership positions too easily. We want these companies to nurture and grow the Singaporean Core. On this note, I am heartened that Deputy Prime Minister Heng has just reiterated that we need to do all things possible for the benefit of Singaporeans.",29,673,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00673

A few days ago, when I was making house visits, a resident lamented that several of her foreign colleagues had been sent home after their contracts expired. Some have even been laid off. She felt sad about it. I comforted her that, at least, her Singaporean colleagues and herself were able to keep their jobs.

2020-08-31-T-006,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Firstly, we want to send a strong signal to all major enterprises in Singapore that every company must treat their local employees fairly and give them opportunities for promotion. When the National HR Committee discovers that some of these major companies do not even have a Singaporean as the Head of HR, this would be a reflection of their weak dedication towards building a Singaporean Core. On discovery of such things, the Committee may issue proper guidance to the companies.",34,678,2020-08-31-T-006-S-00678
2020-08-31-T-006,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"However, we should not simply copy other countries by legislating how many local employees a company must have.

We welcome them. At the same time, these foreign companies have also benefited from Singapore’s eco-system, Singapore’s strategic locations and Singapore’s business-friendly infrastructure. Thus, they also have the obligation to grow the Singaporean Core in their workforce and their management team in Singapore.

My father worked as a delivery man and later on as a taxi driver while my mother assembled electronic parts at home and later on, she became a part-time cashier when we were older.

No system should stop parents from investing in their own children, but any system should attempt to minimise inequalities. It is heartening that we have more Allied Educators now and I would suggest that this be moved upstream to MOE Kindergartens and the ones operate by the anchor operators. We can formalise the tripartite partnership between the schools, Social Service Offices (SSOs) and Family Service Centres (FSCs) so that the pipeline of cases can be reviewed regularly.

We have made some progress in raising productivity in the last 10 years, but it takes much effort to keep up the momentum. And while we have a highly educated population and dynamic workforce, our local labour force is ageing. Last year, the median age of residents in our labour force was 44 years old. The median age will gradually creep upwards. At the same time, the proportion of Singapore citizens between 20 and 64 years old will decline. This is the group that forms the bulk of our labour force. In 2019, around 63% of our citizen population were between 20 and 64 years old. Ten years from now, this is projected to drop to around 56%.

The adoption of new technologies and digitalisation in construction has created new and higher skilled jobs in the sector. With the push for Design for Manufacturing and Assembly, more construction work has shifted off-site to automated production facilities that require production managers and quality assurance personnel, as well as logistics and supply chain planners. These jobs offer better work environment for our local PMETs.
