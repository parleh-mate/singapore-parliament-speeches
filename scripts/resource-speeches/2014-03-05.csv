2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, it has been said that a mature society desires a lot more than to save itself physically and economically. A mature society, in the words of Thomas Berry, ""experiences the world, not as a useful collection of objects, but as the sacred communion of subjects"".",1,14,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00014
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"In the two years that I have been a Member of this House, I have called for policies that think with the heart and not the head. I believe that this year's Budget had sought to do just that.",2,15,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00015
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, I join my colleagues in this House in supporting the Budget and applauding Deputy Prime Minister Tharman and the Government for acknowledging, honouring and rewarding our esteemed Pioneer Generation for their contributions in building this country though the special feature in this year's Budget, the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP).",3,16,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00016
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"I also welcome the fact that Budget 2014 took pains to focus on building a fair and equitable society. It underscores that while we all have different gifts and talent, and have different starting points in life, social mobility is what we aim for. I am also heartened by the move away from cheap-sourcing, which has the consequence of demeaning the work of certain groups of people, stripping them of their dignity and making the relationship a purely transactional one.",4,17,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00017
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"Madam, there is just one concern that I have with the Pioneer Generation Package, which is that it may unwittingly give the impression that we reward our Pioneer Generation when they are sick and not so much on what I consider the preferred basis – that we take care of our elderly regardless.",5,18,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00018
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, in the two years that I have been in the House and now, participating in my third and last Budget debate, raising issues specifically on what has been and still are considered non-mainstream issues – that of the environment – and sometimes, feeling like that strange character in the book by Dr Seuss called The Lorax, speaking for the trees and those that have no tongue, it has always been my inclination to question fundamentals and the philosophy behind policies by asking these three questions  does it educate; does it engage; does it empower?",6,19,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00019
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"So, it is in this spirit of educate, engage and empower that I speak on the Budget. Much has been said about how prudent fiscal policies and productivity are the keys for Singapore to continue to thrive in this globalised world.",7,20,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00020
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),Much is also made of how and why our record of productivity has not been a sterling one in the last few years.,8,21,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00021
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"As I listen to the concerns raised by some of my colleagues in this House that Singaporeans are said to have low self-esteem, lack motivation and pride in their work, reluctant to go beyond the call of duty, not taking ownership for the cleanliness of their living spaces and leaving it instead to the legions of foreign cleaners, I pause to ask why. And I would like to offer some views to overcome these attitudes and how that productivity can be enhanced in a way that is empowering and sustainable for the highest good of all concerned.",9,22,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00022

2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, among the many issues relating to healthcare, recently some Members of this House had raised the bed crunch issue in our hospitals and were given the assurance by MOH that such needs will be adequately met. There have also been several calls to make medical cost affordable through the various schemes. In the Pioneer Generation Package itself, there is substantial financial support for our senior citizens for their medical needs.",11,24,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00024

2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, in my Budget speech last year, I had made reference to a report in The Straits Times of the increasing suicide rates among older people. Late last year, I filed a Parliamentary Question (PQ) on the rise of suicide rates among the youths. Very recently, I have been very disturbed by the rise in the number of animal abusers which has prompted the Minister for Law to promise more severe punishment for the guilty. Many of us are also familiar with videos taken by ordinary citizens of road rage and road bullies, as well as fights in our trains in full public view.",13,26,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00026
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),It would seem as if we are a society wrought with pent-up emotions.,14,27,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00027
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"Have we not questioned enough the underlying reasons on such pent-up emotions? When we increase the severity of punishments for animal abusers, do we also recognise that underlying those disruptive acts are unresolved emotional issues that make it easy for someone to take it out on others deemed weaker than they, whether be it an animal, a child, a spouse or the elderly?",15,28,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00028
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"When the elderly are driven to suicide, could the loss of familiar places, spaces and faces, and the bewildering change around them have something to do with it? Have we considered that all these may well be symptomatic of a society that has emotional issues which are not given the chance to react in a safe non-judgemental way?",16,29,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00029
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"Could all these pent-up emotions be one reason why we are not productive at work and at home, not motivated and have such low self-esteem, as mentioned by some Members in the House?",17,30,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00030
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, for a very long time, it has been widely known that a physical ailment is really a result of an emotional imbalance, as a result of suppressed emotions. Science is only beginning to recognise that in fact there is a mind-body connection between how we think, what we feel, and our physical thesis.",18,31,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00031
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"It is interesting to me that on Monday's The Straits Times, there was a report on the increasing popularity on what is termed ""mindfulness techniques"" in the private sector as people turn away from pills and pharmaceuticals towards a non-chemical based way of dealing with stress.",19,32,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00032
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"It is also interesting to me that in a school in North Thailand, students are taught relaxation techniques, resulting in a more composed outlook towards life. It is clear today that an emotionally-centred society is a healthier society, and I would venture to add, a more productive one.",20,33,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00033
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"At this point, I declare my interest as a facilitator of self empowerment workshops, supporting people as they navigate their way through emotional challenges. It is when people are given the space and skills to express and release their emotions, and channel them constructively that real personal transformation happens. Often, for such people, they no longer see themselves as victims, but rather as empowered people able to make life-affirming choices.",21,34,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00034
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"I would argue, therefore, that beyond exercise, diet and discouraging smoking, our Healthy Lifestyle campaign should provide these lifeskills because real healthcare is about dealing with the underlying causes, and not just the symptoms through the provision of pharmaceutical and hospital services.",22,35,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00035
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"I, therefore, call for the kind of healthcare that places as much, if not more, emphasis on the lifeskills that support Singaporeans manage their emotional challenges beyond the physical rewards and the extra sick beds.",23,36,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00036

2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, in my maiden speech in 2012, I had given anecdotal evidence of how my 19-year old students felt a sense of awe and wonder when they discovered that in the nature reserves of this tiny red dot we called home, is also home to a whole range of wildlife some of which cannot be found elsewhere in the world.",25,38,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00038
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"For some of my students, this was a defining moment in their lives – what I call a ""National Geographic"" moment. For many of them, this experience led to a feeling of a sense of place, identity and pride in their country. For others, it gave them a sense of repose, peace and calm.",26,39,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00039
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"Could this exposure to our national spaces be one way in which we restore and regenerate the sense of pride in ourselves and our country, leading to more interest, care and concern to look after ourselves and our public spaces – both built and natural?",27,40,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00040

2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"Apart from giving rise to a whole generation of aware and conscious young people – eager to volunteer, share their passion, and proud of what their country can offer – I know many of these young people have also chosen studies and careers in the environment field so that what was once a hobby, is now a paid vocation.",30,43,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00043
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"There is no better way to produce a more productive society than young people who, in the words of Joseph Campbell, ""had followed their bliss"". We can thank our wild spaces for that.",31,44,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00044
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"Further, the fact that registrations for public walks filled up really quickly shows how Singaporeans feel about the need to reconnect with nature, and how much they value these places.",32,45,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00045
2014-03-05-T-004,Faizah Jamal,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"Mdm Speaker, in my maiden speech, I had also asked that we do not focus overly on the built economy without, at the same, accounting for the loss of what is called ""natural capital"" defined as land, water, air, living organisms, and all that provide us with eco-system, goods and services imperative for our survival and well-being.",33,46,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00046

2014-03-05-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Mdm Speaker, please allow me to speak in Mandarin first.",1,82,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00082
2014-03-05-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech on Pg xxxx.] This year's Budget, especially the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP), was applauded by all the Members who have spoken. In my view, there are three main reasons why this unprecedented PGP received such strong support. Firstly, the $9 billion package could be funded totally by the 2014 Budget without burdening our future generations. Secondly, the Package is able to cover a major part of the Pioneer Generation's medical expenses for their entire life span, which is a big relief to them. Thirdly, the inclusiveness of the Package is a surprise to many. The Package covers the Pioneer Generation, regardless of whether you are a millionaire or a pauper.",2,83,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00083
2014-03-05-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Soon after the announcement of the Package, a few Members and many Singaporeans started to ask, ""Can we have other packages similar to the Pioneer Generation Package?"" The second generation of pioneers may say, ""While it is difficult to start a business, it is harder to keep it going; therefore, we also deserve a package for the generation who keep things going"". In the end, how many packages can we afford?",3,84,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00084
2014-03-05-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"There is a need to manage people's expectations after we implement the PGP. Otherwise, we will fall into the same trap as Greece and Italy where the governments are having deep financial troubles. So, how do we manage the people's expectations? I want to lay out three principles as a basis for further consideration.",4,85,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00085
2014-03-05-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Firstly, we need to be prudent and use our Budget surplus to pay for any new packages, similar to the PGP. We should not spend the money of our future generations. In this way, Singaporeans can better appreciate the importance of economic growth and see the need to transform our economy so that we can enjoy sustainable growth.",5,86,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00086
2014-03-05-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Secondly, future packages need to adopt the principle of targeted approach. If we divide the $9 billion PGP by the 450,000 pioneers, every pioneer is entitled to $20,000 on average and it is sufficient to pay for most of their medical bills in their lifetime. If we decide to spend the same $9 billion equally on all Singaporeans who are above 25 years old and there are 2.3 million of us, then each of us will only receive $3,850, not very significant. Hence, it is wiser to spend our financial surplus on people who really need it, so as to achieve the maximum impact.",6,87,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00087
2014-03-05-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"And that leads us to the third principle. That is, future packages should not be as universal as the PGP. The Pioneer Generation is quite a homogeneous group. Most of them are not well-educated, have had lower income and thus do not have much savings in their CPF accounts. Hence, it is understandable that the PGP has to be inclusive.",7,88,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00088
2014-03-05-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),The younger generation is more fortunate. We have gone through a period of rapid economic development. The income gap of the second generation Singaporeans is much wider and quite a significant number of them manage to make a fortune from the property market. The wealthier Singaporeans could afford to be gracious and let the less well-off Singaporeans enjoy a bigger share of the future packages. The wealthier Singaporeans do not have to insist that everyone receives the same benefits. I will speak more about the issue of how property appreciation has only benefited a small number of Singaporeans in my English speech later.,8,89,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00089
2014-03-05-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"In conclusion, I hope that the PGP can help to improve the bonding among Singaporeans, rather than divide us. Some who are aged 55 to 64 years old need not fret because you are not included in the PGP. You will still enjoy the Medisave top-up every year. In addition, many of you who are in this age group are still independent and able to work. To this end, I agree that employers have to treat older workers fairly, as advocated by hon Member Mr David Ong.",9,90,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00090
2014-03-05-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"More importantly, I hope that the PGP will remind Singaporeans of the importance of economic growth. It is unwise to advocate zero economic growth as what a small group of people have done. We must stand united, grow our economy and practise prudent fiscal policies so that all of us can share the fruits of economic growth. We should not let down the Pioneer Generation who had worked so hard to build the Singapore we have today.",10,91,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00091
2014-03-05-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"(In English)  Mdm Speaker, let me now turn our attention to the plight of Small and Medium Enterprises or SMEs, like what eight Members had done yesterday. SMEs are facing higher manpower and rental costs amongst others. It is inevitable that manpower costs will rise as we strive to pay local workers more. I agree that we should pay Singaporeans workers more, especially the low-wage workers. In addition, companies have to pay higher foreign workers' levy due to the Government's effort to reduce reliance on manpower growth to grow our economy. To assist SMEs to improve productivity, the Government has offered schemes like PIC, PIC+ and so on.",11,92,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00092
2014-03-05-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"To some SMEs, these schemes may not be enough. SMEs are also facing pressure from rising industrial land costs. According to the information on the URA's website, the price of multiple-user factory space has increased by about 100% between 2010 and 2013, which is alarming.",12,93,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00093
2014-03-05-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"The increase in commercial property prices has enriched a few parties, such as the developers, REITs, speculators and so on. However, for the majority of business owners who cannot afford to own industrial properties, they are at the mercy of the rising rental costs. To relieve SMEs of such cost pressure, Government might want to consider once again, getting JTC to play a more active role in developing factories for SMEs, instead of selling industrial lands to private developers.",13,94,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00094
2014-03-05-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Remaining on the topic of property prices, I would like to shift the focus to the commercial space around transport nodes such as MRT stations and bus interchanges. The heavy human traffic at the transport nodes makes it very attractive for firms to sell their goods and services within the 400-metre to 800-metre radius of MRT stations or bus interchanges. If we leave it to pure market forces, firms with the highest profit margins will snap up commercial spaces around the transport nodes. Social services providers such as childcare centres with lower margins will not be able to afford to lease the spaces near to the transport nodes but these services are essential if we want to improve our fertility rate.",14,95,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00095
2014-03-05-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"One classic example is how legal moneylenders and pawnshops with high profit margins have taken over a significant number of shops at a town centre beside a major MRT station. At the same time, there is a long waiting list for childcare places at the same town centre but most childcare centre operators cannot afford the high rent near the MRT station.",15,96,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00096
2014-03-05-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"If we leave it entirely to market forces, we would be faced with the above situation. Hence, I propose that the Government take steps to reserve commercial spaces near MRT stations for social service providers, such as childcare centres, library, social service offices and so on, to provide better conveniences for the residents.",16,97,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00097
2014-03-05-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"As we build new MRT stations and there are more vacant lands surrounding these stations, the Government could consider providing incentives for the developers to reserve floor spaces for social services providers without affecting the plot ratio meant for commercial uses.",17,98,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00098
2014-03-05-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Mdm Speaker, the Government has taken bold measures to honour the Pioneer Generation by covering a significant portion of their medical needs. It is a departure from previous Budgets whereby the Government used to devote more resources to drive the economy. Budget 2014 also aims to spread the fruits of our economic success and our economic growth to a larger segment of the population. We would not want to reach the same situation as the US, whereby the top 10% of earners took in more than half of the country's total income. This is not desirable.",18,99,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00099
2014-03-05-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"In a similar fashion, we do not want the benefits of land appreciation to profit a small minority of individuals. In particular, we hope that the Government would consider spreading the positive externalities of transport nodes to residents who need the social services such as childcare centres near MRT stations. With this, I strongly support the Budget.",19,100,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00100

First, the issue of cost of living. And second, the issue of business costs, particularly for our SME sector. I will speak about each of these two aspects in turn.",10,110,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00110
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"First, cost of living. Some Members – Mr Nicholas Fang and Assoc Prof Eugene Tan – mentioned the latest EIU report which ranked Singapore the most expensive city in the world. I know this is floating around and is attracting a lot of attention. I do not particularly want to focus on this report in its own right, but to explain a couple of very basic things about the reports that will come out from time to time, whether it is EIU or Mercer, which are really aimed at measuring expatriates' cost of living in different parts of the world. They are useful tools for HR managers and corporate HQs as they decide where to place their people. When they are placing them in a particular place, they need to know how to compensate them adequately based on the cost of living. It is a useful tool.",11,111,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00111
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"These are basically aimed at comparing cost of living for expatriates in different cities or different countries in the world. What this means, therefore, is two things make an important difference in these surveys; and two things in these surveys are quite different from factors that affect the cost of living for locals or Singaporeans. Quite different.",12,112,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00112
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"First, exchange rates. An important reason why, in fact, we have become an expensive place for expatriates is that the Singapore dollar has strengthened. Indeed, the EIU report pointed this out. The Singapore dollar has strengthened over the years. And it means this is an expensive place for someone who is paid in a foreign currency or for a corporate HQ abroad whose earnings are in a foreign currency. As the Singapore dollar strengthens, it becomes more expensive.",13,113,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00113
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"The reverse is true for Singaporeans. A stronger Singapore dollar improves purchasing power both in Singapore – because imported goods become cheaper, and for us, food and everyday items are all largely imported – and when Singaporeans go abroad. You can see that from the latest travel fair last week. So, a stronger Singapore dollar – not a sudden sharp appreciation but a steady appreciation – has been good for Singaporeans, but it does mean it becomes a more expensive place for expatriates on foreign currency earnings.",14,114,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00114
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"The second important difference has to do with what goods and services are being measured as part of the cost of living basket in these surveys. The EIU consumption basket – I would not knock it; it would have to be subjective, but they are trying to put together a basket of what they think are expatriate costs, perhaps a little on the high end, but expatriate costs. And it is quite different from the goods and services consumed by ordinary Singaporeans which our CPI basket, for instance, measures.",15,115,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00115
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"For example, the EIU basket includes imported cheese, filet mignon, Burberry-type raincoats – not very common in Singapore – and the four best seats in a theatre, three-course dinners at high-end restaurants for four people. These are the items in their cost of living basket. I do not think they are irrelevant to an expatriate's cost of living basket but it is quite different from the cost of living basket for Singaporeans.",16,116,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00116
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Indeed, for some of these items, Singapore is expensive. Transport is also part of the cost of living basket for these expatriate indices, but no mass public transport. It is just cars and taxis. Our public transport, as Members know, is significantly cheaper than most other cities – New York, London and Tokyo. We are comparable to Hong Kong but significantly cheaper than most other cities. Even our taxi fares are cheaper. But our cars are expensive because we are a small place. So, for an expatriate, if you want to own a car, it is expensive in Singapore. But if you are talking about an average Singaporean taking public transport, it is, in fact, much cheaper than many other cities.",17,117,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00117
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),I highlight this just to point out the differences. It is not that these surveys are wrong. It is not that they are misguided. But they are measuring something quite different from the cost of living for an ordinary local in different cities around the world.,18,118,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00118
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Unfortunately, there are, in fact, not very many surveys that truly try to measure the cost of living for ordinary residents. We have a good study that was done by the Asian Competitiveness Institute in 2012, which compared purchasing power in different cities. They specifically distinguished the cost of living for expatriates and cost of living for a typical resident household. They looked at all sources of data, including the EIU study, World Bank's International Comparisons Programme, and they constructed consumption baskets for expatriates and for ordinary residents. They found that Singapore was indeed quite expensive for expatriates compared to other cities. At the time of their study, Singapore was ranked fifth out of 109 cities in the index in terms of costs for expatriates. But costs for Singapore residents were very different. We were ranked 61st out of 109 cities when they compared the cost of living for residents. Quite similar to other Asian cities like Hong Kong, which was ranked 58th or Seoul, which was ranked 60th.",19,119,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00119
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"That is the basic difference. From time to time, these surveys will come up. I know some people will give it a spin, but they are measuring something quite different from the cost of living for our residents. What is important for us is that Singaporeans, and particularly, low- and middle-income Singaporeans, have incomes that grow faster than the cost of living. That is what is important and, in fact, that is what we have fortunately been able to achieve.",20,120,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00120
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"In the last five years alone, if you take our middle income households, our median households, their incomes have gone up faster than the cost of living as measured by the CPI index. In fact, income has gone up by about 10% in real terms; similar rate of growth for the low-income households. For the low-income households, if you exclude from the CPI index the imputed rentals for those who own their homes – they do not have to pay rent – then the increase in real incomes of the 20th percentile household was 19% over the last five years. There is thus significant improvement. We keep our eyes focused on that, on how the average Singaporean and the low-income Singaporean is doing with regard to their incomes relative to the cost of living.",21,121,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00121

Ms Jessica Tan had highlighted this as a challenge in her opening speech. There is the challenge of business costs. It has gone up. It has gone up fundamentally because we have not been doing poorly as an economy. Wages have therefore gone up. Rentals have gone up because the demand for industrial, retail and office space has been very strong. Demand has been very strong from businesses. And because supply was short of demand, rentals have gone up. Wages will go up as long as there is a tight labour market and there is a demand for labour. Demand in the economy is strong; demand for resources, and especially, labour and space. That is why costs have picked up, fundamentally.",23,123,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00123

And we can think of many cities not so far from where we are which are less vibrant and the cost of living is significantly lower, because you do not have wage pressures and rentals are cheap.

2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"We have to keep this a vibrant place; keep a check on costs to make sure they do not rise persistently faster than business profits or wages.

2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"How then do we address the challenge of business costs? If I can use a contrast that was in Mr Yeo Guat Kwang's speech between two countries. A very interesting contrast. Mr Yeo spoke about the difference between Hong Kong and Japan. In Hong Kong, retail rentals have gone up very sharply. The cost of land and the cost of all properties, including homes, have gone up very sharply. Prime retail rentals in Hong Kong today are more than seven times higher than the prices in Singapore. Their property cycles are sharper than ours. They have on a trend basis, gone up much more than we have in terms of the cost of space.",26,126,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00126
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"In Hong Kong, they leave it to the market to restructure. As rentals go up, business costs go up, businesses have to restructure. They leave things much more to the market than we do. And as a consequence, businesses have been restructuring. The example that Mr Yeo gave was of how retail rents are now so high, businesses have shifted away from traditional clientele and traditional services towards catering to the high-end Chinese. Some Hong Kong residents are not very happy about this loss of services, but that has been how their businesses adjust.",27,127,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00127
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"This was contrasted to Japan, where rents are cheaper. In Japan, strict rules on redevelopment and land uses have enabled lots of little very charming ramen shops, crafts shops, mom-and-pop shops, to survive. That is a strategy quite different from Hong Kong in another regards. It is not just that rents are cheap, but wages are stagnant, and opportunities for the young are very limited, as we all know. Japan's economic growth has stagnated. Those are two quite different approaches and I think we should avoid either extremes. Do not just leave it to the market but neither can we fix rents and keep prices low, and expect that the standard of living goes up at the same time. It does not work like that anywhere in the world.",28,128,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00128
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"What we have done is to try to mitigate the property cycle. When you look at industrial land, and at retail space, like the residential market, that is our approach. Supply is catching up quickly. In the next three years, as I mentioned in the Budget Statement, just for multiple-user factory space, the amount of new supply coming on-stream is going to be double the demand that we saw in the last few years. Demand is not going to suddenly double, but supply is going to double. So, I expect that that will have a moderating influence on rentals. Indeed, we have already seen industrial rentals fall by 1.4% in the fourth quarter of last year. Likewise, for shop space, we are expecting a very substantial increase in supply that is going to be coming on to the market.",29,129,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00129
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"That is our strategy. We do not have perfect foresight, but when we see the market heating up, we take action to boost supply and find other ways to help businesses to mitigate costs. One of the ways is what Ms Jessica Tan, Dr Teo Ho Pin and some other Members spoke about – which is to help companies to save costs through the sharing of services. We are doing it through JTC's cluster industrial spaces like the Food Hub and Tuas Biomedical Park. There will be more such cluster concepts which enable companies and especially SMEs to share services. This means reducing upfront investment costs that they would incur otherwise if they do it on their own. It also means lower maintenance cost over time.",30,130,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00130

She wanted more of those. That is also a good idea. Mr Zaqy Mohamad spoke about retail malls, helping retail SMEs to share services.

Mr Inderjit Singh had asked for a permanent solution. The permanent solution to address rising business costs is to raise productivity. That is the only permanent solution. We have got to upgrade our economy fundamentally. As long as we remain vibrant as an economy, our costs will basically approach that of an advanced country. A little higher in some areas and a little lower in some areas, but basically, we will have costs similar to that of an advanced economy.",33,133,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00133

That is the only way. We summarise it with a measure called productivity, but it is actually about those things. It is about skills; it is about workplace culture; it is about automation; it is about innovation. That is the only fundamental solution.

I am using the US here for simplicity as it is a major advanced country and, in many aspects, a leader in productivity. If we take the US as 100, Singapore was about 40% of US' productivity level in 1980, or 30 years ago. We were very much a developing country then, and recorded 40% of the US' productivity levels and well below most developed countries.",37,137,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00137

[Please refer to Annex 2 on Pg xxxx.] If you just focus on it one step at a time. It looks at the employment rate on the horizontal axis; and on the vertical axis, it looks at the level of productivity. Ten years ago, our employment rate was around 65%. Since then, our employment rate has increased. If you look at Singapore last year, our employment rate has increased significantly to over 70%. It is not the highest in the world, but it has caught up with some of the advanced countries. It is a little lower than where UK was 10 years ago, but we have caught up in employment rates.",41,141,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00141

No one is satisfied with the rate of our productivity growth in the last few years. It has been dismal. How do we go about it? What has the Government's approach been? First, we have tightened foreign worker policies. Second, we have provided very substantial assistance for our businesses to upgrade. That means, principally, providing our SMEs with assistance because all our schemes, whether it is the PIC or the Transition Support Package, have been tilted in favour of SMEs because we know they are the ones who need the most help. The large firms are able to adapt to the market much more easily. They have got the resources upfront to invest and it pays back over time. It is the SMEs who need more help.

That is about $5.8 billion, which is a very substantial amount of assistance. As I explained in the Budget Statement, it is not lathered equally across the whole system; not everyone is getting the same.

We need both approaches. It cannot be only one approach of having companies show proof before they get assistance; neither can it be an approach where the money is just being handed out liberally, upfront, no questions asked.

So, it saves them costs and manpower, and the interesting thing is that this was a solution developed by an SME itself, which IDA then went in to lend support to, and many other firms hopped onto this platform.",72,172,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00172

It involves every job. As Mr Lim Swee Say said, every job has to be professionalised. He cited the gardener in Japan, the cleaner in Germany, the waiter in the US. Every job can and has to be professionalised. It is not about preserving jobs the way they were in the past, but it is about making every job better for the worker, and thereby helping every worker to contribute to upgrading.",74,174,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00174

Based on current trends, it will mean a very different workplace, whether in Services or Manufacturing. Every area of economic activity will be different, because the digitalisation of economy is proceeding apace in every major economy and every economy that is globalised. It is proceeding apace, and it transforms not just businesses but it transforms jobs.",76,176,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00176

You are already seeing it in the United States. They call it job polarisation where the middle-level jobs are disappearing while that at the top-end is growing, and the middle-end is shifting to bottom-end. Lots of bottom-end jobs are being created. You are seeing it in the United Kingdom. We face that challenge here too, albeit in future.

It will not be a jobless world, particularly for Singapore, a small country with the world as its market. If we stay competitive, and if we get our fundamentals right, we can create jobs. There will be many jobs that involve working with technology and using technology to gain competitive advantage. Jobs in engineering, systems and product design, systems management, people who can troubleshoot problems, solve complex problems, jobs in programming and data analysis, in ICT, and jobs in the creative industry, which Ms Janice Koh had spoken about.",78,178,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00178

We know what the broad sectors are. We know that there will be jobs, but you cannot say exactly what jobs there will be, and that is why several Members have highlighted that we have to also focus on developing obsolescence-proof skills. As Ms Irene Ng put it – the skills that will apply, regardless of the job. We know roughly what they are, but we have to keep sensing the skills that are needed in the market. Being inquisitive, thinking in original ways, being in the habit of continuous learning and, very importantly, the ability to interact with others and to respect everyone. These are skills that MOE is focusing on, from the early years, all the way through the school system.",80,180,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00180
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Secondly, very importantly, we have to redefine education, and we are redefining education. So, that is not simply a matter of what we do in schools and tertiary institutions, and then you have a separate phase altogether, which is what we do in the workplace. It is not about two distinct phases of education and learning in a person's life where most education is over by the time you finish school, ITE, Polytechnic or University, and you get your certificate, and then you have a little bit of training after that as you go through working life. It has to be a continuum, a continuum that involves regular refreshing of knowledge and skills throughout our lives – that has to be the new concept of education. If you want to develop every talent, and keep adapting to this new world, including the new jobs that will come along, it has to be a continuum.",81,181,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00181

2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"But I want to emphasise two points. First, that quite apart from Government putting in resources, the business community plays a very important role and it plays a role in a somewhat different way from what has been the case before. It is not just about investing in your own employees. If you are worried about whether they are still going to be with you three or four years from now, you do not invest as much. As the economists would put it, you have to invest in the commons. Every business has to invest in its employees and if everyone does so, we raise the human capital of Singapore's society. Everyone moves up, and everyone benefits, because in a small society like Singapore, what goes around comes around. You invest in your employees, some of them may not be with you five or 10 years from now, but everyone has been raised to a different level and it is constantly moving up. That is really what we have to see. Everyone has to be invested in, every Singaporean has to be invested in with constant skills upgrading and everyone will benefit, including our businesses. The Government will help.",84,184,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00184
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Second, we will also help Singaporeans themselves to take charge of their learning and development. This is a very important strategy, going forward – strengthen career guidance, strengthen knowledge of careers from early on. There are some suggestions in the debate about starting in Secondary school. In fact, MOE is starting this – internships and work attachments even when the boys and girls are in Secondary school. At the tertiary level, the ASPIRE Committee is developing a plan for meaningful work engagements for students, in particular our ITEs and Polytechnics.",85,185,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00185
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Beyond the early internships and the attachments, it really has to be a continuous process where we have to conceive lifelong learning as one that involves regular infusions of education and learning at different times in our lives. We have to think ahead about the challenge, put the resources and plan a whole new framework for CET that enables us to do this.",86,186,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00186
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"There are examples. MOE, for instance, started a decade ago a system where every teacher and principal, after a period of years, can take time-off to learn. Some go on work attachments; some go abroad; some do something in another field of education before coming back – it is constant infusion of skills and knowledge.",87,187,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00187

Many Members spoke passionately about this – Ms Foo Mee Har, Miss Penny Low, Mr Patrick Tay – and I do not want to cover the same ground which I have stated in the Budget speech and which Members have very eloquently and thoughtfully spoken about. It is a softer area, less tangible, but we all know it underpins everything else we want to do. If we want to achieve the first two objectives of transforming our SME sector, and transforming jobs, we also have to transform the workplace culture and our social culture. We know that.",89,189,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00189

It is something that is going to take time, but we are going to pay special emphasis on this. Not just the hard skills and technologies of involving upgrading, but helping companies upgrade management practices and helping them to reshape the workplace culture with employees. This requires much more emphasis. We will be working together with companies, and working with everyone to get ground-up ideas as to how best we can do this and support this. So, it is a very important priority as we go forward.",90,190,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00190

I just want to highlight a point which Dr Lam Pin Min, Mr David Ong and Mr Ang Wei Neng a short while ago emphasised – that is, one dimension of this we have to think very hard about is the way in which we include older workers in the workplace and our economy. The reason why companies have to do this is not just because of the tight labour market and they have no choice but to employ older workers. And it is not just because we are trying to help older workers build up retirement savings and therefore we want them to work for longer. Those are the economic and financial reasons. It is also because, as Mr David Ong said, it is ultimately about self-worth, dignity and productive ageing. It is a social objective.",91,191,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00191
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"When we think about this issue, therefore, it is not just about the financial strategies. It is really about changing the way we think about every Singaporean – maximising the worth of our older workers, finding ways in which they can add value as part of a team, and this involves transforming mindsets. This is why I want to emphasise this particular point that came up very usefully in the debate. The Government will play its role and support this in every way we can. We have the Special Employment Credit, and the public sector is playing its role. For instance, MOE, again, if I just use an example, is drawing on many retired teachers, retired educationists, involving them in a very meaningful way as we upgrade our education system.",92,192,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00192

2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Next aspect of social norms which I want to mention briefly is the importance of moving to a system where self-service becomes the default option, and something which customers even prefer. If you look at what has happened in the financial industry, for instance, it is quite interesting. We now treat ATMs as the default. ATMs and Internet banking are, in fact, the default option. Not long ago, everyone wanted to go to a bank branch, speak to the officer across the counter, see the passbook being updated in front of your eyes and make sure it is updated.",94,194,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00194

In Australia, the majority of Real Estate transactions are exclusive agency arrangements. Because they are exclusive, it is a sole agent system. The agents are happy to put all the information about a property online or in newspaper ads. They leverage on ICT. When you, in fact, go and look at the house or property, the prospective buyer can look at the floor plans, the different rooms, take a virtual tour of the entire property through online property ads. As a result, basically the prospective buyers do a lot of self-service before contacting the agent. This is another example I am giving, but it applies to many other industries. In every industry, we can think of how self-service can, in fact, provide good service but it also saves on manpower and takes us to a new and higher level.",98,198,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00198

Strong support for the fact that it is focused on healthcare needs, strong support for the fact that it is being given to all pioneers regardless of income, and strong support for the fact that we are setting aside fully now the funding required for the entire life of the Package, and that it is fortunate that we have the means to do so because of our prudent fiscal policies.

Dr Teo Ho Pin in particular has asked whether we can bring forward the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) benefits, so that the Pioneer Generation can benefit earlier from the extra subsidies in our GPs. We have, in fact, studied this very carefully and we have decided to bring forward the Pioneer Generation CHAS benefits from January 2015 to September this year, so that it will come into place at the same time as the enhanced subsidies in our Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOCs).

We will do this in early July. This means that although MediShield Life is going to be implemented at the end of next year, 2015, we have two years of Medisave top-ups that the Pioneer Generation is going to enjoy.

This is, in fact, a key fiscal challenge for the future in Singapore, as it is, too, for many maturing societies. It is a key fiscal challenge that we face. I want to spend a bit of time talking about the nature of this challenge and how we should address the challenge.",119,219,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00219
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Good quality, affordable healthcare has to be our priority. We are making a few shifts in that direction – in the last few years and in this year's Budget.",120,220,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00220
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"First, we are increasing the role of risk-pooling through MediShield Life to provide all Singaporeans, including those with pre-existing illnesses, with protection against large hospitalisation bills. Greater risk-pooling.",121,221,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00221
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Second, we are increasing the Government's share of healthcare spending across healthcare settings, that is, in hospitals as well as outside hospitals. The increased subsidies in this year's Budget for SOCs, and the increased subsidies in recent years' Budgets for intermediate and long-term care services, are an important shift. It is an increase in the Government's share of spending. We have also introduced CHAS for primary care at our GPs.",122,222,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00222
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Medifund has also been strengthened and we will keep it strong as part of the system. So, that is the second part – the Government is taking on an increasing role in the financing of healthcare.",123,223,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00223
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"The third part is important, which is that we have to preserve the role of individual savings, through Medisave, as a key pillar of the system.",124,224,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00224
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Individual responsibility for health, and to save for healthcare needs, must remain a key pillar of our healthcare system. And we are going to provide additional flexibility for older Singaporeans in the use of Medisave – Minister Gan Kim Yong will talk about it more at the COS – that will help in reducing out-of-pocket payments in polyclinic and other outpatient settings. This will be implemented in the first half of next year.",125,225,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00225
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"But the sum of these changes that we have made in the last few years is quite significant. We are providing much greater support in healthcare, not just for the low-income group but also the middle income group, and particularly in the outpatient primary and step-down care sector. It is quite an important shift.",126,226,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00226
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"I will just give Members an example. And this is not a Pioneer Generation example. I will give you the example of a couple in their early 60s – I am not talking about the low-income group which, in fact, receives very significant assistance – a middle-income couple, early 60s. The median household income per capita is about $1,700 per month, so I have chosen the median household, about $1,700 per capita household income. This is a case where the husband receives day rehabilitative care two to three times a week. The wife also visits the polyclinic twice a year and SOC three times a year. Not an uncommon example.",127,227,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00227
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Over the past decade, the policy shifts that we have made to increase subsidies for the middle-income group, particularly outside hospitals, have meant that this couple would receive a quadrupling of the benefits that were in place a decade ago, that is, four times more than was the case a decade ago.",128,228,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00228
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"In addition, as we expand home-based care in future, if the husband, for instance, stays at home and receives care, the household would see a 7.5 times increase in support compared to what we had in place a decade ago.",129,229,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00229
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"So, it is a very significant increase in support that we are providing for all Singaporeans. And as the couple grows older, they will be getting Medisave top-ups through the GST Voucher, which is not an insignificant sum. Each of them will get GSTV – Medisave of $250 each a year. By the time they get to their 70s, it is $350 each a year, plus enhanced benefits of MediShield Life which cuts down on the risk of large bills in hospitals and which will come with subsidies from the Government for the middle-income group. So, I just want to say that we have been making significant shifts not just for the Pioneer Generation but for all Singaporeans as they get older especially.",130,230,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00230
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"But we have a larger challenge in future. Beyond these shifts that we are making, we have to look to the future and address the larger challenge of healthcare costs. To put the scale of things in perspective, the Pioneer Generation is 450,000 Singaporeans. The next generation, now aged 45 to 64, totals 1 million Singaporeans, and they will be entering into retirement 10 to 20 years from now. That was why they were called the ""Baby Boom"", and they will be entering into retirement 10 to 20 years from now. That is a very important challenge that we have to meet  how we can provide quality care in an affordable way. It first involves appreciating very fundamentally two key points that we have to bear in mind.",131,231,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00231
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"The first is that it is a misconception that countries that spend more are doing a better job in providing healthcare. Spending more does not mean better healthcare. The evidence is very clear on this internationally, that it is a misconception that merely spending more means better healthcare. Some countries have very high spending but, in fact, have much weaker healthcare outcomes than others.",132,232,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00232
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"I will show Members a chart to illustrate this. [Please refer to Annex 3 on Pg xxxx.] This is a set of mainly advanced countries, plus Asian countries like Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore and Japan. I will have to explain that the horizontal axis represents ""Total Healthcare Expenditure per Capita"", that is, national expenditure, whether it is the Government, insurers or individuals who are paying for it, this is total expenditure per capita. The vertical axis is for ""Health Grade"" that comes from Bloomberg's Rankings of the World's Healthiest Countries which looks at life expectancy, percentage of underweight children, proportion of people with high cholesterol and various other indicators.",133,233,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00233
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"The first thing that Members will notice, of course, is that Singapore is not doing badly on health grade. In fact, we were rated the best in the world. I do not know whether it is true, but we are certainly doing quite well in healthcare outcomes. And we are doing it with relatively lower expenditure compared to other countries. Part of this is because we are a little younger as a society compared to the maturing European societies. But even if we adjust for that, we spend less on healthcare, but we achieve good healthcare outcomes.",134,234,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00234
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Members will also see at the other end of the spectrum, the United States. People often refer to it in articles and wonder why we are not spending as much. They spend a lot of money but they get very weak healthcare outcomes, in fact, much weaker than most other advanced countries. And if we look at the countries in the middle, there is very little correlation between how much you spend and your healthcare outcomes.",135,235,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00235
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),Why is it that some countries are spending far more and yet not getting better outcomes? There are basically three reasons.,136,236,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00236
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"First, particularly in the United States, prices are just much higher. The costs are much higher for any particular treatment we talk about. If we talk about a knee replacement, it is about four times the cost in Singapore. Prices are just far higher in the United States than in other advanced countries. This is the first reason.",137,237,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00237
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"The second reason is very important because it applies to many countries, which is that incentives have led to over-prescription and over-utilisation of healthcare services. So, they end up just spending a lot more without commensurate improvements in healthcare outcomes. And this is, in fact, a very serious issue. It is an issue in countries where you have a fee-for-service model where as long as the doctors are prescribing new services and treatments, their fees go up, their incomes go up. And in the United States, in particular, their incomes can increase very significantly for prescribing additional services. That is the second reason, that there is such a thing as over-prescription and over-utilisation which does not lead to better healthcare outcomes.",138,238,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00238
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"The third reason is also very important. It is that many healthcare systems provide universal subsidies for everyone across-the-board – the poor, the middle-income and even the rich. In fact, many advanced countries do that. They provide universal subsidies across-the-board at much higher cost. It may make healthcare look very cheap for everyone at the point of consumption, but it leads to much higher usage because it looks cheap and people do not realise that they are actually paying for it in another way, through higher taxes. So, it is a system where everyone benefits from universal subsidies, leading to high utilisation of the healthcare system, but the cost is, in fact, being paid through higher taxes, insurance premiums and other means.",139,239,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00239
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"And it is not just cases like the US. Japan is actually a very good example. In Japan, health insurance covers a very wide range of services with very little control over access to treatment. The Japanese sees physicians three times more often than in other developed countries and they stay in hospitals two or three times longer than in other developed countries because the system incentivises it. And it has got nothing to do with demographics or physiology. It has nothing to do with their medical condition. It is all a matter of incentives.",140,240,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00240
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"The costs that Members saw in that chart are not the end of it. In the next 10 to 20 years, the costs are going to go up very considerably in these societies because of the incentives towards over-utilisation and over-prescription. It is a very fundamental issue. So, that is the first point. More spending does not mean better healthcare outcomes.",141,241,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00241
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"The second key point I want to make is that there is, in fact, no free or cheap healthcare anywhere in the world. It can look cheap or free at the point of obtaining the service because your insurance pays for it or the Government has subsidised it. But the public is ultimately paying for it, either through taxes or hefty insurance premiums. It is not as if someone else is paying for it. The public is, ultimately, paying for it.",142,242,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00242
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Take Germany, where co-payments at point of treatment are very low, extremely low when you go to hospital or even in an outpatient setting. The reason why it is very low is because of very substantial contributions through payroll tax to what they call a ""sickness fund"". The employer and the employee contribute 15.5% in payroll tax that goes into a ""sickness fund"". And when you think of an employer paying, it is actually out of wages, as what would have gone into wages goes into the payroll fund to pay for the sickness fund. Then, when you finally go to the hospital or clinic, you think it is very cheap. But actually you have paid for it. It is actually pre-paid healthcare, with very few limits on how you use it. This is a fundamental point we have to understand. In fact, there is no cheap or free healthcare although it sometimes looks like that. It is being paid for.",143,243,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00243
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"So, we will have to spend more on healthcare in future. As our society ages, as medical treatments that improve the quality of life become available, we will have to spend more. But we will have to do it in a cost-effective way and prevent the total healthcare bill from spiralling upwards because everyone will have to pay for that.",144,244,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00244

2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"The first strategy of rebalancing the structure of our healthcare system has been spoken about. Dr Lam Pin Min has been talking about this for some time. He has spoken about it again in the debate and several other Members have spoken about this – the need for us to place much greater emphasis on primary care and on community care  primary care through our GPs especially; community care through our rehabilitative centres, home-based care, nursing homes and other community facilities. It is very important in our next phase.",146,246,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00246
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"In the near to medium term, we will still have to expand our acute hospital capacity and we are going to invest significantly in acute hospitals. But in the longer term, it is really the expansion of capacity in primary care and community care that will ensure that we deliver quality care while preventing the total bill from spiralling out of control. We have to invest in primary care and community care and rebalance our system away from an over-concentration on the acute hospitals over the long term. That is why we have CHAS and stepped up, in fact, our subsidies for intermediate and long-term care to encourage people to get treatment and care nearer to home or at home. This is a very important shift for the future and Minister Gan Kim Yong will talk more about this at the Committee of Supply.",147,247,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00247
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"So, that is about the structure. But incentives are very important as well – incentives for the healthcare professionals and incentives for Singaporeans, ourselves. We have to first make sure that we avoid this problem of over-prescription that we have seen in so many countries. The US is an extreme example, but there are many others that we can point to, including Japan, as I spoke about. We have to ensure that treatments which are subsidised are clinically necessary based on evidence and are cost-effective.",148,248,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00248
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"There are some interesting lessons we can learn from elsewhere in this regard. In fact, in the UK, France and Germany, they have set up institutions that look at evidence-based research on effective treatments and technologies for various illnesses. When should a specialist referral be made? We can learn from some of these experiments and develop our own systems.",149,249,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00249
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Second, we have to promote more team-based care, in particular, one that allows our nurses and allied health professionals to play larger roles alongside our doctors. Here, too, there are very good examples in Australia and elsewhere, where nurses play a larger role. Dr Lam has also spoken about this.",150,250,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00250
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Third, we have to ensure that our healthcare clusters are encouraged to play a key role in managing the overall quality of care in and outside of hospital. The clusters are not just the hospitals but they involve primary care and step-down care. And our clusters have to take responsibility for overall care of the patient, both in and outside hospital. The Government will support new initiatives, new alternative approaches, such as tele-health. Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, for instance, has a tele-health system that involves nursing homes where the patients and nurses of the nursing homes can communicate directly with the geriatricians at the hospital. It saves on time, is convenient and it allows the patient to stay in the nursing home and not to be warded in the hospital.",151,251,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00251

2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"I have spoken about healthcare spending at some length because this is, in fact, a key fiscal challenge for our future – controlling total healthcare spending and finding a fair balance in terms of who pays for that total bill. A fair balance between the individual, the Government and the employer.

2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"First, expenditures will go up. We expect our expenditures to increase by another two percentage points of GDP by 2020. And beyond 2020, it will increase by at least another 1% of GDP in a decade. So, the increase is likely to be 3% of GDP in total by 2030. It will be driven by two key components  first, infrastructural spending; and secondly, social spending, especially in healthcare.",155,255,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00255
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"For infrastructure, I would not go through all the details but, basically, we have a lot more investment to do in our infrastructure. We are investing heavily in our rail lines. Over the next 10 years alone, we are going to expand our rail network by about 100 km, which is more than any other 10-year period in our history. Then, by 2030, we will be doubling our entire rail capacity to 360 km, which is a massive investment. The expansion of Changi Airport will be another very important infrastructural investment – Terminal 5 – in order to cater to many more passengers. It is not just an infrastructural facility. This is a key industry in its own right – staying relevant and competitive in the aviation space is an important economic strategy for us. And it is an important strategy to help the rest of our economy because Changi Airport also supports our wider economy. So, another very important investment and an expensive one.",156,256,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00256

Quite apart from the fact that we are building a lot more HDB flats – 100,000 new flats over the next few years – by 2020, about two-thirds of our HDB flats, which is about more than 630,000 units, will be 30 years or older. So, estate renewal and rejuvenation will be a very important priority as we go forward and, particularly in the next decade, we will have to steadily upgrade and renew our HDB estates. So, that, too, will be a source of increased spending.",157,257,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00257
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Social spending will increase and I have explained the challenge in healthcare expenditure. Quite apart from what I was talking about with regard to subsidies and the need for increased spending at point of treatment, there is an immediate infrastructural challenge. We are increasing public hospital capacity by 50% – Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Sengkang General Hospital, Woodlands General Hospital. We are increasing intermediate and long-term care facilities by 80% by 2020 – nursing homes, community hospitals – an 80% increase in capacity by 2020. And we are increasing our subsidies, as I have spoken about.",158,258,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00258
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"So, in Budget 2012, two years ago, we had projected yearly total healthcare spending to double from $4 billion to $8 billion by 2016. We are, in fact, likely to reach the $8 billion figure, which is close to 2% of GDP, a year earlier in 2015. We are going to get there earlier – $8 billion of healthcare spending in 2015. Beyond that, healthcare spending will continue to grow. We expect it to reach about $12 billion by 2020. So, from $4 billion in 2011 before we announced a change in 2012, to $12 billion by 2020, a three-time increase.",159,259,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00259

So, we have to spend more as our society gets older. But we are not spending less in other areas. In fact, if we just look at it demographically, we would think, as our society gets older, we spend more on healthcare and we spend less on the young because the younger cohorts are smaller. In fact, despite smaller cohorts, we are not spending less on education because we are spending a lot more per student. Smaller cohorts but a lot more spending per student at every level – pre-school, through our schools and, importantly, in the tertiary sector because we are expanding opportunities in the tertiary sector, including university enrolment going up to 40% of each cohort. So, we are spending a lot more on healthcare and for older Singaporeans, but other spending is not coming down. In particular, for our young, we have to keep investing in them – more investment per student, per Singaporean.",160,260,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00260

2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"First, as our spending goes up, we have to ensure that all spending is judicious.

2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Second, we have to target social subsidies at those who need them most. And for most of our schemes, this means more for the lower-income group, but also some support for our middle-income group. Avoid universal subsidies, as Mr Ang Wei Neng just said. The Pioneer Generation is the exception because we are honouring a whole generation for what they have done for Singapore. But, in general, avoid universal subsidies, stick to targeted subsidies that give more to those who need them the most and also help the middle-income group.",163,263,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00263
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"That is our first strategy to do with spending. Second, we need to raise revenues over time to ensure that we can meet our future needs without the risk of persistent deficits. We are starting from a position of strength. We have a healthy fiscal position today, and this is because we made timely changes over the years to strengthen our revenue base and to develop a resilient revenue base.",164,264,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00264
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),We increased the GST in 2007 while providing a significant package of offset to help the lower- and middle-income groups. The GST Voucher for the lower-income group is now permanent.,165,265,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00265
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"We also put in place the Net Investment Returns framework in 2008 which has been a major addition to our revenues and created better resilience in our revenues as well. Net Investment Returns Contribution provides 2% of GDP each year in our Budget or about $8 billion. To illustrate how significant it is, just think of the many other countries which are in exactly the reverse situation. Instead of bringing on to their budget, 2% of GDP each year in Net Investment Returns, they have to do the opposite. They have to find tax revenues to service debts, with 2% of GDP being the lower end of the scale, because, in fact, if we look at most of the advanced economies, for example, UK, Japan and many other countries, we are really talking about 3% to 4% of GDP each year that has to be found in revenues to service their debt – exactly the reverse situation.",166,266,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00266
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"So, this is a real strength that we have in Singapore and it comes about because we have maintained prudent fiscal policies over the years. We have built up our reserves and we are now able to use the investment returns on our reserves to fund current expenditures. So, our strong fiscal position has allowed us, in the current term, to set aside resources to meet future priority needs. And this is a prudent way of managing the Budget. While we have the strength, set some aside because we know there are needs in the future. We have set aside money for the Community Silver Trust, for R&D and, most significantly, we are setting aside monies for our Pioneer Generation.",167,267,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00267
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"But what do we expect going forward? Beyond this term of Government, it is going to be different. Our revenues are not expected to increase as a percentage of GDP. In fact, revenue growth may moderate. The asset market is likely to moderate. We are not going to get the same amount of asset market-based taxes as we had done in the last few years. Our foreign worker levy collections will also taper off as the foreign workforce growth slows down.",168,268,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00268
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"So, revenues are not going to increase as a percentage of GDP but spending will go up as a percentage of GDP. We will not have the current fiscal advantage that we have in the future. And at some point, our revenues will fall short of expenditures. This is a challenge which many economies faced. Hong Kong, which is a very similar society to us in terms of its demographics, faces the same challenge. They do not have to spend on defence and foreign relations but, in fact, they have the same ageing workforce. And they have projected that within the next seven to 10 years, they are likely to face structural deficits where revenues will fall short of expenditure structurally. Their Finance Secretary, Mr John Tsang, has acknowledged this, in fact, in last year's budget as well as this year's budget. Last year, he acknowledged that ""the growth of government revenue will drop substantially if the tax regime remains unchanged"". So, they know they need to change. Like them, we will run into structural deficits if we do not raise revenues in the next decade. So, we must be prepared for the years ahead and build up our revenues for the spending needs of the next decade and beyond.",169,269,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00269

2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),The first principle is very important. Mr Alvin Yeo and Dr Janil Puthucheary spoke about it. We have to keep our economy vibrant. That is central to our social strategies because an inclusive society is a hollow concept if we do not have fruits to redistribute and share. We have to keep the economy vibrant. And that is how Singaporeans' lives have improved.,173,273,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00273
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Economic competition is intensifying. It is not lessening. It is intensifying globally. The UK is bringing down corporate income taxes to 20% by next year. Taiwan has reduced its corporate income taxes to 17%, which is the same as Singapore. Importantly, quite apart from taxes, the world of technology and globalisation is reshaping the way business is being done. ""Re-shoring"" back to the advanced economies is happening, particularly in the United States, driven partly by cheaper energy cost because of the shale oil and gas revolution. Advances in robotics and additive manufacturing are allowing for cost-effective manufacturing to be done much nearer to their customer base, allowing for rapid proto-typing and mass customisation catering to their markets. It used to be too expensive to do it in the United States. It is becoming increasingly possible because of advances in technology.",174,274,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00274
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"To be sure, our economic competitiveness package is not just about taxes. It is about a quality workforce, excellent infrastructure, rule of law and our whole system of governance. It is about how, as Singaporeans, we make the system work well. Taxes are not the only factor. But the reality is we are a small nation without a natural hinterland and businesses do not need to be here. Ms Jessica Tan made this point that even knowledge-based and creative businesses do not need to be here. They can be done anywhere in the world. And with technological advances, they are being done everywhere in the world – sliced and distributed around the world and then brought together when it reaches the consumer. We have to remain competitive so that we continue to attract investments and grow talents. And that also involves retaining our own talents – Singaporeans who are well-qualified, well-educated and mobile.",175,275,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00275

For example, we made property taxes more progressive last year and there is further room over time to enhance our asset taxes. We have to keep all options open.",176,276,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00276

That is a very important second principle. And it means, firstly, that everyone has to pay some tax. I think that is a good society where everyone is contributing. The majority of Singaporeans do not pay income tax but they pay GST. Everyone pays something for a better Singapore. But those who have done better, those who are better-off, should contribute more to society. And the lower-income and those in need should receive the bulk of the benefits. Taxes and transfers have to enable us to level up society.",177,277,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00277
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"That is our system. Everyone contributes something but those who are better-off contribute far more, and those in need receive more benefits than the taxes they pay. They are paying something in tax but they receive more benefits back. And the GST is a good example.",178,278,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00278
2014-03-05-T-004,Tharman Shanmugaratnam,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam),"Not every tax in a progressive system needs to be a progressive tax. In fact, that is not an efficient system. Not every single tax or benefit needs to be progressive, but the system as a whole must be progressive. And the GST is a good example because the GST, in its own right, is a regressive tax. When we increased the GST, we also made major changes in our other social policies – Workfare, housing grants, education subsidies – many other changes that far more than offset the impact of a higher GST on the lower income group. It is not just a matter of the GST voucher. The GST voucher is one part of the permanent offset for the GST. It is a whole system of means-tested benefits that ensures our lower-income group gets back far more benefits than the taxes they pay. In fact, for every dollar of tax they pay, they get at least five dollars back through benefits at each stage of life – from childcare all the way to retirement needs.",179,279,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00279

[A chart was shown to hon Members. Please refer to Annex 4 on Pg xxxx.] As you can see, the bottom 50% in the income ladder receive significantly more transfers than the taxes they pay and those at the higher end are paying more taxes compared to the transfers they receive. This is expressed as a percentage of household income. If I express it in dollar terms, of course those at the higher end would be paying a very large amount of dollars in net taxes.

I have left out the first decile here, which is the bottom 10%, because we have to understand that two-thirds of the bottom 10% are, in fact, retiree households who do not have incomes, but many of them are, in fact, not poor. Sixteen percent of those in the bottom 10% live in private properties; another 13% live in HDB 5-room and executive flats; and a fair number own cars and hire maids. The bottom 10% includes basically anyone who is not earning an income from work, although some of them are quite well-off. So, I have left the bottom 10% off from there. In any event, because they do not have income from work, if I were to add them in, the benefits cannot be expressed on the chart because, as a percentage of income, it would be infinity.",184,284,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00284

And compared to 10 years ago, it has shifted – because the red bars reflect the situation in 2013, even before this year's enhancements, and the blue bars reflect the situation in 2003 – a significant shift towards progressivity in our fiscal system.",185,285,2014-03-05-T-004-S-00285

For example, while most officers are required to declare only if they have visited the local casinos more than four times in a month, senior public officers are required to declare every single visit they make. Police officers working on law enforcement matters involving the casinos are not allowed to visit the casinos, except for official reasons.

An officer can report such cases to his supervisors, his Permanent Secretary, the Head of Civil Service or the Public Service Commission. Officers may also report to enforcement agencies, such as the Police or Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). Officers do use these channels and surface suspected wrongdoing which will be investigated.

It is only human nature that many foreign spouses would like their own parents or relatives to visit them and help them out in times of need and crises.",1,366,2014-03-05-T-007-S-00366

She said that she needed her relative to stay in Singapore for another two to three months to help her look after her mother-in-law who was diagnosed with terminal cancer while she tends to her two young children and her husband who was also diagnosed with terminal cancer. He is a low-wage worker and the sole breadwinner of the family, so, she cannot afford to employ a domestic helper or an alternative caregiver.",3,368,2014-03-05-T-007-S-00368

By then, the foreign spouse no longer needed the pass for her relative. Her mother-in-law and her husband had passed on. Imagine the angst that this foreign spouse, who is already a citizen, had to go through during the long waiting period as she went about caring for her late mother-in-law, shuttling her late husband to and from home and hospital for his chemotherapy, worrying about her children and then rushing to work after finishing all these errands.",4,369,2014-03-05-T-007-S-00369

A 24-week wait for an extension of Visit Pass on compassionate grounds is hardly compassionate at all. I urge the Minister to review the current protocols and procedures used in the handling of such Visit Pass applications and renewals so that those who are in dire need will not be found waiting and wanting.",5,370,2014-03-05-T-007-S-00370

Mr Sim, a visually handicapped individual, has also not left this country since his birth in 1937.

During the same period, Singapore saw an increase in the percentage of Malay citizen population from 14.9% in 2000 to 15.1% in 2010.

To enable this, we must continue to shift our society and foster a pro-family culture by starting and raising a family take centre stage in our life choices. This involves aligning fundamental values, societal attitudes, practices exercised in settings, such as at the workplace, and, of course, Government policies. The Government has done a commendable job so far in being pro-Singaporean families with a generous Marriage and Parenthood Package, along with all the Baby Bonuses and the likes in the past.

This is significant and possibly suggesting that such marriages will become a common sight. It may not be the majority but, perhaps, a more common sight in future. However, the certainty of long-term residency for the foreign spouses is a significant issue. There was a total of about 11,736 Long-Term Visit Pass and Long-Term Visit Pass Plus granted in 2012. It is a significant figure. However, what happens after these Long-Term Passes expire? Not all graduates even become PRs; some never do.

I gave some examples in my speech at the Budget debate yesterday. Hence, there is great anxiety, frustration and fear of being separated. The problem is worse if they have children together. The hurdles that such couples have to overcome make me wonder if there is an indirect way of telling people who they can or cannot marry. Every country has its set of policies that not only reflect prevalent societal attitudes but is also a means of social engineering. This is understandable and perhaps the right thing to do for a government chosen by its people.

These Singaporeans have chosen their foreign spouses to share their lives with and these foreign spouses have also chosen to give up their homelands to be part of Singapore.

This will offer a greater sense of security to these families. There are, of course, concerns over marriage of convenience or engagement in illicit activities. Heavy penalties, such as immediate revocation of the pass and permanent entry ban, can be imposed in such instances. There are also concerns over the financial health of the family because of the additional family member in an already financially-needy family.

The latter would help to strengthen a low-income family's financial position. Assuming a scenario where the foreign spouse finds a low-skilled job as a stall helper, the pay can range from about $800 to $1,000 per month. The sum of money will significantly enhance the family's income and bring more benefit than our usual PA assistance which would have been likely in a single-income source family.",8,384,2014-03-05-T-007-S-00384

2014-03-05-T-007,Tan Su Shan,Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member),"This trend may lead to the real cost of money rising, despite the low official interest rates. If a liquidity premium were to arise, then the real cost of borrowing for all will be affected. This makes doing business here unpredictable and costly. More importantly, it is the magnitude of interest rate changes that pose a greater risk. These elements are out of our control. For example, the Fed hiked interest rates by a massive 425 basis points in two years, between 2004 and 2006. Rapid increases in interest rates give little time to homeowners and businesses to adjust. The macro-prudential measures introduced may then become a double whammy for all.",8,465,2014-03-05-T-007-S-00465

The property market, stock market, auto dealership and domestic retail are amongst the most vulnerable. Hence, there is a need for heightened vigilance by the authorities to pre-empt the risks ahead and to ensure timely unwinding of these macro-prudential policies to address any downside risks. These adjustments will have to incorporate structural developments and also account for any adjustments to China's monetary policy stance so that we can set right macro-prudential policies for Singapore.",9,466,2014-03-05-T-007-S-00466
2014-03-05-T-007,Lawrence Wong,"The Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong)","Mdm Chair, let me first address the macro-issues that were just raised by Ms Tan Su Shan. I agree with her that there are strong external forces that can impact our economy and we have to stay very vigilant. Given the current uncertainties and volatile environment, it is very difficult to predict how the external environment will change. I think if you ask the economists what the future would be like, you will get different views. Ms Tan cited forecast from a Bain and Co report of a world flushed with money till 2020. But there are also many economists who predict that the days of low interest rates and cheap capital are over.",1,467,2014-03-05-T-007-S-00467
2014-03-05-T-007,Lawrence Wong,"The Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong)","Economists are well-known for their inability to agree on many things. But one thing that economists do agree upon is that in a world of open capital flows, a country can either choose to manage its exchange rate or interest rate but not both. In Singapore, because of our small and open economy, we have chosen to focus on the exchange rate as the monetary policy tool to keep inflation in check. And this exchange rate-centred framework has served Singapore very well over the three decades since we started.",2,468,2014-03-05-T-007-S-00468

2014-03-05-T-007,Lawrence Wong,"The Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong)","Given this environment, Ms Tan asked whether we ought to review and even change our monetary policy approach, to move away from our exchange rate-centred framework and switch to interest rates. In fact, this is something that MAS has studied very carefully. MAS regularly reviews its monetary policy approach, and it does not take the status quo, what it does today, as a given. And MAS' studies show that our current system has been effective and, more importantly, that a switch to a regime of managing interest rates can be highly destabilising. And there are several reasons for this.",4,470,2014-03-05-T-007-S-00470
2014-03-05-T-007,Lawrence Wong,"The Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong)","First, the exchange rate continues to play an important role in household and business decisions, as Singapore's high degree of openness has not diminished. In fact, the policy of keeping the Sing dollar on an appreciation path since April 2010 has dampened consumer inflation by an average of 2.3 percentage points per year over the past four years. Taking a specific example, the stronger Sing dollar has actually kept food inflation at an average of 2.3% over the same period, which is significantly lower than the 5.2% in the ASEAN-4 and 3.7% in the NIE-3 economies. So, that is one reason.",5,471,2014-03-05-T-007-S-00471

Private residential property prices increased by just over 1% last year and, in fact, recorded a small sequential decline in the fourth quarter. There has been a clear moderation in transaction volumes. Mortgage loan growth slowed to 8.6% in January 2014, down from 16.2% a year earlier. On the whole, household balance sheets are sound, although some over-stretched households may come under pressure when interest rates rise. And that is a point that Ms Foo Mee Har highlighted, which is why besides property purchases, to encourage financial prudence, MAS has recently enhanced the rules for credit cards and unsecured credit, as Ms Foo also highlighted.",8,474,2014-03-05-T-007-S-00474

This is why the aggregate limit on unsecured borrowing from financial institutions has been set at a fairly generous level of 12 months and it will take effect from June 2015. In fact, this rule was announced with an 18-month lead time. And all this should provide sufficient transition time and also flexibility for most borrowers.",9,475,2014-03-05-T-007-S-00475

I would like to assure her that MAS has anticipated this and put in place measures to avoid such a situation. Over the last few years, from 2008 to 2012, there were about 6,000 individuals who were counselled by Credit Counselling Singapore who had debts exceeding their annual income. Such individuals will be given additional time – till 2019 – before the aggregate limit takes effect. Furthermore, they will not be forced to make immediate repayment of their existing loans, as the limit is designed to prevent accumulation of additional debt. I should also clarify that the lending limits do not extend to education and business loans, which are not consumption-based.",10,476,2014-03-05-T-007-S-00476

I agree with her that information on non-bank credit channels is useful in having a more complete assessment of an individual's borrowing capacity. This is why MAS has been working closely with MinLaw to align the rules governing the grant of credit by financial institutions as well as moneylenders. For example, for housing loans, the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) framework already takes into account all credit facilities extended by both financial institutions as well as moneylenders. And going forward, MinLaw is looking to put in place a mechanism to limit the total amount that individuals can borrow across all moneylenders.

When we were designing the Marriage and Parenthood Package, we took suggestions and views from a wide variety of people from various segments, and this is because there are differing needs. I think how society and the Government support a young family and their newborn and young children should not be limited to this Package. When we are talking about families with lower income who have to support their children's education, the subsidies provided to support them in meeting their preschool education needs and school fees are very significant. Similarly, when it comes to housing, the Additional Housing Grant that the Government has given to support young parents, especially to those with lower income, is also very significant.",1,491,2014-03-05-T-007-S-00491

2014-03-05-T-007,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Specifically, with respect to foreign spouses, I think the marriage has to be a stable one, so the period of time that the couple is together could demonstrate that there are stable relations and that the foreign spouse is able to be accustomed to the life in Singapore. So, there is a certain time to wait. Typically, two years to six years is what we think is reasonable, but there are many other factors involved, including whether the spouse is able to financially support the foreign spouse. Couples do have options. I think they need to look at their options and they need to consider the stability of the marriage before they take the next step of committing more for their future, for example, if they are going to buy a HDB flat without considering their financial readiness. So, we do want the families to demonstrate that it is a stable one. Having a child actually adds to that stability and that will help in their application. But at this moment, we are not considering releasing a definitive roadmap as suggested by the Member, because we have to review our criteria from time to time and we need to make adjustments depending on the applications that are coming our way.",3,499,2014-03-05-T-007-S-00499

2014-03-05-T-008,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"But the circumstances we find ourselves in today are vastly different from those of 20, or even 10 years ago. In particular, the Internet has revolutionised the way we live, work and play. This is particularly relevant to us as we boast the highest Internet penetration rate in Southeast Asia and one of the highest in the world.",3,523,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00523
2014-03-05-T-008,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"This has posed obvious challenges to those charged with maintaining law and order, and prescribing laws which govern interactions and relationships. Many say they prefer Government to stay away from the Internet and to allow self-regulation, but those who need help navigating this new environment, or are harmed by it, often turn immediately to the Government for intervention.",4,524,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00524
2014-03-05-T-008,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Next week, we will have the Second Reading on a Bill to deal with harassment, which will deal in large measure with online conduct. I shall not comment on that Bill here. However, it is a recognition that many of our laws were drafted well before the Internet was even conceived, and our institutions and procedural rules may not be equipped to deal with this new paradigm. Opportunities are abundant for those who have the means and know-how to exploit the convenience and anonymity of the Internet to commit illegal acts. These include serious crimes such as identity theft, hacking and defamation. The ramifications of cybercrime are very real. Last year, The Straits Times reported that cybercrime victims in Singapore suffered the highest losses per capita in the world. It is therefore imperative that we take decisive measures against Internet crime before it becomes a permanent fixture in our society; an accepted risk.",5,525,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00525
2014-03-05-T-008,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"On that note, I would like to raise two points today.",6,526,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00526
2014-03-05-T-008,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"First, I would like to ask the Minister whether, outside harassment, the Ministry intends to enact more laws to deal with online conduct, in particular criminal conduct. Three areas deserve mention here.",7,527,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00527
2014-03-05-T-008,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"First, many of us will recall the spate of hackings last year by ""The Messiah"". Hacking is primarily dealt with by the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act. Sections 3 and 4 cover unauthorised access to computer material, while section 5 covers unauthorised modification of the contents of any computer. What is telling is that despite increasingly sophisticated and varied methods employed by hackers, these provisions have remained largely unchanged since their introduction in 1998.",8,528,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00528
2014-03-05-T-008,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Furthermore, hacking is increasingly employed for reasons other than to commit fraud or to obtain private data – some employ hacking as a means of advancing activist agendas. The ""Hacktivist"" organisation Anonymous, for example, attacks government, religious and corporate websites as a form of publicity. In view of such developments, it is timely for us to review our laws to ensure that they are adequate to deal with such threats. In particular, precise terms describing various hacking methods can be drafted into legislation to ensure there are no gaps. For example, Dutch legislation has included the definition of ""intrusion"" within their criminal legislation, with ""intrusion"" being defined as access by means of ""break through a security; by technical means; by false signals or a false key; by disguising, which is using a stolen username and password.""",9,529,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00529
2014-03-05-T-008,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"A second area is online news sites. Currently, these sites are regulated by conventional legislation such as the Defamation Act. The difficulty with such legislation is that it works on the assumption that the media is licensed and responsible. This assumption does not always hold true in cyberspace. This disparity between how Internet and non-Internet news providers are regulated prompted the MDA to introduce an individual licensing scheme for popular news sites last year. This may be a convenient and expedient mode of regulation, but frankly not very satisfactory.",10,530,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00530
2014-03-05-T-008,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I would submit that such issues throw up fundamental questions not just of freedom of speech, but safeguarding the rights and interests of our society. It should properly be the subject of specific legislation, where we will have the opportunity in this House to debate what is in the best interests of Singapore and Singaporeans, and how we should define boundaries and out-of-bound markers.",11,531,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00531
2014-03-05-T-008,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Thirdly, the Penal Code should be revised to reflect the reality that the Internet is increasingly being used as a conduit to commit both traditional and novel criminal activities. We have already taken several steps in the right direction. In 2007, sections 267C and 298 of our Penal Code were amended to accommodate the use of electronic media in the commission of crimes. Also, a new offence of ""sexual grooming of minors under 16"" was introduced in 2007 to target Internet sexual predators. More can and should be done.",12,532,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00532
2014-03-05-T-008,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"As criminals are constantly creating new ways of exploiting the Internet and its users, we too must constantly update our laws to safeguard our rights and interests. We should in particular review whether the offences have sufficient extra-territorial reach, and whether we have sufficient legal tools to deal with criminals who stay out of Singapore. Finally, whether the prescribed punishments take into account or properly reflect the enormous and repeated harm that can be done online.",13,533,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00533
2014-03-05-T-008,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Related to this change is whether there is sufficient help and protection for those who fall victims. The anonymity of the net often allows the real perpetrators to remain hidden or out of reach. The number of online victims is also on the rise. Last year, it was reported that there was a sharp spike in mixed delivery scams, where victims fail to receive goods purchased online and are also cheated into making further payments. While only 26 such scams were reported for the whole of 2012, at least 173 cases were reported between July and October of 2013. There has also been an increase in online dating scams. Just last month, it was reported that the number of people robbed by online fraudsters faking romantic interest before tricking their victims out of money jumped 62% between 2012 and 2013. I therefore ask the Minister what plans his Ministry has to tackle these admittedly very difficult issues.",14,534,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00534

2014-03-05-T-008,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Singapore's legal industry has been progressively opening up to international law firms, with a view towards cementing Singapore's rising prominence as Asia's legal hub. This liberalisation process began with the amendments to the Legal Profession Act in 2000. These amendments allowed foreign firms to enter into Joint Law Ventures (JLVs) and Formal Law Alliances (FLAs) with Singapore Law Practices (SLPs). This was followed by the awarding of Qualifying Foreign Law Practice (QFLP) licences to selected international law firms in 2008. This was aimed at encouraging foreign law firms to establish themselves in Singapore, giving more options to Singaporean and foreign clients and making Singapore a more attractive destination for investment, arbitration and other opportunities. Since then, a second batch of QFLP licenses was awarded in 2012.",16,536,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00536
2014-03-05-T-008,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Madam, an inevitable consequence of these liberalisation measures is a more crowded market – since the inception of these liberalisation measures, foreign lawyers in Singapore have doubled to more than 1,200, while foreign law firms have doubled in number as well. With the influx of foreign law firms in our market, arguably the best strategy for SLPs to remain competitive and relevant is to expand overseas. However, law is inherently a parochial industry, and almost all other countries have adopted far less liberal stances towards foreign firms entering their markets. As such, SLPs face challenges in developing their legal practice abroad, hampering their ability to meet their international counterparts head-on.",17,537,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00537
2014-03-05-T-008,Hri Kumar Nair,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Could the Minister tell us if the Ministry intends to level the playing field for local law firms venturing abroad, and if so, what measures they intend to roll out?",18,538,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00538
2014-03-05-T-008,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"Mdm Chairman, the setting up of the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC) is a good move by Singapore to strengthen its leadership position as a centre for dispute resolution in Asia. Building on the success of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre and Singapore's growing popularity as a venue for international arbitration, this move seeks to position Singapore as the Asian capital for cross-border cases which are determined in Court. If it succeeds, it would serve to enhance Singapore's status as a leading financial and services hub, and will bring benefits to not just our legal sector, but also the commercial services and business tourism industries.",1,539,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00539
2014-03-05-T-008,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"There are two key challenges that we need to address. One is the need to ensure that judgments delivered by the SICC are enforceable overseas, particularly in the key markets of China and Indonesia.",2,540,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00540
2014-03-05-T-008,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),One of the pillars underpinning the growth of arbitration is the New York Convention which allows for mutual enforcement of arbitration awards between all signatory countries and is one of the most successful international treaties of all time.,3,541,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00541
2014-03-05-T-008,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"India and Singapore, being British Commonwealth countries, enjoy mutual enforcement of Court judgments under the Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act. The challenge is to extend that reach into non-Commonwealth countries, especially those from where many disputes originate, that could find its way to be resolved in Singapore.",4,542,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00542
2014-03-05-T-008,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"The negotiation of free trade agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, affords an opportunity to provide for reciprocal enforcement of court judgments.

2014-03-05-T-008,Alvin Yeo,Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang),"Another key challenge is to dispel the notion that the SICC is a national court, as opposed to an international one. The dilemma is how to build on the ""Singapore"" aspect of the SICC, which has credibility overseas based on Singapore's well-won reputation for professional excellence, integrity and the Rule of Law, while at the same time promoting the ""International"" nature of the SICC.",6,544,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00544

This will go a long way towards convincing international users that the SICC is not just another domestic court. However, the presence of foreign justices, and the admission of foreign counsel, needs to be skilfully managed, so as to preserve the Singaporean nature of the SICC, which will be fundamental, I believe, to its success.",7,545,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00545

2014-03-05-T-008,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"At the Criminal Procedure Code review in 2010, the Government acknowledged this gap by rephrasing the section on victim's compensation. The current section 359 now makes it mandatory for the criminal court, convicting an offender, to consider whether to order him to compensate the victim. During that debate, I supported the amendment. I raised the concern about whether the new provision will be actively used. I noted then that if the Police did not routinely record the losses or damage suffered by the victim in their investigations, the court might not have the necessary information to make the compensation order at the sentencing stage.",2,553,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00553

In the 2012 answer to my Parliamentary Question, the Ministry revealed that there had been 82 compensation orders made for the whole of 2011. While 82 was certainly improved from the 31 orders made in 2010, it is very small compared to the number of criminal cases where losses and damage is suffered. It was stated that the prosecutors applied for and obtained the orders in appropriate cases. Does this mean the court relied solely or mainly on the prosecutors in deciding this?",3,554,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00554

2014-03-05-T-008,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"On the other hand, other members felt that a regime that permitted automatic discharge would significantly reduce the cost of administration of bankruptcy and would better incentivise bankrupts to work towards their discharge.",4,567,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00567
2014-03-05-T-008,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I am particularly interested to know the Government's view on whether we should have a regime that permits automatic or easier discharge from bankruptcy. Personally, I would favour a regime of automatic discharge, at least in relation to personal bankruptcy, because it would place more risk on lenders and make them more cautious in lending practices. I am personally troubled when credit is sold like a consumer good with attractive marketing. For example, in areas such as consumer credit, credit cards and even licensed moneylenders. If lenders know that borrowers can be easily discharged from bankruptcy, they will be much more careful in lending and this will hopefully reduce the amount of unsecured credit that is extended to people who should not be borrowing such credit.",5,568,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00568

There is no limit on the interest rate that a licensed moneylender could charge for a person earning more than $30,000 per year.

2014-03-05-T-008,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"First, impose overall cap on interest and other charges payable by a borrower in a credit year. This has to be across the board regardless of income tiers.",6,578,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00578
2014-03-05-T-008,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Second, define and stipulate the types of payments that moneylenders can charge, for example, the principal, interest and late payment fees only. This is to simplify the terms for borrowers and to close loopholes for moneylenders to be creative and have different types of late payment fees.",7,579,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00579
2014-03-05-T-008,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Thirdly, limit the total amount a borrower has to pay in a credit year for a loan to be deemed as fully paid. This can be a percentage of the loan amount.",8,580,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00580
2014-03-05-T-008,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Fourthly, to protect moneylenders from irresponsible borrowers, I propose that a centralised loan database be set up that tracks a single borrower's loans across all moneylending institutions.",9,581,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00581
2014-03-05-T-008,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Together with the database, we could then look into restricting the amount to be loaned by any number of moneylenders to a single borrower.",10,582,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00582
2014-03-05-T-008,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"With better transparency and greater restrictions in place, I believe that the contract signed between licensed moneylender and borrower can be handled with greater honesty and mutual trust – ultimately benefiting both parties and to the society at large.",11,583,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00583
2014-03-05-T-008,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech on Pg xxxx.] Madam, the terms for loans imposed on a borrower by licensed moneylenders are a cause of great concern because it causes hardship to the borrower's family. The interest and other related payments imposed are unreasonable because it can lead to the borrower to be indebted for life.",12,584,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00584
2014-03-05-T-008,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),It is important that the Government take measures to curb the activities of these licensed moneylenders in order to take care of the people's well-being. I propose that the Government imposes limits to the interest amount and specifies the types of payment that can be imposed on the borrowers. Borrowers who have made reasonable payments should be considered to have settled their debt. Steps must also be taken to build a borrowers' database so that licensed moneylenders can monitor those who wish to obtain credit. These measures are important so that we can provide protection to those who had no choice but to borrow money.,13,585,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00585
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mdm, I thank Members who have given their comments. Two key themes emerge from most or several of the Members who spoke. First, developing a vibrant legal sector; and second, enhancing Singapore's legal framework to strengthen our society.",1,586,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00586
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"On developing a vibrant legal sector, Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Alvin Yeo expressed support for the establishment of the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC) and Singapore International Mediation Centre (SIMC).",2,587,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00587
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Let me set out the economic context. Cross-border trade and investment in Asia is growing. From 2010 to 2020, global GDP is expected to increase by 73% to over US$100 trillion by 2020. During the same time period, it is expected that Asian economies will more than triple, from US$10 trillion to US$34 trillion. The volume and complexity of cross-border disputes are expected to grow in tandem.",3,588,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00588
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Singapore's legal sector has also grown substantially. From 2008 to 2012, the nominal value-added of legal services sector grew by slightly more than 25%. The value of legal services exported from Singapore grew by more than 60%. Demand for effective and trusted dispute resolution services will continue to rise.",4,589,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00589
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Singapore is well-positioned to be neutral third party venue for dispute resolution in this region. We have a highly trusted and sound legal system. We started some years ago to develop international arbitration in Singapore. That has been achieving significant success. Singapore is now the third most preferred seat of arbitration, after London and Geneva. SIAC is the fourth most preferred arbitral institution worldwide. In recent years, Singapore law firms ranked amongst the top international arbitration practices in Asia.",5,590,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00590
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"SIAC's caseload is also growing. New cases rose from 99 in 2008, to 259 in 2013 along and in tandem with a series of measures that we have taken. The total value of disputes rose to a record high of more than $6.06 billion in 2013. That exceeds the combined total of $4.93 billion for 2011 and 2012. SIAC's caseload is predominantly international. More than 80% of cases involve at least one foreign party.",6,591,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00591
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),Establishing the SIMC and SICC will extend our success in arbitration into adjacent areas of commercial mediation and court-based commercial litigation for international cases. The idea is to provide users with an entire suite of dispute resolution services and they can choose from those which best meet their needs.,7,592,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00592
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),Let me say something about the SIMC. Mediation is an important complement to arbitration and litigation. It allows parties to mutually arrive at mix of legal and non-legal solutions in an efficient and cost-effective manner.,8,593,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00593
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"It is intended that SIMC will offer world-class commercial mediation services. It will also have a panel of high quality international mediators and experts, and it will provide innovative user-centric products and services. My Ministry is currently working with industry stakeholders including the Singapore Business Federation, the Singapore Academy of Law and SIAC to establish SIMC. We will put in place necessary legislation to strengthen and support the framework for mediation. We expect that the SIMC will be launched later this year.",9,594,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00594
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Now, let me turn to SICC. Similar to SIMC, SICC also aims to attract international cases which have little or no connection to Singapore. Parties who prefer the transparency of open Court proceedings, the availability of appeal, or are involved in multi-party or non-arbitrable disputes, may prefer SICC to conventional international and commercial arbitration.",10,595,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00595
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"There are similar models elsewhere, including the High Court of England and Wales, which has a specialist Commercial Court in London, well known for the large number of cases which involve international parties. The Dubai International Financial Centre Courts were established to handle international commercial disputes as well.",11,596,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00596
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),Why would a party choose SICC? Singapore is known for its commitment to the rule of law. Our judiciary is well regarded internationally for quality of judgments and efficiency. Singapore is a neutral venue in Asia and this makes us especially attractive to foreign parties involved in cross-border disputes.,12,597,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00597
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mr Alvin Yeo raised two points  the perception that SICC is a national court, and the international enforceability of SICC judgments. On the first point, SICC will be constituted as a division of the High Court of Singapore. SICC judgments will be treated, and enforced, as High Court judgments. My Ministry is preparing legislative amendments to establish the SICC. The necessary amendments will include changes to the Constitution, the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, the Evidence Act and the Legal Profession Act. We will go for public consultation soon on these. We will also consider the composition of the Court, judges, rights of audience and related issues. All of these need to be considered carefully, bearing in mind that primarily we are looking at attracting cases which have no connection with Singapore. So, that is new work that is coming in.",13,598,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00598
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"On Mr Yeo's second point, namely the issue of enforcement of judgments abroad, SICC judgments may be enforced by registration in countries listed under the Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act (RECJA) and the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (REFJA), similar to any High Court judgment. For other common law jurisdictions not covered by these pieces of legislation, SICC judgments could be enforced as a common law debt. But I do accept Mr Yeo's point on enforceability. This has been considered. We will need to explore ways to enhance enforceability of SICC judgments. To some extent, of course, if parties in the first place are not subject to compulsory jurisdiction but are consenting to jurisdiction, then usually they will also take care of enforcement by contract.",14,599,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00599
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"In its report, the SICC Committee suggested that Singapore consider acceding to the Hague Convention of 30 June 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements. My Ministry is studying the feasibility of this suggestion. Earlier this year, European Commission issued a proposal for an EU Council decision to approve the Choice of Court Convention. Once the EU becomes a party to the Choice of Court Agreements Convention, enforceability of SICC judgments will be enhanced if Singapore decides to be a party to the Convention as well.",15,600,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00600
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Developing Singapore's dispute resolution framework in this way will benefit all Singaporeans. It will add to growing volume of legal work coming to our shores, and create significant opportunities for lawyers based in Singapore and Singapore Law Practices (SLPs). If successful, the SICC will attract more complex commercial litigation to Singapore, and help develop our legal jurisprudence. There will also be economic spin-offs in terms of increased demand for other supporting non-legal services, for example the tourism industry and the hospitality sector.",16,601,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00601
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Now, let me move to insolvency and bankruptcy. On issues of bankruptcy and corporate insolvency, Mr Vikram Nair asked for our views on recommendations of the Insolvency Law Review Committee (ILRC). The ILRC submitted its report to my Ministry in October last year. The ILRC's main recommendation was to unify bankruptcy and corporate insolvency regimes in a single piece of legislation. This is to enhance clarity and access to our laws, and transition and coordination between the various insolvency regimes.",17,602,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00602
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"The recommendations were also made to update core areas of Singapore's bankruptcy and corporate insolvency regime. My Ministry welcomes the recommendations of the ILRC. Presently, we are considering feedback received from public consultation on the report, which was concluded last December.",18,603,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00603
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Mr Vikram Nair also raised the issue of discharge of bankrupts. Alongside review of ILRC's recommendations, my Ministry is reviewing the bankruptcy regime. This is with a view towards putting in place a more rehabilitative regime that will allow bankrupts to be eligible for discharge within clear time frames, where justifiable. The time frame for discharge will be differentiated, depending on factors such as whether a bankrupt pays back a targeted amount, whether his creditors object to his discharge, whether there were extenuating circumstances during the bankruptcy, for example, a debilitating illness. This approach should also provide an incentive for bankrupts to cooperate.",19,604,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00604
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"At the same time, we are mindful that such a regime should not create a moral hazard. It is likely that upon discharge, all bankrupts' names will be placed on a national register for a fixed period. For those who were uncooperative in paying their targeted amounts, their names will remain on the register. These issues are being considered. As most bankrupts may become eligible for discharge after a fixed period, creditors will also be incentivised to undertake better risk assessment.",20,605,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00605
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Pending these changes, which will require legislative amendments, the Insolvency and Public Trustee's Office (IPTO) has also been actively reviewing current cases where a person has been in bankruptcy for a very long time to determine whether a discharge is suitable. These reviews include cases where bankruptcy orders were made more than 10 years ago. Many of these cases remain in bankruptcy because very little has been paid into their bankruptcy estates and/or there has been very little cooperation with the Official Assignee during the administration of their bankruptcy. For these bankrupts, it will help if they make a debt settlement proposal to their creditors. IPTO will assist to facilitate their discharge where possible. I think these points also answer the questions raised by Mr Pritam Singh.",21,606,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00606

The basic principle is clear – the same standards of what constitutes anti-social behaviour and other unlawful conduct should generally apply both in the physical world and in cyberspace.",22,607,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00607

Amendments were made to numerous provisions, including two provisions which the Member spoke about. Sending an SMS message containing an incitement to violence or counselling disobedience to the law would amount to an offence under section 267C, and section 367E of the Penal Code targets sex predators prowling online chatrooms and social media for young prey. Another example is making statements on blogs with deliberate intention to affect or wound religious or racial feelings of any person.

Mr Hri Kumar asked how MinLaw is supporting our Singapore Law Practices (SLPs) venturing abroad. SLPs are an important pillar of our legal services sector. SLPs employ more than 90% of Singapore-qualified lawyers.

There are good growth opportunities for SLPs locally as well as in the region.",2,615,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00615
2014-03-05-T-008,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),We would like to help SLPs who are looking to capture opportunities overseas to grow and become regional leaders. The market for legal services in Asia is expected to grow with the increase in trade and investments in this part of the world. Our SLPs are in a good position to compete successfully. Our top four SLPs are already the largest law firms in ASEAN.,3,616,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00616

First, IE Singapore's Double Tax Deduction for Internationalisation (DTDI). Under this scheme, SLPs may deduct against their taxable income, the expenses for overseas business development trips and overseas investment study trips. Second, there is the Development and Expansion Incentive for International Legal Services (DEI Legal), administered by EDB. Law firms, which are structured as companies and which provide international legal services from Singapore, can get a 10% concessionary tax rate for income derived from such services under this incentive scheme, subject to EDB's approval. There are also other schemes administered by IE Singapore and EDB, depending on needs and strategies of different SLPs.",4,617,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00617
2014-03-05-T-008,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"I would encourage the Singapore law firms to take advantage of such schemes. Any expansion into regional markets must be done in accordance with their laws. The key is in understanding those countries' rules, in terms of allowing foreign firms to do business in their jurisdictions. Some may allow law firms to operate through different vehicles such as partnerships, corporations or joint ventures. Others may do so through licensing regimes. It is not always necessary to have a physical presence or office in the foreign country. It is possible for SLPs to provide legal services out of Singapore to regional clients. In this scenario, what is important is access to potential clients and having a strong Singapore legal services brand so that such clients will automatically think of SLPs when they need legal services.",5,618,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00618
2014-03-05-T-008,Indranee Rajah,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"MinLaw is also helping SLPs to better understand markets in the region through various means. For example, with respect to Myanmar, which is a growing and potential market, we invited the Director-General of Myanmar's Union Attorney-General's Office to speak at a seminar co-organised with the Law Society of Singapore. SLPs were briefed on Myanmar's legal and business landscape as well as their legislation regulating foreign investments. We are now also working with the Law Society to plan seminars in Yangon and Nay Pyi Taw. These will be useful opportunities for SLPs to meet potential partners and clients in Myanmar.",6,619,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00619

In his Budget speech, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman announced the extension of the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) Scheme for another three years. The PIC extends to law firms as well. Law firms can utilise the PIC for their training of lawyers and to acquire systems or technology which improve their productivity or to run their practices more effectively, for example  IT systems, document management systems, accounting systems, client relationship management systems and other automation systems. This would also include, for example, information technology devices such as iPads. In 2012, over 230 SLPs benefited from the PIC, obtaining more than $20 million worth of PIC enhanced deductions.

As the interface between business and the legal service industry, the in-house legal counsel sector creates spin-offs to our legal services industry, including SLPs. In 2012, we amended the Evidence Act to extend legal professional privilege to in-house legal counsel. In-house counsel may enjoy this privilege if they are employed for the purpose of giving legal advice and the communications for which privilege is claimed relates to matters of legal advice.

If the cap is set too low, it would be commercially unviable for licensed moneylenders to service borrowers with high credit risk. This would force borrowers to turn to loan sharks to meet their financial needs. If the cap is too high, borrowers will be overcharged by moneylenders. It is therefore necessary to find the right balance.",15,628,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00628

There is some difficulty in attaching a civil claim to a criminal claim because it is not just a simple matter of tagging a civil claim on. There are issues that have to be thought through carefully. Relevant considerations will include the different purposes that civil and criminal proceedings generally serve, the different burdens of proof in such proceedings, the different legal and factual issues that may arise in criminal proceedings from those in civil proceedings and vice versa, and the different types of evidence that may be required to establish the civil compensation claim and the criminal offence.",23,636,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00636

Our courts are actually required in every case to consider whether compensation should be given. I think Ms Lim's concern really is the ease with which the victim can claim, and whether or not the victim is able to have the issues put before the Court in a way that will enable the claim for compensation to be determined. We will certainly look and see whether more can be done to enable the victims to make claims under the existing section 359. In fact, our approach of requiring the Court to consider whether compensation should be ordered in the criminal case, in some ways makes it even easier and better for the victims.",24,637,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00637

So, discretion is given to the Coroner, and if the counsel for the next-of-kin agrees to the discontinuance, then the question arises  how is the public interest served by insisting that the Coroner must continue with the inquiry, particularly, where all the facts have come across?

First, I would be grateful if the Minister or the Senior Minister of State could give an update on the third law school and where we are on that. And second, on the issue of moneylending regulations, I welcome the review that is going to come up. One of the reasons why moneylenders are prepared to lend to those with lower credit is, of course, the higher interest rates and returns, and also the fact that they are able to employ more robust enforcement method to recover the debt which banks normally do not. As part of the review, would the Ministry also consider looking at regulations in relation to how moneylenders seek to recover their debt?",1,644,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00644

The clarification that I have to ask really is on the Singapore International Commercial Court. One of the concerns raised was the enforceability of judgments they are under. Are there any plans to expand the number of countries covered by the reciprocal enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act which might be helpful in this regard?,1,647,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00647
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mdm Chair, it is really, of course, not within our control to increase the number of countries. Each country will have to decide by itself. I think what would make a significant difference is if the EU accedes to the Choice of Court Agreements Convention that I referred to, and we too accede to this Convention, together with the Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act (RECJA) and the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (REFJA), I think we will get pretty good coverage. But parties will have to make an assessment of enforceability when they choose a jurisdiction. We believe that there will be enough parties who would be interested in coming, particularly because they will also take into account issues of enforcement when they voluntarily agree with each other to come to Singapore.",1,648,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00648

Can it be done expeditiously so that borrowers have a greater sense of certainty as to how much interests they have to pay?

I have tried to explain this a number of times before. If we can take care of all the moneylending issues through legislation, we would have done that long ago. It is not a question of us saying, ""Okay, we impose caps on this, we do this, we do this, we do this"", and the problems go away. You are then going to see them going underground and the unlicensed moneylender problem will shoot up. At the end of the day, you have a problem when people need money for whatever reason, sometimes good, sometimes bad. Then, they are desperate and they will do whatever is necessary to go and borrow the money.",1,653,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00653
2014-03-05-T-008,K Shanmugam,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, let us deal with that. The problem is not the law. The problem is not the lack of caps. Caps can help if it is not a real market. If it is a fixed market, and we impose caps, it can help. But if there is a real market out there and after an assessment of risks, this is the interest that has to be charged, if you impose an artificial curb, the borrower and the lender will find alternate means and they will be driven underground. We used to have a huge unlicensed moneylenders problem in the past. So, we have been imposing curbs, we have been reviewing it and the reason why we are cautious is that the real nature of the problem has to be understood.",2,654,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00654

I am glad that she acknowledged that the Ministry could do more to look into the area of ""justice for crime"" victims. She mentioned in her answer that victims could use the existing section 359 of the CPC to apply for compensation. But from previous parliamentary answer and also my understanding, the prosecutor is usually the one that applies to court on behalf of the victims. So, I would like to ask a clarification on whether, really, it is the prosecutor that is the gatekeeper of that application for compensation. Is there any way to empower the victim to have a direct route to apply to the court? That is why I brought up the joining procedure.",1,656,2014-03-05-T-008-S-00656

We do a number of these things; not all of them are costed under foreign aid development. We also, bring in, by last count, it must be in excess of 80,000 people to Singapore to train them because we do not believe in giving direct money but we believe in training people in capacity building in their countries. So, they come here, they learn from us, and I do not even like to put it in terms of ""learn"", I put it in terms of ""share"". They see what we have done right, they see what we have done not so well – that helps them, they go back. They range from countries like Botswana, Rwanda, obviously Southeast Asia – more than half the participants come from Southeast Asia – and other countries.

Rather than working back from what we ought to spend S$2 billion, we work on the basis that these are the countries that may benefit from our developmental aid. Not everything has got to be based purely on a calculative basis, nor should it be. These are the countries that we can work with and share our experiences. Often, it also is relevant to our foreign policy aims. For example, last year, we had the Foreign Ministers of the Caribbean states visit Singapore to look at our experiences and from the Pacific Islands as well.

Another thing we do is we go into partnership with third countries or we bring in partners and, together, we target to do some good in third countries. We have signed the partnership programme with the United Sates, for example – it is called a Third Country training programme.

Singapore has, therefore, consistently supported China's development over the years and we have witnessed bilateral cooperation expanding beyond traditional economic cooperation into new areas, such as financial services, sustainable development and social management. We continue to have excellent institutional links, such as the Singapore-China Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation, which celebrated its 10th anniversary last year. We enjoy good relations with the Chinese leadership and saw several high-level exchanges, including visits to China by Prime Minister Lee, Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong and Deputy Prime Ministers Teo Chee Hean and Tharman Shanmugaratnam. Singapore also hosted visits by Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. At the broader regional level, China has been a strong and consistent supporter of ASEAN. We commemorated the 10th anniversary of the ASEAN-China Strategic Partnership last year and look forward to the Chinese leadership's continued interest in strengthening ASEAN-China ties.",4,804,2014-03-05-T-009-S-00804

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also visited Singapore last July and delivered the 33rd Singapore Lecture on ""Abenomics"". We have also maintained good relations with the Republic of Korea, which has expressed interest in stepping up ties with Singapore on several fronts, including economic cooperation.

The EU is our third largest trading partner with trade amounting to S$96.5 billion in 2013 and the largest source of Foreign Direct Investments of S$189.4 billion in 2012. The EUSFTA will yield benefits for Singapore companies. The potential tariff savings from the FTA amount to approximately S$500 million each year.

We are also working with various parties to ensure substantive outcomes in the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement negotiations. The TPP, together with the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) FTA, which Singapore is also actively involved in negotiating, will promote greater regional economic integration and pave the way for an eventual Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific.

2014-03-05-T-009,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Singapore currently extends technical assistance to other developing countries mainly through the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP).

So, under the SCP, we trained government officers from other countries to equip them with skills and knowledge to make a real impact in changing their people's lives for the better. We share Singapore's development experiences, our experiences, successes, as well as mistakes we have made along the way in the areas where we are strong in, such as public administration, urban planning and economic development.",4,829,2014-03-05-T-009-S-00829

It also helps to build a strong network of friends for Singapore who can help us defend our interests at the United Nations and other international organisations. As a small state, building a wide constituency of friends is especially useful for Singapore. The SCP helps our neighbours and also benefits Singapore.",5,830,2014-03-05-T-009-S-00830
2014-03-05-T-009,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong,"A good part of the SCP is aimed at strengthening ASEAN. An ASEAN that is economically integrated, prosperous and neutral can better attract investments, create jobs, manage regional challenges and be a platform through which to engage larger powers. The SCP has been very, very well received by Singapore's friends and partners and it complements other forms of assistance extended by other agencies or civil societies and international organisations, such as the Singapore International Foundation.",6,831,2014-03-05-T-009-S-00831
2014-03-05-T-009,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong,"We will need to continue investing in the SCP to broaden our network of friends and also to deepen friendships. But Singapore has limited resources and cannot compete with the larger donor countries in terms of the quantum of their assistance that we give out. Some major donors, like Japan and the US, dispense more than US$10 billion in aid per year. We do not have that kind of deep pockets but we can still do what is within our means – effectively targeting and meaningfully. We will be focusing our efforts on maximising the values of our contributions by providing smarter assistance by concentrating our efforts in areas where we can make a positive impact to the recipient countries.",7,832,2014-03-05-T-009-S-00832

Singaporeans made 6.9 million trips in 2013, that is, last year, compared to 3.6 million a decade ago. This excludes land trips to Malaysia which reach almost 20 million trips last year. Our consular workload has correspondingly grown in both volume and complexity with more than 3,000 consular cases handled last year. Concurrently, Singaporeans' expectations of our consular services have also risen over time. MFA treats all requests for consular assistance seriously and remains committed to providing efficient and responsive consular assistance to Singaporeans in distress abroad.",10,835,2014-03-05-T-009-S-00835

For example, when the Australian police alerted our Canberra Mission that a young Singaporean child had passed away in Tasmania while on holiday there, our mission helped advise the family on various aspects of the repatriation procedure. Our Canberra Mission also took the initiative to contact KK Hospital for the deceased's medical records so as to speed up the process. The family returned to Singapore safely and subsequently they wrote a letter to all those agencies involved, including our Mission and the Tasmanian authorities, to express their gratitude for the assistance.",11,836,2014-03-05-T-009-S-00836

Unfortunately, her passport had been submitted to the local Chinese authorities for the processing of visa and this, unfortunately, had also coincided with the three-day national holiday period for Mid-Autumn festival in China. Upon receiving the news, our Mission in Beijing quickly contacted the Beijing authorities and got the relevant officers to return to the office so that the student could retrieve her passport and rush back to Singapore that very night. The President of NUS wrote a letter to thank our Beijing Mission for the expeditious assistance extended to the student.",12,837,2014-03-05-T-009-S-00837

In addition to our 49 Overseas Missions, we maintain a network of 30 Honorary Consuls-General (HCGs) in countries where we do not have diplomatic presence. These Honorary Consuls General are prominent members of their countries and they help Singapore by providing consular coverage in locations where we do not have resident Missions. Where we do not even have representations of the HCG, there is an agreement among ASEAN countries to help one another's nationals when there is an emergency. We can also request assistance from friendly countries like the UK, the US, Australia and New Zealand. We also place an emphasis on emergency preparedness and regularly review our contingency plans to deal with potential flashpoints where Singaporeans could be affected.",13,838,2014-03-05-T-009-S-00838
2014-03-05-T-009,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong,"MFA also participated in inter-Ministry and interagency emergency preparedness exercises as a coordinated approach among multiple Government agencies is often required when handling crises. If there is a need, we will deploy Consular Response Teams (CRTs) to help Singaporeans in crisis areas following natural and man-made disasters. For example, a CRT was deployed to Egypt during the period of unrest in August 2013 to assist affected Singaporeans, especially our students studying in Cairo.",14,839,2014-03-05-T-009-S-00839

So, we have to act in accordance with international conventions and cannot ignore local laws and regulations or interfere with the judicial processes of other countries. It is inevitable that Singaporeans may have to put up with some inconveniences and frustrations when travelling abroad. Nevertheless, MFA cannot compel a foreign country or government agency or commercial entity to satisfy the demands of Singaporeans.

2014-03-05-T-009,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam,"Sir, you mentioned that a large part of the Singapore Cooperation Programme has been focused on ASEAN. Could you share with us how much specifically and whether there are some key examples of success? Secondly, on consular services, I read recently that the Australian MFA, in a recent review, is considering charging Australians for the use of consular assistance. Is this something, with the growing number of consular assistance requests, that MFA would also be considering?",2,858,2014-03-05-T-009-S-00858

Firstly, I said in my cut quite clearly that I did not expect Singapore to contribute 0.7% and, certainly, not $2 billion. So, I am aware that every dollar we spend on international development must be one less dollar we spend on domestic needs. I also thank Senior Parliamentary Secretary Sam Tan for explaining MFA's contributions through the SCP. My key question actually in my cut was  ""Does the Government see international development as a cost-effective way of furthering our foreign policy goals in terms of building goodwill and support from other countries for Singapore?""",1,861,2014-03-05-T-009-S-00861

The Minister mentioned about Ukraine and I am just interested to know how the Minister interprets this situation. The US and almost all of Europe are condemning Russia for what they did in Crimea. But China's President has actually been contacting the Russian President and both have reaffirmed their good relationship. Given what China is doing currently in East China and the South China Sea, would that be taken as a further manifestation of Chinese intention that instead of condemning Russia for what she is doing in Crimea, China is actually supporting what Russia is doing?",1,864,2014-03-05-T-009-S-00864

But that does not prevent us from taking a specific view on any particular action. We have made our own position clear. China has not quite said what it thinks about Russian actions, but I do not think we should draw a conclusion from the fact that the President of China spoke with the President of Russia that China is either approving or condemning the specific actions in Crimea. But what it tells us is that every country understands what its interests are. Interests are permanent, friends are transient. Each country will behave according to its size and weight and what it considers to be its interest. What China is doing is obviously calculated in China's interest.",1,865,2014-03-05-T-009-S-00865

Many wars were also started out of religious differences or fervour.

Larger countries can afford larger armies and larger budgets, especially when their economies grow. We are seeing this phenomenon of rapid growth in some defence budgets around us.

This message has to be repeatedly, if not continually, communicated to all Singaporeans and others beyond our shores. Not just to this generation, but for the generations to come.

2014-03-05-T-010,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"Mr Chairman, one key area of interest for many Singaporeans, when it comes to defence, has to do with that key institution of NS. It was, therefore, timely that at last year's COS, the Minister for Defence announced the formation of the Committee to Strengthen National Service. The two working groups looking at support for NS as well as recognition of benefits for National Servicemen have held a number of townhall consultations over the last one year and they have gained many proposals on how to further strengthen the key institutions.",1,917,2014-03-05-T-010-S-00917
2014-03-05-T-010,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"The suggestions have been varied and I am quite certain that a good many may not be possible to be introduced. However, I am heartened that the Committee has adopted an open mind on views and ideas throughout the consultation process. The key thing spelt out by the Minister last year was to strengthen Singapore, strengthen NS and the SAF and serve all Singaporeans in that order.",2,918,2014-03-05-T-010-S-00918
2014-03-05-T-010,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"After a long period of consultations as well as fruitful visits overseas, I hope that the CSNS is now ready with its formal proposals to be presented to Singaporeans. I do hope that some of the suggestions will look into further enhancing the contributions of our Servicemen as well as volunteers in areas where they can excel and that their efforts will also be well recognised.",3,919,2014-03-05-T-010-S-00919
2014-03-05-T-010,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"The strengthening of NS is, in itself, important but the positive side effects of also engendering a strong and more united Singapore cannot be ignored.",4,920,2014-03-05-T-010-S-00920
2014-03-05-T-010,Ong Teng Koon,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang),"In Budget 2013, the Minister for Defence announced that he would chair a Committee to Strengthen National Service. Can the Minister give an update on the work of the Committee and the areas of focus? What measures does the Committee recommend to strengthen NS as the critical institution for Singapore's continued survival and success? Will the Committee engage in any public consultations to listen to feedback from the public and take in different views and perspectives?",1,921,2014-03-05-T-010-S-00921
2014-03-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"I signed up last year to attend one session of the Committee to Strengthen National Service (CSNS) in the second half of the year. The session I attended as an NSman was facilitated by Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs Mr Masagos. Like many of the NSmen in my group, I found the feedback process open and helpful in terms of soliciting feedback from NSmen on how to strengthen NS.",1,922,2014-03-05-T-010-S-00922
2014-03-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"In fact, one of the more commendable things the Committee did after the feedback session was to publicise the summary of the consultation on the CSNS website. It may not have been possible to accommodate everyone's inputs as I heard them but the process itself I understand was appreciated, with many of the exchanges quite robust, frank and open. My own interactions with a handful of NSmen found that in spite of the occasional disruptions associated with NS duties with their civilian jobs, for many of them, there was a general appreciation for the institution of NS and its importance.",2,923,2014-03-05-T-010-S-00923
2014-03-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"I would like to ask the Minister if the Committee to Strengthen the National Service could look into supporting NSmen beyond financial measures, such as the civilian utility of skills picked up in the military domain, for example, easier and more facilitative conversion standards from military to civilian licences and equipment with direct civilian applications.",3,924,2014-03-05-T-010-S-00924
2014-03-05-T-010,Pritam Singh,Mr Pritam Singh,"Separately, last year, I raised the prospect of new citizens performing some form of NS. Can the Minister update the House on the plans for the SAF Volunteer Corps announced last year?",4,925,2014-03-05-T-010-S-00925
2014-03-05-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"For most NSmen, annual in-camp training (ICT) involves long hours away from work and family. There is often a lot of waiting time in between the action, hence, the adage, ""hurry up and wait!""",1,926,2014-03-05-T-010-S-00926
2014-03-05-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"Commanders, however, are much busier throughout the ICT because they are often engaged in planning while the men wait. Yet, for the sake of equity, units usually issue call-ups to all involved NSmen for the full duration of the exercise. This incurs a huge cost in terms of the NSmen's time and Make-up Pay – which is based on the NSmen's civilian salary.",2,927,2014-03-05-T-010-S-00927
2014-03-05-T-010,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,"To better utilise NSmen resources, could non-commanders be recalled for a shorter ICT duration or even fewer ICTs? To address the inequality, key appointment holders and commanders could be rewarded with extra pay or benefits to compensate them for the additional sacrifices they make for our nation.",3,928,2014-03-05-T-010-S-00928
2014-03-05-T-010,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Chairman, more of the NSmen now have post-Secondary educational qualifications and would have had some form of work experience during internships or work attachments during their respective courses of study where a lot more hands-on approaches to problem solving would have been done. As the educational levels of our NSmen rise, they are likely to have higher aspirations and also want to contribute more meaningfully to the SAF, such as sharing their views and ideas on existing processes and policies. How is MINDEF looking to engage our NSmen more effectively, maximise their contributions and help fulfil their aspirations? Will there be more platforms to elicit these views and ideas from our NSmen and will MINDEF be able to support the test bed for ideas for pilot projects done by our NSmen with regard to defence and security?",1,929,2014-03-05-T-010-S-00929

2014-03-05-T-010,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee,"Thank you, Chairman. On defence relationship with major powers, the occurrence of a number of events has contributed to the increasing tension in our region. The spat between the major powers over China's declaration of its Air Identification Zone, the Japanese premier's controversial visit to Yasukuni shrine, the unresolved territorial disputes in the South China Sea and North Korea's threats to declare war if provoked are among the events that warrant serious reflection on how the security of the region is being affected.",1,931,2014-03-05-T-010-S-00931

2014-03-05-T-010,Ellen Lee,Ms Ellen Lee,"On overseas training defence ties, a very significant part of SAF's training is conducted overseas. Over the years, we have been carefully cultivating suitable partners to ensure the effectiveness of our training programmes. It is common knowledge that we have many partners, which include the USA, France, Australia, New Zealand, Germany and others. I would like to request MINDEF to provide an update on our defence ties with key partner countries, especially those with which we have training arrangements. Have the partnerships affected in any way the different aspects of our training programmes, such as the length of training and the impact on SAF officers?",3,933,2014-03-05-T-010-S-00933
