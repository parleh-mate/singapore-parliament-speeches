2020-02-26-T-001,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Question No 1, please.",1,1,2020-02-26-T-001-S-00001
2020-02-26-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Mr Speaker, MOM has been actively disseminating educational materials on COVID-19 control measures including the need to maintain good personal hygiene and on the Stay-Home Notice, to employers and partners such as the Migrant Workers' Centre (MWC). Many are available in the work pass holders’ native language and are available on MOM’s website. Employers have been encouraged to use these materials to do regular briefings to their workers. MOM has also asked employers to contact the work pass holders affected by the Leave of Absence or Stay-Home Notice requirements and directly inform them of the measures. Dormitory operators have been displaying many of our posters in their premises. In addition, MOM has been sharing bite-size COVID-19 information to the foreign workers through our foreign worker ambassadors on a daily basis. Videos in various native languages have also been produced to explain the situation and control measures. Ground engagement with foreign workers has been further stepped up with the help of the MWC.",1,2,2020-02-26-T-001-S-00002
2020-02-26-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"As part of our control measures, since 9 February 2020, employers have to obtain MOM's prior approval before the affected work pass holders can enter Singapore. Employers have to send the MOM approval letter with the Leave of Absence or Stay-Home Notice requirements to their work pass holders before they commence their return.",2,3,2020-02-26-T-001-S-00003
2020-02-26-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower),"Work pass holders are aware they face cancellation of their work passes if they violate the COVID-19 control measures. Employers and employees have a joint duty to ensure that the employee behaves responsibly during the Leave of Absence or Stay-Home Notice. In cases where the work pass holders were asked to work during their Leave of Absence or Stay-Home Notice, they should not comply and instead report their employer to the Ministry. MOM will investigate and take actions against the employer. As of 22 February 2020, MOM has taken action against 15 employers whose workers breached the Leave of Absence or Stay-Home Notice requirements. These employers had their work pass privileges suspended for at least two years. In three instances, the workers were not found culpable and were provided the opportunity to find alternative employment in Singapore.",3,4,2020-02-26-T-001-S-00004
2020-02-26-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Ms Anthea Ong.,1,5,2020-02-26-T-001-S-00005
2020-02-26-T-001,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister of State for the response. It was mentioned in The Straits Times on 13 February that three workers were issued warning letters when their employers has asked them to go to work. Will their subsequent employment after their current employment ends, be affected? Workers who are issued warning letters are usually unable to find subsequent employment when current employment ends.",1,6,2020-02-26-T-001-S-00006
2020-02-26-T-001,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"The second supplementary question, in a recent The Straits Times report – I think it was two days ago – we are also concerned about an additional three workers whose Work Permits were revoked because they did not answer their calls by the Ministry, as the Minister of State alluded to earlier. This seems rather harsh and we are wondering if investigations are being conducted to find out why they did not answer their calls.",2,7,2020-02-26-T-001-S-00007
2020-02-26-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"For the first question, the Member would have noticed, yesterday as well, we announced that we are going to work on change of employment directives for manufacturing as well as services. These are two areas where today, they are not allowed to do change of employment so easily. So, we are facilitating it through the trade associations, companies and industry representatives. This is important. We try to help these workers. If you know of such workers, please do refer them to us and we will have organisations or partners such as MWC to see how we can support them.",1,8,2020-02-26-T-001-S-00008
2020-02-26-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"On the second point, it is also important for us to signal that for a public health measure, we cannot take this too lightly. When workers fail to respond, I am sure they have valid reasons. We go down and investigate each one of them. There are a variety of reasons why they cannot respond, the most common is, ""My phone cannot get a signal"" and so forth. The reality is you have the whole day to respond. We do give leeway if needed. When they cannot account for where they were, then it becomes a bit more difficult to explain. In the interest of public health, you have to take a check. This is where we have to take action. And I have to thank employers as well as workers for cooperating with us on all our measures, whether it is Leave of Absence, Stay-Home Notice or the quarantine measures to ensure that public health is maintained, public safety is maintained. And we manage the situation as best as we can.",2,9,2020-02-26-T-001-S-00009
2020-02-26-T-001,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"I would like to ask the Minister of State a supplementary question. For local or foreign workers, in light of the required five-day Medical Certificates (MCs) that are issued by doctors for flu or fever during this COVID-19 period, whether MOM can classify these MCs given out as COVID-19 MCs and outside of the scope or ambit of the 14 days Sick Leave under the Employment Act. Otherwise, the suggestion would be to classify it instead as Hospitalisation Leave under the Employment Act so that a worker will not over consume the 14-day Sick Leave entitlement under the Employment Act.",1,10,2020-02-26-T-001-S-00010
2020-02-26-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Firstly, I just want to say ""Thank you"" to all our employers and workers for cooperating with us. I said Leave of Absence and Stay-Home Notice earlier but I think even MCs today are an important part of the health measures that we have to undertake. The five-day MC is granted to individuals who display respiratory symptoms to allow them to rest at home and prevent the spread of COVID-19. Employers can treat the five-day MCs as part of the employees' outpatient Sick Leave entitlement, or alternatively, as the Member suggested, if they wish to provide more support to the employees, employers can also treat the five-day MC as part of the employees' Hospitalisation Leave entitlement. We are indeed flexible. If an employee were to have insufficient outpatient Sick Leave in the future, employers are encouraged to be flexible and compassionate, and grant additional Sick Leave to the employee to take into consideration the prolonged Sick Leave used for the COVID-19 situation.",1,11,2020-02-26-T-001-S-00011
2020-02-26-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"But generally, for MCs of five days, you will not exceed either one. With the Leave of Absence, Stay-Home Notice or quarantine, the Government does provide a grant to the employer of $100 a day. We are publishing an FAQ to provide clearer guidance to employers on the issue. The team is working on this. So, we are hoping to get the link ready, either by today or tomorrow.",2,12,2020-02-26-T-001-S-00012
2020-02-26-T-001,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Just one clarification. I understand the rationale of making of sure that our workers come back only with approval. But it is the employer who submits the application to MOM for approval. In the case where the two workers came back to Singapore without approval, can I just ask what is the rationale of punishing the workers when it was not them who had to apply to get the approval to return?",1,13,2020-02-26-T-001-S-00013
2020-02-26-T-001,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"I thank the Member for his question. I think we have always made it very clear. It is both the responsibility of the worker and the employer. There are cases in which we have not punished the worker because the worker came to report to us and said his employer had forced him to come back. It is important and incumbent upon us. Again, the measures are in place because public health is at stake. So, in this case, I think we have to also take a really bird's eye view on how we want to deal with the issue, and in which everyone – both the employer and worker – has to cooperate.",1,14,2020-02-26-T-001-S-00014
2020-02-26-T-002,Mohamed Irshad,Mr Mohamed Irshad,"asked the Minister for Education what efforts are being undertaken to educate our educators and lecturers in our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) so that they are aware of (i) the effects of the COVID-19, (ii) efforts undertaken by the Government to manage the developing situation and (iii) the part they can play in social defence by calming any unnecessary panic that may arise among our IHL students.",1,15,2020-02-26-T-002-S-00015
2020-02-26-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Mr Speaker, Sir, the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have been actively keeping their campus communities updated on the evolving COVID-19 situation. Government efforts to manage the outbreak in Singapore as well as the precautionary measures taken are explained to the communities in these IHLs. They are doing this through various advisories and resources.",1,16,2020-02-26-T-002-S-00016
2020-02-26-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Ground practices play a part in education too. These include reminders on the importance of good hygiene, wearing a mask when sick, twice-daily temperature-taking, requiring those returning from mainland China, and now, Korea, to stay at home for the first 14 days, and cancelling, deferring or adjusting large-scale events to mitigate risks.",2,17,2020-02-26-T-002-S-00017
2020-02-26-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Beyond technical knowledge, the COVID-19 situation is also a teachable moment to build resilience. In ITE, a Total Defence lesson package covering content on the COVID-19 situation will be used in all Life Skills classes this month. Polytechnics will roll out similar packages later in April, after their exams and term break. The Universities will incorporate similar lessons where opportune. For example, SMU's core curriculum for all Year 1 undergraduates includes a course on social resilience and total defence, using the SARS outbreak as one case study. It will incorporate insights from the on-going COVID-19 situation.",3,18,2020-02-26-T-002-S-00018
2020-02-26-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Many students and staff are also stepping forward with help and moral support. In the Universities, student groups have rallied to provide support and daily food deliveries for their peers living on-campus but are required to stay in their rooms. In our Polytechnics, staff from our Nursing schools help to train their colleagues in conducting temperature screening.",4,19,2020-02-26-T-002-S-00019
2020-02-26-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"These ground initiatives and actions are contagious, demonstrate the courage of the Singapore society and has more education value than many formal courses. We should build on these positive initiatives to build a more resilient and cohesive Singapore. Together, I am confident we can overcome this COVID-19 episode.",5,20,2020-02-26-T-002-S-00020
2020-02-26-T-002,Mohamed Irshad,Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member),"I thank the Minister for the update. Very heartening to hear such initiatives taking place. From my understanding, there are several IHLs which has cancelled classes or switched to e-learning. However, some classes are still happening and going on as per normal. What is the guidance from MOE that has been given to all the IHLs in terms of cancellation of classes or postponement of massive events?",1,21,2020-02-26-T-002-S-00021
2020-02-26-T-002,Mohamed Irshad,Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member),The second supplementary question is  when can we see us easing back to normalising the situation?,2,22,2020-02-26-T-002-S-00022
2020-02-26-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"On the first question, the guidance that IHLs are working on is to reduce the inter-mingling of students on campuses so that IHLs can keep on operating while mitigating the risks of infection and spreading. So, they are working with about 50 students for each gathering. So, you find lectures are still on-going but they have shrank in size. Tutorials, project teams are all on-going but the sizes have all been shrunk. We have three cases now in our IHLs – one staff and two students. It was fortunate many of them were not in campus when they had symptoms; they exercised responsibility, which was fortunate and we are very thankful to them.",1,23,2020-02-26-T-002-S-00023
2020-02-26-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Secondly, it is also because of all these mitigating measures. Even 48 hours before the onset of symptoms, you find that their exposure in the campus is actually quite limited and localised, because of all these mitigating measures. As a result, the number of staff and students that have to be quarantined or put on Leave of Absence has been much reduced. I think they are all stable, improving and we are glad. We hope to see them back in school soon.",2,24,2020-02-26-T-002-S-00024
2020-02-26-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As to when it will stabilise, it really depends on the situation. I think we have to ask Minister Gan Kim Yong on this.",3,25,2020-02-26-T-002-S-00025
2020-02-26-T-002,Ong Ye Kung,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But we will play our part and do our best to make sure that within schools, while we educate the students, we take the necessary precautions so that life can go on and education can go on as normally as we can – but with precautions.",4,26,2020-02-26-T-002-S-00026
2020-02-26-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for National Development what plans does the Ministry have to encourage companies in the private sector to achieve the BCA Green Mark for Super Low Energy Buildings certification.,1,27,2020-02-26-T-003-S-00027
2020-02-26-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for National Development),"Mr Speaker, BCA launched the Super Low Energy Programme in 2018 to encourage developers and building owners to achieve best-in-class building energy performance in a cost effective manner. The response from the industry has been positive. As of December 2019, 18 buildings have achieved the BCA Green Mark for Super Low Energy certification.",1,28,2020-02-26-T-003-S-00028
2020-02-26-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for National Development),"To drive the adoption of Super Low Energy buildings, BCA worked with the industry and academia to develop a Technology Roadmap, which comprises 60 strategies and technologies that building owners can adopt to increase energy efficiency. We have also enhanced the Green Buildings Innovation Cluster programme with a $20 million top-up last year.",2,29,2020-02-26-T-003-S-00029
2020-02-26-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for National Development),"The programme aims to accelerate the adoption of Super Low Energy buildings through funding the research, development and prototyping of energy efficient building solutions. Through this programme, building owners and developers can work with research partners to develop innovative green technologies for building applications and conduct large-scale demonstrations to assess their feasibility in the local context. In addition, BCA has established the Super Low Energy Building Smart Hub to facilitate the exchange of knowledge on energy efficient technologies amongst industry stakeholders. This is an open database of green building technologies supported by building energy data and analytic tools. The Smart Hub also has an online advisory function to recommend customised retrofitting plans for building owners and developers to green their existing buildings.",3,30,2020-02-26-T-003-S-00030
2020-02-26-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for National Development),We will continue to work with industry stakeholders to encourage companies to achieve the BCA Green Mark for Super Low Energy certification.,4,31,2020-02-26-T-003-S-00031
2020-02-26-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Sir, just one quick clarification. The Technology Roadmap that the Minister of State was talking about, I think we started work on that since 2018. Can I just check whether the study is completed and whether the report is available to the public?",1,32,2020-02-26-T-003-S-00032
2020-02-26-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"I thank the Member for his question. In fact, the Technology Roadmap is in place. Today, some of the technologies identified in the Roadmap are the LED lighting with smart controls, decoupled cooling from dehumidification and thermally reflective cool paint. Many of these solutions are novel applications of existing technologies. But, yes, we have also seen some of these technologies being used in some of our buildings today.  For example the SMU-X building which uses an enhanced passive displacement cooling system. The system uses the natural convection of heat to move the cool air without the use of mechanical fans, so, therefore, reducing energy consumption. The other example is the NUS School of Design and Environment Building 4 which uses a hybrid cooling system that augments the cool air supply with ceiling fans, making it 46% more efficient than a conventional cooling system. This helps the building achieved substantial energy savings while maintaining a comfortable environment for students.",1,33,2020-02-26-T-003-S-00033
2020-02-26-T-003,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"I just want to know whether the Roadmap is available for public viewing, so people can see and give feedback, and possibly improve it as well.",1,34,2020-02-26-T-003-S-00034
2020-02-26-T-003,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"T he fact that the technologies are already in use, I think it is already public. So, if the Member needs further information on the Roadmap, I am happy to provide.",1,35,2020-02-26-T-003-S-00035
2020-02-26-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"asked the Minister for National Development in respect of the Code on Accessibility in the Built Environment 2019, whether the Government will consider (i) increasing the number of lactation rooms from the one lactation room currently required for offices and business parks with a gross floor area of 10,000 sqm and above and (ii) lowering the gross floor area threshold of 10,000 sqm before buildings are required to have at least one lactation room.",1,36,2020-02-26-T-004-S-00036
2020-02-26-T-004,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for National Development),"Mr Speaker, the Code on Accessibility in the Built Environment was recently reviewed in 2019 by a committee comprising representatives from social service agencies, Trade Associations and Chambers, academia and Government agencies. Under the new Code which took effect in January this year, the requirement to provide at least one lactation room has been expanded to apply to more building types. Besides offices and business parks with a gross floor area (GFA) of 10,000 m",1,37,2020-02-26-T-004-S-00037
2020-02-26-T-004,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for National Development),"The intent of the GFA threshold is to strike a balance between the need for such facilities and the practical implications for smaller buildings, such as efficiency in the use of space. Notwithstanding this, the developers are encouraged to provide lactation rooms beyond the requirements of the Code, based on the scale of the building and the needs of the building users.",2,38,2020-02-26-T-004-S-00038
2020-02-26-T-004,Zaqy Mohamad,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for National Development),"BCA will continue to study how we can enhance our accessibility requirements, including the provision of lactation rooms, as part of its periodic review of the Code.",3,39,2020-02-26-T-004-S-00039
2020-02-26-T-004,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Ng.,1,40,2020-02-26-T-004-S-00040
2020-02-26-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Sir. I have three clarifications. Really, we all agree that breast milk is the best food for our babies but we also want our working mothers to return to work and we even incentivise it with the Working Mother's Child Relief. But the two points will be sort of conflicting if we do not allow the working mothers to easily express their milk when they are back at work, if we do not provide enough lactation rooms.",1,41,2020-02-26-T-004-S-00041
2020-02-26-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"So, one, can I ask, for working mothers that work in buildings where the GFA is below 10,000 sqm, where exactly are they going to be able to pump and express their milk? If they do it in their workplace, there are privacy issues. Also, he pumping equipment is actually quite loud. Some of the feedback has been that other colleagues then start to complain about it.",2,42,2020-02-26-T-004-S-00042
2020-02-26-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Two, the working mothers are not asking for this big fancy room to pump or express their milk but a small clean place where they can express their milk. And maybe the cost is an issue. So, whether the Government can step in and provide some grants so that more buildings can provide more lactation rooms for the working mothers.",3,43,2020-02-26-T-004-S-00043
2020-02-26-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"And third, I think the Minister of State said that we will review this again in the next periodic review. Can I ask when will the next review be? Because, really, that one lactation room is really very little for the number of working mothers that could possibly work in that building.",4,44,2020-02-26-T-004-S-00044
2020-02-26-T-004,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"I certainly agree with the Member that we should, as much as possible, facilitate our mothers to breastfeed. Certainly, it helps with the raising of the child. Under the Code Review, really, in many jurisdictions too, the ""one room a building"" based on the floor area is, I would say, a base guideline. It is a base rule, rather, not guideline; it is a base rule because we also have to be practical about some of these buildings and how you can retrofit such rooms.",1,45,2020-02-26-T-004-S-00045
2020-02-26-T-004,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"My own experience so far, I came from the private sector, even in a building, you have tenants who, like my previous firm, provided lactation rooms on every floor or most floors. So, these are on top of the building requirements in which developers may provide one but the tenants themselves could provide more. We have also seen shopping malls with more than one lactation rooms too. I just did a check on my two Ministries. MND has got two in MND HQ within the floors that we occupied. MOM has got five among the two buildings that we occupy.",2,46,2020-02-26-T-004-S-00046
2020-02-26-T-004,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"So, we have not done a survey in terms of the take-up rates out there but, really, I do think that many building owners have provided more than what the Code requires. Certainly, we will continue to promote this. But in setting regulations and codes, it is important that we also take a practical view.",3,47,2020-02-26-T-004-S-00047
2020-02-26-T-004,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"On the Member's question on grants, BCA has an Accessibility Fund (AF) worth about $39.2 million in which we incentivise building owners to undertake voluntary upgrading. Up to 60% of the construction cost for accessibility features, such as lactation rooms can be used up to a cap of $300,000 per development. There is funding available for building owners if they wish to undertake this. As of 5 February this year, close to 150 private building owners have tapped on the AF to retrofit their buildings with the accessibility features.",4,48,2020-02-26-T-004-S-00048
2020-02-26-T-004,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"So, apart from what we put in the Code, the good thing is that we have seen many private buildings too coming on board. Again, we have to be very practical about how we put codes up but we support the motion, generally.",5,49,2020-02-26-T-004-S-00049
2020-02-26-T-004,Louis Ng Kok Kwang,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"Just one last one question. The fact that MND and MOM have so many lactation rooms show that there is a need for this. So, this is the last Supplementary Question, which is that when are we going to review this, whether we are going to study this in further detail, see whether in MOM or in MND, how many times the lactation rooms are used, whether it is sufficient? So, a really detailed study to look into this issue.",1,50,2020-02-26-T-004-S-00050
2020-02-26-T-004,Zaqy Mohamad,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"I thank the Member. Our Building Codes are typically studied every few years. I do not have a date for the next study, so I am not going to commit at this point. But I do think that this could be further promoted to employers. Like I said, tenants themselves too have provided lactation rooms for their own officers. In this case, it is very hard to fix a demand because it depends on the profile of the workers too, whether you have an older workforce or a very young workforce. I think it depends. So, it is difficult and impractical as well to fix a Code and regulate that everyone has to provide this because it also depends on the demand as well. To some extent, we will study this and certainly survey and study more but without waiting for a review, we can certainly do more as organisations to support this.",1,51,2020-02-26-T-004-S-00051

2020-02-26-T-005,Amrin Amin,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Amrin Amin) (for the Minister for Health),Diabetes is a chronic condition and it takes many years before complications present themselves. Many of our War on Diabetes initiatives are aimed at reducing the risk of developing diabetes and delaying the development of complications in those who already have the disease. It will take years before we see both the overall incidence of diabetes and its complication rate decrease.,3,55,2020-02-26-T-005-S-00055
2020-02-26-T-005,Amrin Amin,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Amrin Amin) (for the Minister for Health),"One key thrust of the War on Diabetes is to promote healthy lifestyle through a healthier diet. With this in mind, the Ministry announced in October last year that we will introduce mandatory nutrition labels and advertising prohibitions for less healthy pre-packaged sugar-sweetened beverages. Details of the two measures, including the implementation timeline, will be shared in the upcoming Committee of Supply debate.",4,56,2020-02-26-T-005-S-00056
2020-02-26-T-005,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the answer. So, 19,000 diabetes cases each year. Does MOH have the number s as to what are the causes of the diabetes cases, whether it is through direct sugar intake or is it through other foods such as high starch content?",1,57,2020-02-26-T-005-S-00057
2020-02-26-T-005,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"The second  supplementary question is  I know that the details will be announced later on at the MOH Committee of Supply debate but are there plans to extend the mandatory label for the SSBs to non ready-to-drink beverages, for example, bubble tea drinks, coffees and teas, or even syrup-based beverages that are served at buffets or eateries?",2,58,2020-02-26-T-005-S-00058
2020-02-26-T-005,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),The third supplementary question is  whether there are plans to implement this more extensively to all mainstream schools and even our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) in the canteens and cafes?,3,59,2020-02-26-T-005-S-00059
2020-02-26-T-005,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"I thank the Member for the question. I do not have the exact breakdown of what are the contributing factors of diabetes with me now, but what I have is the information on the freshly prepared drinks such as bubble teas, blended coffee and local ""kopi"" and ""teh"". This forms about a third of Singaporeans' sugar intake from drinks and our data suggests that it is a growing source of sugar intake in Singaporeans' diet.",1,60,2020-02-26-T-005-S-00060
2020-02-26-T-005,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"So, addressing this other source of sugar in our diet could help us to more effectively achieve our objective of helping Singaporeans reduce their overall sugar intake. We have received feedback to tackle freshly prepared drinks and we are currently considering whether to extend the labelling and advertising measures to freshly prepared drinks. We are in the process of consulting the relevant stakeholders such as the food and beverage industry on possible measures and more details will be shared when ready.",2,61,2020-02-26-T-005-S-00061
2020-02-26-T-005,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,"On the third supplementary question, I believe we have measures in Government schools. I am not sure about IHLs. If the Member can file a separate Parliamentary Question, we can provide the response.",3,62,2020-02-26-T-005-S-00062
2020-02-26-T-005,Mohamed Irshad,Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member),Just one  supplementary question. Has the Ministry considered introducing sugar tax on carbonated beverages?,1,63,2020-02-26-T-005-S-00063
2020-02-26-T-005,Amrin Amin,Mr Amrin Amin,We are studying that and we will discuss this at Committee of Supply debate.,1,64,2020-02-26-T-005-S-00064
2020-02-26-T-006,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar,"asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) for each year since 2009, how many drivers have been fined under the Environmental Protection and Management (Vehicle Emissions) Regulations for leaving the engines of their stationary or parked motor vehicles idling; and (b) how effective has public education been in reminding drivers to adhere to this Regulation.",1,65,2020-02-26-T-006-S-00065
2020-02-26-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"NEA adopts a multi-pronged approach to tackle pollution from idling vehicles. NEA carries out public outreach to engage motorists on the importance of switching off their vehicle engines when stationary. NEA works with authorised vehicle inspection centres, vehicle fleet owners and schools to disseminate educational pamphlets to raise awareness of the regulations and promote compliance. Signs reminding motorists against idling engines are installed at hot-spots. NEA has also stepped up checks and increased the penalty for idling engine offences in 2016.",1,66,2020-02-26-T-006-S-00066
2020-02-26-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"The number of idling engine offences increased from 2,000 cases in 2009 to 6,400 cases in 2016. The concerted efforts by NEA since 2016 have led to a reduction to 3,200 cases in 2018 and further down to 2,800 in 2019. The number of repeat offenders also decreased from 19 cases in 2016 to only one in 2019.",2,67,2020-02-26-T-006-S-00067
2020-02-26-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),We urge drivers to do their part to protect the health of others and reduce emissions by not leaving their engines idle when stationary.,3,68,2020-02-26-T-006-S-00068
2020-02-26-T-006,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the answers. It is heartening to know that the numbers have dropped over the years, from 2009 to 2019, over a period of 10 years. However, 2,800 is still quite a large number every year for enforcement acts to catch recalcitrants. So, I am just wondering whether awareness of this regulation is included in our Highway Code before drivers actually get the licence to drive vehicles.",1,69,2020-02-26-T-006-S-00069
2020-02-26-T-006,,,"Because, I am sure, for most of us here, we would sometimes come across stationary vehicles or parked vehicles and the engines are left idling. For me, I have gone up to the person myself and told him, ""You should turn off your engine while the vehicle is stationary"". Beyond that, how can public education efforts be stepped up so that the numbers can be further reduced and that the awareness is there? That is not just about protecting people's health but it is also being kinder to the environment.",1,70,2020-02-26-T-006-S-00070
2020-02-26-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Since December 2016, we have included the idling engine regulations as well as the penalty regime in the Handbook on Highway Code under the Eco-driving section and in the theory test. The idea really is, as the Member has said, to enhance awareness as well as compliance right from the start.",1,71,2020-02-26-T-006-S-00071
2020-02-26-T-006,Amy Khor Lean Suan,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"I agree with the Member that we need to look at even more ways for effective public outreach and education efforts. We have actually stepped up enforcement blitzes at hot-spots and increased the penalties since 2016. And since 2011, we have  distributed more than 1.3 million educational pamphlets and flyers through various means – through the private vehicle fleet owners, schools, authorised vehicles inspection centres and so on. We will continue to look at ways for more effective public education and outreach efforts.",2,72,2020-02-26-T-006-S-00072

2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mr Speaker, Sir. There is never a dull moment for this tiny island. The COVID-19 outbreak is the latest uncertainty to be added to our list of challenges the country faces – even as we grapple with growing stresses in the global trading system, the impending shake-up in the international tax regime, the increasingly difficult geopolitical dynamics that we have to navigate through – to name a few.",1,82,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00082
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"These are all working against our operating proposition, where, as a small and open state, we thrive on a rules-based multilateral system and where each has its opportunities and livelihood based on competitive advantages.",2,83,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00083
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In the midst of navigating these daunting external developments, we have also our domestic challenges to content with – such as the ageing demographics, peaking of the local labour workforce in the decade ahead, the friction that we saw in jobs matching and so on.",3,84,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00084
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"At times like this, it may come across as the world is collapsing upon us. But then, this is Singapore. We are no stranger to crisis. We have been hit by external shocks many times in our history. We have had to deal with many existential threats and challenges. Some, we have overcome and some are still out there, like rising sea levels. And very often, we turned the solutions to our domestic challenges into opportunities and possibilities – like the water story, or how we build physical and non-physical connectivity with the world to make up for our lack of size and hinterland.",4,85,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00085
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The Singapore's exceptionalism story has always been about constantly in the mode of preparing and readying for the next crisis to come even as we hope that things can be smooth sailing. And when the crisis does hit us, we respond decisively, purposefully and with ample fire power to make a difference. Thereafter, regroup, build up again and get ready for the next crisis.",5,86,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00086
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"So, here we are again. Let me start with the fiscal management of the Government, which epitomises this psyche of preparing and readying for a crisis. Thanks to disciplined and prudent financial management as well as the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC), the surpluses accumulated in this term of Government, allow us to mount a massive and robust response to the current situation, yet allowing us to still press on with our longer term agenda.",6,87,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00087
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Without NIRC, three out of the last four fiscal years would have ended in deficit positions. So, we are already spending more than what we have collected from taxes. The call to spend more, the need to spend more is expected to keep rising. The calls were even louder in Budget 2018, where there was a bigger that projected surplus of $10.9 billion for FY2017 due to a one-off contribution from MAS and stamp duties collections.",7,88,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00088
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"It is understandable for all of us here, in this chamber, to push for more spending and subsidies in areas that we feel strongly about. I do that a lot here. The Finance Minister would then have the unenviable task of allocating the next dollar based on our priorities; and also importantly, based on how these spending commitments can be sustainably funded.",8,89,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00089
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"It is always tempting to be nice and popular – spend more today and worry about tomorrow later. Fortunately, this is not the case for Singapore's Ministry of Finance.",9,90,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00090
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I remember at last year's Budget Statement speech, the Finance Minister said this  ""Our fiscal discipline and prudence gave us the resources to respond decisively to unexpected challenges, such as the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. We must not take this for granted.""",10,91,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00091
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"These words said last year may sound like the Finance Minister knew what was to come in 2020. But we know that the good old adage of ""Saving for Rainy Days"" has never failed Singapore. It is our most valuable 20-20 foresight and so aptly shows up in Budget 2020.",11,92,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00092
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),A case in point here is how we used the savings for rainy days to come up with this $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package to deal with the impact from the COVID-19 outbreak.,12,93,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00093
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Indeed, the first wave impact to the affected businesses such as tourism, aviation and retail have been sharp and severe. Some hotels have almost immediately seen 50% drop in occupancy as travellers deferred their trips and many international conferences and meetings were cancelled. Air travel has dropped significantly, especially for routes to the affected areas. Cinemas, restaurants, taxis have all seen lower patronage. Even neighbourhood coffeeshops' businesses are affected as more eat at home and do less outings.",13,94,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00094
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The Stabilisation and Support Package has rightly focused on tackling two situations. Firstly, the weaker cash flow position of businesses due to sudden drop in revenue; secondly and actually more importantly, to focus on saving jobs as the sudden drop in businesses have also resulted in excess labour.",14,95,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00095

2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I am glad that Government has also introduced the Jobs Support Scheme to provide wage support to companies. It not only helps companies with their cash flow situations but also incentivise employers to hold on their workers. Coupled with the enhanced upskilling measures that were also announced, the message to employers is to tap on these assistance schemes to send workers for training and skills upgrade during this lull period and be ready to seize opportunities again when the recovery comes.",16,97,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00097
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I would like to make a technical suggestion here to the Finance Minister. The qualifying period for the Job Support Scheme is for salary paid during the months from October 2019 to December 2019. And hence, there is this possibility that employers who enjoy this cash grant could still lay off the workers in the months later. While I believe most employers will be grateful and understand the Government's good intention, MOF could eliminate this possibility by adding another condition; which is that that the wage support will only be valid for those workers who remain in employment from January to July 2020.",17,98,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00098
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, I welcome the update by the Finance Minister on timing of the GST rate increase and that it will not happened in 2021. The $6 billion Assurance Package does help to address the concerns of Singaporeans on the GST increase.",18,99,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00099
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),The COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting sudden surge in demand for its related medical services further underscored the critical need to allocate sufficient funding for healthcare services and that we not only need to have the right capacity but also the deep specialisation and expertise to deal with any public health threat of this scale.,19,100,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00100
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"As our population ages, the recurring annual costs to provide healthcare services will surely rise. And our expectations for higher subsidies, better quality healthcare and better accessibility will also keep rising over time.",20,101,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00101
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"For example, at my Constituency, we are building a new 12-storey polyclinic which comes at a cost of more than $100 million and thereafter, millions of dollars in recurring costs to run the centre. We are also looking at sites within our estates to build more senior day-care centres that come with medical facilities to handle long-term chronic illness. I understand the costs of each such centre is minimally $1 million and again, the costly recurring expenses.",21,102,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00102
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"While I dislike seeing GST rate increase, I do understand that the Finance Minister would need additional funding to help pay for these new expenditures as well as other increased spending in social areas in education, in security and so on.",22,103,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00103
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),I am convinced that our system of GST that stapled it with a massive and almost permanent GST offset package does mitigate its impact on lower and middle households and re-tilt it from a regressive to a progressive tax system.,23,104,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00104
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"GST taxes on everyone who consume. But those who spend more especially on more expensive items will contribute more GST. These tend to be from the wealthier or the higher income group. Even foreigners who are here for work, businesses or leisure also contribute to our GST coffer when they spend in Singapore. Just like if I travel to Japan, I would also have to pay the 10% consumption tax for my spending there and in effect, directly helping to fund Japan's budget deficit. Here, it would be useful if the Finance Minister can share on the proportion of GST collected that is being contributed by the higher income groups and foreigners.",24,105,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00105
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The Assurance Package that will come into effect when the GST rate increase kicks in after 2021 is specifically targeted at helping the lower and middle income Singaporean households and seniors. Under the Package, every adult Singaporean will receive a cash payout of $700 to $1,600 over five years. The majority of Singaporeans will receive offsets to cover at least five years' worth of additional GST expenses incurred.",25,106,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00106
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In other words, to the majority of Singaporeans, the effect of the GST increase will be further pushed back by another five years when the new increase kicks in because of the Assurance Package.",26,107,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00107

2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),I have met many such job seekers at my Meet-the-People session. I can fully understand what they are going through. They are often under tremendous pressure to find a new job quickly and the entire family is also impacted as these job seekers are often also the sole or main breadwinner.,31,112,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00112
2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"As what the Deputy Prime Minister has related in the Budget speech, for people in their 40s and 50s, when they started work, it was normal to stay with one job, in one or two companies, for life. They lived through the period when Singapore’s economy experienced high growth, and technology was not changing very fast as to have a major impact on the workplace.

2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),The issue is that these new positions are often not filled by this age group of job seekers.

2020-02-26-T-009,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),The best way to do this is to help workers stay employable when they still have a job and for them to have the option to move to new jobs and new roles if need be. We need to reduce difficulties in job transition and enhance their capabilities to better match jobs so that job seekers can be re-employed faster.,40,121,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00121

2020-02-26-T-009,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"A young resident came to my Meet-the-People Session (MPS) some years ago to ask for financial assistance to pay for his ITE school fees. I told him that we would assist him, but I asked that he promise me that he would put in his best effort to do well. I still remember how he, without hesitation, agreed to do so. That year, he did come back, showed me his grades and it did reflect him doing well. And I was very glad for him. After a year, one of my residents came to see me asking for help, saying that he needed help for me to speak to his son. He explained that his family had financial difficulties and because he was a low-income worker. He said that his son wanted to quit school to be able to earn an income to help the family with its finances. He asked if I could convince his son to stay and continue his studies. So, I told him I would try my best and hope that we could do that. After he left, I asked my grassroots leader to please go and see if this is the boy that came to see me a year ago because we need to convince him that he needs to stay in school because his grades are good and we need to help his family.",2,139,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00139

By sheer coincidence, I was invited to an ITE graduation ceremony and I witnessed the graduation of him and he was receiving an award and a scholarship to the Polytechnic. At that time, he informed me that, with his scholarship, his family could manage and he asked that we channel the support to other more needy families.",3,140,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00140

He now has a promising career and he and his family are doing very well. And he said this to me repeatedly. He said, ""I know the importance of opportunity and I am grateful that by continuing my studies, I was able to take the opportunities that came my way"". So, he had potential and he would have been able to help his family had he gone and found a job at that time. The fact that he was able to build on the foundation and acquire the skills to enable him to access better opportunities really made the difference for him and he is now clearly able to take on larger opportunities that come his way. Of course, his learning continues.",4,141,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00141

Addressing current challenges and keeping businesses viable are important because, if they fail, Singaporeans who work for these organisations will lose their jobs and their livelihoods will be impacted. We must not, however, give up on building for the long term. I am glad that Budget 2020, while seeking to provide the much-needed support and help for workers and businesses to weather the short-term uncertainties brought about by the COVID-19 situation and geopolitical tensions, is also balancing this with ensuring that we stay on track with the strategic economic transformation plans to prepare Singapore and Singaporeans for the longer term and to be ready for new opportunities.",5,142,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00142

With the business slowdown, organisations must take the opportunity to execute these transformation plans and reskill their employees.

In times of a crisis, it is also time for us to come together to find ways to address the challenges and also see opportunities that present themselves even in these difficult times.",6,143,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00143
2020-02-26-T-009,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"An important thrust of the Budget is the development of our people and supporting continual learning. The measures in this Budget support nurturing every Singaporean to achieve his or her full potential. And I must tell you this. It is a little bit disconcerting sometimes but I have residents who come and ask me, ""Can you get me approval to transfer my SkillsFuture credit to my family members?"" The reasons given are that they do not need this to learn new skills because they are too old or just that they do not need it or they think that other members of the family may have more need for training. The need to continually learn, unlearn and relearn is important for everyone, regardless of age or stage in life. This is to build confidence not only for employability but for active participation in life in an economy and society that is more complex and fast-changing. With change comes the need to be agile and to be able to handle ambiguity. Therefore, building relevant skills, picking up new knowledge and the ability to deal with change are key to not only availing oneself to employment opportunities, but also to enabling us to be confident to participate and thrive in society. This will impact an individual's quality of life. The challenge is how we can help as many Singaporeans as possible to understand what training is available, assess what is relevant for them and to make access to learning easy. Today, many more people are taking courses and, while this is encouraging as it shows the willingness to learn, we need to do more to ensure relevancy and the impact of the learning in helping with employability or addressing required life skills.",7,144,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00144

The short-term measures in the Stabilisation and Support Package will provide businesses some relief from the impact of the COVID-19 situation and will help workers retain their jobs.

2020-02-26-T-009,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"We do have to recognise that for some businesses, the impact of the current uncertainties has been quite sharp and although their business operations have been viable, the drastic drop in business demand and impact on supply chain will have significant short-term operational and cashflow impacts. Going through the immediate challenges will have to be priority for them if they are to be able to keep jobs. While the Stabilisation and Support Package does provide some relief on wage costs and funds training support, they may not be sufficient to help businesses. Employers will need to take the leadership on cost-management measures as well as partner with employees to help with cost-saving measures to protect jobs. Perhaps, more can be done to help businesses navigate existing programmes already in place that can complement Budget 2020 to manage this current business impact.",12,149,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00149

As Deputy Prime Minister Heng had said in the Budget, some in this segment have stayed with one company and have not made career changes since they left school.

And I must tell you that I do see my residents in this age group, struggling with finding suitable employment and this is not because they have not tried. Anxiety levels are really quite high, not just for them, but also for their families. I am also somewhat concern with the emphasis on training and re-skilling with this Budget because if many are trained and yet, they are not able to find suitable employment, we may have a situation where there is even greater frustration and anxiety.",15,152,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00152

Sometimes, I feel that when we talk about re-skilling, we forget that these mid-career workers bring a wealth of knowledge, capabilities and experience that we should leverage on while we help them with re-skilling. This is something that I hope we can pay some attention to, because otherwise, it will be a waste of opportunities and also wasted skills. For example, if data analytics is the area of focus, as we re-skill the individual for this, how do we also look at his/her experience – perhaps we can say it is marketing,or management – and say how do you avail them to be able to use these skills across different industries and roles as they pick up this new skill.

And what do I mean by that? Let me give you an example. For organisations, when they look at on-boarding their staff, they look at on-boarding staff to the new environment in the office, to the company and the company's policies and practices and business. For the mid-career worker, what is additionally required is also the on-boarding and transition to a new industry when you are looking at re-skilling and job role changes. I can tell that to you personally because I have experienced that. I have changed industries. And it can be extremely scary because you suddenly find yourself in situations where you do not even know what questions to ask, because you may not know what you do not know of your new industry. That kind of orientation – on-boarding and so on – is very important as well as the support systems to be put in place for that. Performance systems and management systems need to also evolve in the same way.",18,155,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00155

Beyond the provision of funding, equally important is these platforms to encourage ground-up participation and bringing stakeholders together to catalyse more ground-up initiatives, crowd source ideas and drive innovation.

On my part, I have been studying the phenomenon of globalisation for a while, and I would argue that the main debate today is not between those who support or reject globalisation. Instead, it is a more nuanced and constructive debate, about the kind of globalisation we should strive for, that would improve human welfare in a sustainable way.

Workers in their 40s and 50s are at a stage of their lives when they can least afford income disruption  they have children to raise, mortgages to pay and elderly parents who may be ailing and need financial support. Disruption can come anytime, through industries being off-shored elsewhere, or by being displaced through foreign competition within Singapore. To this end, I agree with the Government's effort in this Budget to boost the hiring of locals and mid-career transitioners, by reducing the S Pass sub-DRC in the Construction, Marine and Process industries.",10,166,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00166
2020-02-26-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Despite all these efforts, mid-career workers' anxiety will be hard to assuage. Why? Transitions into new industries take time. There could be mismatch between openings and applicants. Seeking assistance from Government agencies also positions the citizen as someone applying for help, which can be a humbling experience. All this can be a tremendous mental and emotional strain on the whole family. To illustrate, I know of one retrenched man, who has still not told his wife that he lost his job some months ago; every day he leaves home as usual and comes back at the usual time, while trying to find another job.",11,167,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00167
2020-02-26-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"In dealing with the long-term structural shifts, the Government has devoted significant resources to enable workers to skill-up and transit to other industries. This is certainly needed. But is it time now to consider other measures too, that Singaporeans can tap on more seamlessly, and for security and peace of mind? It had always been a tenet of this Government to promote self-reliance among Singaporeans. Singaporeans, too, prefer to be self-reliant and not have to seek Government assistance at every turn.",12,168,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00168
2020-02-26-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"With the weak economic outlook and soft job market, it may be the time to re-examine some policy approaches. For instance, I know of some mid-career employees who had been laid off and turned to Government agencies for assistance, but were unable to secure work for months, a point Ms Jessica Tan alluded to earlier as well. Some of them wanted to chart their own re-skilling towards a professional qualification in another field, which would require a significant cash outlay. One measure, which I think should be considered, is allowing more liberal use of CPF savings for education and re-skilling. This would be reasonable for CPF members whose savings already exceed the applicable Minimum Sums. I will speak more about this at MOM's Committee of Supply debate.",13,169,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00169
2020-02-26-T-009,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Another measure for consideration is some sort of redundancy insurance. This has been previously debated in this House, with the Government calling it, ""not a crazy idea"", but preferring its current approach of job creation and re-skilling. How confident is the Government that its existing schemes will be able to find solutions for everyone who applies?",14,170,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00170

Suffice to say for now, Sir, that the Government would need to re-assess its approaches periodically, as economic and technological realities change. If the anxiety of citizens is not taken seriously enough, the door to populism and nativism will widen.",15,171,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00171

This transition is not easy, and I appreciate that the Government has poured in resources to support Singaporeans in re-skilling and career transition.

Today, as we debate Budget 2020, Singapore as a country must grapple with the round-the-clock challenge of battling with COVID-19. This is over and above the continued race to keep up with the rise of digitalisation, new technologies and economic transformation. Against the backdrop of these exacting forces, the future of work, workers and workplaces will – and must – evolve and transform.",1,233,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00233
2020-02-26-T-009,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Thus far, many union leaders, workers as well as my grassroots leaders and residents have shared positive feedback about this year’s Budget. At a personal level, I am sure the Stabilisation and Support Package announced at Budget 2020 will be a boon to both businesses and workers, as it provides assurance and support in this time of economic uncertainty and ensure every worker matters and every job counts. On one hand, businesses will receive job and cash flow support to retain and retrain workers. On the other hand, our workers – from the young and mid-career to older workers – will get a much-needed boost, through the various SkillsFuture Credit schemes to upgrade, upskill and stay employable. What is particularly reassuring, is that Deputy Prime Minister Heng has also stated affirmatively in his speech that the Government is prepared to do more should the need arise.",2,234,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00234
2020-02-26-T-009,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),This year’s Budget is seen as an expensive as well as an expansive one. I am particularly happy and delighted with three items fleshed out in the Budget because it has answered three calls which I have been making in this House.,3,235,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00235
2020-02-26-T-009,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"First, is the $500 SkillsFuture Credit top up for all Singaporeans, which I have been lobbying for over the past two years. Some of you may not know but what is particularly beneficial and useful is that freelancers and self-employed individuals can also tap on their SkillsFuture Credits to learn new skills or even develop in their field. I am heartened, therefore, that this top-up will give all Singaporeans aged 25 and above, an added push, as they make lifelong learning a way of life.",4,236,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00236
2020-02-26-T-009,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Second, is the added focus on mid-career workers between the ages of 40 to 60 years old through the various programmes and policies. Based on labour market statistics and reports, this group continues to be the most vulnerable and affected by retrenchments, with higher skilled, middle-aged PMEs the hardest hit. Mature and older workers, including PMEs, also face greater difficulty in the job market with the long-term unemployment rate of Singaporeans climbing with age. For those who are unemployed or retrenched, re-entry into the labour market is also an uphill task. In my interactions with mature workers, and especially PMEs, they have shared their concerns about being made redundant by younger colleagues or being replaced by technology and job automation. In short, they worry about staying employed and employable.",5,237,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00237
2020-02-26-T-009,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Third, would be the creation of the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit for Employers. This is also something I have suggested in this House. I hope this credit for employers will serve as a catalyst for companies, especially SMEs, to develop their workforce as they transform their business, by embracing and investing in skills upgrading and training of their workers. In particular, the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit will further augment and complement existing efforts by the NTUC and our affiliated unions to partner companies in forming Company Training Committees. These efforts, which were introduced last year, aim to equip workers across all sectors and all sizes of companies with the necessary skills, so that they can secure better wages, better welfare and better work prospects.",6,238,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00238

2020-02-26-T-009,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"First, to speed up the disbursement of Jobs Support Scheme and SkillsFuture Top-Up. In the near term, some companies that are directly affected are already feeling the effects of economic fallout brought about by COVID-19 and any immediate relief is welcomed. As such, can the disbursement of the Jobs Support Scheme be brought forward from the start date of July 2020?",8,240,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00240
2020-02-26-T-009,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"In the same vein, many workers, especially the freelance and self-employed, have asked if the SkillsFuture Top-up originally scheduled in October 2020 can be rolled-out earlier, so that they can make use of this period of downtime to embark on the relevant training. As I urge the speeding up of disbursements, I also suggest for the Government's support to lengthen and stretch the validity of these schemes should the situation worsen or become prolonged.",9,241,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00241
2020-02-26-T-009,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Second is to expand the Training Support for Mid-Career Singaporeans. My second suggestion is not to confine the additional top-up for those aged 40 to 60 years old only to those 200 career transition programmes offered by the CET centres as outlined in Annex B-2 to the Budget Statement. I urge for the courses availed to include those recognised under the ITM Skills Framework as well as suitable Government and NTUC run courses and programmes and those of our company training committees. By the same token, to minimise jobs and skills mismatches, career advisors could look at providing peer-level support for this group and additional support such as coaching to identify skills gaps and training intervention that may be needed.",10,242,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00242
2020-02-26-T-009,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Third is to restore the Surrogate Employer Programme. During the SARS crisis in 2003, I was in NTUC overseeing the Surrogate Employer Programme, where NTUC acted as a surrogate employer and helped many of those affected by the downturn such as Tour Guides as well as SIA's Cabin Crew who were on unpaid leave, to go for training and upgrading while benefiting from a training allowance. These efforts resulted in a win-win-win for all, in that when the Singapore economy rebounded months later, affected workers who had the training allowance as stipend, could now return to their jobs and assignments quickly to the delight of their employers and customers. In addition, they were now armed with additional qualifications such as a Diploma in Hospitality or other related certifications. I see a good opportunity for us to revisit and reintroduce this scheme to support workers who may fall through the cracks or those not covered under the current schemes such as our freelancers and self-employed Singaporeans.",11,243,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00243
2020-02-26-T-009,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"To further support this group of workers, could the Government also look at extending calibrated wage support through sector agencies to help them cope with the immediate impact brought about by the current economic situation. NTUC stands ready to partner the Government to administer the Surrogate Employer Programme so that this group of workers can also benefit from training assistance and incentives.",12,244,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00244
2020-02-26-T-009,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Fourth, to raise the absentee payroll and course fee funding. In light of the current situation, as well as business slowdown for many industries and possibility of recession, the Government can step in to provide an additional nudge and incentive for employers to send all their workers for training and skills upgrading through increasing the absentee payroll and course fee funding. Minimally, I submit that this enhanced critical funding can help to address the vulnerabilities of the mature and older workers in this time and space.",13,245,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00245
2020-02-26-T-009,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Today, the world has changed and continues to change.

2020-02-26-T-009,Patrick Tay Teck Guan,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"To ensure job security for workers, my fifth suggestion would be the formation of Job Security Councils. As NTUC Secretary-General and Minister Ng Chee Meng has shared, NTUC will be piloting a Jobs Security Council, JSC, for short, to pre-emptively match at-risk workers and PMEs into jobs. Through the JSC, NTUC and its affiliated unions will help displaced workers find new jobs within the network – and where necessary, provide the requisite training to help workers smoothly transition from one job to another.

In fact, many of them suggested to me that when this episode is over, FairPrice should not allow people who stock up to return their excess goods to us to get a refund. This is actually our standard policy. This so as to teach people a lesson on buying responsibly and not hoard first only to return the stocks later.

Those who mock them – purveyor of false news, socially irresponsible, the boors of society. Most of all, the Budget is for the ordinary men and women of Singapore who are decent and care for our fellowmen, who would work together to stem out the foul storm that is facing Singapore. This Budget has something for us all, and I thank the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng and his team for their inclusive and thoughtful rendering that is this Unity Budget.",31,286,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00286

2020-02-26-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"But while our nation unites to tackle the pandemic, we must not forget that long-term structural challenges – such as the declining support for globalisation, an ageing workforce and the uncertainties surrounding our economy – continue to persist. More worryingly, some of these challenges are now being accelerated due to COVID-19. The confluence of these factors will impact our entire economy, and I am heartened to note that the Government will be investing $8.3 billion to drive industry transformation and develop our workers for the future. However, more can be done to help our PMETs, which according to a 2019 report published by DBS Senior Economist, Irvin Seah, PMETs are now the ""new vulnerables"" among our workforce.",2,288,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00288

2020-02-26-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Speaker, I am happy to note that Budget 2020 has placed an emphasis on helping mid-career PMETs, currently in their 40s and 50s, through the Mid-Career Support Package. This is a timely move as PMETs in this age group are arguably at one of the most vulnerable stages in their careers. And they are vulnerable in two key areas – employment and employability.",4,290,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00290
2020-02-26-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Let me first touch on employment vulnerability, or better known as job security. Employment data over the past decade has shown that PMETs are increasingly at risk of being retrenched. According to the retrenchment statistics released by MOM, the proportion of PMETs among workers being retrenched annually has grown from 37% in 2008 to 65% in 2018. This upward trend is unlikely to be reversed anytime soon and will be accelerated in the event of an economic downturn.",5,291,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00291
2020-02-26-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"PMETs, particularly those in their mid-career, are also vulnerable in terms of employability. Those who do not keep their skill sets current will find it hard to secure new jobs when they are displaced. As the Deputy Prime Minister noted in his Budget speech, many of our mid-career PMETs grew up in a time when it is seen as the norm to stay in one company for life until retirement. However, with technology cycles shorter than ever, many are now at risk of being displaced by fresh graduates if they do not equip themselves with new technical and new technology skills.",6,292,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00292
2020-02-26-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Quantitatively, we are already seeing this trend happening. If we analyse the rate of re-entry into employment among retrenched residents from MOM's Labour Market Survey, it shows that workers aged 40 and above have lower re-entry rates than their younger counterparts.",7,293,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00293
2020-02-26-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"So, how then, can we better support this group of vulnerable mid-career PMETs to have better job security, and boost their employability if and when they get displaced? I am proposing three strategies  (a) build a strong eco-system of job security support within each sector; (b) bring training closer to our mid-career PMETs; and (c) equip them with adaptive skills beyond technical and technology skills.",8,294,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00294
2020-02-26-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Let me start with providing better job security support to our PMETs. First, I would like to commend Budget 2020 for introducing the Stabilisation and Support Package amounting to $4 billion, which will support our enterprises in keeping their workers during the economic slowdown and position them to rebound quickly once the crisis is over.",9,295,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00295
2020-02-26-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"However, in the longer term, we need to ensure that our economic sectors are self-sustaining. And in my view, the concept of the Job Security Council, which the NTUC Secretary-General Mr Ng Chee Meng had highlighted in his speech earlier, is a useful way forward. By creating a structure to formalise the matching of displaced workers in an affected sector to a growing sector in need of manpower, we will be able to achieve a more resilient employment landscape. The NTUC Job Security Council will benefit all working professionals and will go a long way to mitigate the increased risk of retrenchments that our PMETs face in today’s fast-changing operating environment. I am therefore glad to see such strong support during the pilot phase and I urge more companies to come on board this initiative.",10,296,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00296
2020-02-26-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Mr Speaker, we also need to ensure that our PMETs remain employable and constantly upgrade themselves to take on the new jobs of tomorrow. To do so, we must bring training closer in terms of relevance, cost and location.",11,297,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00297
2020-02-26-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"First, we need to make training more relevant to our PMETs. From my weekly visits to workplaces, many PMETs have told me that while they understood the importance of going for training and staying current with industry trends, they are unable to see how going for generic courses can help them in their specific line of work. This is why the NTUC, through its affiliated unions, has initiated the formation of Company Training Committees (CTCs) with our unionised companies. These CTCs are meant to help our workers answer the two common questions of ""Train what?"" and ""Train for what?"" Through the CTCs, we work with companies to assess their specific business and operational needs and translate these needs into a targeted training plan for employees to close the skills gap and at the same time remain employable.",12,298,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00298
2020-02-26-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"In the area of cost, training must be made more affordable and within the financial reach for our PMETs. In previous Budgets, my fellow Labour MPs and I had called for top-ups to the SkillsFuture Credit and we are glad that this suggestion has been adopted. The top-ups will certainly help our workers offset the costs of keeping their skill sets relevant. I also support the $500 special top-up to the SkillsFuture Credit accounts for mid-career workers aged 40 to 60.",13,299,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00299
2020-02-26-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"I note, however, that this Special SkillsFuture Credit is limited for use to only about 200 selected career transition programmes. I hope that the Government can expand this to include all Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) courses as well as programmes to help our PMETs to deep-skill themselves. Deep-skill training programmes require a certain level of experience as a pre-requisite and are often more costly due to their small niche. Perhaps the Government can consider mapping deep-skill training courses to the proficiency levels found in the Skills Framework and allow eligible programmes to be further subsidised. This way, we can help to reduce the out-of-pocket expenses for those who wish to gain a deeper mastery of their profession.",14,300,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00300
2020-02-26-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Additionally, with our ageing workforce and the corresponding rise in our retirement and re-employment ages, I hope the Government can extend the Special SkillsFuture Credit top-up to those beyond 60 years of age. Just as we should support those who wish to continue working beyond 60, we should also support them in their pursuit of lifelong learning.",15,301,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00301
2020-02-26-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Like my NTUC colleague, Mr Patrick Tay, I would also urge the Government to bring forward the disbursement of the SkillsFuture Credit top-ups from the current date of 1 October. As the Chinese proverb goes  ""远水救不了近火"". We should disburse the additional SkillsFuture Credit sooner rather than later so that our workers can attend the necessary training during this near-term economic lull and be equipped with new skills and confidence when our respective industries recover.",16,302,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00302
2020-02-26-T-009,Melvin Yong Yik Chye,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Beyond cost, we need to bring the training programmes physically closer to our mid-career PMETs. Some courses just cannot be done online. For courses that require a physical premise, schools, institutes of higher learning, and even neighbourhood Community Centres (CCs) serve as a more convenient location for our working people to go and upgrade themselves.",17,303,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00303

Currently, the U PME Centre sits at the NTUC Members Hub in One Marina Boulevard, helping to equip PMET union members with a growth mindset through services such as career development workshops and job preparation courses. The existing centre has done well, serving over 1,500 individuals in the past three years. Moving forward, we will bring these workshops and training programmes closer to our PMETs. For a start, U PME Centre will set up on-demand mobile centres at the three CCs located within the Moulmein-Cairnhill constituency at Cairnhill, Tanglin and Pek Kio. I understand the grassroot advisor has been most supportive of this. We will gradually extend our services to all 11 CCs located within the Tanjong Pagar GRC.

This is well received by many of my union leaders and workers, who told me that while they are worried about the impact of COVID-19 on their job security, they are thankful that the Jobs Support Scheme and the Wage Credit Scheme will help enterprises retain their workers and protect the jobs that they have.

One such example is Copthorne King's Hotel. Working with the Food Drinks and Allied Workers Union (FDAWU), the hotel's General Manager, Mr Kung Teong Wah, saw value in tapping on the Hotel Job Redesign Place-and-Train programme to multi-skill their workers in other job functions so that they can actually be cross-deployed into other departments when there is a shortage of manpower. He even took the initiative to convince General Managers from other hotels within the same group to do likewise in order to avoid asking their workers to go on mandatory annual leave or to take no-pay leave.

Companies can take this opportunity to help these workers transit and become more digitally confident and at the same time, use this as impetus to accelerate the digital transformation of their business processes. Through the use of technology and job redesign, flexi-work arrangements for certain jobs can indeed be a more permanent arrangement to save on operating costs like office rental and utilities while providing the opportunity for employees to remain productive and empowered to manage their time flexibly.

The company embarked on the OTR process in September last year and within a month, completed the entire process. Our Union Leader, Sister Sukartini, who is the Branch Chair of UWEEI in Energizer, was involved in the whole OTR process. Because she was able to give critical inputs about workers' concerns and understanding of the ground situation, this has helped the company's management to identify gaps and blind spots in the roadmap. The OTR process has certainly helped Energizer to identify transformation priorities and action plans. The CTC will be the platform for regular tracking of their transformation objectives.",15,329,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00329

Fong's Engineering is an SME unionised under the Metal Industries Workers' Union. I have shared in previous Budget speeches before how Fong's has embraced innovation and business model transformation very much early on to help keep themselves ahead of the competition. While having done their own company planning previously, Fong's still chose to undertake the OTR process in November last year. The aim is to re-evaluate the relevance of their previous transformation plans and through this OTR process, Fong's managed to pinpoint some blind spots in their current transformation plan that needed a further in-depth analysis, they identified additional talent and training needs and updated their transformation plan to move even more decisively for the next two years ahead. So, whether you are a MNC or a SME, let me encourage all companies to work with our Labour Movement via the CTC platform to hasten and to deepen your transformation.",16,330,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00330

However, with so many different courses to choose from, some companies and workers are at a loss about which courses to pick. They also find it difficult to map the training courses against the skills framework developed by SkillsFuture Singapore, and hope that the training they have undergone will be better recognised by their employers and the industry, and that it will help advance their career. Government ministries and agencies need to work with their tripartite partners and human resource professionals to streamline the matching of courses with the skills framework, and make the “customer experience” of lifelong learning more manageable. This will fit in better with the Government’s efforts to provide more SkillsFuture Credits at the individual and enterprise level.",19,333,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00333

Companies can make use of this opportunity to build digital confidence amongst employees and accelerate the digital transformation of their business operations. Flexible work arrangements for certain job functions could also be made permanent. This will not only help companies save on operational costs like office rentals and utilities, but also help many working parents better balance work demands and parental duties, which will encourage more to contribute to our workforce.

For example, PSA currently offers alternative employment for personnel from the Emergency Response Team, or the ER Team, upon retirement at the age of 55 years old.

This year’s Budget intends to mitigate the short-term vulnerabilities faced by businesses and workers without taking our eyes off the future.

The vulnerability of workers can manifest itself in the form of stagnating wages, job insecurity, skill redundancies and poor working conditions, among many others.

Given that the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) has shown its effectiveness to help improve workers' skills and wages, I urge the Government to support industry stakeholders if they are keen to adopt PWM so that more workers can enjoy better wages coupled with better skills and increased productivity. Sectors like waste collection and strata management are keen to have a mandatory PWM and it is important to have Government support to identify and leverage on the key levers that would encourage widespread adoption.",4,363,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00363

Given that wage data are collected in the annual Occupational Wage Survey, we can help these workers by having a wage benchmark by occupation and sector so that workers can identify a fair wage for their occupation and be more aware of the industry standard to make informed decisions about their careers. Perhaps, as a trial to set industry wage benchmark, the tripartite partners could start with the F&B industry where there are around 180,000 workers in diverse roles.",5,364,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00364

There are many with disabilities who are working or would like to seek employment. However, it may not be easy for them to work in a building where the physical structure may pose a big hindrance or for them to find companies that offer employment to people with disabilities. In this aspect, I would like to call for the Government to consider providing funding support to help employers offset the costs needed to modify infrastructure at workplaces, especially in older buildings, to encourage employment of people with disabilities.

I would like to ask the Minister how do we continue to grow our economy and create good jobs for all Singaporeans even as we battle the outbreak?

And two, to classify SEPs, within a limited definition, especially the platform workers, as workers defined by the Employment Act. Both of these approaches are not without their limitation but it certainly betters the lot of the SEPs. Their ranks will certainly increase over time. I hope that the Ministry can also consider providing greater support for the SEPs in the second phase of COVID-19 support, if ever one is needed.",8,382,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00382
2020-02-26-T-009,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Next, on the unmet needs of the younger workforce. Our Young NTUC survey showed that younger Singaporeans are keen to develop themselves overseas. The Asia Ready Exposure Programme in Budget 2020 would greatly help our students to pick up those valuable experiences while still in school.",9,383,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00383
2020-02-26-T-009,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"We also hope that young Singaporeans in their first or second career can also have such opportunities. Especially those in the early 20s, there is still sufficient runway for an internship. However, the resources available to them are limited. Those Singaporeans who have graduated are dependent on their companies for overseas exposure. Can Government provide a one stop centre, and perhaps subsidies for younger Singaporeans to explore careers in Asia, especially South East Asia?",10,384,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00384
2020-02-26-T-009,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Next, let me discuss on the gender wage gap. It is not a common Budget debate topic. But first, it is an important issue and second, there are opportunities afforded from COVID-19 outbreak. MOM did a study not too long ago and found that women in Singapore are earning less than men today and that gap has grown slightly from 16% in 2002 to 16.3% in 2018. The adjusted gender pay gap was 6% in 2018.  The main adjustment was for occupational differences. Yet, it still runs counter to the principle that all things being equal, men and women must obtain the same pay if they are doing the same job with similar outcomes.",11,385,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00385
2020-02-26-T-009,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"We acknowledge that there has been progress. And we also acknowledge that absolute gender parity in job outcomes is not necessarily a normative ideal. But there is immense value to pursue the economic outcomes of greater equality, besides addressing the social issues and the values that we engender as a nation.",12,386,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00386
2020-02-26-T-009,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Indeed, there are benefits for greater women participation at all levels. In an IMF blog piece by Christine Lagarde and Johnathan Ostry on 28 November 2018, their conclusion was gender diversity matters. I quote, ""Our analysis springs from the observation – supported by considerable microeconomic evidence – that women and men bring different skills and perspectives to the workplace, including different attitudes to risk and collaboration. Studies have also shown that the financial performance of firms improves with more gender-equal corporate boards…. our evidence – from macroeconomic, sectoral, and firm-level data – shows that women and men complement each other in the production process, creating an additional benefit from increasing women's employment on growth."" Therefore, the key benefits from narrowing gender wage gaps are  first, a bigger boost to growth; second, higher productivity; and third, a more equal and inclusive society.",13,387,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00387
2020-02-26-T-009,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"There are structural issues to tackle  first, human resources – and how we grade women who are out on maternity. A working mother would be entitled to up to 16 weeks of Government-Paid Maternity Leave. But oftentimes, in some organisations, they might be graded on the same 12 months as any other colleagues. This meant that from a work output perspective, the women on maternity are already at a disadvantage. Companies would argue that it would only be fair to the other colleagues who picked up the slack. But this also meant that good talent on maternity would not be given a level playing field to progress as progression are usually based on consistency of better graded performances. This has perhaps contributed to a lack of women in senior leadership positions over time.",14,388,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00388

2020-02-26-T-009,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Women are still often expected to take on the primary role at home. The responsibility of care-giving and housework also continue to disproportionately affect women, who find themselves taking on the double shift of working a job and taking on most of the household responsibilities.

2020-02-26-T-009,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"First, women should be given the right to flexi-work arrangements (FWA) post-maternity. Normalising flexible work arrangement options to give a degree of comfort to working women, as it helps working care-givers avoid the conflict they face in trying to balance their careers with responsibilities at home something especially accentuated post-maternity. It can be very difficult to ask a woman to ask for FWA if it is seen as a privilege and not a norm. COVID-19 outbreak has clearly shown that organisations can and are able to operate with broad FWA, even as we speak now. Previously, the argument was it was not possible.",19,393,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00393
2020-02-26-T-009,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Second, companies should grade women on maternity on an eight-month basis rather than a 12-month basis. Planning from the start meant that women will still be able to have a more level promotion path after maternity.",20,394,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00394
2020-02-26-T-009,Desmond Choo,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Third, key leadership positions in our listed companies ought to be tracked and monitored to ensure that women are not being grossly under-represented. Company-wide reviews can be done consistently. Citigroup, for example has adjusted the pay in Singapore of women who earned less than their male peers for doing the same job. We all need to lean in to create a more inclusive environment for women.",21,395,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00395

Although we cannot proclaim to have solved every problem easily, at least we have been able to come up with measures as the situation evolved. During the initial stage, unions took the initiative to understand the concerns of our taxi-drivers, and most drivers expressed hope that they can drive their cars safely but said they lacked protective supplies like hand sanitisers and disinfectants. Since then, unions have tried their best to procure these necessities for drivers through various channels and distributed the supplies to them.",8,405,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00405

2020-02-26-T-009,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"In terms of enabling skills building through funding, the Government is introducing the next bound of SkillsFuture through this Budget. There will be more money given to individuals and companies to undertake training via SkillsFuture. There will be a second top-up of $500 to the SkillsFuture accounts of all Singaporeans aged 25 and above, while middle-age workers will get an additional $500. There will also be a new SkillsFuture Enterprise grant to defray up to 90% of companies' business transformation, training and job redesign costs. These incentives, together with substantial existing grants and subsidies from Enterprise Singapore, Workforce Singapore and other economic agencies, again goes to show the Government's firm belief in enabling individual and corporate investment in building skills and capabilities for greater competitiveness and in enhancing the employment and employability of our workers.",23,441,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00441
2020-02-26-T-009,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"On the Labour Movement's part, as elaborated by my fellow Labour Member of Parliament colleagues earlier, we introduced last year the Company Training Committees (CTCs) as platforms to bring companies and unions into partnership over skills building, and to inject Government resources and support for such initiatives through this channel and platform. This is a practical way to proactively and systematically upgrade companies' and workers' capabilities, and to help build momentum for the overall transformation of Singapore's economy.",24,442,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00442
2020-02-26-T-009,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"Good progress has been made in this area, and again, as reported earlier, 352 CTCs have already been formed since its inception in April last year. Provisions of this year's Budget can certainly give a boost to the CTCs' efforts, and I urge our tripartite partners to make full use of these resources to press ahead with investing in our workers' training, across all ages.",25,443,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00443
2020-02-26-T-009,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"For displaced workers, finding a new job quickly is important. This is especially so for older workers as experience tells us that they will find it more difficult to find a new job and to maintain the previous pay. And this affects not only what we might traditionally call rank-and-file workers, but actually, it is so for all levels and all ages of workers, affecting also middle-age PMEs.",26,444,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00444
2020-02-26-T-009,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"In this Budget, through the SkillsFuture Mid-career Support Package, the Government is going to double the job placement of professionals via the Professional Conversion Programmes or PCPs. Such professionals will be able to find new career runways through the PCPs' skill-up-and-switch roadmaps. I fully support this, and I have one call on the Government to consider, which is to broaden the age criterion – currently set between 40 and 60 years old – to include those up to the current re-employment age ceiling of 67. And the reason is because all the factors that we have argued about, the 40 to 60 year olds having the vulnerability, they would certainly also apply from 60 to 67 years old. And indeed if anything, if that group should lose their jobs, I think the challenges will not be less than those aged 40 to 60. As the same time, the scheme itself has certain safeguards in terms of useful courses. So, I think it is good and proper that we broaden the criteria to include workers up to the re-employment age ceiling of 67 and to continue in this way to show the Government's commitment towards their employment, employability and welfare.",27,445,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00445
2020-02-26-T-009,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"In this area of boosting job search and placement, the Government will find an enthusiastic innovator in the Labour Movement. As Minister in the Prime Minister's office and Secretary-General of NTUC, brother Ng Chee Meng had said earlier, NTUC will be spearheading the Job Security Council (JSC) in partnership with industry to go beyond what, for example, NTUC's e2i has traditionally done for individual job seekers and individual hiring companies.",28,446,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00446
2020-02-26-T-009,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"Through proactive information sharing and planning, JSCs and CTCs can work together to efficiently facilitate training, re-training and placements between manpower-flushed areas and manpower-starved areas. Such system-level efficiency in manpower re-deployment will further sharpen Singapore's overall competitiveness that is good for business and it would certainly help shorten periods of unemployment for workers who are seeking new jobs.",29,447,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00447
2020-02-26-T-009,Heng Chee How,The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How),"Sir, as the saying goes, ""When the going gets tough, the tough gets going"". We have to face down both the immediate COVID-19 threat as well as shape up for the big challenges and opportunities that the future economy will bring. I heard our Deputy Prime Minister over the radio, as he was discussing aspects of the Budget and exhorting everybody to keep our spirits up and together do our best, he quoted the name of a Hokkien song title. He said, “要 拼 才 会 赢”, which means in English, success comes through effort and striving. He is absolutely right. Success will not come from just taking painkillers or hunkering down. It will come from taking action – concrete, purposeful, effective action.",30,448,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00448

2020-02-26-T-009,Yaacob Ibrahim,Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar),"It consists of two parts, one dealing with the effects of the COVID-19 crisis meant to stabilise the economy and support those affected by the current crisis and a second component designed to help our country continue to grow over the longer term. It supports a range of short-term measures to help tide over the current crisis and a broad sweep of longer term measures to ensure that the economy continues to grow over the long term and that our people can enjoy an increasing quality of life.",2,451,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00451
2020-02-26-T-009,Yaacob Ibrahim,Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar),"Among the proposed measures which for me deserves special mention are increasing the Budget for CSA to embark on new capabilities needed to protect our IT systems against increasingly sophisticated attacks, removing the internal combustion engine vehicles by 2040 and replacing them with electric vehicles and measures to mitigate the effects of climate change. All these resonate with me, not just because they are important issues affecting the future of our country but also because I have always believed that we as a nation can take the global lead in these issues. Sir, I also welcomed the delay in increasing the GST rate by one year.",3,452,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00452
2020-02-26-T-009,Yaacob Ibrahim,Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar),"Sir, despite the COVID-19 crisis, we must have one eye on the future. We cannot afford to be distracted from discussing the real challenges facing our country. It is also important that we learn from this experience and put in place changes and preparations that can help us face the next crisis. Our response to the SARS episode in 2003 and subsequent changes we made to prepare for the next crisis have stood us well in this instance.",4,453,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00453
2020-02-26-T-009,Yaacob Ibrahim,Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar),"Our Government has responded decisively to the crisis. As a people, we have shown both the good and not so good behaviour during this challenging time. The rush for food items and sundry items such as toilet paper when the DORSCON level was changed from Yellow to Orange, reflected not only anxiety but also an irrational response that brought out the worst of Singaporeans. My thanks to all the staff of the various supermarkets and outlets for showing immense patience and fortitude during this period.",5,454,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00454
2020-02-26-T-009,Yaacob Ibrahim,Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar),"Several self-initiated efforts have emerged to rally support for our frontline workers. Youth groups, religious and community organisations, civil society groups and several selfless individuals are all coming together to play their part in this effort. These and other examples of selfless Singaporeans stepping forward to do what they can to deal with this crisis are instances that should give us hope that there is the better side of us waiting to come out especially when the need arises.",6,455,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00455
2020-02-26-T-009,Yaacob Ibrahim,Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar),"Many have also adjusted to a new normal of washing our hands regularly, staying away from crowded places, wearing a mask if we are unwell and spending time with loved ones in parks and beaches enjoying the fresh air and breeze prevalent this time of the year. Sir, if out of this crisis our hygiene standards are raised and as a people we become more conscious of keeping Singapore clean, then we would not have wasted the lessons of this crisis.",7,456,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00456
2020-02-26-T-009,Yaacob Ibrahim,Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar),"Some have also adjusted to working in different teams at different times and locations such as their homes and meeting only if necessary. And I am told by a friend that because of some working from home, Raffles Place is a lot quieter and cleaner. Congestion in the morning seems to have eased a bit. If we make this change permanent, would our quality of life not improve? For those with young children in school, being at home on a working day can indeed be helpful.",8,457,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00457
2020-02-26-T-009,Yaacob Ibrahim,Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar),"Sir, I am sure we can work out the gains and losses so that we understand the impact this change may have on our country. Likewise, conducting classes online has become a part of the new normal. Coming from an Institution of Higher Learning, I am all for online learning to be one of the features of our IHLs. IHLs can decide on the balance among the various classes. Online learning will release classrooms for other needs. Clearly, interaction between students and staff must continue albeit for those that really warrant it such as tutorials, project discussions and lab works.",9,458,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00458

So, let us work together with the team and other Singaporeans in seeing the end of this current crisis as soon as possible. I am sure Ministers Gan and Wong are both looking forward to a good night's sleep and perhaps a round of golf when all this is over. I look forward to meeting them at the greens.",10,459,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00459
2020-02-26-T-009,Yaacob Ibrahim,Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar),"Sir, there is an issue that I think deserves some discussion. The rush to stock up food items over that fateful weekend reminds us that getting communications right is very important. During SARS, there was no social media. Today, we are inundated by news of all sorts from various platforms and from friends and strangers alike. The fundamental question is whether we trust the Government in telling us what is the right thing to do especially during a crisis. Rumours and misinformation about lack of supplies helped to fuel senseless hoarding. This shows a lack of trust. Chaos could have broken out leading to unimaginable losses. This is something we all do not want to happen in Singapore.",11,460,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00460
2020-02-26-T-009,Yaacob Ibrahim,Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar),Another issue of trust currently being debated is POFMA as some view this as an attempt to stifle dissent on the Internet. There is a sense among them that the Government is using this legislation for its own agenda rather than serving the needs of our people.,12,461,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00461
2020-02-26-T-009,Yaacob Ibrahim,Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar),"I am all too familiar with this kind of concern. When I moved to license online news sites in 2013, several Internet groups alleged that this move would kill the diversity of voices on the Internet. As it turns out, the licensing scheme did not stifle the Internet at all. Many groups continue to flourish on the Internet. All we wanted, and I am sure all of us can agree to this, is responsible behavior on the Internet, especially when the issues affect the lives of so many Singaporeans.",13,462,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00462
2020-02-26-T-009,Yaacob Ibrahim,Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar),"Sir, going forward, this issue of trust will continue to arise as we grapple with increasingly complex issues. Consider the effects of climate change on our small island. It is a long-term issue which requires us to put in place the solutions now. It means spending valuable state resources on matters which will affect future generations but does not bring immediate benefits. At the same time, if other countries do not put in place their own mitigation measures, climatic changes can affect us. Hence, dealing with the effects of climate change will raise many questions about how the Government should best use our limited fiscal resources for the good of our country. And the Government will need to build trust that it is doing what is right for our people, even though it means spending significant resources over a very long-term period to benefit future generations.",14,463,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00463
2020-02-26-T-009,Yaacob Ibrahim,Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar),"Sir, consider our efforts at digitalising the economy and our society. When I asked some residents about the many cameras placed at the void decks and some common areas, they generally believe that the Government is doing so for their safety and security. People trust that our Government is using the data captured for good. But this is not the case in some other countries. In places like San Francisco, the residents have voted against having videos in public places. For our own digitalisation efforts to succeed, people must trust that their data is collected solely for the purpose of developing useful services for them.",15,464,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00464
2020-02-26-T-009,Yaacob Ibrahim,Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar),"By all accounts, we have done well thus far. But it is not inconceivable for some to begin to raise the issues of privacy and how their personal data is being used. The PDPA has put in place several measures to protect personal data, but the emergence of data protection legislation that favours more to data owners, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act, will cause some to wonder whether the PDPA is sufficiently rigorous to protect personal data. Similarly, since the Government's handling of citizens data is carved out from PDPA, a time will come where some will raise issues of privacy and accountability.",16,465,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00465
2020-02-26-T-009,Yaacob Ibrahim,Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar),"Sir, my intent in raising these issues is for all us to be cognisant of the potential hazards awaiting us in our journey towards digitalising our economy and society. I believe strongly that we must leverage on technology, especially on those that will improve our quality of life. Internet banking, for example, means I do not have to queue up at bank branches anymore. Immediately, my quality of life has improved. So too for the many Apps that have been developed by both the private sector and our Government. But the flip side of all these new applications of technology are issues of accountability, transparency and trust. Can our Government protect us from being manipulated by the big tech giants? Can we trust our Government to use our personal data for the benefit of all Singaporeans and not some political agenda?",17,466,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00466

2020-02-26-T-009,Yaacob Ibrahim,Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar),"Sir, trust between our Government and the people will undergo stresses as we grapple with these issues. The trust we have built over the past 60 years or so has given us a quality of life that is the envy of other nations. Going forward, what more can be done to nurture this trust? What can be done to meet the expectations of our people in an increasingly complex world we are living in today? We have seen how trust has broken down in other societies leading to the rise of populism. And with social media and the rise of misinformation and alternative facts, sometimes, it is unclear whether the lack of trust in Government is an effect of all these developments or it is the cause for the rise of alternative centres of trust.",19,468,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00468
2020-02-26-T-009,Yaacob Ibrahim,Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar),"Our trust in public institutions in Singapore such as our hospitals, our schools, our courts and security agencies are indeed very high.

We trust that these institutions will do what is right and just.",20,469,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00469
2020-02-26-T-009,Yaacob Ibrahim,Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar),"Similarly, as we digitalise our society, trust that these technologies will be used correctly is important. There are ethical issues associated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the use of machine learning algorithms. Can we trust that these technologies will be deployed in a manner that preserves the best interest of Singaporeans? Just like the guidelines for the use of AI which have been released by MCI in Davos earlier this year, perhaps there is a need for a community wide conversation on how these technologies should be deployed. Should we not consider the creation of an independent Digital Commission that looks at these concerns from all sides dispassionately. Just like the trust we have in our other public institutions, should we not consider similar public institutions that can build trust in our people in dealing with these new technologies?",21,470,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00470
2020-02-26-T-009,Yaacob Ibrahim,Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar),"Sir, I raise these concerns and suggestions out of the belief that continuing digitalisation of our economy and society is a good thing but we cannot avoid the nagging concerns of privacy and transparency that digitalisation will bring. If we do not deal with this early, then trust in Government can be eroded. I hope creating an independent Digital Commission to look at these issues can help address these concerns. When human biomedical research raised some concerns, we created the Bioethics Advisory Committee to advise Government on these matters. It is time we have a similar committee for the digital revolution.",22,471,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00471
2020-02-26-T-009,Yaacob Ibrahim,Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar),"Sir, the COVID-19 challenge will pass as other viruses infections have gone in the past. How this challenge will unfold is unclear. But given recent reports of infections in South Korea, Italy and Iran and the warning raised by the US health authorities, it will be sometime before this is over. Our own teams in Singapore have assured us that we are ready with new measures if the situation worsens. Our best response is to continue to be vigilant, practise the proposed hygiene practices and make it our way of life and look out for one another in this difficult time.",23,472,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00472

2020-02-26-T-009,Yaacob Ibrahim,Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar),"After SARS, the then Ministry for Community Development and Sports proposed the Fabric of the Nation project. As a nation, including our then Prime Minister Mr Goh Chok Tong and his wife, we stitched together patches of fabric to symbolise the coming together of people from all walks of life in overcoming that challenge together. Today, that Fabric of the Nation hangs quietly in the lobby of MSF, a reminder of who we are as a people in times of crisis.",25,474,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00474

2020-02-26-T-009,Yaacob Ibrahim,Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar),"I would add one more change and that is of our attitude towards those at the frontline in fighting this challenge. Someone has to keep Singapore clean, keep our transport system moving, ensure there is enough supplies in our markets and supermarkets, and attend to those who are sick and unwell as we battle this crisis. These are our fellow Singaporeans and workers who put their lives on the line for the sake of Singapore. They too have families anxious for the safety of their parents, siblings and loved ones either here or elsewhere. I am heartened by the responses of Singaporeans towards those at the frontline in this challenge.",27,476,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00476

The kindness and generosity we have seen to our frontline workers should be something history will remember us not just for this moment in our history but for defining who we are as a people. The dignity of every worker, no matter their occupation and station in life, must forever be maintained and cherished by all of us. Let us show to the world that these attitudes and behaviours are not a flash in the pan, but an integral part of our way of life. This is the legacy I hope we can bestow to succeeding generations that out of this moment in our history our better half triumphed over the other half and it became part of our enduring character.

2020-02-26-T-009,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Concern one  an extended COVID-19 outbreak scenario. Not unexpectedly, the top-of-mind concern of Singaporeans is the ""what-if"" scenario of a longer-drawn COVID-19 outbreak leading to an extended global and local economic downturn. Many people are relieved and thankful that Government acted swiftly to delay the expected GST increase and boldly decided on a larger than expected budget deficit. But even with Deputy Prime Minister's recent public assurance that Government is prepared to do more if warranted, many people are nonetheless still worried about how long the Government will be able to sustain deficits of such a large quantum. What will an extended Stabilisation and Support package look like? How will it be funded if the impact is even more broad-based than the tourism, the retail and the transport sectors directly hit by the outbreak; when supply chain continues to be disrupted; when consumer sentiments and demands continue to decline and companies start to shed their local manpower? The anxiety is real and I seek Deputy Prime Minister's insights on this concern.",6,484,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00484

However, actions and results too, lag aspirations and SMEs continue to be challenged, as observed by Singapore Business Federation (SBF) in December 2019.

Some are asking for administration of Budget measures to be more expedient and some ask for the extension of measures such as job support to be extended to six months.

2020-02-26-T-009,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"How can Government and the rest of Singapore better support and uplift the vulnerable amongst us? Can more resources be invested to deep-dive and study their needs, create a spectrum of more suitable jobs and have more effective job placements? Can there be a more impactful and lasting way of signposting to guide them or even to create a jobs clearing house of sorts? For the disabled, which thankfully due to Government’s eyeballing and ground advocacy, things are improving but I feel it is still not enough. Is there a way by which the SkillsFuture movement can include them in a more substantive and systemic way?",14,492,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00492
2020-02-26-T-009,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Concern four  income inequality. Income inequality is a hot topic for many societies including Singapore. It is indeed good news that our Department of Statistics reported that household income inequality as in 2019 was at its lowest in almost two decades, with a lower gini coefficient of 0.452 versus 0.458 the year before; and even lower at 0.398 after adjusting for Government transfers such as Workfare and GST rebates.",15,493,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00493

Research shows that innovators, investors and high-skilled IT workers benefit the most in the future economy; and the rest of the population may be at risk of being left out.

But this is such an important topic. It still calls for a deeper dive, I believe, to remove the income inequality that will surely arise from the advent of technology. So, that is concern four on income inequality.",19,497,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00497
2020-02-26-T-009,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"My last concern in this speech is  SG Together. I wish to cover the important Singapore Together, or the SG Together, movement – a brainchild of Deputy Prime Minister Heng, and very typical of his style – at least to me – of listening and engaging others, including those not in the Cabinet or the Government. The Deputy Prime Minister, in January 2020, called SG Together the ""new cornerstone of nation building"" – a new model of partnership between Government and Singaporeans in owning, shaping and acting on our future to expand what is called the ""democracy of deeds"".",20,498,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00498

Can we deploy more of the best brains to the ground and develop their execution muscles? I remember the days when I was starting a leadership training firm in China many years ago and I failed miserably at the start. The business only took off after I sent my best top staff to China and when I regularly worked with my PRC team on the frontlines. There ought to be a strategy to change the way the Government views and deploys its best. Station them on the ground to learn, to facilitate, to forge alliances through personally experiencing the challenges on the frontlines. Similarly, the Government should be bold enough to appoint good mid-career practitioners to leadership positions in Public Service – offer them a bridging learning stint if need be. That may make a big difference in the complexion and the DNA of SG Together.",26,504,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00504

2020-02-26-T-009,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"In the illustration given in the Budget Annex, a retiree couple, both 65 years old, had only $570 a month in total to support their retirement needs, pre-Budget 2020. That is about $285 per retiree. A single person on the ComCare Long Term Assistance Scheme receives $600 a month for basic living expenses. There is no way for this couple to survive on $570 a month. The illustration went on to state that this couple has to supplement their retirement needs with family support and their own savings. What if this couple does not have family support and savings?",2,510,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00510
2020-02-26-T-009,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"There was a study released by two professors last year in which an elderly person aged 65 and above would need at least $1,379 a month to sustain a basic standard of living.

2020-02-26-T-009,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"With the CPF system being the bedrock of our retirement plans, the Government expects seven-in-10 active CPF members from the 2021 and 2022 cohorts to be able to set aside their Basic Retirement Sum (BRS). That would mean that 30% of the members in these cohorts would not be able to live on their CPF payouts alone when they reach their Payout Eligibility Age (PEA) in 10 years’ time.",4,512,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00512
2020-02-26-T-009,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),But the more concerning part of the numbers highlighted in the Budget Annex is the six-in-10 CPF members who could not meet their BRS a decade ago. Some of these Singaporeans are on the old Retirement Sum Scheme and would have reached their PEA by now. I have met such members who are receiving less than $300 a month in CPF payouts. Some are still working as they do not have extended families or children to support them.,5,513,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00513
2020-02-26-T-009,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"So, for those with little or no savings for retirement, the measures announced in Budget 2020 should go some way to alleviate their hardship and uncertainty. The couple illustrated in the Annex at the beginning of my speech would receive $1,400 monthly, post-Budget 2020. Although this is a more meaningful payout per month, at $700 per retiree, it is still predicated on additional family support and their own savings, something policy makers should not presume when formulating policies on retirement adequacy.",6,514,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00514

2020-02-26-T-009,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"A number of my residents were shut out of the Silver Support Scheme when it was introduced in 2015 as they had more than $70,000 in their CPF at age 55. Many of them wondered how long does the Government expect $70,000 in total CPF contributions at age 55 to last when housing alone would have taken a big chunk of it, if not all of it away? And these people would share that they were low-wage earners to begin with and were living paycheck to paycheck with little savings. Some of them would not qualify for the scheme as they are gainfully employed but homeless children are still living with them, for whatever reasons. The enhancements to the Silver Support Scheme is certainly a welcome move for elderly Singaporeans in these difficult times.",9,517,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00517

2020-02-26-T-009,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Would it not make more sense for the Government to avail these vouchers for all the mom-and-pop shops instead, so as to help these small businesses tide over this difficult period at the same time? The $16 million budgeted for the scheme would go a long way to help these local provision shops but it would only be a drop in the ocean for the three big supermarkets combined. NTUC Fairprice alone had reported a group revenue of $3.45 billion for FY2018.",12,520,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00520

This is a topic very close to my heart. This year, the expenditure for Social and Family Development is expected to increase by 8.5% to $3.3 billion. Our Social Service Offices (SSO) play an important role in coordinating social assistance for needy residents. Most vulnerable households face multiple problems. They need help with their finances, job seeking, family relationship problems, health issues, care for their children, elderly or disabled family members. Living from hand to mouth, struggling to just make it through the day, it is daunting for them to figure out where to ask for help, let alone approach different Government agencies. It is very helpful that SSO, the coordinating body, provides them with the necessary guidance and help, such as job matching and linking them up with the relevant Government assistance schemes and services and voluntary welfare organisations.",3,592,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00592

This is labour-intensive work and, not surprisingly, our SSOs are very much stretched in terms of resources, specifically manpower. This makes it hard for them to follow up with individuals or families to see if they are doing fine after help has been rendered and the cases considered closed. Many social workers and case officers would definitely want to follow up to ensure their cases are okay because, in reality, there are always lingering or recurring problems which pop up as this vulnerable segment goes through the different stages in their recovery or relapse.

Doing a longer and more thorough follow-up is the real challenge. Our social workers and officers need time to build rapport with these families and establish trust. Over a long period, with greater and deeper understanding of their cases, they could be more effective at proposing more long-term solutions and detecting other underlying or potential problems. This is very important, particularly where children or the elderly are involved. These are two groups of people who may not be able to articulate their problems or speak up for themselves. Protecting and helping children is one of the most important things we should do because we want to enable them to grow up into healthy and well-adjusted individuals who can take care of themselves, break out of the poverty cycle and become contributing members of our community.",5,594,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00594

He visits individuals and families in distress, patiently talks to them and understands their issues, then works with our SSO, various Government agencies and voluntary welfare organisations to ensure these families receive holistic help. After a couple of months of the case closing, he will get in touch with the families to ensure all is well. This goes on till he is confident that the family is alright. If something has gone wrong mid-way, he will work with SSO again.",7,596,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00596

If this follow-up portion can be delegated to people like Mr Ho, someone who loves people, enjoys working with people and who has such invaluable experience and, if a system can be put in place, the SSO officers can be freed up to do the earlier coordination and intervention work. Sir, in Mandarin.",8,597,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00597

2020-02-26-T-009,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"One of the measures to push more people to buy electric vehicles (EVs) is the introduction of the EV Early Adoption Incentive. This is a 45% rebate on the Additional Registration Fee (ARF), capped at $20,000.",3,601,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00601
2020-02-26-T-009,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Sir, I would like to highlight that while the $20,000 is generous, I feel it may not be sufficient to push more people to buy EVs. A comparison of the price of EV versions with ICE or hybrid versions of the same car model shows that EV versions currently sells at a significant premium to their ICE or hybrid equivalent. This is mainly because lithium ion batteries are very expensive. Moreover, costs incurred by car distributors to bring in EV models are spread over a small number of cars, thus increasing the per car costs. For instance, a Hyundai Ioniq Electric currently sells for $152,000, a premium of $44,000 over its hybrid sibling.",4,602,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00602
2020-02-26-T-009,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"The story is the same for plug-in hybrids which allow charging as a source of energy. A Volvo S60 plug-in hybrid sells for $265,000, a whopping $90,000 over its normal S60 equivalent.",5,603,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00603

2020-02-26-T-009,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Mr Speaker, another area which I think we have look at is to push local car distributors to bring in more EV and plug-in hybrid models. While car manufacturers have introduced more car models with cleaner engine technologies, local distributors have been slow to bring them in. For instance, Volkswagen has an EV version of its Golf, called the e-Golf, but it is not available here. The story is the same for Japanese cars. Honda has a very cute EV called Honda E, again, not sold here.",7,605,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00605

Unfortunately, none of them brings in an EV or plug-in hybrid model.",8,606,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00606
2020-02-26-T-009,Yee Chia Hsing,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Sir, unless we can make car distributors bring in more EV models, our push towards EV is doomed to fail.

Last year, we started to develop our BCP framework in accordance with international standards, that is, ISO 22301, to ensure that the plans are objectively consistent, credible and viable. In addition to the operational benefits this will yield, on a psychological level, this will inspire confidence in our residents that their needs will continue to be taken care of during a crisis.",7,618,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00618

This can be done by providing matching grants to businesses when they give discount vouchers to consumers. Sir, many customers are concerned with the situation and choose to stay at home. This has caused many businesses to hemorrhage money as there are significant overhead costs. To keep our businesses afloat, it is important that measures which incentivise consumers to consume are implemented.

I believe these families must be recognised and supported, and to this, I make two suggestions. First is, if they are put to expense because of these deployment requirements, then I think it is only fair for them to be recompensed. One example is if they have to cancel a travel arrangement because leave had to be cancelled. Alternatively, if there had to be some care arrangement, like for example, Mdm Jorah's husband is stroke-ridden and she had to make arrangements so that he could be taken care of while she goes back to the clinic.

The Deputy Prime Minister said and I quote, ""The Government is placing a significant bet on EVs."" Deputy Prime Minister Heng does not seem to me like a betting person, but may I please ask what is the basis of optimism over EVs as opposed to HFCVs? Also, what kind of infrastructural development is required to achieve the aim of 28,000 charges by 2030? Do we need to build more substations, for example? What is the expected cost? Would there be cost recovery from users and if so, how do you do so?",14,647,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00647
2020-02-26-T-009,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"I wish to share one point though from personal experience. There is a potential for municipal issues to creep in during the transition period when you convert parking lots for ICE cars to EVs. I have dealt with situations where there have been complaints that EVs take the more accessible parking lots as opposed to ICE cars. So, sometimes, there is scope for such complaints to come up.

I appreciate that fuel excise duties generate revenue and are also imposed to discourage excessive driving. It also has another element  it promotes less pollution. So, I take it that in relation to this lump sum tax that the Deputy Prime Minister contemplates to impose, at least there will be certain savings for EV users because it promotes less pollution.

The observations that were shared were that it was very comprehensive, that it deals with ""live"" issues on the ground, particularly the fears of mid-career workers, cost of living, and of course, the economic challenge posed by COVID-19.",17,650,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00650
2020-02-26-T-009,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"This reflects the extent of consultation that Deputy Prime Minister Heng and his colleagues engaged with people on the ground. I understand from his speech that about 1,000 leaders from different parts of society were engaged and their ideas were incorporated in this Budget. Truly, this is a ""Unity"" Budget from conception.",18,651,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00651
2020-02-26-T-009,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),The $106-billion expenditure is a headline grabber. I do not recall many other Budgets crossing this $100-billion mark. But we were able to do it without drawing our Reserves. Mr Liang Eng Hwa highlighted this point in his speech and he highlighted that the prudent expenditure policy of the Government helped in this regard.,19,652,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00652
2020-02-26-T-009,Murali Pillai,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"But one thing which I thought is worth highlighting is that over the years, this Government had been making a heavy investment to grow the collective capabilities of our people and this in turn allowed us to achieve the real income growth as well as the economic growth. As a result, operating revenue actually went up. I checked the figures. At the start of the term of Government this year, it was about $64 billion. Now, it is about $75 billion. So, that is real growth resulting in revenue increase and I laud the Government for that. With that, I end my speech.",20,653,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00653

2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Speaker, Budget 2020 is a balanced Budget with a two-pronged approach. There is a clear short-term focus on fighting the impact of COVID-19. This takes the form of protecting local jobs, lowering corporate cost structures and household stimuli to mitigate the worries concerning the day-to-day expenses. Structural transformation of the workforce continues to be the mid-term focus. It is important that even in the midst of a crisis, we must not lose perspective of the future. By recovering faster than the rest, we can leverage on a stronger headstart. In the long-term, not to mention, the efforts focused on climate change.",1,655,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00655
2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Speaker, I will focus on three topics.",2,656,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00656
2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),The first topic is on help for businesses. Businesses are the bread and butter of our nation. The Deputy Prime Minister is right to address the immediate cash flow needs of businesses and wages are a big part of this. The Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) will certainly help to encourage enterprises to retain their local employees during this period of uncertainty.,3,657,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00657
2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I have two concerns. Eligible employees will receive the payment by 31 July 2020 for wages paid out from the months of October to December 2019. Can this duration be shortened? Otherwise it is almost half a year from now, which may not come in time for SMEs facing liquidity challenges. I urge for efforts to be made to prioritise payouts to companies whose finances are in poorer shape.",4,658,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00658
2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Another concern is the period that we are basing the wages off. Let us say an employer has hired an employee through the months of October to December. He lays off the said employee in March. I assume he will still receive his JSS payout. However, does that not defeat the primary purpose of this scheme, which is employee retention? Ultimately, helping businesses is also indirectly helping employees, so I am still glad that there is this scheme. Nevertheless, I hope the Ministry will consider the efficacy and timing issues of such disbursements to ensure they achieve maximum intended results.",5,659,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00659
2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Next, property tax rebates have been a common offering in Budgets in times of uncertainty. While the intention is for commercial landlords to pass on the savings to their tenants, this is not guaranteed. Time is needed for landlord-tenant discussions to take place and then the administrative work involved to update the tenancy terms. Has any outreach been done in the past years to determine how much of the savings from the rebates are passed on to the tenants? Moreover, I think we can consider increasing the quantum of property tax rebates if the economy is projected to undergo a U-shaped or a slightly deeper U-shaped recovery.",6,660,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00660
2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In light of the difficulties experienced across many sectors, we have to ensure that the continued shift away from employment of foreign workers is also conducted in a sustainable manner. This is especially so for sub-sectors or firms which (a) have a high reliance on foreign workers, (b) are facing external headwinds from the earlier global economic tensions, and (c) are now further burdened by COVID-19 pressure on margins.",7,661,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00661
2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),Will it be possible to introduce a waiver of the Foreign Worker Levy for the five directly affected sectors as well as other industries which are not doing so well? I also hope more can be done to support sectors directly affected by COVID-19.,8,662,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00662
2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"An example is the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme which was introduced to the tourism industry. Can we also consider this for the other four directly affected sectors? I observe that the current measures are focused on retention and re-training of workers. But if the business fails to pick up or if businesses are unable to revise their business model, it is only a matter of time before they have little choice but to let go of workers.",9,663,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00663
2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Deputy Prime Minister, in the alternate worse-case scenario of a protracted global pandemic situation, can you share with us if we have enough to undertake an off Budget package if needed to help businesses and workers?",10,664,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00664
2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Speaker, my second topic is on targeted assistance for those in the 40s and 50s group. I was extremely delighted to hear the Deputy Prime Minister mention in the Budget that he has introduced a SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package for locals in their 40s and 50s to help them stay employable and move on to new jobs or new roles. The Deputy Prime Minister has highlighted the aim to double the annual job placement of locals in their 40s and 50s to around 5,500 by the year 2025 via increasing the capacity of re-skilling programmes such as the Professional Conversion Programme under the Adapt and Grow initiative, plus other sector-specific and career transition programmes. I am in this 40 to 50 age group, so I hopefully will benefit from some of this.",11,665,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00665
2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"It is good to know also that employers will be supported to recruit, retain and re-train our local mid-career workers, so I strongly support the effort to increase the capacity of re-skilling programmes such as the Professional Conversion Programme by 2025. This, in my view, is pertinent, because a skills-restructuring exercise is very important for Singapore in this transition phase that we are facing. So, can we hasten and intensify the efforts on this and to focus a bit more to provide more targeted help for those who are in their 40s and 50s and provide incentives for companies to absorb more of them into the Professional Conversion Programmes, which we already had, but we can actually widen a bit more and focus them in a faster way.",12,666,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00666
2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Many existing SkillsFuture programmes require employees to be employed and nominated by their employers. For those who are not employed by a participating company, they sign up and hope they are shortlisted. As with the typical job applications, there is no guarantee. It is not unreasonable to believe most companies will put their interests before anything else and that could mean choosing an applicant who is perceived to have greater potential, someone with better qualifications, younger and so on. This may result in the more vulnerable groups, the ones who need the training and re-skilling most, left in the lurch.",13,667,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00667
2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Last year, I proposed in my Adjournment Motion to the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) and MOM to enhance the Capability Transfer Programme (CTP) to incentivise companies to train more of their local workforce by sending them for training overseas or have them trained under a foreign specialist with the aim of transferring or sharing the new job scope. Companies should build their 40s to 50s Singaporean Core through this programme. Their experience in the workforce along with excellent work ethics make them exemplary employees to invest resources in. I hope this can still be considered by the Government, going forward.",14,668,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00668
2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"COVID-19 also underscores the vulnerability of income sustainability for 40 to 50s gig and contract workers. Freelancers across various industries are also affected, from trainers whose class attendances are slashed, to event organisers, emcees, photographers whose events are cancelled and so on. If COVID-19's impact lasts longer than projected, a second round of stimulus may be required to provide more direct help to these individuals.",15,669,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00669
2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Regardless, job retrenchment and job transitions are inevitable. Besides current measures, how can we better support in these situations? How do we develop our people so they seize opportunities in this fast-changing economy? For every success story of someone who discovered their new calling, there are others who feel discouraged from months of seeking.",16,670,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00670
2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Speaker, my third topic – cost of living. Cost of living is a perennial concern even amongst middle-class Singaporeans. Over the years, the Government has come up with new measures, raised income ceilings, provided relief to the sandwiched middle-class who have children and elderly to take care of. But in this climate of uncertainty, the current measures may be insufficient.",17,671,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00671

2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"One major concern is inflation. Singapore imports more than 90% of our food. Climate change and natural disasters around the world threaten our food security. With demand exceeding supply, this drives up food prices everywhere. Since 2013, food prices have gone up by about 10%, while 2019 saw the fastest increase in food prices in a decade. COVID-19 brings about many knock-on effects. With the Singapore dollar hitting a three-year low against the US dollar and weakening against regional currencies, costs of our imports will go up. Shipping costs too are going up due to logistical difficulty in shipping out supplies from China. And with sudden waves of COVID-19 infection in certain countries resulting in city lockdowns, people are panicking and stockpiling food and necessities. I fear this may also contribute to further price increases in our food and essentials.",19,673,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00673
2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In a typical middle income family, both husband and wife work, so most Singaporeans would dine out and order delivery. Higher rentals and labour costs as well as increased water and electricity bills, have all led to increased operating costs. With prices of food and food services going up, a typical sandwiched middle income family can certainly feel the pinch from feeding their children, especially those with larger families.",20,674,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00674
2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Many parents have shared with me that one of their greatest concerns is paying for their children's tertiary education. So, Primary and Secondary education in Singapore are indeed extremely affordable, but the same cannot be said for Universities and Polytechnics, where tuition fees and textbooks are hefty. There are bursaries and scholarships, both from the Government and community, but availability and eligibility are limited.",21,675,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00675
2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Healthcare too is a natural concern. Today's sandwiched generation are worried about the healthcare costs of their elderly parents. Despite all the existing measures and schemes to keep healthcare costs affordable even for the very poor, it is apparent that healthcare costs will keep going up with the increased demand for better-skilled healthcare workers and medical equipment and pricing power of the pharmaceutical companies.",22,676,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00676
2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"So, the announced $1.6 billion Care and Support Package provides assurance and support to Singaporean households during this period of uncertainty, by helping to defray some of their household expenses via various cash outlays, special workfare payments and others. So, it is a substantial amount for a large number of Singaporeans.",23,677,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00677
2020-02-26-T-009,Saktiandi Supaat,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"But beyond these, can the Government share how it will mitigate rising living costs or the perception of it, so that Singaporeans will feel assured to build and grow their families? One avenue that comes to mind is to ensure that we have adequate measures for a start to monitor as a whole-of-Government to ensure prices of food, necessities and energy-related products do not see profiteering and asymmetric price adjustments that could affect general households during periods of crisis or shocks. The asymmetric price adjustments is quite key because sometimes, you adjust prices lower and sometimes, you adjust prices higher. But typically, when you adjust prices lower, energy companies tend to take a lag effect. So, besides the MTI-related workgroup and committees, CASE and Competition Commission of Singapore (CCCS) looking at profiteering, can we set up a single enforcement unit to address profiteering and price adjustment asymmetries in a more sustained manner or embed it more explicitly to address inefficient pricing practices within the CCCS mandate?

A sector is more viable if the companies actively steer industry development.  Some industries have yet to come up with compelling visions, despite the additional help that the Government has provided to TACs. Without a compelling vision, Singaporeans will struggle to identify meaningful paths for upskilling within those sectors. If things do not move in some of these sectors, I hope the existing companies and Government can partner to create alternative TACs to drive industry development. Too many jobs, especially from mid-career Singaporeans, are at risk if we do not do this transformation well.",28,714,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00714

These include the construction, engineering services, healthcare, social work, which usually face difficulty recruiting Singaporeans. Companies can tap on MOM's many excellent initiatives to attract Singaporeans. I also hope that affected Singaporeans will also keep an open mind for these jobs. Yes, career transitions are hard.

Today, employers can already enjoy short-term flexibility in meeting foreign workforce criteria under the Capability Transfer Programme and the Lean Enterprise Development Scheme. At a structural level, too, we recognise the differing appeal of sectors. In the construction sector, out of 100 employees, up to 87 can be foreigners, of which 15 can be S Pass holders, even after the changes kick in by 2023. A company in the services sector of the same size can have up to 35 foreign employees, of which 10 can be S Pass holders starting from January 2021.",15,768,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00768

Which sub-sector or occupation will accept having more restrictions compared to others that have less? Looking at it from a different lens, which local employees would feel it is fair that their employers need not worry or try as hard to improve job quality to retain them because of more access to foreigners? Consider the longer term, too. Can we be so sure that foreigners will always accept the work conditions our own people find unappealing or that will they not find better jobs back home in time to come?",16,769,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00769

Employers, too, can help themselves by enhancing job quality and widening the pool of potential recruits.

Bedding was changed so that it takes 20% less time to tidy up each room. A new vacuuming system has halved the time to get the job done.

In fact, we had discussed this in Parliament extensively in May 2017. Countries with unemployment insurance typically have persistently high unemployment. In contrast, Singapore has consistently had full employment. Willingness to pay for unemployment insurance is not the same as most people do not expect to need it and also have other buffers, for example, a working spouse or child. While we keep an open mind on unemployment insurance, we should also be aware of its serious downsides, such as reducing employers' willingness to pay retrenchment benefits.",8,782,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00782

The Government directly subsidises a very wide range of training programmes, up to 90% in some instances. To fund the unsubsidised portion of reskilling or self-improvement courses, Singaporeans have access to workplace sponsorships and schemes, such as SkillsFuture, Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidy and the Workfare Training Support. At present, it does not appear that the lack of funds is a significant barrier. As Ms Sylvia Lim herself has also acknowledged, we are redoubling support to both employers and individuals.

Can the applicant ask for waiver from the National Electronic Medical Record sharing, quoting Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) rights, to avoid detection?

While we agree that we should always put Singaporeans first and give them the best possible opportunities, but we know that there are jobs out there that are really challenging to find locals to take on. An example of healthcare-related jobs are pharmacy technicians, whose service is required 24/7, including public holidays and weekends. Although we have Polytechnics that specialise in training and educating diploma holders to support this pipeline of pharmacy technicians, most of our youngsters aspire to take on higher qualifications after their graduation, leaving a constant vacuum in the system.

I understand where she is coming from, but can I just say that at today's stage of development for Singapore, especially when it comes to seeking productivity improvements and finding manpower savings in the Services sector, we have gone far beyond the idea of simply automating things. It is a much more sophisticated approach towards becoming more manpower-lean. I shared earlier the examples of hotels.

I give you an example. In manufacturing, I visited a company making noodles. They make hokkien noodles that we eat, they make kuay teow that we also eat. So, I asked them, ""Where are you finding business opportunities?"" And they told me that one of the things that they discovered was that in F&B outlets, quite often, two staff spend two hours every day doing one thing  portioning out noodles that were delivered to the outlet in 3-kg packs into smaller portions of 150 grams. Why? Because at peak hours, when the customers start arriving in the restaurant in droves, you have no more time to do portioning. You must be able to cook very quickly. So, what do the restaurants do? They get two workers standing there – maybe around 10 o'clock, nine o'clock – and for two hours, they do nothing but portion out the noodles.",2,837,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00837

Stock-taking	– the customer does not care about you taking stock, taking note of inventory. So, we have gone far beyond automation. There are so many more things that we can do. And credit to the businesses – they are much more creative. I just want to share that with you.

2020-02-26-T-009,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"The current COVID-19 public health situation has been a very challenging one. Our daily work routines are drastically changed and remote interactions and communication have replaced physical interactions or face-to-face communication. However, with every challenge comes an opportunity for us to learn and initiate and embrace change.",22,892,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00892
2020-02-26-T-009,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"Flexi-work provisions, arrangement and support have been extensively rolled out during this period. We find that even with some initial inconveniences, we are able to work remotely, flexibly and still fulfil our daily work or meet our daily business targets, with some creative provisions and solutions, to ensure business and work continuity. Flexi-work is not too diﬃcult to implement after all. Necessity is truly the mother of all inventions.",23,893,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00893

Just as we trust our workers and staﬀ to work remotely or on a flexible work arrangement during this period, we must continue to trust them to give the same amount of commitment and eﬀort when the worst is over.",24,894,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00894
2020-02-26-T-009,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"In addition, as I have mentioned in my Budget speech last year, flexi-work arrangements can provide for better employment opportunities for persons with disabilities or special needs to work from home or to gradually adjust to their work environments and work commitments at a pace they are comfortable with. Being gainfully employed and being able to be remunerated for doing meaningful work is a start in helping persons with disabilities or special needs live independently like many others and it accords suﬃcient opportunities to develop that much-needed self belief and self dignity. Hence, I urge employers and companies to carry on with their flexi-work arrangements that we already have in place now during the current COVID-19 public health situation so that our society, communities and workplaces can be a lot more inclusive, especially for those who are less privileged or who face more challenges in life.",25,895,2020-02-26-T-009-S-00895

2020-02-26-T-011,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Last year, I asked for mental health to be a whole-of-Government priority. It was unintentionally prescient then to see this in action now with the multi-Ministry task force set up to tackle the COVID-19 outbreak. The psychology of our people became more than a priority for the Government to understand so as to manage the panic buying, hoarding and shunning of healthcare workers – all coping mechanisms to deal with underlying fear and anxiety. Research studies have found that these deficiencies of community resilience can be caused by poor mental health, leading affected communities to be less cohesive, adaptive and more vulnerable to shocks and disruption.",2,902,2020-02-26-T-011-S-00902

2020-02-26-T-011,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"As a nation, we clearly struggle with mental health. There has been a steady increase in the lifetime prevalence of mental illness in Singapore over two decades – 10% or more when it was first tracked in 1998 and 2007, to 12% in 2010 and now 13.9%. To put into perspective, which I also did last year to limited success apparently, the prevalence for diabetes in Singapore was 8.6% in 1992, peaked at 11.3% in 2010 and has seen remarkable improvements since the ""war on diabetes"", decreasing to 8.8% today. As one doctor shared with me  ""Until the Government starts taking the stand that mental health is as important as diabetes, there is a limit to what individual organisations can accomplish"".",5,905,2020-02-26-T-011-S-00905

In fact, the Health Minister has previously shared in this House that we only spent 3% of our healthcare operating expenditure in FY2017 on mental health compared to 11% for diabetes. Under our FY2020 expenditure estimates for healthcare, there are only three expenditure items targeted to support mental health. In comparison, many other developed countries such as New Zealand, Scotland, Iceland, Finland, Canada, Norway and Australia have identified mental health as a budget priority with significant resources dedicated to support mental well-being in their societies.",6,906,2020-02-26-T-011-S-00906
2020-02-26-T-011,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Sir, at this juncture, Members may think that I am recycling my speech from last year but let me assure you that I am not, although that would be clearly so much easier for this part-time Nominated Member of Parliament with no institutional support! Last year, I shared the mental health struggles of those near and dear to me including my own close shave with depression more than a decade ago. Perhaps, these sharings did not seem substantive or representative enough to persuade our policy-makers. So, earlier this year, my amazing team of volunteers and I decided to launch the first-ever public consultation on mental health in Singapore. Rudimentary it may be – given less-than-limited resources – we were surprised and heartened by the more than 400 responses received from Singaporeans, 70% with lived experiences whilst the rest from care-givers and mental healthcare professionals! Many of these personal stories are heart wrenching – we even ended up doing ""case work"" with some! But since personal stories did not seem to move policy-makers last year, I decided I will focus this year’s speech on where we are falling short in the specific areas of affordability, accessibility and quality in mental healthcare and concrete urgent actions that I hope Deputy Prime Minister and relevant Ministers will take.",7,907,2020-02-26-T-011-S-00907
2020-02-26-T-011,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"First, on affordability. It broke my heart when I read one respondent ""having to starve to afford therapy"". At least 10 respondents shared they stopped seeking help because of financial struggles. Sixty-six percent of the respondents shared that mental healthcare costs were high, with more than half of them being users of public healthcare services. How is it that our world-class healthcare system has denied so many people the mental healthcare that they need?",8,908,2020-02-26-T-011-S-00908
2020-02-26-T-011,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Sir, you may not know that as much as a seven-time difference still exists between MediSave and MediShield Life limits imposed on treatment for physical health versus mental health conditions. A respondent shared, I quote, ""I paid over $10,000 total [purely] for inpatient care after deduction of MediSave and MediShield Life for the past two years"", even after ""opt[ing] for class B2 and C wards to save costs"". It is time to remove this entrenched stigma by bringing these limits to parity for both mental and physical health conditions. MediSave should also be allowed for services at Government or quasi-Government-funded community organisations because how can we have a community health approach if it is not?",9,909,2020-02-26-T-011-S-00909
2020-02-26-T-011,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Next, on accessibility. There are around 248 psychiatrists and 473 psychologists practising in Singapore, or 4.4 psychiatrists and 8.3 psychologists per 100,000 population which may explain why the overall median waiting time for new subsidised appointments across the public hospitals is 27 days to see a psychiatrist and 28 days to see a psychologist . Seventy-one respondents also shared that lack of relevant and trusted information was a prohibitive factor against seeking help.",10,910,2020-02-26-T-011-S-00910

CHAT provides a unique combination of  one, free and confidential mental health check service that guarantees data will not be entered into the public health system; and two, care navigation that includes subsidised referral for public mental healthcare services if required. Unfortunately, CHAT currently only serves the youth segment but I hope this model could be adapted and expanded to support all ages.",11,911,2020-02-26-T-011-S-00911

More than 50 respondents, however, indicated grave dissatisfaction with the quality of public mental healthcare. Thirty-six percent explicitly mentioned lack of empathy in the professionals they interacted with and the dismal environment of psychiatric wards in our public hospitals.",12,912,2020-02-26-T-011-S-00912
2020-02-26-T-011,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Mr Deputy Speaker, we are not saying all mental healthcare professionals are incompetent or without heart. In fact, many respondents indicated that the poor quality could be attributed to the excessive workload which strains both professionals and the system. As one respondent puts it, ""While the Government is ostensibly pushing campaigns that aim to reduce the stigma of seeking help for mental health issues, there is a lack of parallel funding for actual mental health services, such as the hiring of more counsellors and mental health professionals"".",13,913,2020-02-26-T-011-S-00913
2020-02-26-T-011,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Twenty-six respondents cited the importance of feedback on treatment to improve their health outcomes.

2020-02-26-T-011,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"The structural and policy issues discussed earlier aim to close the treatment gap. But what if we could reduce the number of people getting ill in the first place? What if we paradigm-shift mental health as a public health issue? What would our policies for mental health promotion and illness prevention look like? Would we then start to ask what are the causes of rising levels of mental distress in childhood that saw calls made by five- to nine-year-olds to SOS Singapore jumped by 500% over a three-year period? And the spike in the number of teenage suicides in 2018? Might we not insist on conducting mental health screening for our students every year, like physical health and dental checks? Will we begin to study the role of social justice, family and schools in mental health so that we can address the underlying social determinants? Will we also start to understand the impact of public policies on the psychological capital of our people and endeavour to create a psychological safety climate for innovation and well-being to flourish that truly binds Singapore Together?",20,920,2020-02-26-T-011-S-00920
2020-02-26-T-011,Anthea Ong,Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member),"Another paradigm shift we urgently need to make, Sir, is the long overdue recognition that mental health is a critical part of total well-being. Mental health is a continuum. It is not ""I'm mentally sick, or I'm not"". It’s not ""I'm over it, or I'm still in it"". It's not ""I got it, I will never get it"". We may think that mental health challenges only affect certain people, or some segments of our society. But if we just pause and have an honest conversation with ourselves, we will realise that we are navigating along this continuum at any point in time through our life. Because who has not suffered a loss? Who has not had a major life transition? Who has not felt overwhelmed with responsibility for another? Who has not been marginalised in some way? Who has not been made to feel like a failure?",21,921,2020-02-26-T-011-S-00921

Why workplace health and safety must be beyond physical health and safety, which I am very happy to note that the Tripartite Oversight Committee on Workplace Health and Safety – of which I declare I am a member of – has started doing good work in this area with employers and employees. Why there is merit in making it explicitly clear to employers that the Sick Leave entitlement for each worker can also be used for mental health treatment and recovery and that mental health insurance is not a luxury but a necessity for employers to support their employees' total health.",23,923,2020-02-26-T-011-S-00923

2020-02-26-T-011,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines),"In Tampines, we have a free bowling programme during the school holidays. We deliberately mix students of different races and schools during the game. One of the girls went home crying because she was afraid and uncomfortable mixing with students she did not know. Her mum took leave to bring her for the next session and shared with her that she will not be able to choose her own Secondary school classmates or work colleagues in future. She told her to try and adapt and she will be there to support her. We watched the girl as she finally enjoyed the company of her lane mates and even forgot about our presence. She just needed the morale booster.",11,942,2020-02-26-T-011-S-00942

2020-02-26-T-011,Cheng Li Hui,Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines),"I witnessed that first-hand in Tampines earlier this month. Just two days after the raising of the DORSCON alert to Orange, and amidst reports of panic buying at supermarkets islandwide, our volunteers continued their monthly food donation drive to help needy residents.

The rest of the family members were quarantined at home. We delivered some daily necessities to the family. I also took the opportunity to visit the other residents in the block.

2020-02-26-T-014,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Singapore established formal diplomatic relations with China on 3 October 1990. We have a close, vital and multifaceted relationship with China involving our leaders, our corporate sector and at the people-to-people level in many fields including education, science and culture. Consequently, we have many frequent high-level exchanges, institutionalised platforms and substantive cooperation all across China. The Government-to-Government projects at the 1994 China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park; the 2008 Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City; and the 2015 Chongqing Connectivity Initiative are icons of success that reflect Singapore's complementary roles at various phases of China's spectacular development.",1,961,2020-02-26-T-014-S-00961
2020-02-26-T-014,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,We share deep economic relations. China has been Singapore's largest trading partner and Singapore has been China's largest foreign investor since 2013.,2,962,2020-02-26-T-014-S-00962
2020-02-26-T-014,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Singapore and China are commemorating the 30th anniversary of Singapore-China diplomatic relations this year in the face of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. China has borne the brunt of the impact of the epidemic. The Singapore Government, our business community, as well as our people have come together to offer support to a friend in need by donating funds, some critically needed test kits and medical supplies to support communities in China which have been severely affected by COVID-19. As of 25 February 2020, the Singapore Red Cross has raised more than S$6 million. This is a reflection of concern for our Chinese friends and our solidarity with China and the international community to fight the virus, understand the disease, and prevent its further spread. We are confident that through close cooperation, Singapore, China, and the international community will ultimately overcome this challenge. I have just returned from attending a Special ASEAN-China Foreign Ministers' Meeting on COVID-19 in Vientiane, Laos where I also had a bilateral meeting with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. He thanked me for Singapore's encouragement and support during this challenging period for China.

2020-02-26-T-018,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Through our consultations, tripartite partners recognise that there is a need to retain the flexibility to renegotiate employment terms, including making salary revisions to reflect the demonstrated performance of the worker. Disallowing downward revisions of salary entirely will leave the employer with no other option except to terminate the employment of a non-performing worker. Furthermore, tripartite partners have an understanding that in certain situations such as an economic downturn, businesses will reach an agreement with their workers on wage flexibility instead of retrenching the workers. Such approaches that cut costs to save jobs would no longer be possible if the Member's suggestion is adopted.",2,984,2020-02-26-T-018-S-00984
2020-02-26-T-018,Josephine Teo,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Given the feedback from tripartite partners, the Ministry has decided to retain the flexibility for employers to revise the salaries of their foreign workers. We will continue to focus on protecting the interests of foreign workers by strongly enforcing against employers who reduce their workers' salaries without their agreement. When there are disputes involving salary reduction, the onus is on the employers to declare and substantiate their reasons for the salary reduction. The Ministry of Manpower's (MOM) actions against errant employers include requiring them to make good any salary shortfall to the workers and imposing a fine of up to $10,000 per worker. In 2019, we imposed a total of $488,000 in administrative financial penalties on 68 employers. MOM also allows such workers to be transferred to a new employer.",3,985,2020-02-26-T-018-S-00985
