2024-01-10-T-001,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in view of the call by the UN Climate Change Conference 2023 (COP28) to accelerate zero and low emission technologies (a) what has been the progress in Singapore to increase renewable energy capacity and to improve the overall rate of energy efficiency; and (b) what are the plans ahead to accelerate towards the COP28 goals.,1,1,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00001
2024-01-10-T-001,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what are the plans for operationalising the UAE Consensus from COP28 including the transition away from fossil fuels to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050; and (b) what is the timetable for this transition in Singapore.,1,2,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00002
2024-01-10-T-001,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment how will Singapore contribute to global efforts agreed at the global stockttake at the 2023 UN Climate Change Conference (COP28) to (i) transition away from fossil fuels to achieve net zero by 2050 in keeping with the science (ii) triple renewable energy capacity globally and double energy efficiency by 2030 and (iii) phase down unabated coal power, reduce methane emissions and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.",1,3,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00003
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,The Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien),"Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to address Question Nos 1, 2 and 3 on today's Order Paper by a combined reply?",1,4,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00004
2024-01-10-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,"Yes, you may. Please proceed.",1,5,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00005
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Thank you. At the UN Climate Change Conference 2023 (COP28), Singapore co-facilitated negotiations on mitigation and the first global stocktake that contributed to the successful adoption of the UAE Consensus. The UAE Consensus calls on countries to transition away from fossil fuels, accelerate the phasedown of unabated coal power, phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies and to triple renewable energy and double energy efficiency globally by 2030, among others.",1,6,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00006
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Singapore supports the UAE Consensus. As part of our Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS), Singapore has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, despite being a small, alternative energy disadvantaged city state with many natural limitations on our climate action measures. Our LEDS is aligned with the UAE Consensus.",2,7,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00007
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Over the past few years, many Members have spoken extensively about the urgent need to address climate change – in particular, during the two climate Motions that have been endorsed by this House, as well as the debate on the Carbon Pricing (Amendment) Bill. I am glad that Members, including those from the Opposition, who advocated for a carbon tax above $100 per tonne, agree that more should be done to support our net-zero goals. We have raised our carbon tax to $25 per tonne from 1 January 2024 and will progressively raise it further, to between $50 and $80 by 2030. Our carbon tax ensures that the negative externalities of carbon emissions are properly priced, and is an effective mechanism to spur economy-wide decarbonisation efforts to achieve our net-zero ambition.",3,8,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00008
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"At COP28, Singapore signed on to the Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency pledge, which is a collective global effort that aims to triple the world's renewable energy generation capacity and double annual energy efficiency by 2030. Singapore has been accelerating our energy transition as part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. We have doubled our solar power deployment since 2021 to over 1,000 megawatt-peak (MWp) currently. We aim to at least double this deployment again, to achieve our target of at least 2,000 MWp by 2030.",4,9,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00009
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We are also partnering like-minded countries to import low-carbon electricity from the region. Last year, the Government issued Conditional Approvals for 4.2 gigawatts of imports from Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam. When implemented by 2035, these projects will meet about 30% of our electricity needs. They will also support our neighbours' development of renewable energy projects and serve as building blocks towards our shared vision of an ASEAN Power Grid.",5,10,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00010
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Beyond solar power and electricity imports, we will need to leverage other energy alternatives to further expand our low-carbon energy capacity. We are working closely with the industry and academia to realise the potential of low-carbon technologies. These include research and development as well as industry projects in areas such as innovative solar power deployment, transport and utilisation of hydrogen and ammonia, carbon capture, utilisation and storage, as well as advanced geothermal energy.",6,11,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00011
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The Government is progressively updating our regulations to facilitate the adoption of these low-carbon alternatives. Last year, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) announced new emissions standards for power generation units, which will require all new generation units to be at least 30% hydrogen-ready by volume, with the ability to be retrofitted to become 100% hydrogen-ready in the future.",7,12,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00012
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In the area of energy efficiency, Singapore's overall energy efficiency is already much better than the global average. According to the International Energy Agency, Singapore's energy intensity in 2019 was almost half that of global energy intensity. This has been achieved through consistent efforts to identify and realise energy efficiency opportunities. For example, the National Environment Agency (NEA) enhanced the Energy Conservation Act in 2017 to require energy-intensive industrial facilities to conduct regular energy efficiency assessments. Another example is the Economic Development Board (EDB)'s Resource Efficiency Grant for Emissions, which supports businesses in improving their energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For households, our Climate Friendly Households Programme continues to help eligible households offset the higher cost of energy-efficient appliances.",8,13,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00013
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Accelerating the energy transition in Singapore will require a whole-of-nation effort. The Government, businesses, communities and individuals must all contribute to this overall goal.",9,14,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00014
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Even so, no country can tackle climate change alone. Despite our natural limitations in size and natural resources, Singapore is committed to do our part as a responsible global citizen and will continue to work with like-minded countries and companies for a cleaner, greener future.",10,15,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00015
2024-01-10-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Liang Eng Hwa.,1,16,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00016
2024-01-10-T-001,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"Thank you, Sir. My first question is, as the Minister was at COP28, I would like to hear from her whether she is satisfied with the overall outcomes of COP28.",1,17,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00017
2024-01-10-T-001,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"The second question is about this call to triple renewable energy capacity and doubling the rate of efficiency by 2030. It is a major undertaking, notwithstanding the plans we have in place. I would like to ask the Minister if Singapore is confident to achieve these goals.",2,18,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00018
2024-01-10-T-001,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"My third question is, in COP28, there were also increasing calls for the use of nuclear energy as one of the renewable sources, with the goal to triple nuclear energy capacity by 2050. I believe there were 20-over countries that came up with a declaration, including the United States (US) and some Asian countries like Japan and Korea. Can I ask the Minister whether this declaration will have any bearing on the Government's position on nuclear energy as another source of renewable energy?",3,19,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00019
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Speaker, with regard to the first question about the overall outcome of COP28, I think we must look at it in the context that it is being held. It is being held in a period where there is high energy inflation, there is also great geopolitical contention. But the fact that all parties were able to come together and again, re-affirm that the UN Climate Change Conference (COP) is the only relevant multilateral platform for climate discussion and negotiations is a major undertaking.",1,20,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00020
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"On top of that, I think there were several improvements and I would say movements in negotiations. Transitioning away from fossil fuels is one major achievement – it is the first time that such language has appeared. But more importantly, it is that with a global stocktake, there was a louder and more concerted call to accelerate action in this decade. Climate projections, temperatures are telling us that we need to do more in the near term. The focus of the global stocktake has been a lot on implementation. What the Member has spoken about – whether it is three times renewable energy capacity, two times on energy efficiency improvements – these are going into the so-called ""nitty gritty"". It is no longer just setting net-zero targets, but, really, what is the pathway to 1.5 °C. There were some very specific recommendations and agreements. I think that is a major achievement of COP28.",2,21,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00021
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"There are many other details. It is a very extensive and comprehensive process, and it does not do justice to the process by just answering supplementary questions. It deserves a much more extensive discussion.",3,22,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00022
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Having said that, I think it is important and useful for Members to also understand that this being a global UN process, we need to pay attention to the language that is being used. Although there is a consensus, the basis of the consensus is still on the basis of the Paris Agreement, where some of the basic values – for example, common but differentiated responsibilities, nationally determined contributions (NDCs), national context – are still relevant.",4,23,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00023
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Where we have goals, such as three times renewable energy capacity, two times energy efficiency improvements, these are global collective measures. The implementation is still dependent on countries incorporating those into their NDCs, taking into consideration their own national context.",5,24,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00024
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"On nuclear energy, that is the same basis. A few countries have a declaration, they have started to look at it separately. These declarations outside the negotiation documents are helpful. Because these are the initiatives that are pushing movements, directions and developments in technologies, in finance and in global action.",6,25,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00025
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"So, we need to look at it in two ways  look at what is happening outside the negotiations, look at what is in the documents and see how Singapore can leverage on some of the developments, such as the development of technology in nuclear energy. This is an area where we have some interest to understand the development, because we think that the advanced nuclear technology offers us some potential. In terms of safety, there is better safety in these technologies, and also, in terms of cost competitiveness. These are two very important metrics that feed into our energy decision.",7,26,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00026
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"We have not made a decision on adopting nuclear energy, but we are building capabilities to understand how these technologies are advancing and also, how these technologies can potentially be of help to Singapore.",8,27,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00027
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,I hope that answers the Member's questions.,9,28,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00028
2024-01-10-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Louis Chua.,1,29,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00029
2024-01-10-T-001,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Just two supplementary questions for the Minister. The first, following up to the previous supplementary question and in relation to my original Parliamentary Question, given that this is the goal that we have, is there any timetable or transitional plan or milestones that we will be setting along the way in order to achieve this in the next couple of decades or so.",1,30,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00030
2024-01-10-T-001,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"The second supplementary question is, the Minister also mentioned at COP28 that we will not be claiming from the Loss and Damage (L&D) Fund. I just wanted to understand whether or not we will be contributing to the L&D Fund today or any time in the future.",2,31,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00031
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"I think I have gone into some extent on how we are progressing on our climate action. In fact, from the Singapore Green Plan that was announced in 2021, we have been updating some of the sub-goals almost annually. Even though there are five pillars and two horizontals, there have been movements on every vertical, every pillar of work that we are doing. I would encourage the Member to watch this space, to give us suggestions as to how we can move further. And I think the Member has the assurance that all the participating Ministries are working flat out towards our net-zero 2050 goals.",1,32,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00032
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"It is by no means easy, given our constraints. In fact, we are looking at some of the alternatives that have yet to come on stream, such as low-carbon hydrogen that is so important in our energy transition but which we are still in the process of developing a viable, commercial market for it. So, do not misunderstand that although there is a lot of effort, there are also many, many challenges. But we are not afraid of challenges, and we will do our very best for climate action and for Singapore's decarbonisation.",2,33,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00033
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"On L&D, can I understand from the Member whether it is the Workers' Party's position that Singapore should contribute and, if so, what would the Member suggest that we contribute?",3,34,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00034
2024-01-10-T-001,Speaker,Mr Speaker,Mr Louis Chua.,1,35,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00035
2024-01-10-T-001,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,"I thank the Minister. I think there was also a related supplementary question that was asked last year. I know that the Minister mentioned that we will be facilitating countries to claim from the L&D fund. But at the same time, in light of what was also shared by my fellow colleague, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, about contributions to international funds and all that, I think we do have a role to play in terms of — we may not be the main contributors to this from the historical context, but I do believe that we do have a part to play in terms of using finance terms, introducing, say, seed funding, to enable people to join in the cause and to show people that, look, even though Singapore is small and resource-constrained, we are also doing our part in that regard.",1,36,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00036
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"I did not get a clear question from the Member because the Workers' Party has been asking us  are we contributing to L&D? So, I just wanted to know whether the Member is asking us to contribute to the L&D funds specifically. But it is okay. I think that our position is quite aligned, that we will do our part in finance.",1,37,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00037
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Senior Minister Teo has announced an initiative called ""FAST-P"" to basically galvanise up to $5 billion in seed funding and also in blended finance to help in climate action. But L&D is very specific. It has a specific purpose – loss and damage. This is where I think countries that are looking to claim are looking for outright grants. So, we believe that we can play a role to facilitate, to develop capabilities, to do technological transfers, and capability and capacity-building.",2,38,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00038
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"That is where Singapore's strength and role as a financial centre can come into play. So, we do not think that our current capacity or resources would be meaningful in contributing grants in L&D, but we definitely will be supporting other developing countries, particularly in the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) grouping, to tap on the L&D fund because they are most badly affected. But if the Member would like to suggest a sum to the Government to contribute to L&D, I would really welcome his suggestion.",3,39,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00039

2024-01-10-T-001,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Mr Speaker, I have three supplementary questions and I thank the Minister for her earlier answers.",1,41,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00041
2024-01-10-T-001,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),My first supplementary question is that Singapore set up the Singapore Pavilion at COP28. Could the Minister share what were the objectives behind the Pavilion and also the cost and resources that were involved in setting up the Pavilion? And how does the Government assess the gains that we have made through the Pavilion and the efforts of our delegation at COP28 in contributing to the agenda and objectives of COP28?,2,42,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00042
2024-01-10-T-001,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"My second supplementary question is that moving forward, what are the Government's shorter-term goal and emphasis in the run-up to the submission of Singapore's first biennial transparency report in 2024 later this year and also as we submit our updated NDC at COP30?",3,43,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00043
2024-01-10-T-001,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Finally, how can Singapore play its part globally or regionally to engage and persuade, by both actions and words, the transition efforts from fossil fuels, including unabated coal power, reducing methane emissions and phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies?",4,44,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00044
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Mr Speaker, I would put through you, to ask the Member to, perhaps, file a separate Parliamentary Question on Singapore Pavilion because, by itself, it is quite a topic and it is not related directly to his question.",1,45,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00045
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Secondly, it is about the biennial transparency report as well as NDC. The preparation is in progress. There is some time for us to do it, until the end of this year. So, I think we are making good progress. Unabated coal, fossil fuel subsidies, as I mentioned in my reply, our LEDS is actually aligned to the UAE Consensus. So, we do not think we need to make major adjustments because it is out of sync or out of place with what has been agreed. So, we will, basically, progress with what we have already planned under the Singapore Green Plan.",2,46,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00046

2024-01-10-T-001,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"I thank the Minister for her comprehensive answer. May I draw the Minister's attention to my speech from the 2022 Budget Debate two years ago where I spoke about Singapore, the climate crisis, our climate ambition and our energy security.",1,48,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00048
2024-01-10-T-001,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"In particular, can I ask the Minister, given the speed of developments in the climate space, including what commentators described as the risk of a climate endgame with catastrophic change upon the world, will Singapore – at a whole-of-Government level – look at moving ahead of the market in certain strategic areas?",2,49,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00049
2024-01-10-T-001,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Two years ago, I had asked about Singapore and a potential position as a hydrogen hub. The Minister mentioned this in her earlier answers. Can I ask  is there a role for us more actively moving ahead of the market in a calibrated way so that we can be the first mover and not last mover or too late to move when the market finally evolves.",3,50,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00050
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"I thank the Member. Indeed, I think this is where our Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) and Ministry of Transport (MOT) folks are working flat out to be ahead but, at the same time, leveraging on the massive investments in R&D that is going into new areas.",1,51,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00051
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"The world is looking for new solutions – solutions in hydrogen and carbon capture, for example, are not an exclusive arena for Singapore.

2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"But there are certain areas that we want to invest in. So, as I have mentioned in my speech, already in our power generation system, we are making provision for hydrogen to be introduced as an alternative fuel.",3,53,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00053
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In the maritime sector, for example, we are also pioneering, with other ports, green shipping with alternative fuels, learning how to handle, store and move new types of fuels.",4,54,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00054
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"So, we are moving in many, many different ways. Even in aviation, a similar undertaking is ongoing to really be at the cusp of change. The change is going to be massive. We will not be alone and we want to really be out there, to be early enough to tap the change and not to be left behind, but at the same time, also capture opportunities that may arise.",5,55,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00055

2024-01-10-T-001,Dennis Tan Lip Fong,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"Regarding my third supplementary question, yes, I did hear the Minister in her original answer. This is regarding the transition efforts from fossil fuel, including unabated coal power, reducing methane emissions and phasing out inefficient fuel subsidies. My supplementary question pertains to us living in an area where our neighbouring countries may use a lot of coal, for example. So, I am asking how Singapore can engage our neighbours or other countries globally by action and words to persuade other countries to journey along this transition as well.",2,58,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00058
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"I thank the Member and would like to commend Mr Dennis Tan for his ambition to have Singapore play a regional and global role in climate action. We will try to do our best by being, I would say, an active partner in global negotiations, as well as propagating, advocating at the regional level. So, whether it is at ASEAN or other regional groupings, we will do our best.",1,59,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00059
2024-01-10-T-001,Grace Fu Hai Yien,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"For example, we bring our climate projections, the 3rd National Climate Change Study (V3), to many of the ASEAN fora, whether it is on agriculture, environment or water. We also bring in finance. Our Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) as well as our banks are working actively to look at how we can have a taxonomy that allows transition energy and transition fuels to be financed so that, as the Member said, neighbouring countries that still have a lot of coal-fired power plants are able to benefit from finance to help them transit.",2,60,2024-01-10-T-001-S-00060

MOH has also received enquiries about transferring cord blood units to another provider. We have engaged the other storage providers, who are prepared to assist. MOH has advised that clients wait for the investigation to complete, likely in a few weeks' time, before deciding whether to do so.

2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Ms Nadia and Ms He probably have in mind a recently reported case where a child from a children's home was sexually abused by a kith caregiver. Kith caregivers are adults who are not related to a child and meet the child through family or community connections, and are not registered as foster parents. I would like to clarify that while the offender and his wife had expressed the desire to adopt the child, they had not taken any steps to start the adoption process. I would also like to clarify that the offender's firm was not working with the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), but directly with the children's home.",1,90,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00090
2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,Ms Nadia asked about the safeguards in the adoption process. The primary consideration when processing applications for adopting children is the child's welfare and best interest of the child. There are various steps in the adoption process to ensure this.,2,91,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00091
2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"During the first stage, prospective adopters must undergo a comprehensive Adoption Suitability Assessment. This is conducted by social service staff from an accredited adoption agency. Prospective adopters are assessed on a range of factors including their ability to provide a protective and nurturing environment, their motivations for adoption, stability of the marital relationship and overall capacity to meet the child's needs. Prospective adopters also undergo screening for risk factors, including criminal records.",3,92,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00092

2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"This incident is very regrettable, and all the professionals and social service workers who have been in contact with the child are shaken. Based on our knowledge, the children's home had made every effort to perform due diligence on persons who have contact with the child and to supervise the contact. The social service professionals had also followed up actively with supervised visitations, check-ins and house visits.",8,97,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00097

2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"We are very grateful to the teacher whom the child confided in. This shows the critical role of having trusted individuals in one's life.

At the same time, we should not let this incident make homes reluctant to work with community partners and volunteers, many who do good work and befriend children and run recreational and other activities for them out of a desire to help the children.

For this particular case, MSF had conducted background checks on the man and his wife before they were identified as caregivers for the child. They had no adverse records.",2,107,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00107
2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Trained professionals had also assessed the couple as capable of providing adequate and safe care for the child.

2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Coming back to volunteers, which was another aspect of the Member's question, I had mentioned before that all volunteers in MSF-funded programmes who have contact with clients, will need to undergo suitability assessments and background checks. These are run by the agencies. So, as part of the suitability assessment, all prospective volunteers must provide information about their areas of interest in volunteering, the skills and expertise that they have to offer, any medical concerns and any prior criminal convictions.",6,111,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00111

2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I had talked about the training that all social service professionals have to undergo. For staff at children's homes, they have to attend compulsory training courses. This include understanding the legal frameworks and the legislation that protect children in state care.

But at the same time, I think it is also a clear reminder to all of us that we have to work with many other community partners, including teachers, because in this case, it was a teacher who reported after the child confided in the teacher.",4,122,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00122

The first is, I think the Minister of State mentioned earlier about the importance that teachers can play in this. I just wanted to know, is there and what is the basic training given to preschool educators and assistants to enable them to recognise these signs? Is there a very general training that is available to these preschool educators to enable them to detect signs and symptoms of abuse in children, given that children of this age are usually less able to articulate or verbalise what is happening to them?",1,126,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00126

I would like to check whether this training that is given to them also includes training about how best they can respond initially to a child coming up to them and telling them potentially that they have been — or recognising that this child might actually be a victim? I am just wondering whether or not there is basic training given to teach them how to respond and how best to first respond to these children, so that these children are not further traumatised or are better protected.",2,127,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00127

So, in the training, we also train our teachers to recognise how children and young persons may respond or show symptoms of such abuse and neglect. For instance, is the child more withdrawn than usual? Are there visible marks on the child? Is the child adverse to physical contact? Are there changes in the child's behaviour? Has the child lost appetite, not interested anymore in the games and the activities that the child used to be interested in?",3,130,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00130
2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Some of our SSAs also use play therapy. We have observed that some of the children, because of their young age, they are not able to verbalise their personal experience, not able to talk about it in first person terms. Instead, they have to use toys, other objects and talk about it from a third-person perspective because that is their way of protecting themselves from further hurt. These are ways that children and young persons can communicate. Our teachers and our social service professionals are made aware and sensitive to the point that children may respond in such ways. So, that is the first point on what we aim to do and continue to try to do through the family and domestic violence awareness training.",4,131,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00131
2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"On the second point, we have a specialised division called the Clinical and Forensic Psychology Services team which provides specialised psychological services to children, youths and their family, and in particular, they have a good understanding of how to understand the profile and needs of children who have undergone trauma and abuse, and how to communicate with these children and their families. We will look at how to ensure that this expertise is also further translated and communicated to frontline professionals, which include the teachers and social service professionals that I had talked about.",5,132,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00132

2024-01-10-T-004,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin,"Speaker, thank you for your indulgence. Minister of State, with all due respect, this is a case of a child who first witnessed her mother's suicide and then was sexually abused by her own biological father, before then being sexually abused by this fatherly figure. I think what many people truly want to know is beyond training, how do we improve the current processes? How is the home looking at improving its current protocol, recognising that constant, or even daily check-ins, are too resource-intensive? How do we really strengthen the rigour applied across the different MSF agencies to ensure that this does not happen again, as much as possible?",1,134,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00134
2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for her follow-up questions. I would say this  we would spare no effort when it comes to training our social service professionals to identify signs of abuse. That is their job and when social service professionals come to this profession and want to help children and young persons, in particular in children's homes, they are well intentioned and this is what they set out to do every day.",1,135,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00135
2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"So, like I said, this incident is something that has shaken the community. Nobody wants to see this, in particular, the social service professionals who have been in contact with the child. We all know the traumatic experience of this child. It is terrible for a young person to have to undergo this in her own biological family, to seek refuge in a children's home and to have a glimpse of a future with a prospective adopter, only to be abused at their hands of this potentially trusted adult that she has come into contact with.",2,136,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00136
2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"Like I said, this has shaken the community. What we will continue to do is that even though training sounds like a very generic term, it is a very important one because it is fundamental to equipping our social service professionals to have the means and the background to identify, to prevent and to stop abuse from happening.",3,137,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00137
2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I would like to further reinforce the point that the social service professionals, with all the resources that they have and they are managing many cases at the same time, they are in contact with the child through supervised visitations, check-ins, home visits. During COVID-19, there was the added element of check-ins over video. But, of course, post-COVID-19, we have replaced that with physical home visits because that, fundamentally, is the best way of assessing the environment.",4,138,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00138
2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"But what is very, very important is that we really need members of the public to be together with us in this fight to protect our children. As you can imagine, for a young person or child who is experiencing this, you never know at which point and what might trigger the child to finally open up. When he or she decides to open up, then there must be a trusted adult nearby for him or her to open up to. In this case, it was a teacher who was open, who had obviously spent time building a nurturing and trusting relationship with the child; and it was one such teacher whom the child had trusted and whom she confided in.",5,139,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00139
2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"So, I would say that the most fundamental, and perhaps the most comprehensive, way of tackling this issue is to raise greater awareness among more members of the public, in particular, persons who have immediate touchpoints with children and, therefore, I mentioned teachers, I mentioned neighbours, I mentioned friends.",6,140,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00140
2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"At the same time, I would also like to share that we had rolled out the hand signal for help because we want to make sure that whether there is opportunity for the child to be in the community and should he or she decide to disclose this abuse, that he or she is able to reach out for help. We hope that members of the public will recognise what the sign means and please call the National Anti-Violence and Sexual Harassment helpline or reach out to Social Service Offices'  or our protection specialist centres, so that help can be given to this survivor victim of family violence as soon as possible.",7,141,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00141

2024-01-10-T-004,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"That said, I wish to caution against going too far in the other direction and let me elaborate. I have had residents who wish to adopt the children of their spouse from second marriages. Based on their feedback, this process tends to be very drawn out, and more often than not, the child is of a foreign nationality. And so, the Permanent Residency and citizenship process, based on what they have shared, is very lengthy.",2,144,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00144

2024-01-10-T-004,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"I wonder whether the Ministry will, even as they review their processes to protect the child, not to go too far in the other direction and make the process of adoption more onerous, especially for children that result from second marriages.",4,146,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00146
2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for raising this. I suppose the Member has a specific case in his mind when he shared this. If he does not mind, perhaps after this Sitting, he could share the case with me offline, so we can take a closer look at it.",1,147,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00147
2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"In general, for prospective adopters, what happens in the process is that they first have to attend a pre-adoption briefing and they have to undergo a comprehensive Adoption Suitability Assessment which is conducted by social service staff from an MSF-accredited adoption agency.",2,148,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00148
2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"The prospective adopters have to first obtain a favourable Home Study Report that I mentioned earlier, before they can proceed to identify a child to adopt. If the child is a foreigner, and I think this is a point the Member raised in the case, the prospective adopter would have to apply for a Dependant's Pass, so that the child can reside in Singapore while undergoing the adoption process.",3,149,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00149
2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"After the Dependant's Pass is granted, the prospective adopter can apply to the Family Justice Courts (FJC) to adopt. That would then be MSF's Guardian-in-Adoption, which is appointed by the FJC who will conduct social investigations. And by that, I mean checking in with the prospective adopters, family members, character referees, professionals and so on.",4,150,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00150
2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"So, as you can see, there is a process in place. Whether it is overly onerous, at the onset, I think we have to agree in principle that we have to make sure the child's interest, welfare and well-being – whether or not a Singaporean or a foreign child – has to be front and centre. That is why we have all these processes in place, to make sure that we are able to assess and screen the prospective adopter, to make sure that they have the basic requirements and have the best situation to be able to care for such a child.",5,151,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00151

2024-01-10-T-004,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for his question. At the stage of pre-adoption requirements, I had mentioned that the prospective adopter has to undergo a comprehensive Adoption Suitability Assessment and prospective adopters who wish to adopt a child with a traumatic history, will need to be assessed if they are able to meet the child's complex care needs. So, it is one layer above what I shared earlier.",1,155,2024-01-10-T-004-S-00155

Utilisation of SFC was higher among the younger age groups, at close to 40% for those in their 30s, while the utilisation rate of SFC for those aged 60 and above was around 25%.

Specific to older Singaporeans, SSG works with partner agencies to ensure that there is a suitable range of SFC-eligible courses to cater to their upskilling and lifelong learning needs, such as digital literacy, financial literacy and physical and mental well-being.

2024-01-10-T-006,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"To minimise risks to consumers remitting funds to China, MAS has decided to temporarily suspend the use of non-bank and non-card channels by licensees for money transfers to China. While consumers may now have to pay more to remit funds to China, this temporary suspension will protect consumers from the uncertainty of funds being frozen by the authorities in China.",8,191,2024-01-10-T-006-S-00191
2024-01-10-T-006,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Relevant Government agencies have also been engaging the PRC government, so that the PRC government can provide information to help affected remitters understand how they can get their accounts and monies in China unfrozen by PRC law enforcement. MAS has also told the licensees to render the necessary assistance to affected consumers, also to strengthen their complaints handling processes and to review the existing arrangements with partners and intermediaries for remittances to China, in view of these complaints and the impact to their customers. MAS and SPF will continue to engage the relevant Chinese authorities and the Singapore licensees and render assistance to affected remitters.",9,192,2024-01-10-T-006-S-00192

2024-01-10-T-006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),Some remittance companies have a practice of going through third-party payout agents to perform the funds transfer using personal bank accounts. The Minister of State earlier said that MAS has prohibited this practice for three months. Are there plans to extend this prohibition for longer or ban the practice outright in order to better protect consumers?,2,195,2024-01-10-T-006-S-00195
2024-01-10-T-006,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Secondly, given that most of these funds have left Singapore's jurisdiction and are held up by authorities in China, has MAS been in communication with all the complainants to inform them about the limits of Singapore's jurisdiction beyond the outreach session that was conducted in December, which was attended by just 39 individuals?",3,196,2024-01-10-T-006-S-00196
2024-01-10-T-006,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Sir, I thank the Member for his supplementary question. MAS will review the temporary suspension before 31 March.

2024-01-10-T-006,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"On the second point, maybe I want to also set the context. Both MAS, as well as SPF, have been working with the relevant government agencies in China. But what is also useful is that, in this regard, MAS considers the remittance companies to have discharged their obligations once the funds have reached the intended recipient. So, once these funds have been successfully deposited into the bank accounts, then they have discharged their obligations. But the funds have been frozen or forfeited by the law enforcement agencies, and MAS and SPF are continually engaging the relevant government agencies in China to understand the situation and then also to work with the remittance agencies to see what we can do to assist those affected.",2,198,2024-01-10-T-006-S-00198

2024-01-10-T-006,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Mr Speaker, just two supplementary questions for the Minister of State. The first is in relation to remittance companies which might potentially exempt themselves from any liabilities by making their customers sign certain waivers. Is this the case for the remittance companies that are currently involved in these cases, especially for one of them, Samlit Money Changer, which I understand from the press release, is responsible for the majority of the cases that have been surfaced, and are these exemptions basically against the current regulations?",1,200,2024-01-10-T-006-S-00200
2024-01-10-T-006,Chua Kheng Wee Louis,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"The second supplementary question is in relation to, again, these licensed payment institutions, especially the major ones. I understand from MAS' requirements that they must comply with requirements to protect customer money and, in this case, is that protection of customer money about just ensuring that the funds reach their intended destination or that they can be accessed at their intended destinations?",2,201,2024-01-10-T-006-S-00201
2024-01-10-T-006,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"Sir, we are, indeed, reviewing the complaints and have been following up with the remittance companies. In the case of Samlit, we understand that they have considered some civil action as it is a civil matter. But we are working very closely, through SPF as well as MAS, with Samlit and the other remittance licensees that the Police have received reports regarding this particular case.",1,202,2024-01-10-T-006-S-00202
2024-01-10-T-006,Alvin Tan,Mr Alvin Tan,"If these remittance licensees – they are licensed under the PS Act, as I mentioned in my original reply – are found not to meet with the regulatory expectations, we will take action. While MAS cannot compel the remittance companies on compensation, we have told them that they should treat their customers fairly. But if they are found to be in breach, we could take regulatory and enforcement actions, including fines and reprimand. But as I mentioned in my earlier response to the supplementary question, in this case, we found that they have discharged their obligations in terms of remitting, and this is an issue that MAS, SPF and the relevant Government agencies are engaging with the PRC agencies to resolve the matter.",2,203,2024-01-10-T-006-S-00203

They had then scanned the QR code in the website via their WhatsApp account on their mobile device and, in doing so, they inadvertently granted the scammers access to their WhatsApp account. The scammers then used the compromised WhatsApp account to impersonate the user and reached out to the user's family and friends and convinced them to transfer monies to the scammers' bank accounts or PayNow numbers.",1,205,2024-01-10-T-007-S-00205

2024-01-10-T-007,Sun Xueling,Ms Sun Xueling,"First, I would like to share that the platforms have responded with varying degrees of urgency and they had leaned to it to different extents. For example, Meta has, on some occasions, required more time to recover compromised WhatsApp accounts. We intend to work even closer with Meta and to highlight to them that we need them to do more. They need to respond more quickly to our requests, to be more effective and efficient in recovering compromised WhatsApp accounts and disabling the service if it is part of a scam.

2024-01-10-T-011,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Unreliable systems, frequent outages or vulnerabilities in the infrastructure make users skeptical about the security of their transactions, hindering the growth of digital trust.

2024-01-10-T-011,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Second, we need to combat scams and fraudulent activities swiftly and effectively. Scams erode trust by exploiting unsuspecting users, leading to financial losses and undermining confidence in digital transactions.",28,257,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00257
2024-01-10-T-011,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Number two, addressing cyber threats. Cybersecurity threats, such as data breaches and identity theft via malwares, contribute to fear and suspicion among users. Privacy breaches and unauthorised access to personal information can also make individuals hesitant to engage in digital activities. Hence, we must ensure that related policies and capabilities continually evolve to keep up with the rampant and fast-changing threats online.",29,258,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00258
2024-01-10-T-011,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Number three, countering online harms. Online harms, including cyberbullying and harassment, have real-life consequences on individuals' mental health and well-being, hampering their potential. Further, vulnerable groups, such as children and the elderly, are particularly susceptible to online harms. Hence, we must promote respectful and responsible behaviours and implement measures that protect vulnerable groups from exploitation, thereby fostering trust among users of all demographics.",30,259,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00259
2024-01-10-T-011,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Number four, meaningful human connections. The interconnectedness of online and physical worlds often influence real-life relationships.

2024-01-10-T-011,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"And number five, digital inclusion. Ultimately, people will be keener to participate if they feel safe.

2024-01-10-T-011,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Key to this include  number one, access to essential services.

2024-01-10-T-011,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Number two, digital skills empowerment and closing social gaps. We must empower our citizens with digital access and the right skills for active participation in the digital society. We must be mindful of not creating new gaps between the digitally savvy and those who are not. By doing so, individuals, including the vulnerable, can gain the confidence to navigate digital platforms, reducing the digital divide and fostering trust in their ability to engage with digital technologies.",36,265,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00265

2024-01-10-T-011,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Number four, enhancing citizen participation.

2024-01-10-T-011,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"However, companies tend to be more willing to share data and experiences with the Government, which could then anonymise and aggregate such information.

2024-01-10-T-011,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Taking a leaf from the ""Stop Scams UK"" that allows industry players to share intelligence and collaborate on scam-related initiatives, our Government can and should take the lead in setting up a similar information-sharing mechanism with the industry.

2024-01-10-T-011,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"It is also encouraging to note the establishment of Anti-Scam Command in 2022 and co-location of major banks' staff with the Police to facilitate scam detection and reporting. But the broader efforts in combatting scams and online harms still necessitate extensive coordination across various Government agencies and departments, and private institutions, such as banks and telcos, which may have varying mandates and resource priorities.",47,276,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00276
2024-01-10-T-011,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Hence, there is scope for further integration of expertise and resource prioritisation in regulating and enforcing online safety.

We have seen an increase in prevalence of scams enabled by malware on users' mobile devices. These malware threats are difficult for everyday citizens to detect.

Even someone who is in the tech industry will find it difficult to know.",49,278,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00278

2024-01-10-T-011,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Many digital service providers continue to use authentication methods, such as traditional passwords that are vulnerable to phishing.

As we spend more time online, the digital and physical worlds are converging and our actions in either realm can have a profound impact on the other. Ultimately, we should ask ourselves what kind of environment do we desire to see in the digital world? If we desire safety, inclusiveness, kindness and respect in the real world, we should also aspire to create the same online. Why should the digital world be any different from the real one?

The Internet has the power to amplify the voices of a vocal few. If this ability becomes misguided, it risks drowning out or cancelling others who hold a different opinion or who are, simply, different. Hence, this call of action calls on every one of us to continue upholding the values of kindness and respect online and offline, to look beyond ourselves and reach out to others who may be in need of help.",54,283,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00283

It has set up the AI Verify Foundation, which published a discussion paper last year entitled, ""Generative AI  Implications for Trust and Governance"". The paper was stated to be targeted at senior leaders in Government and business, advocating for more discourse and collaboration on building an ecosystem for the trusted and responsible adoption of generative AI. Among the emergent risks of generative AI listed by the paper were the making of mistakes, copyright infringements and the spreading of toxicity and cyber threats. Apart from these emergent risks, the fact that AI will lead to drop losses and disinformation alone will erode public trust in the digital arena.",25,322,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00322

2024-01-10-T-011,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Firstly, on the issue of scams. There is, I would say, agreement on all sides of the House that it is a serious issue, especially in the era of digital banking, where senior citizens who grew up in a world of face-to-face counter transactions now can have their bank accounts and life savings depleted at the click of the device by a scammer far away, outside of Singapore.",3,333,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00333
2024-01-10-T-011,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"This is a serious issue, especially in societies such as Singapore, where we progressed rapidly from third world to first and seniors growing up in the pre-digital era today exist in a world of digital access and digital technology. That is the first point about consumer protection.",4,334,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00334
2024-01-10-T-011,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Even as Members on both sides of the House call for additional measures to scrutinise how banks treat their customers, I would like to once again call upon the MAS and the relevant authorities, to call upon and make the point I have raised previously in this House on multiple occasions, which is that there needs to be a consumer protection approach to scams involving banking customers who get scammed out of their savings online.",5,335,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00335
2024-01-10-T-011,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"In recent times, there have been efforts by the MAS – initially called the risk sharing framework or risk allocation framework, depending on how commentators look at it. But the key point has to be this  the norms that we approach consumer safety in banking, the approach to consumer safety for banking should not be too different from consumer safety in other more tangible areas of the marketplace.",6,336,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00336
2024-01-10-T-011,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"As I shared to the Minister of State from MAS not too long ago, if today, a company had a consumer product and if somebody could be tricked by a stranger into configuring that product wrongly so that there was either bodily harm or damage to property resulting in the loss of someone's entire life savings, we know what the consumer protection approach would be.",7,337,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00337

2024-01-10-T-011,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Yesterday, in a written question to the Minister for Communications and Information on operating systems, what was quite notable was that a certain operating system accounted for virtually all of the online banking scams made known to the Police, while a certain different operating system did not figure very much in the figures reported in that Parliamentary written answer. So, again, we see quite a different situation between these consumer products.",9,339,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00339

2024-01-10-T-011,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"The second part of my speech will be on the age of AI and what Singapore needs to do to adapt. I spoke on this last year, during the debate on the President's Address. Early last year, I spoke on the age of AI and it was a humbling moment, because after the speech was delivered and it got a little bit of viral traction online, I think, just a little bit over 100,000 people around the world watched it – not that many. But we started getting emails, messages, from people around the world. Someone from the USA wrote to me, someone from Africa wrote in as well and it touched a chord. But this is not about that speech. It is about what Singapore represents to the world. When people see our Parliamentarians, whether our Ministers, office holders, whether our backbenchers of various persuasions, looking to the future about what the world will be like, people look at what Singapore is thinking about and they want us to try and find the way forward as well.",13,343,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00343

2024-01-10-T-011,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"The issue of deepfakes is going to be a serious matter for democracies around the world – because if we can no longer discern easily what is real and not real, you cannot even have a functioning democracy.

Project that forward three, five years, 10 years, with more computing power, you can imagine how authentic those deepfakes are going to be.

2024-01-10-T-011,Tan Wu Meng,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"One last point I wanted to make is that we need to double down our investments in AI capability in our Government and in our industry as well.

It seemed like a big amount then, but in hindsight, it seems like it was a quite a good deal at the time, given what OpenAI grew into. This also links to a point I made a few years back during a Budget debate. Sometimes when we invest ahead of the market, invest in certain technological capabilities which may see tenuous today, but which could have high yields tomorrow, it means that we are able to get those dividends later on.",25,355,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00355

As we put more demands on all the larger players, and the key players and stakeholders, I will say that there is also an opportunity for platform and service players in Singapore. Singapore is an advanced market with high levels of connectivity, as I have shared earlier, and also high levels of residents owning smartphones. The number of seniors owning smartphones has increased to 89%, as per the report I cited earlier. This provides platform and service players an opportunity to use Singapore as a base for innovation to apply and showcase higher standards of security.

We would not give our NRIC details, bank account information or ATM card to anyone we do not know or trust. These same principles and practices must be applied when we are online and using our digital devices and applications. Otherwise, no matter what measures and legislation are in place to improve digital safety and security, they would not be able to protect us in our digital transactions. So, we all have to do our part.",21,380,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00380

2024-01-10-T-011,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"While digital literacy allows us to transact digitally, one of the areas when people do hit issues with transaction is the ability to get help to resolve these issues can, sometimes, be quite challenging, given how access to support is currently structured. Unless you are a victim of fraud or have been scammed, most helpline numbers provided take quite a bit of navigation. Prioritising support for those who have been scammed is necessary. However, users of digital services when faced with issues during their transaction, do also need support to resolve their transaction issues.",23,382,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00382
2024-01-10-T-011,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"I do agree that it is challenging to resource support given manpower constraints, cost and capacity. But as commercial businesses and Government services become more digital-first, we need to rethink the model of support and find more effective ways to provide timely access to support for users when they encounter issues with their digital transactions. This will reassure and build digital trust and confidence. Especially when transactions involve monies, it can cause anxiety for users, young or old.",24,383,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00383
2024-01-10-T-011,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"I do want to touch on another point about digital inclusion and that is about the ability to participate in opportunities.

2024-01-10-T-011,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Singapore continues to have ambitious plans to leverage new technologies to grow and bring benefits to our people and businesses. An example is Singapore's second National AI Strategy (NAIS 2.0), which was recently launched last December by Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. It outlines both the opportunities and risks of AI. It outlines also our ambition and commitment to building a trusted and responsible AI ecosystem, driving innovation and growth through AI and empowering our people and businesses to understand and engage with AI. But it will require new governance models as well.",26,385,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00385
2024-01-10-T-011,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"So, my point is, to realise these ambitious plans, we will need people with skillsets in new areas of technology and cybersecurity. Why? It is to build thoughtful design and solutions to really benefit from these new technologies. What it also means is good jobs for Singaporeans. But in order to take advantage of these opportunities will require new skills. Organisations must make investments to support their employees in building new skillsets, educational institutions must prepare our students and those in the workforce for these opportunities, individuals of all ages and career stages must be open to learning and taking on new opportunities. There must be investments by the Government and the private sector to build deep skills.",27,386,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00386
2024-01-10-T-011,Jessica Tan Soon Neo,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"New technologies will allow for new ways of doing things and this involves more than technologies. We will need new thinking and ideas. And this brings me to a point about a diverse workforce. A diverse workforce will enable organisations to leverage different perspectives, skills and experiences because you need that to develop new ideas to grow and thrive in a digital society. This is possible. On that note, I do want to make a point to employers and organisations that we must tap on the vast pool of wealth and experience of senior workers and bring that into that diverse workforce to enable us to find new ways, both young and old, to create new ways of doing things with technology.",28,387,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00387

It is not about being a digitally advanced society with the best infrastructure, policies and skills or level of excellence and technology adoption. All these are necessary, but the purpose of an inclusive and safe digital society is to ensure that everyone can actively participate and benefit to make their lives better and that no one is left behind. But in order to achieve this, it will take all of us to do our part to enable an inclusive, trusted and safe digital society.",29,388,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00388

2024-01-10-T-011,Jamus Jerome Lim,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"All this sounds reasonable on its face. But, in practice, fraud is almost always perpetrated on the weaker link in the chain, in this case, the vulnerable consumer, more often than not, than on the relatively better-equipped and technologically sophisticated bank or telecoms company. Hence, the equitable sharing framework becomes less about fairly distributing losses, but about distributing responsibilities. Losses, when they occur, would appear overwhelmingly borne by the consumer. Put another way, we should only expect the framework to yield equitable outcomes if the fair assignment of responsibilities were all that mattered.",4,393,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00393

While this does not close the door to other resolution mechanisms, such as the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre (FIDReC), it remains too cavalier in apportioning liability in the first instance. SRF is a split based on effort, not outcomes. Put another way, should there be a realised loss, as long as the financial institution or telecom operator can demonstrate that they have satisfied a certain set of obligations – which, to be honest, is not even exhaustive – their loss share will not be half.

Should one car brake suddenly and it is ahead, the following car should always maintain a safe distance. But what if the cars were side-by-side and a child were to run out in front of one of them? If one of them were to swerve to avoid an accident and the other fails to yield, it is hard to say that only one of the cars should bear responsibility for the crash.",17,406,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00406

2024-01-10-T-011,Nadia Ahmad Samdin,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),This idea of a filtered life also creates discontent and intensifies social comparisons.

In my constituency, Cheng San-Seletar, a group of youths known as the Cheng San Chapalang Club held one-on-one digital workshops in various languages and dialects for seniors to boost their literacy.

Back then, Mr Yu was making an online hotel booking when he fell prey to a malware by entering his OTP on a bogus website. He promptly contacted the bank's customer service upon discovering several unauthorised transactions amounting to over $6,000 charged to his credit card. But despite his request to terminate them immediately, Mr Yu was advised by the bank's customer service officer that because the monies have yet to be received by the scammer, he would have to wait until he received his next monthly statement of account as proof before raising a dispute on the fraudulent credit card transactions.",9,508,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00508

Almost six months later, the bank replied after completing their investigations to inform him that he is expected to bear 50% of the unauthorised transacted sum. To add insult to injury, the bank in their written response reminded him ""to always take care of your credentials and refer to the bank's website for more information about how to protect from scams.""",10,509,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00509

Amongst other efforts, the banks ought to have paid more attention to each customer's regular banking patterns. In their parents' case, the couple's bank account had zero withdrawal activity for years until the scammers wiped out over half a million dollars of their savings through two large transactions. The bank should have made calls to them to seek confirmation on the abnormal request before releasing the funds.",15,514,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00514

In November last year, OCBC introduced its anti-scam security feature called OCBC Money Lock, which allows customers to lock away funds in their bank accounts and can only be unlocked after the customer's identity has been verified by the bank. This is a good initiative which I hope MAS can mandate to be rolled out across all of the banks in Singapore and to encourage sign-ups by our seniors.",16,515,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00515

Upskilling workshops, such as OCBC's Digital Silvers programme, and the digital literacy partnership by DBS Foundation and IMDA, are prime examples of such initiatives. If deployed in conjunction with the previously mentioned measures, the banks can also make use of these workshop as opportunities to promote and encourage seniors to sign up for the ""money-lock"" features as well as enrolling for the anti-scam insurance to protect funds in their bank accounts. I hope that such workshops can be made easily available, just like those run by the SDOs, and I will explore how I can best help my Woodgrove residents benefit from them.

2024-01-10-T-011,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"Firstly, the SRF has a limited scope. It only covers phishing scams and does not cover the whole range of other scams including malware scams, Police official scams, investment and love scams. Its protection is thus rather limited.

2024-01-10-T-011,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),Financial institutions have the capacity to do more to protect consumers against scams with systems to monitor transactions and detect suspicious payment flows. Large overseas transactions by individuals who rarely or never perform them should immediately trigger alarm bells within the systems of financial institutions. This would not affect businesses that regularly perform such transactions and would not be difficult to implement given the scale and capacity of the IT infrastructure at financial institutions.,13,532,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00532

2024-01-10-T-011,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),I acknowledge that there are moral hazard issues with a full reimbursement and would thus like to suggest a co-sharing of liabilities between the bank and the consumer.,15,534,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00534
2024-01-10-T-011,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"In assessing the issue of online scams, there is a trade-off between financial security on the one hand and convenience and productivity on the other. If banks are totally not liable for any losses, then they have only financial incentives to move more and more towards digital financial transactions and services due to the savings in manpower costs. The cost of digital financial transactions come in the form of greater ease of losing huge amounts of money, and it is being borne by bank customers, especially the most vulnerable. In addition, banks are in control of the security features in their banking apps and the payment processes, but customers, who have no control over those, pay the price for any inadequacies. This is clearly not balanced and hence not tenable.",16,535,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00535
2024-01-10-T-011,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"In considering the trade-off between financial security and convenience and productivity, it may be difficult for the authorities to draw a line for everyone. For example, when OCBC introduced security features in their banking app that prohibited the downloading of suspicious apps, there were complaints from some customers. It is foreseeable that different customers will have different needs. But there is no need for a one-size-fits-all.",17,536,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00536
2024-01-10-T-011,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"I urge the Government to consider a multiple-tiered system with different levels of security versus convenience. Banks can offer different versions of banking apps and processes; for example, one with maximum security features and low convenience, and it comes with a 75% reimbursement of financial losses by the banks in cases of online scams not covered by the SRF. Another with lower security features and comes with a 50% reimbursement for customers who need greater convenience.",18,537,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00537
2024-01-10-T-011,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"Banks can adjust the security features in their apps and processes to commensurate with the different level of liabilities. For example, banks might want to re-evaluate the benefits of requiring a separate physical token. The hon Member Ms Sylvia Lim had spoken previously about the difficulties of getting one from the bank. Whilst the token is an additional cost for banks, it provides the added security of requiring a second device for the authorisation of transactions, not just a handphone which can be hijacked by malware. Using again the example of the family involved in the recent egg scam, if a physical token had been required, the family might not have lost their life savings.",19,538,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00538
2024-01-10-T-011,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"Banks are private commercial entities. They are expected to conduct cost benefit analysis in evaluating any investments in additional security measures.

2024-01-10-T-011,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"Under such a model, both the banks and their customers share the liabilities of any losses due to scams and they both have incentives to be vigilant. Customers can choose the level of security they are comfortable with. Banks will have incentives to push online transactions in line with their ability to provide security, thereby ensuring that the development of digital financial transactions is a more balanced and holistic one. The maximum limit on reimbursement helps to limit the banks' exposure and at the same time, ensure that the most protection is given to the most vulnerable.",22,541,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00541
2024-01-10-T-011,Hazel Poa,Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member),"Another institution to which duties should be assigned to mitigate scams is the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board, where many Singaporeans' life savings are held. It is very worrying that recently, there has been a trend where CPF accounts were emptied by scammers who had taken control of the user's Singpass and bank accounts. It was only in June 2023 that the CPF Board and GovTech introduced Singpass Face Verification as a step-up authentication challenge for certain CPF e-services.",23,542,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00542

I am concerned about the wealth of information available in Singpass. Information like family members, education background, income and CPF information and so on. If scammers took control of victims' Singpass, would they not gain very comprehensive information about individual victims and their family members, to enable them to device more ways of scamming?

Across our nation, residents, both young and old, tech savvy and not, have fallen victim to these fraudulent schemes.

Victims are sometimes told by the Police that the funds had been transferred overseas and nothing further can be done to retrieve the funds.",2,612,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00612
2024-01-10-T-011,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),The technical nature of these scams is deeply concerning.

I echo Ms Sylvia Lim's earlier call for banks to reintroduce physical tokens as a default measure for multi-factor authentication for all their customers. Multi-factor authentication relies on a combination of something you know and something you have. However, when phones are compromised by malware, allowing scammers to view screens and keystrokes, this system collapses into a single factor. This allows scammers who have access to the password entered by the user to bypass the additional security layer. Therefore, bringing back physical tokens will reinstate the crucial second layer of security.",9,619,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00619

In my dealings with MAS, when advocating for constituents victimised by scams, I have observed that MAS tends to forward these critical cases to the banks for their follow-up instead of directly addressing and resolving the issues on behalf of victims. This delegation process then places the onus on the banks to determine who is at fault, the institution or the victim, for the occurrence of the scam. Such a practice raises serious concerns about the impartiality and effectiveness on the investigation.",10,620,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00620

2024-01-10-T-011,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Scam victims need a comprehensive explanation from a knowledgeable and impartial entity like MAS about how the scam occurred. This explanation should detail the roles of banks, telcos, customers and other entities in both the occurrence and prevention of such scams. This will determine who is responsible and who should bear the loss, the cost of these fraudulent acts.",13,623,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00623
2024-01-10-T-011,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Furthermore, responsibility should not be limited to financial institutions, telcos and consumers. Social media companies and mobile phone handset manufacturers should be held accountable for securing their platforms again scams. All handsets sold in Singapore should be required to disable side loading of apps by default and make it difficult for end users to override critical security features. Social media platforms should be required to have processes in place to remove fraudulent posts soon after being notified.",14,624,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00624
2024-01-10-T-011,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"MCI has revealed that a notable proportion of residents, approximately 37%, do not regularly update their devices. Many of these may be less tech savvy users. It is not reasonable to expect that everyone will have the technical proficiency to keep their devices updated. Therefore, consumer protection strategies must be designed on the premise that a significant number of users will not know how to keep their devices updated and should incorporate additional layers of security to safeguard these users.",15,625,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00625
2024-01-10-T-011,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"A central agency should oversee all scam investigations and responses. I am aware of the Anti-Scam Command (ASCom) and the important work their officers are doing. However, given that ASCom is a department under the Commercial Affairs Department of the Singapore Police Force, I do not think it can be held accountable for whole-of-Government efforts to combat scams. Who therefore, is ultimately accountable for the Government's anti-scam efforts?",16,626,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00626
2024-01-10-T-011,Gerald Giam Yean Song,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"To summarise, my recommendations as follows. First, banks must significantly increase their responsibility towards consumer protection, including by providing physical tokens to customers. Second, MAS should take a more active role in acertaining responsibility for scams carried out on banks, digital platforms and supporting victims. Third, the Online Criminal Harms Act needs to be fully operational operationalised without further delay. Fourth, the Government needs to hold technology companies more accountable for their security of their platforms and devices. And finally, a central anti-scam agency should oversee and be ultimately accountable for the Government's anti-scam efforts.",17,627,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00627

Thankfully, the narrative was interrupted by the rise of the socially conscious investor. The socially conscious investor demanded that corporations be held accountable to higher standards of social responsibility. This has in turn, led to the emergence of corporate social responsibility and ESG, or environmental, social and governance goals as new priorities.",3,632,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00632

2024-01-10-T-011,See Jinli Jean,Ms See Jinli Jean (Nominated Member),"First, technologies will get more complicated and powerful.

2024-01-10-T-011,See Jinli Jean,Ms See Jinli Jean (Nominated Member),"Given the fluid nature of data, users might find themselves at the receiving end of unsolicited marketing messages as companies seek to profit from new consumer segments. Many individuals struggle to extricate themselves from the never-ending web of marketing messages as they lack the knowledge or ability to do so. The struggle imposes mental strain on individuals who are constantly inundated by advertisements and often tempted to spend more time and more money on the apps. How might we cultivate a respectful code of ethics for commerce in the digital age?",6,635,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00635
2024-01-10-T-011,See Jinli Jean,Ms See Jinli Jean (Nominated Member),"Second, technologies will get simpler yet more complex. On the one hand, mobile technology coupled with AI tools are set to herald a new age of productivity for service frontliners; we do see resources being customised and at the fingertips of service frontliners when interacting with customers. On the other hand, workers can also be held hostage by technology. Many workers are users and operators, and unexposed or underexposed to technology's working mechanics. If companies train workers only for deployment rather than staff development, a firm’s decision to change technology provider could render its current cohort of workers struggling to become competent in a new technology within a short timeframe. This story would end with the workers being made redundant and the firm let off the hook when the firm cites incompatibility of worker skills and business needs.",7,636,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00636

2024-01-10-T-011,See Jinli Jean,Ms See Jinli Jean (Nominated Member),"Third, the spotlight on technology and online harm has made us more aware of our rights. However, many of us are less certain of how to exercise them. While businesses are conscious of seeking consent from users on data privacy, default privacy settings are often onerous to navigate. It is even more challenging to attempt a complete opt out from the default settings. Furthermore, users who consent to the default settings might not be aware of what the settings allow or mean.",9,638,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00638

2024-01-10-T-011,See Jinli Jean,Ms See Jinli Jean (Nominated Member),"To address the harmful effects of unsolicited marketing and the powerlessness that users experience in relation to the data that we hand over to the companies, I would suggest that regulators take a proactive approach to educate companies on respect for user rights. For instance, a socially responsible company would ensure default settings favour user privacy and autonomy. This means that users must have unrestricted access to their own data privacy settings.",14,643,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00643

2024-01-10-T-011,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"Topics like online privacy, recognising misinformation and understanding the ethics and psychological impact of digital media are crucial. We must continue to creatively integrate these digital literacy programmes into the core curriculum of our education system at all levels. This integration should not be limited to just IT lessons.

2024-01-10-T-011,Wan Rizal,Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar),"Secondly, in homes, the engagement and education of parents in digital safety must be intensified.

Numerous phishing websites and mobile applications have emerged recently. Scammers create fake websites that are almost indistinguishable from the real ones.

Link shorteners are frequently used by scammers to make these links appear legitimate.",4,687,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00687
2024-01-10-T-011,Ong Hua Han,Mr Ong Hua Han (Nominated Member),"One way to identify fake websites is to carefully examine the domain name. An example of a legitimate domain name is "".gov.sg"", which cannot be replicated by scammers. ""Go.gov.sg"" is the official link shortener used by Government agencies and users are prompted to pause and check their browser address bar when they click on the shortened Government link for the first time. The Government also publishes and updates a list of trusted sites and clearly highlights that people should look out for "".gov.sg"" in the URL of Government websites.",5,688,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00688

2024-01-10-T-011,Ong Hua Han,Mr Ong Hua Han (Nominated Member),"Now, the question arises – in an environment where phishing scams involving clickable links still take place, how do we ensure that all retail banking users, particularly seniors, are aware of this initiative? Furthermore, these measures do not apply to non-bank financial institutions, such as digital investment platforms. Could the Government consider widening the scope of these measures to ensure that non-bank financial institutions serving retail customers also conform to the same standards? After all, it is in the interest of end users and service providers when scammers fail in their attempts.",7,690,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00690
2024-01-10-T-011,Ong Hua Han,Mr Ong Hua Han (Nominated Member),"Having considered online safety, I would like to now turn our attention to the other equally important tenet of this Motion. In the rest of my speech I will raise certain issues to ensure that our digital society is also inclusive to disadvantaged groups. This is especially important as daily life becomes digitalised over time. Today, the Internet has become a significant and unparalleled source of data. All of us in this Chamber would not think twice to search something up on the web or add to its content through social media. In day-to-day living, instant payments via our smartphones are second nature. For some in society, it is not quite the same.",8,691,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00691
2024-01-10-T-011,Ong Hua Han,Mr Ong Hua Han (Nominated Member),"According to MCI, seniors in Singapore continue to find using technology for purposes, such as contactless payment, a challenge. For seniors over the age of 60, this struggle is even more prevalent. The SG Digital Office (SDO) set up in June 2020 by IMDA runs a Seniors Go Digital programme that aims to help our seniors navigate the digital landscape with ease and confidence. Given that some seniors still express hesitancy over the use of technology, can the Government clarify if such programmes have been successful in achieving their objectives and what more can be done?",9,692,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00692
2024-01-10-T-011,Ong Hua Han,Mr Ong Hua Han (Nominated Member),"Moving on to our friends with sensory disabilities, more attention is required to ensure that they are not left behind as we develop what we call our Digital Social Compact. I will begin by addressing the concerns of the deaf community, followed by a discussion on issues relating to the visually impaired (VI).",10,693,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00693
2024-01-10-T-011,Ong Hua Han,Mr Ong Hua Han (Nominated Member),"In September last year, I asked a Parliamentary Question on whether the Government will consider providing Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) interpretation services during significant Government live TV broadcasts. It was noted in the reply that since April 2020, MCI has required TV broadcasts of significant national and public interest to be accompanied by SgSL interpretation. This move marked a crucial step towards inclusivity and events, such as the National Day Rally and Budget speeches, have, indeed, become more accessible to the deaf community. However, there had been significant live events where SgSL interpretation was absent or only provided in a delayed broadcast.",11,694,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00694
2024-01-10-T-011,Ong Hua Han,Mr Ong Hua Han (Nominated Member),"For instance, during the most recent Presidential Forum in 2023, I understand that SgSL interpretation was not available in realtime but only in a delayed broadcast. This was despite the fact that the Presidential Election 2023 was the first contested Presidential Elections in over a decade in Singapore.",12,695,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00695
2024-01-10-T-011,Ong Hua Han,Mr Ong Hua Han (Nominated Member),"Critical live broadcasts, such as the initial COVID-19 briefings during the outbreak of the pandemic, also lacked sign language interpretation. Although it was eventually provided in later briefings, it is essential we recognise the challenging and unsettling environment the deaf community faced during those early, deeply uncertain moments.",13,696,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00696
2024-01-10-T-011,Ong Hua Han,Mr Ong Hua Han (Nominated Member),"Beyond TV broadcasts, there has also been feedback highlighting the disadvantages faced by the deaf community. Today, in our digital first but not digital only approach, there are still Government services that involve face-to-face or phone interaction. This includes reporting flat damage to HDB, consulting MOH or health clusters or addressing issues with CPF, ICA, LTA, among others. These are not fully accessible to the deaf. The deaf often have no choice but to hire a sign language interpreter at their own expense in order to communicate with Government agencies through these channels.",14,697,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00697
2024-01-10-T-011,Ong Hua Han,Mr Ong Hua Han (Nominated Member),"Given these persistent challenges, it is easy to empathise with the deaf community. It is natural for them to feel that their social participation in day-to-day living, access to essential services or time-sensitive information lag behind those of their hearing peers currently. I am aware and grateful for the ongoing collaboration between ServiceSG and SADeaf in addressing these accessibility challenges. That being said, it is necessary that we continue to push for inclusive and timely solutions. We must ensure that no one in the deaf community feels left behind as our world becomes digital.",15,698,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00698
2024-01-10-T-011,Ong Hua Han,Mr Ong Hua Han (Nominated Member),"I will use the final part of my speech to highlight issues on behalf of the visually impaired (VI) community. According to the Enabling Masterplan 2030 report, about 61% of all high traffic Government websites are accessible. These high traffic websites are defined as those with at least one million visits per year. The Enabling Masterplan 2030 rightfully acknowledges the existing gap in digital accessibility. It commits to designing accessible websites and applications for Government services. Additionally, it aims to raise the adoption of e-accessibility by the non-Government sectors.",16,699,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00699
2024-01-10-T-011,Ong Hua Han,Mr Ong Hua Han (Nominated Member),"Despite this, on the ground, many of those with VI continue to provide feedback that digital inaccessibility remains a big issue. People with VI consume digital content in a different way. For those with low to no vision remaining, they use a type of software called a screen reader. A screen reader is a text-to-speech software that turns a user's phone or computer into a talking machine. It scans all available text and reads the contents out loud. For images and buttons, the screen reader needs clear, user-friendly labels or alternate text to enable meaningful audio playback of screen content.",17,700,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00700
2024-01-10-T-011,Ong Hua Han,Mr Ong Hua Han (Nominated Member),"Speaking with the VI community, their experience with accessing digital content in Singapore via their screen readers is riddled with inconsistencies. For example, following the latest update of the HealthHub application, I am told that, unfortunately, blind users can no longer access the app like before. Previously, the app featured well-labelled buttons, enabling blind users to easily book hospital appointments or make bill payments seamlessly. After the update, the buttons somehow became unlabelled and the screen reader could only announce ""button"" or ""unlabelled graphic"" without any helpful context. Currently, blind users are left to navigate the app by trial and error, leading to an inefficient and often frustrating experience.",18,701,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00701
2024-01-10-T-011,Ong Hua Han,Mr Ong Hua Han (Nominated Member),"Thankfully, there is a brighter side.

2024-01-10-T-011,Ong Hua Han,Mr Ong Hua Han (Nominated Member),"Apart from Government services, many websites and applications from local companies are not screen-reader friendly.

2024-01-10-T-011,Ong Hua Han,Mr Ong Hua Han (Nominated Member),"The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is an international standard to ensure online content is accessible to persons with disabilities.

2024-01-10-T-011,Ong Hua Han,Mr Ong Hua Han (Nominated Member),"Without these, companies do not spare enough thought or consideration for disadvantaged groups in their online offerings. For instance, some e-commerce websites use puzzles or sliders to verify that users are, indeed, human. These methods often do not meet the basic level ""A"" of the WCAG standard, which requires alternative challenge-response authentication to cater to different types of sensory perception. Examples like this cause persons with disabilities to frequently find themselves relying on others when using the simplest of online services.

This creates a cruel contradiction  urging seniors towards digital dependence on one hand and then, blaming or even mocking them for the costly mistakes made.

Dedicated helplines and support networks are critical for seniors to seek assistance with digital issues and report scams without fear.

This journey requires action, not just words. We must accelerate digital literacy programmes, equipping every senior with the tools they need. We must establish a centralised support network, a single point of contact for their digital anxieties and fears.

2024-01-10-T-011,Usha Chandradas,Ms Usha Chandradas (Nominated Member),"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I stand in support of this Motion and I, too, would like particularly to speak about the way our society has considered our seniors in the creation of our safe and inclusive digital society. This is a point that has been raised by many other hon Members today and I would like to add my views as well, to this discussion.",1,748,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00748
2024-01-10-T-011,Usha Chandradas,Ms Usha Chandradas (Nominated Member),"According to the annual Population In Brief report, Singapore citizens aged 65 and above make up around 19% of our demographic. That figure is expected to increase and by 2030, around 24% of our citizens will be aged 65 and above. These are large numbers, and by now, I am sure everybody in the House is quite familiar with them.",2,749,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00749
2024-01-10-T-011,Usha Chandradas,Ms Usha Chandradas (Nominated Member),"Our approach is for Singapore to be a ""Digital First"" society, and not a ""Digital Only"" society. Accordingly, there is a need to make sure that our non-digital options – where we choose to provide them – are effective and thoughtful ones. Again, this is not a new point at all, it has been addressed and acknowledged in this House many times in the past.",3,750,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00750
2024-01-10-T-011,Usha Chandradas,Ms Usha Chandradas (Nominated Member),"I would like to add two further points to the discussion. First, in the context of building inclusivity, I would like to re-emphasise the need to think about the digital experience as a whole and not just in respect of the functionality of specific services and apps. Let us take a step back and consider for a moment – what does the larger digital environment look like right now, for a senior trying to live out their retirement years?",4,751,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00751

2024-01-10-T-011,Usha Chandradas,Ms Usha Chandradas (Nominated Member),"A number of bank branches have closed and self-service video teller machines have replaced human bank tellers. Medical appointments, prescription refills, health records – these are all accessible through apps such as HealthHub and Health Buddy. Shops, supermarkets and cafes have started to go cashless and smartphone apps are also used for the collection of points and allocation of discounts. If you go to a restaurant, chances are that you have to scan a QR code to access the menu and sometimes even to order and pay. And while your entire life is condensed into your tiny smartphone, there is an additional fear and worry that you will be targeted by scammers.",6,753,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00753

It is perhaps easy to say that elderly folks unfamiliar with technological developments in banking, healthcare and other sectors should simply be educated on how to improve their digital skills or seek to depend on trusted family members for help. This approach, however, ignores a few things.",7,754,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00754

2024-01-10-T-011,Usha Chandradas,Ms Usha Chandradas (Nominated Member),"There is a case to be made, I feel, for allowing seniors who wish to carry on with non-digital options to simply live out their lives as they wish in the way that they are used to. They can learn to adopt digital solutions if they want, but they should be gradual and they should do this in their own time.",11,758,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00758

Three examples come to mind, which I would like to share with you today.",17,764,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00764

2024-01-10-T-011,Usha Chandradas,Ms Usha Chandradas (Nominated Member),"All you had to do was point your phone camera at a QR code on a void deck wall and an artwork from the National Collection would appear before you as if it had been hung on that wall. In one magical swoop, viewers could suspend physical reality for a moment and enjoy the experience of having a beautiful piece of art appear right in front of them. They did not have to pay a single cent. All they had to do was simply turn on their phone cameras.",19,766,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00766
2024-01-10-T-011,Usha Chandradas,Ms Usha Chandradas (Nominated Member),"This is technology which is easy to use and something that, to my mind, we could use just as easily in different scenarios, for example, in hospital waiting areas of geriatric clinics, where elderly folk are required to wait for lengthy periods of time. These long waits can create huge amounts of stress for seniors whether they are alone or with caregivers and it is quite possible that access to digital art could alleviate some of that tension while familiarising our seniors with digital tools. This is a great example of how technology can be inclusive, easily accessible and applied in a way that makes sense in order to serve the real needs of our seniors.",20,767,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00767
2024-01-10-T-011,Usha Chandradas,Ms Usha Chandradas (Nominated Member),"The next example I would like to talk about is the use of technology in dementia care. Artist and programmer Eugene Soh is one such person who is working in this space. Specifically, he helps patients to cope with dementia using virtual reality (VR) technology. In his Mind Palace social enterprise, Eugene and his team are able to virtually transport nursing home residents to evocative places which are familiar to them, such as their old homes or neighbourhoods or even places of interest such as Haw Par Villa and Chinatown. They are also able to incorporate family members in created VR scenes, which helps the elderly patients to trigger memories, relieve social isolation and expand their physical boundaries.",21,768,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00768
2024-01-10-T-011,Usha Chandradas,Ms Usha Chandradas (Nominated Member),"But that is not all. Being mindful of the fact that wearable VR goggles may not be attractive to seniors and may come with the risk of spreading viruses, Mind Palace decided to convert entire rooms into immersive interactive environments where interaction with fitness and meditative experiences is done via motion sensors. So, to summarise, the whole experience is totally contactless and in line with what users of this service require and prefer.",22,769,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00769
2024-01-10-T-011,Usha Chandradas,Ms Usha Chandradas (Nominated Member),"To date, Mind Palace has conducted hundreds of trials and built five permanent immersive rooms at various eldercare facilities.

2024-01-10-T-011,Usha Chandradas,Ms Usha Chandradas (Nominated Member),"The final example I would like to refer to is that of HSBC Bank in Hong Kong, which last November, organised an art exhibition aimed at promoting public awareness on fraud prevention and online scams. Amongst others, the show featured an art piece that leveraged on face-swapping technology to show exhibition visitors how their images could be transformed into those of famous local celebrities. The point of this exhibit was to educate visitors about deepfake video call scams.",25,772,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00772

Racial or religious tensions, increasing income gaps, fake news, deepfakes, as shared by fellow Parliamentarian Dr Tan, perceived unfairness and unaddressed anxieties can very easily unravel the trust we have meticulously built over the years. In this Motion, our GPC thus calls for the House to reaffirm our commitment to adopt a whole-of-nation approach to sustain trust by building an inclusive and safe digital society.",4,780,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00780

2024-01-10-T-011,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),I would like to focus on just three critical points to help sustain trust by building a safe and inclusive digital society.,6,782,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00782
2024-01-10-T-011,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Firstly, redefining employment. Redefining employment is essential as the employment landscape is evolving.

2024-01-10-T-011,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"It has been mentioned repeatedly that by 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be above the age of 60. Currently, jobs for seniors are typically manual in nature, such as cleaners and pump attendants, possibly because of the lack of digital skillset of the current seniors. However, what is different compared to what we are experiencing now is our young seniors now are digitally literate and can continue to contribute to the economy in a different way.",8,784,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00784

2024-01-10-T-011,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"So, how do we bring all of these different elements together and leverage digitalisation to meet the needs of our future seniors to have meaningful employment with a comfortable work-life balance when they retire, to meet the needs of future retirees to continue to build their retirement nest egg and to meet the manpower needs of our economy?",11,787,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00787
2024-01-10-T-011,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"To do so, we must take a structured, whole-of-nation approach to rethink the definition of employment to encourage flexible work arrangements like job sharing, staggered time, part-time work, where possible, to truly unlock the potential of digitally abled young seniors. Moreover, individuals with disabilities and back-to-work moms can stand to benefit too from such arrangements, helping to foster inclusivity while ensuring economic activity continues.",12,788,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00788
2024-01-10-T-011,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Secondly, while our digital connectivity is commendable, we must ensure every school-going child has digital access and digital skillsets required in the future economy.",13,789,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00789

2024-01-10-T-011,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Typically, more affluent families send their kids to extra classes on coding, AI, AR and robotics. The access to such expensive extra-curricular activities, especially at a young age, may not be available to the lower-income families who face hurdles in accessing resources as well as being aware of and learning these crucial digital skills. This widens the skill gap between the haves and the have-nots. How do we ensure all our youths have equal opportunities to be exposed to and to develop these digital competencies?",18,794,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00794
2024-01-10-T-011,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Can we identify essential digitals skills such as basic coding, robotics, applied AI, cybersecurity and digital wellness to be included as core curriculum in primary and secondary schools, so that all our students have access and are exposed to these essential digital skills at an early age? I fear if we do not do so, kids from lower-income families are unduly disadvantaged in the future economy.",19,795,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00795
2024-01-10-T-011,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Hence, it was reassuring to hear from Minister Chan Chun Sing yesterday, that MOE is preparing our students to develop the foundational knowledge of AI. And I hope we can have more digital skills taught formally in schools. To ease the academic load on our students, I propose that these topics are included into the core curriculum as non-examinable, while we replace topics that may not be as critical in the future economy.",20,796,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00796
2024-01-10-T-011,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Providing a platform to create awareness and knowledge of the skills required in the digital economy, is precisely one of the things M3@PRPG (Pasir Ris-Punggol) hopes to achieve.

2024-01-10-T-011,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Firstly, can we review the approach of dealing with scams by unauthorised transactions? Many scams originate from transactions which the victims have been misled to authorise. However, some scams are executed without the transactions being authorised. Can we review the approach such that financial institutions bear some consequences for scams by unauthorised transactions?",25,801,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00801
2024-01-10-T-011,Sharael Taha,Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Secondly, given the volume of scam cases, more than 24,000 scam cases from just January to June 2023 alone and the complexity of scams with only 10,000 regular officers, it is understandable that investigations take some time. However, during the investigation, the victims' bank accounts or account, can be frozen. This can be highly challenging for the victims especially if it is the victim's sole account. Can we review the process of freezing bank accounts for the entire duration of the investigation period?",26,802,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00802

2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"For those of us who are online and get our services online, life has never been easier.

All this, without any of us teaching her.",7,844,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00844
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"On the other hand, I do have many older residents who are not fully online and struggle. I used to get requests for more bank branches to remain open when banks started closing branches and transitioning people to ATMs and AXS machines. Now, banks are also pulling back on ATMs and residents who have spent a lifetime transacting with cash are now finding it more difficult to do so. The same applies to many small business owners, and while many shops in wet markets and HDB malls have gone digital, there are still a few who have not signed on to online payments or record keeping. This includes some very educated people, including, in some cases, senior doctors who prefer to practice the way they have done for many years.",8,845,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00845
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"There have been wide ranging initiatives by different Government agencies to bridge this divide and bring more people into the digital fold. For example, Hawkers go Digital, an initiative by the IMDA to subsidise hawkers to move their business online and accept digital platforms, was rolled out, bringing many heartland hawkers into the digital world. Seniors Go Digital, likewise, is targeted at seniors with courses available at locations throughout the heartlands and trains them in the range of functions and services they are able to access through their phones.",9,846,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00846
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I believe these initiatives are working, but in order for them to work better, I think it will take the whole of society to be involved, for us to encourage people around us to go for courses, go online and become more enabled. Whenever I get requests by residents for more ATMs, I explain the challenges we face in getting more ATMs, but also gently nudge them to getting online banking apps and to move digital.",10,847,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00847
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),The next aspect of the Motion which has received a lot of attention is digital security. This has several facets.,11,848,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00848
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"One aspect is security of the systems. This includes keeping systems operating and protecting from cyber threats. There have been several instances, for example, of some of our banking systems going down, preventing transactions taking place. Where people operate largely digitally, this can create issues. For example, if a bank's payment systems are down, what happens to people who only have digital means of payment from that bank?",12,849,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00849
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),I suffered a minor inconvenience in this because I was at a shop the first time the system went down. I had to return the items and went back home. Not a major issue but definitely something that needs to be looked at if we are going more digital.,13,850,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00850
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"But more important are malicious cyber threats, including hacking and ransomware, where organisations may have systems hacked, information stolen and then demands are made for payment. Many companies and organisations have extensive personal information from individuals and if the systems on which these are stored are not secured, individuals could be exposed to attacks. On these matters, I think it is necessary to ensure that those who collect personal data are able to protect it.",14,851,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00851
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),The third aspect which I think has received the most attention from many speakers in this House is online scams. I have spoken on this issue several times in this House.,15,852,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00852
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The challenge with scams is multi-faceted. First, the perpetrators are mostly located out of Singapore. This makes it difficult for local law enforcement agencies to take action against them. The Singapore Police is closely plugged in with Interpol and counterparts in other agencies, but it is sometimes difficult to trace exactly where each of the numerous scams originate from.",16,853,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00853
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Second, victims normally have their trust taken advantage of. The types of scams include job scams, love scams and investment scams. Some in this House have spoken about how the prevalence of scams is creating a crisis of confidence in our digitisation process. I beg to differ on this.",17,854,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00854
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I think digitisation is a fast moving train and most Singaporeans are on board. The victims of scams are often too trusting and take at face value the calls and messages they get, which hook them into the process.",18,855,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00855
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In the course of my work, I was approached by a victim of a love scam. She had fallen in love with an individual through online exchanges and one meeting in-person. Eventually, this individual allegedly died, leaving her a massive inheritance. However, to get this inheritance, she had to and did make regular payments for various purportedly official purposes. By the time she approached me, she had spent more than $1 million dollars. It is still difficult for her to believe she has been scammed. She still wants to believe there is an inheritance waiting for her.",19,856,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00856
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Scammers are essentially criminals who are trying to steal. Digitisation has simply created an easier way for them to do so. I do not think there is a crisis of confidence in digitisation, but rather this is a matter on which each consumer must learn to be more careful and vigilant. Just as in the real world, we take precautions, such as not leaving our wallets and phones lying around, or leaving our houses unlocked when we are out, we must exercise the same care digitally.",20,857,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00857
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The third challenge is where the losses for these scams should fall. Generally, we are all sympathetic to the victim, who have been taken advantage of. Some have lost life savings or monies they needed for important purposes. Some of the victims I have met at the Meet-the-People Sessions have had heart wrenching stories. There are calls for more of these losses to fall on telco operators and/or banks, or generally, any other big companies that may be involved in this process.",21,858,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00858
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"There are several attractions to this approach. We all believe that big companies should be better able to bear losses than individuals. We also want to put more pressure on big companies to take the necessary precautions to protect individuals. I would, however, like to highlight some risks I see if we swing too far in this direction.",22,859,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00859
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"First, every large company, including banks and telcos, have to make money from their customers and if taking a large proportion of losses from online scams falls on them, they will have to recoup these losses from one of their customers. So, we may see prices rising across the board.",23,860,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00860
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Second, this may mean that more invasive approaches by service providers to their customers. For example, if telcos are held liable for scams through phone calls or WhatsApp messages, they probably going to have to take more efforts to monitor and scan private calls and messages in order to ferret out scams. To what extent do we want banks to second guess instructions and transactions?",24,861,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00861
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The third point, that of moral hazard, has been recognised. If people believe that losses may fail elsewhere, they are more likely to take less precaution.",25,862,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00862
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Balancing these considerations, Singapore has taken a three-pronged approach to fight scams.",26,863,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00863

I think many of us already have this adopted.",27,864,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00864
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Second, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) adopts downstream measures, including trying to chase down scams syndicates. I think there was a report in The Straits Times that at least one scam had been successfully cracked with this, adverting over $12.6 million in losses – a drop in the ocean but a step in the right direction.",28,865,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00865
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The Singapore Police Force (SPF) have also begun working with banks to tackle this issue. One example of this the work with OCBC Bank in March 2023 to use robotic processes automation to allow them to identify potential scammers. MAS has also been involved in this approach to combat scams, working closely with banks to strengthen anti-malware controls, faults surveillance and detection capabilities. Major retail banks have enhanced their security measures. So, certainly, bigger organisations and the Government are taking steps to fight scams.",29,866,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00866
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Of course, the most important approach is the third aspect, which is public education. I think SPF, Cyber Security Agency, MoneySENSE and banks have used multiple platforms, reach out to residents and many of us, Members of Parliament, have also been conducting talks and dialogues in our constituencies to encourage people to download ScamShield and to warn them about the risks of scams.",30,867,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00867

2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"There was a recent crackdown in Singapore where large numbers of people were arrested and I believe a large part of this money is from crimes committed abroad.

2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"This is a matter that affects all countries and other countries like the UK, Australia and the United States and also similarly taking these approaches to fight scams. One initiative that caught my attention was actually ""Stop Scams UK"", which is an industry led collaboration of businesses, including major banks, credit card operators and big online players, such as Amazon and Google.",33,870,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00870
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In the UK, just like in Singapore, fraud is the most commonly experienced crime. In the UK, one is twice as likely to be the victim of a fraud than any other crime. What is interesting here is this is a private-sector-led initiative. This may have been partly motivated by UK's legal measures to require banks to reimburse victims of authorised push payment or APP scams. This is where a payee poses as someone else and defrauds victims to make payment. By placing potential lability on private sector players, they have been financially incentivised to get together to work to stop APP scams. The jury is now whether this will work or whether it may increase moral hazard and increase the incidence of frauds, but we should keep a watch on it.",34,871,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00871
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"It should be noted that despite the seemingly radical approach, the UK's aim is to reduce fraud by 10%. Even they are not ambitious or claiming that it can be completely eradicated but they just want to reduce the incidence. So, this is something that is going to be with us, but with which we all have to take the necessary precautions.",35,872,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00872
2024-01-10-T-011,Vikram Nair,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In Singapore, it may be necessary for the Government to take the lead in these initiatives and/or in the passed legislation, to put adequate risk for industry players. MAS' risk-sharing framework is a start and it is one thing that can be reviewed and modified, if needed, to balance the allocation of risks amongst the different players. I believe that financially aligned industry collaboration is, in general, a sensible approach.",36,873,2024-01-10-T-011-S-00873

2024-01-10-T-013,Tan Kiat How,Mr Tan Kiat How,"Singapore is well placed to harness the power of AI, as we have done in previous waves of technological change. The Government's approach has always been to support our businesses and workers to adapt to changes so that they can fully benefit from the opportunities that digital technologies can bring. Some examples include how we are using Jobs Transformation Maps (JTMs), which are specific to different sectors, help employers and workers understand and prepare themselves for future tech-enabled job roles. SkillsFuture and Workforce Singapore offer programmes to support workers to upskill and reskill to take on new jobs. For those who wish to transit to tech roles, they can tap on IMDA's TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) programme.

As Dr Wan Rizal, Assoc Prof Razwana Begum, Ms Nadia Samdin as well as Ms Mariam Jaafar had mentioned, such risks include exposure to harmful online content, such as cyberbullying and self-harm content, as well as excessive and problematic use of social media. To mitigate these risks to Singaporean users, MCI has introduced regulatory measures to enhance online safety for users, which Minister Josephine Teo will touch on later.",7,889,2024-01-10-T-013-S-00889

Unlike existing frameworks to equip Singaporeans with digital skills for the workplace or specific sectors, DSL outlines the digital skills to enable Singaporeans to carry out day-to-day tasks online. We have referenced overseas examples and got inputs from experts. But more importantly, we heard from Singaporeans themselves. We learned from our insights from reaching out to more than 280,000 seniors through the Seniors Go Digital programme over the last three years and I would like to especially thank the 16,000 learners who were part of the pilot last year for their valuable feedback.",57,939,2024-01-10-T-013-S-00939

Secondly, exploring information online. Through the Internet, we can access limitless information and new opportunities. But we need to know how to search, view and retrieve this information safely for our use. Thirdly, communicating online with others. Fourthly, transacting online for greater convenience – accessing banking and Government services, booking healthcare appointments, just to name a few examples.

A few years ago, I met an elderly lady at the SG Digital Community Hub at Heartbeat@Bedok. She was asking our Digital Ambassador many questions on how to use her smartphone and I saw her taking copious notes down on a small, little notepad. She was probably around her late fifties and early sixties, speaking in Mandarin. When I asked what she was learning, her answer both surprised and inspired me. She said that she was a victim of an online scam and she lost some money. She was there to learn how to make sure that this would not happen to her again. So, instead of being fearful and withdrawing, she wanted to confront the issue head on by learning how to safeguard herself.",59,941,2024-01-10-T-013-S-00941

Learners can also learn at your own pace and access videos and guidebooks on the Digital for Life Portal.

Additionally, telcos have implemented firewalls within their networks to proactively block suspicious calls and calls that attempt to spoof local numbers. These efforts have also been helpful. The volume of suspicious international calls blocked in 2023 has nearly doubled compared to a year ago. To further protect the public, telcos have now introduced an option for subscribers to block their mobile phones from receiving international calls, which is a common source of scam calls.",37,987,2024-01-10-T-013-S-00987
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Sir, whilst we can introduce blocking measures, we must expect the scammers to keep starting fires in new ways. As mentioned by Mr Ong, scammers are increasingly abusing online platforms to deceive their potential victims. To deal with this more effectively, we introduced the Online Criminal Harms Act (OCHA), which will be progressively implemented from this year. Many Members supported the Bill and I thank them again.",38,988,2024-01-10-T-013-S-00988
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"This Act will allow authorities to order the swift blocking of online accounts or content suspected to be used for crimes, including scams. For the protection of consumer on high-risk platforms, we will also impose ex-ante requirements such as stricter requirements for identity verification.",39,989,2024-01-10-T-013-S-00989
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"The second set of preventive safeguards aim to disrupt fraudulent transactions, even after a victim has been tricked. This includes preventing Singpass accounts from being taken over. It is why last year, we introduced more friction into the authentication process for Singpass.",40,990,2024-01-10-T-013-S-00990
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"When conducting high-risk transactions, users are required to perform facial verification. To protect against impersonation attempts, which Ms Hazel Poa asked about, facial verification includes liveness checks, which guards against attacks such as using a still photo.",41,991,2024-01-10-T-013-S-00991
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Facial verification was also introduced as an additional safeguard for high-risk CPF e-services. Since then, there have been no further losses to scams due to unauthorised CPF withdrawals.",42,992,2024-01-10-T-013-S-00992
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Also last year, we observed the emergence of scammers exploiting malware to bypass existing safeguards and make unauthorised fraudulent transactions on victims' accounts. Having identified this new scam variant, we worked with the banks to enhance their fraud and malware detection capabilities. Compromised devices were prevented from transacting with the banks. We cannot quantify it but millions more dollars could otherwise have been lost.",43,993,2024-01-10-T-013-S-00993
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Ultimately, our devices themselves must be better able to defend against malware attacks launched by scammers – Ms Tin spoke about this. We are therefore working with key industry players to enhance the security of mobile devices sold in Singapore. For instance, we are working with Google to design new features that can better detect and deter users from downloading malicious files onto Android devices.",44,994,2024-01-10-T-013-S-00994
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"The third set of measures involve harsher consequences to deter money mules from misusing our key digital services, such as Singpass, to perpetrate scams. We have recently tightened our legislation to criminalise individuals who intentionally disclose their Singpass credentials in aid of scams. We are also reviewing how to extend these principles to those who sell SIM cards to scammers.",45,995,2024-01-10-T-013-S-00995
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Sir, fighting scams is a team effort and the Government cannot do it alone. Ms Tan spoke about the need for platform players, telcos and device manufacturers to do more to improve online safety for their users. We agree. As mentioned by Mr Ong and Mr Tan, we need companies to ensure that their customers can enjoy a safe and secure environment as they interact online.",46,996,2024-01-10-T-013-S-00996
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Last August, OCBC was among the first banks in Singapore to disallow account access, if the bank app detected the presence of potentially risky mobile apps on the customers' devices. Some customers felt inconvenienced, but in fact, they may have been among those that were saved from at least $2 million in losses in the first month of roll-out. The MAS has since worked with other major banks to implement similar safeguards.",47,997,2024-01-10-T-013-S-00997
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Several MPs also spoke about the need for larger companies to take more responsibility to mitigate scams by unauthorised transactions. This year, the upcoming Shared Responsibility Framework (SRF) will further enhance the accountability of the banks and telcos in protecting their customers from the threat of phishing scams. During the public consultation on the SRF, many suggestions were received, which are similar to those raised today. They relate to the expansion of coverage to more scam types and more entities, besides banks and telcos.",48,998,2024-01-10-T-013-S-00998
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"The SRF covers phishing scams because such scams were the main contributor to fraudulent transactions taking place without the consumer's knowledge and consent when SRF was first conceived. Compared to the payout frameworks in other jurisdictions, which only impose obligations on banks, the SRF already holds a wider scope of entities accountable by including telcos.",49,999,2024-01-10-T-013-S-00999
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Duties are also specified to clearly hold banks and telcos accountable to the victims. Even if there is no breach of duty and, hence, no payout under SRF, there are other avenues of recourse for victims. These include banks' goodwill frameworks, which can provide some comfort to victims of new scam tactics. As was shared in Parliament last year, MAS has leaned on the banks to be more accommodative in applying their goodwill frameworks.",50,1000,2024-01-10-T-013-S-01000
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"These complementary measures notwithstanding, the Government will consider how to enhance the accountability of key entities and strengthen protection for individuals within SRF or through other means that are available to us.",51,1001,2024-01-10-T-013-S-01001
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"We hear the specific calls to include social media platforms and closed-messaging services, in particular, for scam variants involving malware and phishing that result in unauthorised transactions. I appreciate Mr Vikram Nair and Ms Hazel Poa's acknowledgment that there are trade-offs and moral hazards to consider and that the Government cannot take a one-size-fits-all approach.",52,1002,2024-01-10-T-013-S-01002
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"With regard to physical tokens, these are available upon customer request. I should caution, however, that existing physical tokens may be resistant to malware, but they are still vulnerable to phishing tactics. Agencies are, therefore, studying longer-term solutions, such as the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) passkeys that were mentioned by Ms Tin.",53,1003,2024-01-10-T-013-S-01003
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Sir, I thank Members who have recognised the many steps we are taking and also the challenges our agencies face, such as those identified by Mr Vikram Nair. To Mr Yip Hon Weng's suggestion to learn from best practices abroad, we have been proactive. Our efforts include exchanging information on the latest scam variants and strategies to combat scams.",54,1004,2024-01-10-T-013-S-01004
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"However, all of these efforts notwithstanding, this may still beg the question, ""Has Singapore been slack in fighting scams?""",55,1005,2024-01-10-T-013-S-01005
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"On the contrary, Singapore is widely regarded as a leader in thought and action when it comes to battling scams. When interacting with our international counterparts, I can only share with you how much they marvel at some of the initiatives that we have put in place, which they consider quite unthinkable in their own context and still quite cutting edge. And these include widespread call blocking, the SMS Sender ID Registry (SSIR) and the kill switches that the banks now use; and also CPF Board.",56,1006,2024-01-10-T-013-S-01006
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"The fact that we have an Anti-Scam Command, which involves the co-location of banks and, soon, other entities that we are speaking with; the fact that we have ScamShield; and something that people in the trade are very interested about  the backend processes that none of us will get to talk about in this room – among the agencies and all the stakeholders to smoothen the process of following up on leads – that is something that they find very difficult to even bring about.",57,1007,2024-01-10-T-013-S-01007
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Many measures have also reduced the losses – stemmed the losses – to a very significant extent. So, then that begs the question, ""What about these rankings that you come across that named Singapore as one of these top places in terms of how much victims have lost?""",58,1008,2024-01-10-T-013-S-01008
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Well, I can only say this. In many places, scam victims are not going to take the trouble to report the fact that they have been scammed, because they do not expect whichever authority they report to, to be able to do anything about it. And so, when these kinds of reports are a function of reporting, what this really tells us is that reporting levels in Singapore are very high. This is, of course, not to trivialise the amounts lost. But I think we have to recognise that fact.",59,1009,2024-01-10-T-013-S-01009
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"In this regard, I think we also have to recognise that our members of the public have been quite remarkable in terms of their openness and willingness to pay attention to public education efforts on scams. I appreciate that it sometimes makes them quite anxious – because they keep hearing about it when they are at the bus stop, they see it when they are at the void deck and they see the digital display panels and then they go to a grassroots event and the Member of Parliament is also advising them to listen to the Police talk about anti-scam measures. So, I appreciate this. It gives a certain sense of anxiety.",60,1010,2024-01-10-T-013-S-01010
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"But it is an essential part of our overall scam defence which we cannot avoid and which we aim to fortify through a variety of means. And so, the question is  what more can we do?",61,1011,2024-01-10-T-013-S-01011
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"First, let us take a step back and acknowledge that all countries recognise that when it comes to dealing with scams, there is really no silver bullet. There is not a single measure that you can implement and be done with it. In the trade, they call this a wicked problem. In cyber as well as in scams, you solve one problem, the bad actors are driven somewhere else and you have to start again.",62,1012,2024-01-10-T-013-S-01012
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Therefore, an agile approach is critical and a very good example is how we had to very quickly pivot to dealing with the malware-enabled scams which had not been conceived of before and had not been seen before. It is very easy to say that, ""You should have anticipated it."" Not so easy in reality.",63,1013,2024-01-10-T-013-S-01013
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"The last thing, in this context, is not for us to politicise the debate or to vilify any group because you do not know when the next scam variant comes around who you need to work with to try and solve the problem. So, vilifying any group is not a good idea and we should very consciously try to avoid this. This is a problem that has emerged and we have observed in other countries. This is one lesson that we are taking away. Do not go around vilifying various groups and saying that you should have done this, you should have done that. We will need them at some point. It is better to preserve the relationship and find ways to work together.",64,1014,2024-01-10-T-013-S-01014

I could not help but notice that, amongst the Members who spoke from the Workers' Party, there was this term that was repeated quite a few times. This is what Mr Vikram Nair also responded to. He said that he disagreed with this idea that there is a crisis of confidence.",65,1015,2024-01-10-T-013-S-01015
2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),I am not sure what the purpose of describing this problem this way is.

2024-01-10-T-013,Josephine Teo,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"I say to Members, have a care. This is a tough fight and I think our agencies and all the people involved they are not just public officers. By all means recognise the fact that there are also private sector players involved.

I call on Members to please use your own networks and your social media influence not to spread this, you know, very easy labels, to tag onto something like this, but to spread awareness of the tools that can really help people.

Online harms are notoriously nebulous and regulating them is difficult because, although they are undesirable and morally questionable, many of them are not, strictly speaking, illegal. For instance, how do we define and regulate trolling, cancel campaigns and the issue of body shaming online? Different people would understand and interpret them somewhat differently, depending on whether they are engaging those activities or are on the receiving end of such behaviours.",7,1061,2024-01-10-T-013-S-01061

Worryingly, there are also youths who believe that women who upload images online should be accepting of negative comments; as in, it is acceptable to receive sexually explicit images even when unrequested.

Our fellow citizens and residents came out in so many different ways to help one another. We did not need a committee or extensive discussions or we did not need to fill out multiple pages of applications. Many across all strata of our society stepped forward in small and not so small ways. Public, private and people sectors acted spontaneously, responding to needs from basic necessities to financial support and financial support for both individuals as well as businesses and to caring for each other.",6,1118,2024-01-10-T-015-S-01118

In the simplest definition, this describes the active engagement and mobilising of all of society in acts of giving and generosity. These would be through giving of time such as volunteerism and befriending, the giving of talent such as giving expertise and programme development and also the giving of treasures through direct donations.",9,1121,2024-01-10-T-015-S-01121

2024-01-10-T-015,Keith Chua,Mr Keith Chua (Nominated Member),"If I look back, the response that we see in appeals for help and contributions should continue to be an encouragement to all of us. I recall years back, how society responded in highly generous giving when we became aware of, for example, a foreign worker injured and needing financial help or individuals and their families needing particular financial support for specialised medical treatments. If you look over the years, you would find that our live charity shows, for example, bring together wide sections of our society in generous and spontaneous giving.",11,1123,2024-01-10-T-015-S-01123

While there are the natural and the normal priorities for our foreign missions such as economic and trade development, diplomacy and political engagement, we can also, through our foreign missions, continue to plant seeds of generosity in tangible and meaningful ways. I visited Myanmar in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis and had several meetings with our then Ambassador. He was personally engaged in helping local communities in development initiatives, among which, would be the provision of affordable, clean water solutions.

2024-01-10-T-015,Keith Chua,Mr Keith Chua (Nominated Member),A nation with a spirit of generosity is a breath of fresh air to a troubled world. Allow me to summarise and conclude with some thoughts and suggestions for further consideration.,24,1136,2024-01-10-T-015-S-01136
2024-01-10-T-015,Keith Chua,Mr Keith Chua (Nominated Member),"Firstly, develop Singapore as the Silicon Valley of philanthropy. A visionary Singapore philanthropist shared this idea recently. The more I reflect on it, the more strongly I feel we should take this suggestion seriously as we continue to develop Singapore as a philanthropy hub. Attracting both the financial resources and the service providers to work out local, regional and global solutions is such a powerful and impactful combination.",25,1137,2024-01-10-T-015-S-01137
2024-01-10-T-015,Keith Chua,Mr Keith Chua (Nominated Member),"Secondly, review the current 2.5 times tax deduction for donations to Institutions of Public Character (IPCs). I had made an appeal for the 2.5 times tax incentive to IPCs to be made available for longer than three year cycles, to enable longer-term planning in both giving and in receiving. Providing, for example, a five year or longer, rolling cycle would enable both the donors and the beneficiaries to enhance planning of services with greater certainty.",26,1138,2024-01-10-T-015-S-01138
2024-01-10-T-015,Keith Chua,Mr Keith Chua (Nominated Member),"Thirdly, as I touched on briefly earlier, promote giving as a family. We can action this as part of bringing generosity to the next level and to encourage active participation across all generations. My generation may be more comfortable with direct donations and this is still one of the more common methods. Amongst the younger generation, there may be more interest in volunteerism and direct engagement.",27,1139,2024-01-10-T-015-S-01139
2024-01-10-T-015,Keith Chua,Mr Keith Chua (Nominated Member),"Fourthly, encourage and nurture Singaporeans to become ambassadors for good. Singapore Citizens are fortunate. We have one of the most accessible passports in the world. Yes, this enables us to pursue our business and economic interests, and there is great benefit for that. Yes, this also makes our leisure pursuits more convenient. But how about actively considering the social opportunity that this presents?",28,1140,2024-01-10-T-015-S-01140
2024-01-10-T-015,Keith Chua,Mr Keith Chua (Nominated Member),"Fifthly, actively encourage and build collaboration. We are seeing this, over the years, growing very much so locally. But I would look at international giving. I would propose to encourage that we encourage stronger and intentional public, private and people sector collaboration. Temasek Foundation and SIF, our larger private foundations and philanthropic groups can increasingly take the lead to bring generosity beyond our borders as Team Singapore.",29,1141,2024-01-10-T-015-S-01141
2024-01-10-T-015,Keith Chua,Mr Keith Chua (Nominated Member),"Six, consider to promote internationalisation. Just as our social entrepreneurs look to scale their programmes outside of Singapore, could we look at a suitable support programme for internationalisation for suitable social service agencies. I am thinking of an approach similar to the Enterprise Singapore support for local companies to internationalise.",30,1142,2024-01-10-T-015-S-01142
2024-01-10-T-015,Keith Chua,Mr Keith Chua (Nominated Member),"Seven, maintain a healthy donor-beneficiary relationship. We need to maintain a healthy balance between donor and beneficiary organisation. Beneficiary organisations are expected to be responsible and accountable for public funds and donations. Donors may need to recognise and appreciate that the beneficiary organisations are expected to deliver high levels of service in their area of specialisation. They may also be more attuned to needs on the ground and therefore more knowledgeable, both in service delivery and needs. While fiduciary responsibility remains a collective responsibility, not every aspect of service delivery can be brought back to a simple cost denominator. For instance, the care of certain groups with special needs can require a high ratio, even one-to-one staffing such as adults with autism in a care facility.",31,1143,2024-01-10-T-015-S-01143
2024-01-10-T-015,Keith Chua,Mr Keith Chua (Nominated Member),"Eight, maybe we need to rethink the phrase ""he who pays the piper calls the tune"". When it comes to identifying needs in the community and allocation of resources, we also need to keep the right balance so that the funding of initiatives does not result in solely being donor driven. We need to provide adequate space so that there is regular and adequate input from service providers and their beneficiaries.",32,1144,2024-01-10-T-015-S-01144
2024-01-10-T-015,Keith Chua,Mr Keith Chua (Nominated Member),"Ninth, we have had an extensive discussion on this, harness technology.

To do this, NEA moderates the rent of hawker stalls by not setting reserve rents in the tender of stalls and disallowing subletting. In addition, NEA has put in place support measures to help hawkers enhance their productivity. For example, the Productive Hawker Centres programme provides a subsidy for hawker centres to adopt centralised dishwashing and the Hawkers’ Productivity Grant provides co-funding for the purchase of kitchen automation equipment and digital solutions.",1,1196,2024-01-10-T-020-S-01196

Therefore, the only way to do this is via Government regulation.",2,1257,2024-01-10-T-037-S-01257

The programme aimed to improve productivity for companies by consolidating deliveries at an intermediate site, thus reducing the number of total deliveries made to malls. However, the adoption rate for this pilot was low, with only 13 companies participating. Feedback from companies indicated a preference for maintaining existing long-term logistics contracts with 3PLs or their fleet, as this option provides them with greater control over service requirements like frequency of delivery.

As the shortening of Services 162/162M and 75 also affect these commuters, LTA decided to retain Service 167 at a reduced frequency for now, to give commuters more time to adjust to the new travel arrangements. We proceeded with the changes to Services 162/162M and 75, as the ridership on these services had declined significantly after TEL3 started operations. LTA also made adjustments to increase the frequency of other services such as 121 and 980 to ensure that there is sufficient capacity on alternative routes for commuters.",2,1285,2024-01-10-T-044-S-01285

2024-01-10-T-047,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the rationale for requiring at least one of the co-applicants or co-occupiers of first-timer families applying for HDB flats to have worked continuously for 12 months to be eligible for the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (Families); and (b) whether the Government plans to review the need and period of this continuous employment requirement.,1,1300,2024-01-10-T-047-S-01300
2024-01-10-T-047,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Government is committed to helping Singaporeans, particularly first-timers and lower to middle-income families, own a home. On top of providing significant market discounts in pricing new flats, we offer generous housing grants to further support first-timer home buyers. For example, eligible first-timer families may receive up to $80,000 of Enhanced Central Provident Fund (CPF) Housing Grant (EHG) when they buy a new or resale flat. The EHG amount is tiered by household income, to provide more support for those with lower household income.",1,1301,2024-01-10-T-047-S-01301
2024-01-10-T-047,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"To qualify for the EHG, at least one member of the core family nucleus must be in continuous employment for at least 12 months, amongst other conditions. The 12-month continuous employment condition provides a good proxy of a household’s financial situation, so that the corresponding means-tested grant amount can be determined fairly.",2,1302,2024-01-10-T-047-S-01302

For eligible young couples comprising full-time students or National Servicemen, as well as those who have recently completed their studies or National Service, who may face difficulties meeting the continuous employment condition at the point of application for an HFE letter, they may still apply for an HFE letter first, while the assessment of their income for the EHG and HDB housing loan is deferred closer to key collection.

2024-01-10-T-048,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In the short term, we can weather the impact of the Red Sea situation on the flow of supplies to Singapore. We have sufficient stockpiles of critical supplies. In addition, more time-sensitive cargo is transported by air rather than via the Red Sea. Likewise, Singapore’s oil supply is not expected to be significantly impacted, as oil from the surrounding Middle Eastern region is primarily transported through the Strait of Hormuz. However, we can expect some increase in sea freight costs from the longer voyages and higher insurance costs. If the Red Sea situation worsens, the supply chain disruptions may cause an indirect longer-term impact.",2,1307,2024-01-10-T-048-S-01307

Accounts are suspended if the borrower is 60 days past due on their payments. Mortgages, which constitute the largest liability for households, are subject to both a loan-to-value limit and a total debt servicing limit, with the latter based on a borrower’s income.

2024-01-10-T-050,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Upon receipt of the feedback, HDB will carry out inspection to determine the source of the condensation. One of the common causes of air-conditioner condensation includes the use of air conditioner at prolonged low temperature with the air outlet louvres set to non-oscillating mode. HDB will also advise both flat owners of the actions that they can take to resolve the issue, such as setting the louvres to oscillating mode to minimise the concentration of cold air at a particular location and for the affected flat owners to keep their units well-ventilated to minimise mould growth.",2,1315,2024-01-10-T-050-S-01315

2024-01-10-T-054,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong (for the Prime Minister),"MAS works closely with financial institutions, industry players and other Government agencies to implement technologies and solutions to counter increasingly sophisticated scam tactics employed by scammers. A recent example is the enhancement of banks’ banking apps which block access to the app when there is a side-loaded app with access permissions turned on in the customer’s mobile phone. This enhancement has led to a significant reduction in the number of malware-enabled scams in recent months.
