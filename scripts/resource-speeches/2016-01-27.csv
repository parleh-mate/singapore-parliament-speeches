2016-01-27-T-001,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"Before I proceed to call Members, just a reminder, because we have a lot of new Members, that supplementary questions are not speeches. So, please make your supplementary questions short, succinct and to the point. Mr Christopher de Souza.",1,1,2016-01-27-T-001-S-00001
2016-01-27-T-002,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"asked	 the Minister for Home Affairs in light of the 14 January 2016 bombing in Jakarta, what is being done to (i) step up Singapore's border security and internal security and (ii) increase the vigilance of Singaporeans, the resident population and the Home Team.",1,2,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00002
2016-01-27-T-002,Joan Pereira,Ms Joan Pereira,"asked	 the Minister for Home Affairs in view of the number of terrorist incidents globally and Singapore's status as a travel hub, what new measures are put in place to ensure our domestic security while maintaining our lead as a travel destination and attraction.",1,3,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00003
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"Mdm Speaker, there is a question set down by Ms Tin Pei Ling tomorrow, but it is on a related topic. So, if Mdm Speaker would permit, I would like to answer Question Nos 1 and 2 together. And if Ms Tin is satisfied with the answer, she could perhaps withdraw the question for tomorrow.",1,4,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00004
2016-01-27-T-002,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,"I will leave the second part to Ms Tin. But I agree to the merger of Question Nos 1 and 2, for them to be taken together.",1,5,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00005
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Thank you, Madam. First, I will start off with the question by Ms Tin Pei Ling. She asked about the terrorism threat assessment in ASEAN. The terrorism threat in Southeast Asia is serious and persistent. In addition to terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda and its regional affiliates such as the Jemaah Islamiyah, the conflict in Syria and Iraq and the emergence of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) have significantly raised the threat level.",1,6,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00006
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"ISIS has attracted many foreign fighters to its ranks. Regional authorities estimate that some 1,000 Southeast Asians may have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight for ISIS. Over 70 of them may have died in the fighting, several as suicide bombers. At the same time, several self-radicalised Southeast Asians who were unable to travel to Syria or Iraq to fight have heeded the call by ISIS to carry out terrorist attacks in their home countries in pursuit of the ISIS cause to expand its self-proclaimed ""caliphate"". The Indonesian and Malaysian authorities have collectively arrested over 100 of their citizens for ISIS-related activities and thwarted several planned attacks in their own countries. Even then, four Indonesian ISIS supporters succeeded in carrying out a terrorist attack in downtown Jakarta on 14 January this year.",2,7,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00007
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,The Southeast Asian fighters pose a serious security threat when they return with battlefield experience from Syria and Iraq. A sizeable number of them have formed a dedicated group in Syria called the Katibah Nusantara lid Daulah Islamiyah or Malay Archipelago Unit for ISIS. They can be expected to use the fighting experience that they have acquired to carry out terrorist attacks in this region.,3,8,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00008
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"ISIS declared in November 2014 its intention to set up ""wilayat"" or provinces in Indonesia and the Philippines. The establishment of an ISIS ""wilayat"" in Southeast Asia would further raise the terrorism threat to Singapore.",4,9,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00009
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Ms Tin also asked whether there have been further reports of Singaporeans intending to join ISIS. So far, at least two Singapore citizens are known to have made their way to Syria with their families to take part in the conflict there. Last year, four Singaporeans were detained and a fifth was issued a Restriction Order, on the basis that they intended to fight for ISIS in Syria and Iraq. One of those detained had planned to carry out terrorist attacks in Singapore on behalf of ISIS if he was unable to travel overseas. There are others who have expressed interest to go to Syria to fight and have been investigated or are currently under investigation. Most of them were radicalised by online videos and articles, and through social media postings. This problem of self-radicalisation continues to be a concern in Singapore.",5,10,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00010
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The global and regional terrorism situation is worrying. The recent attacks in Paris and in Jakarta involved multiple gunmen carrying explosives and heavy firearms, targeting soft targets packed with people who have little or no security protection, and with the aim of inflicting maximum casualties. Against this heightened threat environment, the Home Team has adopted a multi-pronged approach, and I would like to highlight three key measures.",6,11,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00011
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"First, Singapore is a major transport hub in the region. More than half a million people pass through our checkpoints every day. Our Woodlands checkpoint is the busiest land checkpoint in the world. These present security risks. Attackers can gather and plan just outside Singapore before coming into Singapore to carry out the attack. This would be similar to the attacks on Paris, where the planning and preparation were probably carried out in Molenbeek where security was less tight. Border control is therefore our first line of defence to prevent an attack from taking place in Singapore.",7,12,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00012
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) therefore conducts checks on travellers, vehicles, baggage and cargo at all our air, land and sea checkpoints and puts in place visible deterrent measures to detect and deny attempts to smuggle prohibited items or persons. The Police Coast Guard has also increased its patrols along our coastline and will be developing a more comprehensive set of physical barriers that will complement these coastal patrols. We will continue to assess the threat level and adjust the security measures at our borders accordingly.",8,13,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00013
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"But as Ms Joan Pereira's question has suggested, it is a constant challenge to manage the balance between maintaining vigilance and security at our checkpoints and facilitating speedy and efficient travel, especially in the current heightened threat environment. Some of the enhanced security measures at the land check points will cause inconvenience to travellers. This is especially so during festive seasons and holidays like the upcoming Chinese New Year period, when traveller volume is expected to increase. We are making further investments in technology to help us maintain a high level of security at our checkpoints, while facilitating efficient travel. For instance, ICA will implement the BioScreen initiative across all checkpoints to capture the fingerprints of all arriving persons by June 2016. These records will allow us to verify the traveller's identity before he is allowed entry to Singapore and will facilitate automated self-clearance during his departure.",9,14,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00014
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Under the current heightened threat environment, our security agencies will continue to work closely with international and regional security partners through the exchange of intelligence and information to more effectively combat terrorism. The Police have also enhanced security measures and vigilance. The installation of police cameras at all HDB blocks and multi-storey carparks will be completed by this year, and we will look into installing more cameras in HDB estates and other public areas. Police have also stepped-up patrols in crowded areas and conducted exercises to raise the level of preparedness of its officers in response to a terrorist attack. In fact, more than 1,800 Home Team officers participated in a multi-agency security exercise on the night of 19 January 2016 to test our contingency and security response plans during a terrorist attack. Participants were not informed prior to this surprise exercise in order to test their response.",10,15,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00015
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We will also work with commercial and private establishments to enhance security measures at their premises. One platform is the Safety and Security Watch Group (SSWG). Through SSWG, the Police and the business community have forged a close partnership to counter the threat posed by terrorism. Building managers or owners and security personnel work together with the Police to assess localised threats, share knowledge and pool resources to enhance their security. Response protocols are drawn up to deal with crisis situations. Tabletop exercises and live exercises are also being carried to test the plans and validate and refine the contingency plans. The Police will continue to assess the threat level and step-up patrols when necessary.",11,16,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00016
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Even as we enhance security at our borders and within Singapore, Government efforts alone will not be adequate. Dealing with terrorism is not just about action by security forces. Each and every one of us has an important part to play. We must be more alert to help prevent a terrorist attack from happening. Should an attack take place, we must be able to respond in a number of ways. Above all, when a terrorist attack happens, we must stay united and resilient as one people. This was indeed the tenor of many speeches in the course of the debate on the President's Address these past few days.",12,17,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00017
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In the coming months, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) will be working with our partners to further strengthen our community vigilance, cohesion and resilience. We will conduct regular and realistic exercises to help various community groups to be better prepared for and to remain resilient in the aftermath of any attack.",13,18,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00018
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Terrorists seek to threaten our security and our way of life. They seek to instil fear and divide the community. Should a terrorist attack occur, it is important for all of us to stand united against these threats, with a spirit of resilience and determination that we should not be defeated.",14,19,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00019
2016-01-27-T-002,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Madam, I would like to ask whether the CCTV footage in the Jakarta and Paris bombings played a significant role in the detention of terrorists, post the events, as well as exposing evidential leads to where the masterminds were operating from in each of those cities. If MHA's view is that the CCTV footage provided significant evidence, how can we deploy such technology and strategy in Singapore? May I ask this to complement the Senior Minister of State's previously comprehensive answer?",1,20,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00020
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Madam, I agree with the hon Member. In fact, on 25 January, Monday evening, Channel NewsAsia's Saifulbahari Ismail interviewed the Jakarta Police Chief on television, and he mentioned that he would like to see better CCTV and digital coverage of the city that would enable security forces to better deal with the situation.",1,21,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00021
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"CCTV and video coverage or the leverage of technology as it advances can achieve a couple of things. First is deterrence. Second is	 detection, and especially with analytics, you might be able to, through technology, analyse and detect certain patterns of behaviour. Third, it permits real time incident management. If you have a ""live"" feed as a situation unfolds, security forces will have a better feel on what is happening on the ground. Lastly, as the Member has alluded to, post-incident management, not only in the cold light of day or aftermath, but in the tension and the ambiguity as to whether the situation has ended or still ongoing. That will also provide some support.",2,22,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00022
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As I said earlier, Police cameras have been rolled out and will be rolled out by the end of this year across our estates. We are studying the possibility of putting more cameras in public areas – the study is still ongoing.",3,23,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00023
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We have been working and will continue to work with agencies such as the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to leverage on CCTV cameras that are already out there in the public, and leverage on existing cameras that other agencies use for various purposes in order to help us in our counter-terror efforts.",4,24,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00024
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"We also work with private and commercial premises and businesses – I spoke earlier about the SSWG. As of last December, there are about 1,300-plus building operators that have participated in our SSWG clusters. Under this effort, Police will work with them and engage them to install video surveillance systems, to allow access and to expand coverage.",5,25,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00025
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"In addition to localised clusters, we also work with specific industry sectors, for example, with the chemical sector, the security sector, the hotel sector and with F&B, amongst others to help them harden what would otherwise be potentially soft targets.",6,26,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00026
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Lastly, members of the public – you and I – can play a role. There are many smartphones out there. There are many vehicle cameras out there. There is an app known as Police@SG. If you have not downloaded it, please do. It allows people to submit videos, photographs, information to the Police. We will filter it. It allows close to real time analysis of videos. Hopefully, that will enhance our capabilities. We also have a scheme known as Vehicles on Watch (VOW) where members of the public keep their vehicle cameras on in the cars. That helps to just add extra layers of vigilance.",7,27,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00027
2016-01-27-T-002,Cedric Foo Chee Keng,Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer),"Can the Senior Member of State brief the House on counter-terrorism measures relating to air and sea and port facilities, like the air marshal programme and the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS)?",1,28,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00028
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"There are certain security measures which, for operational reasons, would not be appropriate for me to share in a public forum such as this. But I have spoken about the importance of border security. I had spoken earlier about land, sea and air checkpoints. They have enhanced and perform very thorough checks on all arriving as well as departing travellers, whether it is through our checkpoints on land, both Woodlands and Tuas, through the air, through Changi and Seletar, as well as through sea, through ports.",1,29,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00029
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"But beyond checkpoints, we are also concerned about unauthorised entry. So, our physical borders, not just our checkpoints, are also places that remain vulnerable. The Coast Guard and ICA have enhanced patrols and vigilance. Physical barriers have been and will continue to be erected as an additional barrier to entry. Air security is something that is not just of concern to us in Singapore, but certainly, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and many other agencies internationally, as well as other countries, cooperate very closely and we are plugged into those efforts.",2,30,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00030
2016-01-27-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thank you, Madam. I have two supplementary questions for the Senior Minister of State.",1,31,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00031
2016-01-27-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, he mentioned earlier, of course, the threat of self-radicalised terrorists but he did not elaborate in his answer very much about the Government's strategies to counter that. So, I wonder if he could share with us what the Government is doing in that area. For example, is it making a concerted attempt to block, for example, dangerous Internet sites from being accessible from here?",2,32,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00032
2016-01-27-T-002,Sylvia Lim,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Secondly, relating to security of people coming into Singapore via the air or sea checkpoints, could the Senior Minister of State explain whether there are enhanced measures as in additional checks on passengers coming in on a random basis, or are there more intensive checks based on certain risk criteria?",3,33,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00033
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Within the parameters of the caveat that I gave to the earlier Member, let me deal with Ms Sylvia Lim's questions. First is on self-radicalisation and what the Government has been doing and willing to do. There is, in fact, a Parliamentary Question (PQ) tomorrow set down in the Order Paper, and there will be a comprehensive reply. So, I urge the Member to be patient. There will be a more thorough exposition of the issue tomorrow.",1,34,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00034
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"As far as checkpoints are concerned, we do 100% or close to 100% screening at our checkpoints. Naturally, there will also be selective checks depending on intelligence and other information.",2,35,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00035
2016-01-27-T-002,Speaker,Mdm Speaker,Ms Tin Pei Ling. Last question.,1,36,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00036
2016-01-27-T-002,Tin Pei Ling,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Thank you, Madam, and thank you, Senior Minister of State for the very comprehensive reply. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State, in view of the increasing risk in our region as well as already there are radicalised Singaporeans detected within our own home soil, does the Home Team have the sufficient capacity to prevent or deal with emergencies that may arise from terrorist attacks in Singapore, should it ever happen?",1,37,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00037
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"The Member asked about the capacity to deal with these threats. Madam, terror threats evolve along the way over the years, their modus operandi change, the threat levels change. So, the Home Team needs to be on top of it – needs to be prepared, needs to project, and needs to evolve along the way.",1,38,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00038
2016-01-27-T-002,Desmond Lee,Mr Desmond Lee,"Manpower will always be tight. In fact, the hon Member, Mr de Souza, will ask that question later. Amongst other things, leveraging on technology will help augment our Home Team's capabilities to help create new capabilities that were not existent before technology had advanced to that level. All these things need to be done but on top of that, good training, proper equipping, constant exercises – both planned as well as unplanned exercises that you spring a surprise on the Forces and you test them, and continually learning from the lessons that we pick up from these exercises – need to be done. So, our Forces will be prepared, they have to be, and need to remain on top of the risk.",2,39,2016-01-27-T-002-S-00039
2016-01-27-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,asked	 the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) what has been Singapore's position regarding Syrians who have been forced to flee from their homeland; and (b) what is the Government's assessment on what should and can be done at an international level to provide assistance to those who have been left behind in exceedingly difficult circumstances.,1,40,2016-01-27-T-003-S-00040
2016-01-27-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Mdm Speaker, the ongoing Syrian conflict is a tragedy. Over 220,000 Syrians have been killed. Four million have been forced to flee, and many millions more internally displaced. It does not appear that there will be any resolution soon.",1,41,2016-01-27-T-003-S-00041
2016-01-27-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Our sympathies are with the Syrian people. But as a small densely packed, crowded city-state with limited land, Singapore is not in a position to accept any persons seeking refugee status, regardless of ethnicity or place of origin. This is a long-standing, indeed decades-old, Government policy. In fact, as demonstrated by recent events in Europe, even much bigger countries with substantially more resources at their disposal are now having great difficulty handling the huge influx of refugees into Europe.",2,42,2016-01-27-T-003-S-00042
2016-01-27-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Mr de Souza has also asked what should be done at an international level to provide assistance for Syrians who remain in Syria. The answer is that there needs to be a political solution to end the conflict definitively. Initiatives such as the recent meetings of the International Syria Support Group are certainly a step in the right direction, given the participation of key stakeholders, including, if I may add, that of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Republic of Iran. We were also encouraged by the unanimous adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2254, which laid out a roadmap for a political settlement in Syria. However, achieving this in reality on the ground is much harder than talks and resolutions.",3,43,2016-01-27-T-003-S-00043
2016-01-27-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"The situation in Syria has become extremely challenging and dangerous. Terrorist groups such as Jabhat Al Nusra and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) have exploited the chaos in that area in order to establish control over territory and resources. Syria has become the epicentre for extremism and violence, and this is becoming an international phenomenon. Therefore, any eventual solution is of great interest to the rest of the world but, ultimately, it has to take into account the internal political dynamics within Syria. There also needs to be a clear strategy to deal with the terrorist groups that pose a clear and present global menace, including to us here in Southeast Asia, in Singapore, as the Senior Minister of State Mr Desmond Lee has just elucidated.",4,44,2016-01-27-T-003-S-00044
2016-01-27-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"These difficulties, however, should not detract from the need for the international community to promote a political solution, and to facilitate humanitarian aid to those who need it most.",5,45,2016-01-27-T-003-S-00045
2016-01-27-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Singaporeans who wish to help to alleviate the suffering of Syrians can contribute by donating to legitimate, humanitarian charity organisations that provide emergency relief and rehabilitation support, such as the Singapore Red Cross and the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation started by the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore, or MUIS. In fact, this foundation supports the Temasek Education Centre in Kilis, Turkey that currently provides education for hundreds of displaced Syrian children.",6,46,2016-01-27-T-003-S-00046
2016-01-27-T-003,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for his comprehensive answer. I appreciate the limitations and I would just like to ask whether between now and a political solution to all of these, what more can be done for the suffering women, men and children in besieged cities, such as Aleppo and Deir ez-Zor, in the form of perhaps ration drops or fly-in drops, orchestrated by the international community? I also do appreciate the limitations involved but I think a great deal of moral support, at least attempting to do so, will go a long way for these people in besieged cities.",1,47,2016-01-27-T-003-S-00047
2016-01-27-T-003,Vivian Balakrishnan,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"I thank Mr de Souza for his sympathies for the people. As I had said before, this is a tragedy unfolding in front of our eyes. We will continue to work with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), as well as legitimate humanitarian groups that I outlined earlier. Unfortunately, that is the limit of what we can do right now until a political solution and peace is achieved within that fractured country, and in the region as a whole. In fact, so long as there is instability there, and so long as Syria remains a hotbed attracting extremists and terrorists, or would-be terrorists, from all over the world, including us, we remain at risk.",1,48,2016-01-27-T-003-S-00048
2016-01-27-T-004,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,asked	 the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources with regard to the increasing number of dengue cases (a) whether current enforcement and fines are sufficient to deter owners of properties that are breeding grounds; and (b) what financial and resource support are provided for research to combat and reduce the Aedes mosquito population.,1,49,2016-01-27-T-004-S-00049
2016-01-27-T-004,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Mdm Speaker, over 11,200 dengue cases were reported in 2015, and this is lower than in 2013 and 2014. However, we should worry because in the recent few months, there have been a higher number of cases compared to corresponding periods in previous years. We expect the total number of dengue cases in 2016 to be high, with cases spiking earlier than usual. This increase may be due in part to the change in the main circulating dengue serotype. We have also observed an increase in the Aedes mosquito population. The warmer-than-usual year-end weather due to the El Nino phenomenon has aided the breeding and spread of both Aedes mosquitoes and the dengue virus in Singapore and in the region.",1,50,2016-01-27-T-004-S-00050
2016-01-27-T-004,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Source reduction remains the most effective way to curtail the transmission of dengue. In anticipation of a rise in dengue cases, the National Environment Agency (NEA), together with members of the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force, has stepped up source reduction efforts earlier than usual. From November to December 2015, NEA conducted more than 193,000 inspections and removed more than 4,000 breeding habitats, the majority of which were found in homes, and this can be found in containers, flowerpots, the usual places. NEA has also stepped-up publicity efforts to raise awareness of the ""Five-Step Mozzie Wipeout"" and encourage the community to take part actively to prevent dengue.",2,51,2016-01-27-T-004-S-00051
2016-01-27-T-004,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Owners of premises in dengue clusters found with breeding habitats can be fined up to $5,000 under the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act. Already more than 1,000 households in dengue clusters were fined in 2015. The current penalties have been effective in keeping re-offending rates low. Nonetheless, my Ministry will continue to monitor the situation and introduce stiffer penalties if necessary.",3,52,2016-01-27-T-004-S-00052
2016-01-27-T-004,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"Besides checking homes, NEA has also intensified checks for other areas, including construction sites, and taken stern action against those found breeding mosquitoes. In 2015, more than 900 Notices to Attend Court were issued to construction site contractors and over 100 Court prosecutions were taken against contractors for repeat offences. In the same period, more than 100 Stop Work Orders have been issued to construction sites to ensure that proper mosquito control measures were put in place before construction was allowed to resume.",4,53,2016-01-27-T-004-S-00053

In addition, more than $3 million has been committed over the next three years to develop a novel method of suppressing the Aedes mosquito population through the use of male Aedes mosquitoes that carry Wolbachia, a naturally occurring bacterium that can prevent mosquito eggs from hatching. The Government is also tracking the development of the dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, and will carefully evaluate the vaccine to ensure that it is safe, of high quality and effective before it is made available in Singapore.",5,54,2016-01-27-T-004-S-00054

2016-01-27-T-004,Masagos Zulkifli B M M,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"We are equally worried about the possible detection of Zika in Singapore. To facilitate this, the Ministry of Health (MOH) is working with NEA to enhance ongoing laboratory surveillance of sample Zika infection. Already, Zika is a notifiable disease under the Infectious Diseases Act. However, having said that, the Zika virus is also transmitted by the same type of mosquito that transmits dengue. Therefore, whatever we do for dengue, if we are effective, will also be effective to prevent Zika from spreading.",1,57,2016-01-27-T-004-S-00057

If it were a single local case, we will also conduct a vector control in the case's contacts' residences. That is the first step.",2,58,2016-01-27-T-004-S-00058

That is how it starts to spread virulently. Therefore, we ask everybody to go out, help do something within your homes, stop its breeding, do the ""Five-Step Mozzie Wipeout"" and, if we are effective in this, we can also prevent Zika from spreading, if it should come to Singapore.",3,59,2016-01-27-T-004-S-00059

First and foremost, the Minister alluded to the fact that the majority of the cases are in the homes. I think the challenge is that in the residents' perception, most of the time, it comes from outside. So, what proportion, based on breeding sites, in any area has the Ministry found where dengue breeding is in the homes, compared to the external areas?

But on record the number of enforcements that we have carried out against residential premises is about equal to that of construction sites. That is because we give them a stern warning for the first instance of discovery. What we have found is that if we enforce against the recalcitrant – that means having found and given a warning, we still find it again, and we impose a penalty on them – then the recurrence of finding breading in that home disappears, almost disappears. Unfortunately, not everybody has taken a chance, but when given a penalty, that habit of checking on these things suddenly becomes much better.",1,64,2016-01-27-T-004-S-00064

Our department has been looking at what we can do to suppress the population, first, of Aedes aegypti, particularly prevalent during warm weather. This Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti is not a genetically modified (GM) organism. And this has been confirmed by the Genetic Modification Advisory Committee in Singapore. So, the Member can rest assured that it is not a GM-mosquito.",2,65,2016-01-27-T-004-S-00065

But what we are trying to do is to use the male Aedes aegypti which will Wolbachia-carrying, to introduce that and compete with the wild-type males for the wild-type females. Because what the scientists have discovered is that when the eggs are laid, they do not hatch. Although promising, this is something we still need to study further, and to continue to look at what the field experience is like in other countries as they experiment on this, and to ensure that when we do this in Singapore, the impact on environment and health, and even how it affects other insects or population is not adverse.",3,66,2016-01-27-T-004-S-00066

We have some residents living in private estates who may be living adjacent or near to private land which is unoccupied. I would like to ask what is NEA's response in such matters; as in, how far does NEA go to follow up to do checks within such premises, whether with or without the owners' consent, and is it a check on 100% of such premises or is it based on complaints?",1,67,2016-01-27-T-004-S-00067

So, like I mentioned just now, we have made a lot of inspections. Altogether, in 2015 alone, there were 1.4 million inspections around Singapore. In addition to the inspections, we put in what we call ""Gravitraps"" to monitor whether mosquitos are breeding in that area, to look at the density of the breeding, as well as the people who get infected, from their blood, to understand the serotype changes, be able to map and, therefore, to be able to look at what are the possible risks that can be prevented both to the areas as well as to the country.",1,68,2016-01-27-T-004-S-00068

Social well-being for our people can only be enhanced and sustained if we have a growing economy that generates the financial resources to pay for the needed expenditures, which include security which the House talked about last two days, as well as to provide good job opportunities for our citizen workforce. That includes the tens of thousands fresh graduates that join the workforce each year.",2,128,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00128
2016-01-27-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In the last 50 years, we earned our prosperity largely by value adding and we are pretty good at that. Not just because we do it cheaper than others but rather, we were able to create our own competitive advantages. We engineered strong growth in manufacturing and services by way of a whole-of-Government approach – building the necessary infrastructure ahead of demand – ports, airport, industrial spaces – continually developing international linkages and connectivity to facilitate trade and investments, free trade agreements (FTAs), multinational corporations (MNCs) with their international links, instituting pro-business policies, among others, our low tax regime, and ensuring that there are sufficient manpower resources for businesses, both local sourced and foreign sourced. This strategy has enabled companies large and small to ride on the global economic cycles and thrive.",3,129,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00129
2016-01-27-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Continuing this way of growing our economy is still a viable option, particularly in areas of high value adding, and it remains a policy option. However, given the inherent constraints in our capacity, that would mean we have to settle for a much lower growth range going forward and are destined to always compete with the next cheaper player. We will also be at the mercy of the volatile global demand cycles, which tends to impact us more as a small and open economy. So, just adding value and competing on prices has become less of a value proposition for us, especially so as our economy matures and that we are near the limits in terms of manpower growth and land spaces.",4,130,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00130

With smarter resource optimisation, greater technological adoption and enhanced global linkages, our smallness as a country can be less of a disadvantage. In the future landscape, it may well be the case where the big no longer beats the small. It is the fast that beats the slow and the imaginative that will eat the lunches of the uninspired.

I think we only need to look at the SPRING Singapore website to see the range of schemes available to help the start-ups.

2016-01-27-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In the economy of the future, having good subject-based knowledge is important but not good enough on its own. We need to foster critical and creative thinking as well as develop behavioural and social skills. Our education system cannot be narrowly focused on examination-based academic performance. It just stresses out everyone – the students, parents and teachers and even the Members of Parliament, when the parents come to see us to appeal for the scores and to get into the schools. So, it stresses out everybody with very little gain in return besides generating the national examinations scores to help us do the school postings. Instead, it risks producing an education system that dampens the innovative and entrepreneur spirit. Students may score well in exams for those subjects, but they may have little passion or interest in that subject matter, which some recent international studies have shown. So, we need to distinguish the truth from the facts.",19,145,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00145
2016-01-27-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Also, schools should avoid crowding out less easily assessed curriculum such arts, sports and aesthetic subjects as these activities stimulate a wide range of social, thinking and behavioural skills. Rather, the weightage of these subjects should be increased so that learning in school can be fun and can be enriching. So, when I heard that in some schools, co-curricular activities (CCA) were stopped for students in the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) year or the ""O"" Level year, just so that the students can focus on their major examinations, it disturbed me quite a fair bit. How does stopping CCA during the PSLE year or O-level year help in developing the students that we want? It is just going to increase the tension and add more stress. We need to develop students to be self-assured, confident and, for that matter, to be able to multi-task.",20,146,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00146

Often, when I attend schools' annual award ceremonies, the Principal's speech and presentations sometimes really sound like a shareholder's Annual General Meeting (AGM). There will be a lot of performance indicators being shown. So, I do not think numbers are that important. The speech should be about motivating the students and motivating the parents as well.",21,147,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00147
2016-01-27-T-010,Liang Eng Hwa,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I do believe that there exists a distribution of strengths and abilities for each cohort of students. There will be some who may appear to do less well in a whole bell curve, but who, nevertheless, have the inclination to think out-of-the-box, and are perhaps less ""conventional"" than others in their learning attitude. Perhaps, they have more of the ""maverick-like"" thinking.",22,148,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00148

In the early years, they tend to daydream a lot – I agree with Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam that some of it is good. In fact, we should not dampen their natural curiosity, especially during their early formative years. Help them, open up to them and give them second chances and if not, third chances even if they have not done well academically in their early years.

And that the learning institutions will help Singaporeans discover their strengths and interests and thereby cultivate passions and fulfil aspirations. I have lifted this from the Addendum.

These are very much informal social structures that may involve the university alumni support groups, networks of overseas Singaporeans, mentors or serial entrepreneurs, among others, to create buzz, facilitate sharing and mentoring, and also to foster collaborations and partnerships. We need to place-make of some sort to get the entrepreneurs and innovators to come together to participate in lively forums and to leverage on the value of interdependencies.

By all means, manage and calibrate our overall foreign manpower supply in accordance to our physical and social constraints like what many international centres, such as New York and London, have done.

Our way of life as we know and enjoy is now under threat. These are indeed dangerous and uncertain times we are living in. A terrorist attack in Singapore is no longer a remote possibility.",5,166,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00166
2016-01-27-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Thus, I fully support the President's call for Singaporeans to remain steadfast and united under these trying times, when misguided extremists are trying to tear this world apart through violence and fear.",6,167,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00167

2016-01-27-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The war on terrorism at our homefront is psychological as well. We cannot influence the people beyond our shores, but we can surely remind our own to value and preserve the peace and harmony we have here.",8,169,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00169
2016-01-27-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The walk with terrorism probably begins with some form of self-radicalisation, and such activities are impossible to prevent and they usually go under the radar.

But behind the cold existence of these religious artefacts lie a whole lot of effort in exercising tolerance, consideration and good neighbourliness. These stories must be passed down from generation to generation in all forms and means. We have to start young to sow the seeds of religious and racial tolerance in our classrooms, and hope for the best that our children will be able to discern dangerous ideologies online and reject them outright. We all have a part to play in this – this Ministry, the schools and most important of all, the parents – to make Singapore safe and secure.",11,172,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00172

Madam, education is one of the key building blocks of Singapore. The Government has made many changes to our education system over the years, in search of a balanced approach to prep our young for a world that is constantly evolving. The change the educator intends to make in the next chapter must stand the test of time because lives are at stake.

2016-01-27-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The ""Teach Less, Learn More"" model has found its way into schools in the past decade. Can our educators say for sure that this model really works because our students continue to do well in high-stake examinations, despite being taught less in school? Has the shift to focus on quality teaching instead of quantity teaching resulted in better desired outcomes of education? Or has it merely shifted more of the learning from the classroom to the private tutors?",14,175,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00175

2016-01-27-T-010,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),We need role models in life to inspire ourselves to greater heights.

Countries such as Azerbaijan, Cypress, Algeria, Guatemala, St Lucia, and Madagascar, to name a few, have all produced a Laureate or two each. Is this Government prepared likewise with the same vigour in our human capital outside of sports?

The Chinese has a saying “活到老，学到老”. The SkillsFuture initiative announced last year is certainly a step in the right direction. However, the values we impart to our young must stand the test of time. Each successive cohort that leaves our classroom must be resilient and, most important of all, must have a sense of belonging, without which we can never have an exceptional nation. I certainly believe that when we get our education right, we will get our security right, we will get our economy right, we will also get our society right, we will get our living environment right and most important of all, we will get our nation building right.

2016-01-27-T-010,Denise Phua Lay Peng,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Seriously, walk another path − remove one high-stake examination, the PSLE! Even educators, I understand, call for this. At the age of 12, it is too early to sort. Tweaking the assessment grading system will not remove the deeply entrenched mindsets of chasing the scores. The problem is unlikely to disappear even if we replace PSLE T-scores with Banding – students will start scoring four ""A""s, five ""A""s and so forth. We are back to square one.",54,238,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00238

Re-think the concept of the  School of the Arts, the Singapore Sports School, Normal (Technical) schools, the Special Assistance Plans (SAP) schools, and the Special schools. Think programmes, yes, even programmes for the gifted, and make these programmes available across more physical school campuses – so that students of different abilities and talents can grow up together under one roof.",55,239,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00239

2016-01-27-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Health and the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"How do we further strengthen the political system such that the right leaders – honest, selfless, capable, and committed – can surface? How do we sustain a robust political system that does not paralyse Government unnecessarily, but also does not stifle well-reasoned, cogently argued dissent? How can we assure alternative and minority voices a platform to be heard at the national stage?",42,296,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00296
2016-01-27-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Health and the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),Singapore has implemented various political innovations over the past few Parliaments. One such innovation is the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP). The NCMP scheme presently allows for nine highest scoring Opposition members to enter Parliament.,43,297,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00297
2016-01-27-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Health and the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),The NCMP scheme was introduced some 32 years ago to allow for alternative party views to be aired in Parliament. This was in recognition of Singaporeans' desire for alternative views and the value of contest of ideas and robust debates to sharpen policy making.,44,298,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00298
2016-01-27-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Health and the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"But while the People’s Action Party (PAP) has won a strong mandate from Singaporeans in the recent General Elections, the desire for alternative voices has not waned. In fact, I believe that with greater diversity of our population, as well as rising political interest and awareness among a better educated population, such a desire would grow.",45,299,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00299
2016-01-27-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Health and the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"I would thus support further expansion of the NCMP scheme, say to 12 or even beyond, recognising the value of having issues dissected from various perspectives that can sharpen and refine policy formulation. This is especially relevant as the challenges we face becomes even more complex and unpredictable. In fact, this would also affirm our desire to build a more inclusive society.",46,300,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00300
2016-01-27-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Health and the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"The number of Parliamentary seats has also increased since the last election in 2011 from 87 to 89 in 2015, and it is envisaged that this number could continue to rise given the rising population. Hence, it would be sensible to increase the number of NCMPs in this House.",47,301,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00301
2016-01-27-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Health and the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"But, regardless of the number of NCMPs admitted, what is most important, to ensure that our Parliament continues to have robust, well-informed and quality debate that will help shape and sharpen policies, is for Singaporeans to judge and scrutinise every Parliamentarian with the same lens and apply the same set of standards – whether it be of conduct or the substance of the argument.",48,302,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00302
2016-01-27-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Health and the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),Another political innovation has been the Elected Presidency (EP). The EP is the custodian of our financial reserves against pilferage by irresponsible government. He also safeguards the integrity of our public service. The EP is therefore to be above party politics and should play a unifying role.,49,303,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00303
2016-01-27-T-010,Amy Khor Lean Suan,The Senior Minister of State for Health and the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"The issue of the EP has drawn vigorous debate in the media recently. One key issue is how to depoliticise the EP scheme, such that it is not an alternate power centre that keeps ""checking"" on the government of the day or offer presidential endorsement of everything the Government does.

This does not mean taking more medicine or going to see the doctor more often. In fact, over-medication or treatments could do more harm than good and is costly for both the patient and the country.

About 3% of residents aged 55 years and above are non-ambulant and require physical assistance. Long-term care needs can last for several years if disability strikes. This group of elderly require a lot more support from their families to care for them and their daily needs. Many prefer to age-in-place, but strong family support is needed to make this happen.

2016-01-27-T-010,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"So, it is evident that much has been done, and yet it is timely to ask if we should consider other ideas to address nagging concerns among some Singaporeans. One of these is the uncertainty over long-term care costs. Many Singaporeans believe this to be large and required for an extended period. They also worry that nursing homes may be their only option, when they prefer to age at home. Quite a number of families are willing to have grandpa or grandma or their parents at home, if they have access to quality home care services.",27,341,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00341

I have some suggestions for the Ministry's consideration.",28,342,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00342
2016-01-27-T-010,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"First, we should have a comprehensive action plan to help our seniors remain healthy and connected. We have to accelerate the development of more alternatives to nursing homes. Our seniors want to be with their families even when they become frail. Family members want to be assured that they can rely on skilled help and nursing support when their parents or grandparents require it. And for seniors without family, or when their families can no longer look after them, new models of care such as assisted living centres should be explored.",29,343,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00343

2016-01-27-T-010,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"My medical colleagues have recently called upon the MOH to reconsider building subsidised single and twin rooms in nursing homes, as research has shown that residents with dementia in nursing homes with individual rooms have less anxiety, irritability and aggression, and also sleep better. And so, they have called for a move towards providing more individualised care for the elderly in nursing homes and also to allow them to retain some degree of independence. Not only is this good for the elderly, but it may also reduce the need for manpower in the long run, as earlier stated. And so, perhaps a mix of both single and multiple bed setups can be considered for future subsidised nursing homes, so that we can explore both paradigms.",31,345,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00345
2016-01-27-T-010,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Second, we should have an ongoing public education campaign to sensitise our young and middle-aged to the need to plan ahead. This means putting aside some savings for old age, not to over-commit in terms of property purchase and not to opt-out of ElderShield. And if they do buy a larger flat, to consider downgrading after their children move out, for ease of upkeep and to release cash for post-retirement needs. I have seen the recent advertisements on our television channels highlighting this issue, and I think this is a good start.",32,346,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00346
2016-01-27-T-010,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Third, we can consider a bigger role for insurance in long-term care financing, just as we enhanced MediShield. As there are plans to review ElderShield, I urge MOH to be comprehensive in this exercise and address the most important elements – the role of individuals in saving, the role of the family in supporting them and the role of the community and Government in sharing of the risks.",33,347,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00347
2016-01-27-T-010,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Lastly, in line with our aim to be a Smart Nation, I hope that the Government will increase funding for the research and development of health and mobility aids and monitoring devices such as variables and robotics and even drones to help out our elderly. To accelerate our development in this area, we should look into partnering foreign leading firms and institutions in this industry. Japan is one of the leaders in this field and exoskeletons like those developed by Cyberdyne and interactive personal robots, such as Pepper, which was launched by SoftBank recently, provide us with an endearing view of the future.",34,348,2016-01-27-T-010-S-00348

2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"The President and many Members of this House have spoken about the bracing challenges that we face in the future – terrorism, our economy, maintaining our social cohesion, among other things. Indeed, it is a daunting list. But as Members have emphasised, we have every reason to be confident that we can overcome them – one by one, together.",2,359,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00359
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"The question is  how do we do that? How can we build a stronger Singapore? How can we progress together? For Singapore to succeed, what must we do? One fundamental requirement, beyond individual policies, was what the President said at the end of his speech – we need good policies, but we also need good politics.",3,360,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00360
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"Members would have read the Addenda to the President's Address. These comprehensive documents lay out the agenda for this term of Government. The business of Government is to govern. Voters elect us to develop policies, to implement them, and to make things happen.",4,361,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00361
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"They want policies which respond to people's needs, like enhancing social safety nets, making housing more affordable and accessible, improving public transport, and managing the growth of foreign workers. They want to see policies that will enable our people to achieve their aspirations, for themselves and for their children  investing in education at all levels, for example, the SkillsFuture; implementing major projects which transform Singapore, like Changi Airport – building T4, putting up Project Jewel, planning for T5 – or Jurong Lake District or the Southern Waterfront City. One by one, brick by brick, building a better Singapore.",5,362,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00362
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"That is what this Government has done for many years. And this is what my Government will do in this term. We will fulfil our promises. But in order to have these good policies done, we also must have good politics, because the two go hand-in-hand. Good politics make sure that we will elect governments who will develop good policies, who will expand our common space and strengthen our society for the future. If we have good politics, then we have the best chance of having our system continuing to work for us, instead of against us, over the long haul.",6,363,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00363
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"If we are only concerned over the next five or 10 years, we do not have to make any changes in terms of politics because the system is working now and will continue to do so for the next 10 years, maybe a bit longer. The actors are in place. We are familiar with one another. We know where the leaders are, we know the response function – you press this button, this will happen; you pull that lever, something else happens. We know how to make it work today.",7,364,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00364
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"But if we are thinking beyond this term and this team, about a new Prime Minister and a new Cabinet, and a new population, different electorate, then we will need to keep Singapore able to work well with them in charge and with them being the team that leads Singapore. Then, it is prudent for us to consider what possible adjustments may become necessary now, in good time.",8,365,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00365
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"It is not an urgent task that you must do today instead of tomorrow. But it is this generation's responsibility to make sure that our political institutions and system continue to work well, well beyond the term of this team, and work well for future generations.",9,366,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00366
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"In theory, to get your politics right should not be such a very difficult problem for most countries because there is some sense of identity and unity, and leaders and your followers of different political persuasions should be able to come together and work for the common good. It makes sense to work together; it is a lot of trouble if you are at odds with one another. But if we look around the world, in fact, it is not such a simple matter.",10,367,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00367
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"There are some countries which face division and gridlock, and the government is paralysed, like the US. The executive and the legislative branches are controlled by different parties. The government is stalemated on issues ranging from gun control to trade policy. Democrats run the Administration; the President is Democrat. Congress is led by Republicans. The two do not see eye-to-eye and are unable to compromise. Three years ago in 2013, the Federal Government had to shut down for 16 days because Republicans and Democrats in Congress could not agree to pass a Budget. And last year they nearly had to shut down again.",11,368,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00368
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"In President Obama's recent State of the Union address, this was the theme he took up right at the end of his speech – the most important thing which he felt he had not been able to achieve – to get American politics to work. He described how the founding fathers of the US – Washington, Jefferson, Madison – had distributed power between states and the branches of government. That means between the federal government and the different states; between the executive and the legislature and the judiciary; checks and balances. And they expected people to argue over matters as they themselves did, but eventually to find common ground and be able to work something out. But now, the basic bonds of trust between the major parties, between the Democrats and the Republicans, have totally broken down. There is rancour and suspicion, no willingness to compromise. The system desperately needs to be fixed but no Congressman, no Senator, not even the President, is able on their own, to put it right. That is the US, the most powerful country in the world.",12,369,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00369
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"Other countries too have seen their national consensus fray. Many European countries were governed by stable, centralist coalitions. Sometimes, you have a centre-right coalition that will govern for a time. The mood changes, the country's priorities shift, a different balance emerges, and you have a centre-left coalition, perhaps even some of the same parties continue in the new coalition. You shift from one to the other within limits, never out of control. But now, the economy has broken, the immigration and refugee crisis is presenting them with an insoluble problem and deep disenchantment has set in. Extreme left and right groups are gaining ground. In every country, the regular political parties are losing support, never mind whether you are left-wing or right-wing. It is the extreme parties, the ones who just say, ""To hell with it. I am unhappy with the world. Vote for me and I will show two fingers to the world."" They are the ones who are getting support.",13,370,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00370
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"In Greece, it is called Syriza. They are now in government and having to make decisions which their supporters do not like at all. In Spain, they have Podemos. They have just had elections and Podemos won a significant number of seats. Now they are having a lot of difficulty forming a new government – in Germany, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), an anti-immigration party; in France, the National Front; in Britain, UKIP – pushing anti-immigrant, anti-EU, anti-globalisation platforms. Just expressing angst and anger, not propounding compromises and solutions. They are reflecting public unhappiness, but they are also riling up the public, offering no coherent policies of viable alternatives.",14,371,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00371
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"In many Asian countries, whom you vote for depends on your race, depends on your religion. In some countries, it depends on what caste you belong to. It is not policies; it is not integrity but ""Is he my guy? Does he have the same caste name as me? Then, I know whether I can trust whether he will look after me."" These are fundamental divides, divides which countries have tried to close but which remain deep and have sometimes even deepened decades after independence.",15,372,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00372
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"You may say, ""Well, that is the problem of democracy"", but even countries which do not have elections also have not such an easy time. You take China. It is a major challenge for the Chinese government, for President Xi Jinping, to keep his system clean, to keep his officials accountable and to keep his government with authority and legitimacy. Chinese officials visit Singapore. Invariably, they ask to see our Meet-the-People Sessions. They come, they sit in, they watch our Members of Parliaments and Ministers take cases and they are deeply impressed at how the system works. They go back and try to do the same. It is not the same. What is the fundamental difference?",16,373,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00373
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"In Singapore, Members and Ministers are taking cases for their voters. The person sitting in front of you votes for or against you come election time. In China, the officials may have a good heart and want to do good for their population, but they do not owe their positions to the votes of the people they are in charge of.",17,374,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00374
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"The moral of the story is there is no perfect model anywhere in the world, much less one in which we can import wholesale and apply in Singapore. If we look at other people's political problems, we do not feel any ""schadenfreude"", any sense of superiority or rejoicing. In fact, we say, ""There but for the grace of God go I"", because what happens elsewhere can easily happen in Singapore too, if either we blindly copy other people's practices which do not work here, or we find our own way but take a wrong turn. We can end up in such a situation also.",18,375,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00375
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"It does not mean we do nothing. It does not mean we learn nothing. It means we have to keep evolving our system carefully, step by step, making sure that our Government works and the politics in Singapore serve our people's interests. We have to find our own way forward.",19,376,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00376
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"What kind of political system do we want in Singapore? I would list five ""desiderata"", desirable things.",20,377,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00377
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"First, it must enable us to have a high-quality government – accountable, honest, competent, and effective. You have to be responsive to the people, able to look beyond the short term and keep us safe and successful. Because as a small country with no luxury of resources, with no domestic hinterland, excellence and integrity have been and always must be a crucial competitive advantage for Singapore. An excellent, honest government. It is something which we have, which we can do, which others can see; not so easy for others to duplicate.",21,378,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00378
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"I will put this quite bluntly; if we had not had a first-class government in Singapore, led by exceptional leaders who are able to foresee problems, head them off, seize opportunities, reap dividends for Singapore and mobilise people to work with them and to support policies – sometimes tough ones – we would not have Singapore today. So, we cannot ever afford to be paralysed, gridlocked or become dysfunctional like some other countries. For America, you can live with it. You go down, you go up. It is an aircraft carrier. For Singapore, you go down, you are finished. You do not come back up again.",22,379,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00379
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"Secondly, the political system has to be open and contestable. What do I mean? There has to be free and fair elections, and it must not be forbiddingly expensive for people to stand and contest elections. In fact, that is one of the greatest things we have done to keep our system open, to make sure that we keep money out of politics, and it does not cost a lot of money to contest elections.",23,380,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00380
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"So, if you take last year's General Elections. All of the parties together, added up, during the national General Elections, they spent all of $7 million, less than $3 per voter. The Straits Times calculated it at $2.89. You compare that with the cost of the US elections. In 2012, when they last had their Presidential election together with Congressional elections, it cost them US$7 billion. Not cost the government to run it; cost the candidates to raise it and to spend it; US$7 billion divided by about 350 million Americans. That is US$20 per American. That you may say is American-class, one of its own. But look at the money politics that you see in many countries, including in our region. The sums which are spoken about, which are necessary for elections, openly, not a secret, not even illegal or embarrassing. But it is a reality. It is an insoluble problem and ours must never become like that.",24,381,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00381
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"Thirdly, our political system must foster accountability so that the government is always kept on its toes and will always be motivated to look after the interests of Singaporeans. Parliament here must be a serious forum where big issues are discussed and decided – defence, economy, choices to tax and spend, and plans for the future. The Government's actions have to be scrutinised and debated in Parliament. If a Member of Parliament – whether it is an Opposition Member or a Government Member – argues a case against the Government's proposal, then either the Government has to be able to rebut it and explain convincingly what it is doing and why, or if the Member makes a good case, then you have to acknowledge that, and policies have to be changed. That is what Members have seen happen in this House, not just with Opposition Members but with Government Members or Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs) as well.",25,382,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00382
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"On the other side, if a Member makes a good proposal and advocates convincingly for it and persuades the Government, then I think the Government should support it, back it with resources and help to make it happen – as also has happened with PAP Members and Nominated Members, who have, from time to time, moved private Member's Bills and other times, have persuaded the Government that the bee in the bonnet is a justified bee in the bonnet and we should do what they are buzzing us loudly to carry out.",26,383,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00383
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"Every government must take Parliament seriously. And I think we take Parliament seriously in Singapore on both sides of the House. It is a place where you have debates, where big issues have to come to be decided. You can agree or disagree, and vigorously; and you ought to disagree, if you have strong views. But you must take it seriously; it is not a place where you throw chairs, swing handbags or pour water on one another; or a place where you exchange clever put-downs but really avoid the serious issues concerning the Government and the future of the country.",27,384,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00384
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"So, our Parliament may not be as entertaining on television as many other parliaments which you watch on the news at night, but I think, in terms of quality and seriousness of purpose, we have it and we should keep it.",28,385,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00385
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"Ultimately, of course, the Government is accountable not just to Parliament, but also to the electorate. If it performs well, then it gets the support of voters again, and it can continue in office. If it performs poorly, there is an electoral price to pay. Then, either the Government mends its ways and regains its support, or the electorate can vote it out and another party, another team, will have to take its place and try to do better. So, we must have a system where the Government does not, over time, become complacent, go soft or even worse, become corrupt.",29,386,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00386
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"Fourthly, our political system must uphold a multiracial society. Multiracialism is fundamental to our identity as a nation because we have three major races in Singapore, we have all the world's major religions in Singapore. Race and religion will always be fundamental tectonic fault lines for us. If we ever split along one of these fault lines, that would be the end of us.",30,387,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00387
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"Therefore, our political system must encourage multiracial and secular politics, not racial or religious politics. It has got to encourage political parties to seek broad-based, multiracial consensus and pursue moderate policies in the interests of all Singaporeans, regardless of race, language or religion. It has to discourage parties from forming along racial or religious lines or championing the interests of one race or religion over others, whether it be a majority or minority group in our society. Minority Singaporeans must have the confidence that they will not ever be marginalised, or shut out, or discriminated against. Every Singaporean must have the confidence that he has a place in Singapore.",31,388,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00388
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"Fifth, our system needs to incorporate stabilisers. The Government has to be responsive to the will of the people, but at the same time, we also have to have safeguards, in case the country is swept off course by a transient public mood, or an erratic government, which can happen. By the time you change your mind and realise it is unwise, it is too late to come back. So, you need stabilisers to make sure that you respond to the mood, but you do not get carried too far and capsize the boat.",32,389,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00389
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"Most political systems have such stabilisers built in. They have an Upper House like the Senate in the US, the House of Lords in the UK, or especially in big countries, you have a division of powers between the city and regional governments and a national federal government on the other. So, no single point can cause the whole system to fail. You clear the Lower House, you must go pass the Upper House. Elections may be different times, may have different rules. You persuade one region to do something, but it is a big country and other regions have to go along. You have to get the consensus, take some time, sleep it over, think carefully and perhaps think the better of it.",33,390,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00390
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"We are too small to have either an Upper House or to have a regional set of governments. The most we can do are Town Councils. Useful, but not really a regional government. We have overlaid on top of them Mayors. We call them Mayors, but actually if you compare them with the Mayor of London or the Mayor of New York, it is what they call, 小巫见大巫. It is a small personality, same title, but is quite a different entity indeed.",34,391,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00391
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"We may be small but we still need stabilisers, and we especially need stabilisers in two areas  (a) protecting our reserves and (b) safeguarding the integrity of the public service. Why do I say this? Because these are two critical elements that give us safety, security, assurance and resources for the future.",35,392,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00392
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"It has taken us decades to build up our foreign Reserves. They are our oil in the ground. If we do not have a second key, and you happen to have a generous or profligate government, then one government can spend it all and bring you back to zero. Elections will become auctions, where the parties compete to be more generous than the other, offering what it can do to voters by raiding the bank.",36,393,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00393
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"This happens in countries much richer than us. Look at Australia. Ten years ago, under a basically conservative government, they built up significant amounts of reserves or surpluses. They set up a pension fund for the future and said, ""This is our sovereign wealth fund and this is to make sure that in future, you will be provided for with state pensions"" and so on. But then came elections and both parties, whether in government or out of government, because of the dynamics of the situation, they have no choice. One side offers something, the other side offers more, and back and forth. It is an auction. Today, the funds for the future have disappeared. The country is in deficit. The commodities boom is over. The budget cannot be settled. They have to cut back spending. It is extremely contentious. They are back where they were. All within 10 years. It can happen to Australia with all that wealth and resources. Think what can happen if it is Singapore.",37,394,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00394
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"That is money. What about people? The whole of our excellence in Government, the competence and the performance of the country depends on the integrity and the ability of the individuals in the key posts in the public service – judges, central bankers, the Accountant-General, the Commissioner of Police, the people who head our Statutory Boards, who sit on our key Statutory Boards, the people who manage our Reserves.",38,395,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00395
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"Once corrupt persons get into key positions, it will be the end. It is not only the end because they take money and help themselves because we can stop that and put them in jail. It is the end because they subvert and corrupt the system and make it impossible to root out the cancer which then becomes entrenched throughout the system. The system is permanently broken.",39,396,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00396
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"Look at other countries. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia used to lament publicly about the problem he had with what he called the ""judicial mafia"". He does not mean the mafia on the streets. He means judges whom he could not trust for their integrity because they had become corrupt and had become part of the problem. If you look at other countries where the police are in cahoots with the crooks, and if you have a problem, you are not sure whether you should go to the police station or run away from the police station. Or you look at countries where those responsible for safeguarding state assets instead raid the bank. As the Malay proverb goes, ""Pagar makan padi"". You are the hedge but you are eating the rice which you are supposed to protect.",40,397,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00397
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"To prevent this, or at least to make this harder, this system needs a second key. The challenge for us is how to ensure this second key strengthens and stabilises our system of Government.",41,398,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00398
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"We have evolved our system of politics over the years and it has served us well. Our political and constitutional history is quite different from that of most other newly-independent countries, countries which were colonies and became independent after the war, in Asia, Africa and particularly in Southeast Asia. Most newly-independent countries start life anew, with a brand new fresh-minted Constitution. But when we became independent, we did not do that. We decided to retain and tweak our existing Constitutional arrangements that had worked for Singapore when we were part of Malaysia, and that had been working before that, when we were a self-governing state before we joined Malaysia. Mr Lee Kuan Yew felt that it was better for us to evolve our model gradually, learning from experience, rather than to strive for some unworkable perfection. Mr Lee said that his best teacher of the difference between political reality and constitutional theory was the Tunku. Once, he wrote, I think this is in his memoirs, Mr Lee was in the Tunku's office and admiring a beautiful leather-bound green-covered volume. It was the Pakistani Constitution and was presented to the Tunku by Ayub Khan, who was at one time President of Pakistan. Mr Lee admired the book and the Tunku told him, ""You know, Kuan Yew, they make very good constitutions. They have many brilliant lawyers. With every leader, they have to make a new one.""",42,399,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00399
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"When we became independent, we cobbled together the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, which is what we have today. Where did it come from? Part of the provisions from Singapore's State Constitution, part of the provisions from Malaysia's Federal Constitution which we adopted and incorporated, plus amendments which we made after Separation, for example, amendments to safeguard our sovereignty and to ensure that any decision to give up our sovereignty would have to be put to a referendum of all the voters in Singapore and not decided by the Legislature.",43,400,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00400

It is a messy document and such a messy document that in 1970, Mr Lee asked the British High Commissioner to get British Constitutional law experts to polish it up. And it came back polished and shiny. Mr Lee thought that the British experts had done a first-rate job. The idea was you look at the American Constitution. It has lasted 200 something years and over these 200 something years, it has only had 20 plus amendments. So, you worship it. You get it precisely right, beautiful form of words, every school child knows it and that is what is going to guide the country for the next several hundred years.",44,401,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00401
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"But, in the end, Mr Lee decided not to take that approach. He did not take in the brand-new versions drafted by the British experts in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) because he concluded that the experts had not understood the context, nor why we had made certain basic decisions. He explained this to the House in 1984, when he moved the Constitutional Amendments to create the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) scheme. He used Thomas Jefferson's analogy of a suit. He said, ""From my experience, Constitutions have to be custom-made, tailored to suit the peculiarities of the person wearing the suit"". He changes the metaphor here but I think you will forgive him this mixed metaphor. He said ""Perhaps, like shoes, the older they are, the better they fit. Stretch them, soften them, resole them, repair them. They are always better than a brand new pair of shoes"".",45,402,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00402

Any fundamental change takes a long time. But most important of all, the Constitution works. Many countries have tried and gone through several Constitutions since Independence. They have not brought stability or legitimacy. I believe it is better to stretch and ease an old shoe when we know that the different shape and fit of a younger generation requires a change.""",46,403,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00403

The Sunday Times published an excerpt. I encourage you to read it, and I urge Members to read the full version in the Hansard. Apart from talking about Singapore politics, he gave a tour of the horizon of how historically other countries – Britain, France, America – have each got their own histories and how the system evolved for them and how difficult it was.",47,404,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00404
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"He talked about France, and how as a young man in 1956, after attending a constitution conference in London, he took a side trip to Paris on the way home, and the taxi driver took him around, showed him the sights and brought him to the National Assembly. This was 1956, it was a democracy and the politicians could not agree. The taxi driver pointed at the National Assembly and said to him, ""wala, wala, wala"" [the hon Member pointed a finger to his head and made circles with his finger], and he said that was an education for a young politician to the reality of politics.",48,405,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00405

You will therefore not find this in The Sunday Times because The Sunday Times could not make sense of it and edited it out. But it is a most vivid example of how things can go wrong in politics. It was a highly civilised nation, but the system did not work. In the end, General de Gaulle had to come back out of retirement and changed the rules. He took very stern measures and created the Fifth Republic. But even de Gaulle must die and till today, the French, they also, like other countries, have political problems. Today, in the newspapers, if you read The Straits Times, Paris is in upheaval, because there are strikes. Who is on strike?

2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"The approach which we have taken has been to evolve our political system as we go along. Mr Lee did this and we continue to do this. Learning from experience, stretching and easing the old shoe, and adapting it to our needs and dealing with problems as new problems emerge, as we understand the difficulties and weaknesses. For example, we inherited the first-past-the-post parliamentary system, modelled on the British House of Commons in Westminster. We have kept the first-past-the-post system. That is why here we sit opposite one another – the Government and, in principle, the Opposition on the other side. We do not sit in a semi-circle, the way the Americans sit in a semi-circle, or the way the European legislatures sit in a semi-circle. It is a parliamentary system, first-past-the-post. You are in opposition to each other. We kept that system but subsequently, we introduced new institutions – Non-Constituency Members of Parliament, Nominated Members of Parliament, Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) and the institution of an Elected President. Each institution with a purpose, each one in line with our principles. Let me say something about them.",51,408,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00408

You either win decisively or lose decisively, and especially in Singapore where every constituency is more or less the same composition and the same mood as every other constituency, all the more you tend to have a national swing and it goes across the board and so you end up with a clear majority in the House.",52,409,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00409
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"After Independence, after Separation, the Barisan Sosialis Opposition walked out of Parliament in 1965. From then, Parliament was composed entirely of PAP Members. In the next four General Elections, the PAP won all the seats and as well as all the by-elections in between, the PAP won all of them. This enabled the Government to govern decisively and effectively in the vital first years of our nationhood. It lasted from 1965 until 1981 when the first Opposition Member, J B Jeyaretnam, was elected to Parliament. It had been, by then, 16 years since Separation. A new generation of voters was coming of age. A new team of Members of Parliament and Ministers was preparing to take over. Mr Lee and his senior colleagues watched what happened in the House after Mr Jeyaretnam came in. After some time, they concluded, to their surprise, that despite all the to-ing and fro-ing and unpleasantness, it was good for the Government and good for the Singapore system that we have Opposition voices in Parliament because the Opposition could express opposing views, could question and criticise the Government and could make Ministers justify their actions. The Opposition provided Mr Lee and his team the ""foil"" or a backdrop against which they could set out their ideas more clearly, in contrast to what was being presented on the other side. Right against wrong, good ideas against better ones. Through the debate in Parliament, helped Mr Lee and his team get their message across and aid public understanding.",53,410,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00410
2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"So, Mr Lee proposed the NCMP scheme in 1984. The NCMP scheme made sure that whatever the election outcome, there would always be a certain minimum number at least, of Opposition Members in Parliament. At first, this minimum was three Opposition Members – either elected or not elected NCMPs, or some combination. Over time, we gradually increased it and we have brought it now to nine.",54,411,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00411

2016-01-27-T-012,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"We did not do the proportional representation way because we felt that it would be bad for Singapore. It would result in political parties that are based on race or religion. It would encourage political leaders to champion the demands of their particular segment against the broader interests of Singapore. It would divide us, rather than bring us together, because to win in a proportional representation system, you have got to have your base. What is your base? It can be Christians, it can be Buddhists, it can be Muslims, it can be Indians. It can be a special interest group, maybe on gender issues. What is your interest? Your interest will consolidate that base, take a hard position, demand as much as you can for your group. Then, you increase the percentage. You do not have to win seats, you just get a higher percentage, and you will get seats in Parliament. You do not have to win constituencies. I think if you do that, you end up split, polarised and severely weakened.",58,415,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00415

NCMPs are Opposition candidates who had the best results but did not quite win their seats. In fact, some NCMPs have higher percentage, if you look at it on a personal basis, than other people, Members elected in GRCs. If you just count their chunk of the GRC and how many votes they got and the percentage, the NCMP may have got more than the person from a GRC. But the point is, he did well, he is one of the best losers and they come in, ensuring that Opposition voices are always represented in Parliament.",59,416,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00416

In 1984, Mr Lee would still have fresh in his mind, the memory of what had happened in 1961, when the extreme left-wing split off from the PAP and formed the Barisan Sosialis, and the PAP hung on in the Legislative Assembly with a one-seat majority. And then one Member of Parliament died and it was levelled – no seat majority.

Next thing you know, there is a new Prime Minister, and I am writing a new letter of congratulations. It has happened three or four times within the last five years in Australia.

They also know that if they play racial politics during elections, then whatever votes they may win from one group will be at the expense of votes which they will lose from the other groups, because in the multiracial team, with a multiracial electorate, you have always to strike that balance and internalise that balance within your team and amongst your voters.",80,437,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00437

In 1990, we passed legislation to make the President an elected office, so that he could act as a stabiliser in our political system. The President would exercise custodial powers over the spending of past Reserves and key appointments in the public service – the two vital areas which I talked about earlier. He would be directly elected by the people in a national election, so as to have the mandate and moral authority to say ""no"" to the Government, should this become necessary.",89,446,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00446

The Elected Presidency as an institution was a major innovation, again with no precedent anywhere else. So, we spent a long time designing it. We published one White Paper. We debated it. We published a second White Paper. After extensive debate, we legislated it, operated it and have amended it over the years.",90,447,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00447

He has to be above politics. He represents all Singaporeans, regardless of race, language or religion. He is a symbol of our sovereignty and of our nation. By design, the President has no executive, policymaking role and this remains the prerogative of the elected Government commanding the majority in Parliament.",91,448,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00448

I suspect even now, quite a number of people still do not understand this. Regrettably, during the last Presidential Election, those who did not understand it included some candidates. They campaigned for President as if they were going to form an alternate Government. But the President is neither the Government nor is he the Opposition. He is a custodian, a goalkeeper. The Constitution gives him power to block certain actions of the Government, in areas which are specifically carved out for him. But it does not give him the power to initiate policies or generally to champion policies.",92,449,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00449

The purpose is specified in the Constitution, and we have to operate by the Constitution, both to be complying with the law and to make sure the system works. For the system to work, both candidates and voters have to understand this. Otherwise, if you have a President who thinks that he is the Government, competing with the Government, you have two power centres in the system. At the very least, you have confusion, you could have an impasse between the two and the democratically elected Government will be undermined. As the Chinese phrase says  天无二日,国无二君, which means that you have no two suns in the sky, you have no two governments in a country.

We are not proposing this review because of any dissatisfaction with the present working arrangements or any difference of views between the Government and the President. But we are doing this because any adjustments that may be necessary for the future should be made in good time, in order to give us time to think it over in a thoughtful, mature and unpressured way and in order to keep the Presidency a robust and effective institution in our political system.

The person who is making those decisions must understand what those decisions are, what is involved in that job before he can decide whether a person is fit to do that job or not, and before he decides whether a spending proposal is right or wrong, justified or otherwise.",103,460,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00460

But if the President says, ""Veto"", and the CPA says, ""Yes, I agree"", that is a heavy veto.

They were joking and poking, pushing and shoving and enjoying each other's company.",3,491,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00491

Maybe it was the excitement of the dress rehearsal, or maybe it was just the sense of whimsy or foolishness on the part of one of those soldiers, but these three young soldiers on my left started to sing as loud as they could, pouring all their energy – not shouting – but putting every ounce of effort into singing, using every fibre of their being. You could hear all the passion and pride that they could muster. Maybe they were egging each other on. Maybe they thought they would try and drown out the thousands of spectators that they could not see. Whatever the reason, the aunties and uncles around me – I will include myself in that – would not be left behind. We also raised our voices louder and louder and louder. Although I could not turn around to check, in my mind's eye, the Enciks behind us were also singing louder, louder and louder. If you have ever sung in a choir, there is a special feel in the air when everyone gets it right, and the timing is just perfect with everybody in step.",5,493,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00493

The choir lifts their voices a little bit more, not because of any effort, but because everybody had fallen into step perfectly. The moment does not last long, but it feels special, almost magical.

I was rushing back to my constituency to join the Punggol-Damai Residents' Committee for an SG50 celebration.

So, as the first verse finished with ""Berjaya Singapura"", there is that pause into the short silence between the verses, you could hear this young voice with all his energy and gusto trying to sing, and trying loudly to sing but you could not really hear the words he was singing – completely out of time. And his parents from the front row of the seats facing me, they began to have a worried look on their faces, looking like they wanted to do something or fix something. I smiled at them and shrugged, it was okay, he was trying his best, he was doing his best, and everything was okay, a little child trying his best to sing our Majulah Singapura. We all smiled, we all sang and throughout this song, we heard his little voice trying harder and harder to get it right. Maybe he thought that if he sang a little bit louder, all the Aunties and Uncles would follow him. We also sang louder and louder.

Since we are already allowing lateral transfers and greater flexibility for students to take subjects at different levels of intensity or difficulty based on their abilities, we should extend that to remove the labelling of students altogether, according to academic streams. My concern is that pigeon-holing students into Express or Normal (Academic) or Normal (Technical) streams will create and entrench the self-limiting belief in each student that they are only as good as the academic stream they are in. Yes, it will be a lot messier not to have academic streams, but neatness or expedience cannot be the reason for creating a less than optimal environment – for abilities to flourish and full potential to be achieved without imposing artificial limits.",21,543,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00543

A resident I know, Joseph, was retrenched from his job as a C-suite executive as a result of budget cuts and job restructuring in the company. However, he was convinced it was because of his age. He was 58 years old when he lost his job.",23,545,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00545
2016-01-27-T-012,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"In light of a slowing economy, these concerns are very real. In addition, I have met Indian and Malay Singaporeans who have expressed their worry that a slowing economy would mean either opportunities for employment or job promotion for members of our minority races, would be even more difficult. This may simply be a perception, but the perception that is observed or heard often enough becomes entrenched as a reality.",24,546,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00546

There is always the worry that because of how different you look, you can be denied of opportunities. It is important for us to see beyond our physical differences and see the person within.",25,547,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00547
2016-01-27-T-012,Intan Azura Mokhtar,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"We need to recognise that our abilities and potential come from what is in our hearts and minds, and are not determined by our physical appearance, by the colour of our skin or by what is covering our heads. I have spoken about this before, but it is important enough for me to say it again. I hope that those in positions of influence or power can show that these worries and concerns will remain unfounded.",26,548,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00548

The rationale for teaching CCE in Mother Tongue classes may be to address racial issues or values more sensitively, but I believe that after 50 years of nation-building, our society is mature enough and sensible enough to discuss sensitive issues pertaining to character or citizenship openly and honestly, starting with our children who are even more race-blind. Let us be sensible and honest enough to discuss issues of discrimination, stereotypes, perceptions and social cohesion openly with our children.",28,550,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00550

I would propose that as a requirement of admission, these students will have to take Chinese as a third language from Secondary 1 to Secondary 4. This will enrich the racial make-up of students in the SAP schools and create more opportunities for multi-racial interactions and learning, making it more authentic and representative of society at large. As a parent and educator, I believe that taking Chinese as a third language and exposure to the Chinese culture for more of our children will help to prepare them to venture into a big market in China and other Chinese-speaking economies for employment and entrepreneurial opportunities in future.",29,551,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00551

I am asking for the SAP schools to be enhanced and for its social environment to be enriched. I am asking for MOE to pilot this in one or two SAP schools to see how it works out.

We must introduce and encourage innovative technologies allowing Singaporeans to access information easily for lifelong learning of new skills. We must provide a safe living and working environment and protect the vulnerable, especially the elderly and children in our society. We must set up informative and alert systems that will further strengthen our emergency rescue and healthcare support services.

2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"First review the planning concepts and norms for land use. Madam, I understand that the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has adopted the ""live, work and play"" concept in the development of our concept and master plans for land use in Singapore. However, many Singaporeans still have to travel long distances from their homes to their workplaces as well as for food and leisure.",4,558,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00558
2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"To better fulfil the needs of our people, we need to review the planning concepts and norms so that residential areas, business clusters and leisure amenities can be planned and built at suitable locations. This may entail the following transformations to our urban landscape.",5,559,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00559
2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"First, high-density residential clusters. We need to facilitate the change of land use and increase plot ratio for residential developments at key transport hubs. This involves redeveloping and upgrading of HDB towns into large high-rise and high-density residential clusters.",6,560,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00560
2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Second, future economy business clusters. We need to provide more incentives for businesses to move into future economy clusters. This involves relocating existing supporting businesses and building new business clusters for future economy industries including smart city technologies, medical and pharmaceutical manufacturing or finance and professional services.",7,561,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00561
2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Third, leisure amenities clusters. We can locate or relocate leisure amenities near MRT stations for better accessibility.

2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Next, enhancing ""live, work and play"" in Singapore. Madam, we need to enhance the quality of life for Singaporeans to live, work and play in Singapore.

In addition, by building neighbourhood town centres which provide a wide range of services, HDB and neighbouring private estate residents enjoy affordable products and services at great convenience.",10,564,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00564
2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"However, as HDB towns grow, more flats are built away from the neighbourhood centres. As a result, some neighbourhood centres have become less accessible to residents, especially the elderly who live further away. This problem will be exacerbated as our residents age – travelling the distance to town centres may be challenging to these seniors.",11,565,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00565
2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Madam, we need to enhance the infrastructure of our HDB towns to make our neighbourhood centres more accessible.

We must align these agencies in order to build wider walkways and cycling paths promoting accessibility for all users.",13,567,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00567
2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Madam, we can also build more high-rise residential buildings and basement car parks. This will free up more surface land areas for gardens, paths, walkways and cycling paths. It will provide more green lungs within our towns and reduce the heat island effects – that is the warming of our built environment.",14,568,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00568
2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"In this regard, the Ministry of National Development (MND) and the HDB can explore innovative solutions to build flats above 40 storeys and replace surface and multi-storey car parks with basement car parks.

2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Madam, as part of increasing accessibility and connectivity, we should also review our public transport, infrastructure and services. I support the Ministry of Transport’s (MOT) proposal to build the North-South Expressway and provide dedicated lanes for buses, cyclists and pedestrians. We should also consider adding capacity to our existing expressways by building two-tier expressways. The upper tier can have dedicated lanes for express buses and cars while the lower tier expressways can have dedicated lanes for motorcycles and goods vehicles. This segregation will ease the flow of traffic and may help to reduce accidents.",16,570,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00570
2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Madam, we should also review our existing express bus or train services and consider increasing their capacities.

2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),We can also introduce weekend public transport day pass at an attractive price such as $2 for multiple trips.

2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Third, building a sustainable built environment. Madam, Singapore is a land-scarce country.

2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"In addition, we should further encourage the use of solar energy in powering our building utilities. I understand that HDB has piloted the use of solar energy for HDB blocks. We should maximise the solar energy potential in Singapore and install more solar panels at our roofs. This will not only reduce heat transfer into our buildings but also promote the use of ""green"" energy and reduce our reliance on less sustainable energy sources.",21,575,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00575
2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Madam, as our society becomes more affluent, there will be higher demand for more electrical appliances in our homes.

2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Fourth, building smart city and smart towns. Madam, we should aim towards building a holistic and smart city. New technology has been introduced to make cities smarter. These include sensors, CCTV, big data analytics and dashboard management systems. We must be careful and vigilant when adopting these technologies.",24,578,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00578
2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"We must first understand the present and future needs of our people and ensure that Singaporeans are ready to adopt and benefit from these smart city initiatives. In order to implement Smart City systems in Singapore, we must first prioritise the needs of our people and businesses. I would urge the Government to focus on three key areas to apply smart city initiatives.",25,579,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00579
2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"First, safety and security. Over the last few years, the town councils have been working closely with our Police to install CCTV at HDB void decks and common areas to enhance safety and security. To date, over 52,000 cameras have been installed in 8,600 HDB blocks. This has enhanced crime prevention efforts significantly. I wish to commend the Police for spearheading this project and their success in using the CCTV system to solve crimes.",26,580,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00580
2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"In view of the ever-present threat of terrorism, I urge the Government to introduce this project to more areas, especially at high human traffic locations.",27,581,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00581
2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Second, healthcare services. Smart city systems can provide intelligent and alert systems and facilitate data collection to further strengthen our emergency and healthcare services. Big data analytics can provide real-time monitoring of trends. The information gathered will support preventive healthcare interventions and contribute towards developing response strategies in disease outbreak management.",28,582,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00582
2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Third, town and facilities management services. In the areas of town and facilities management, smart technologies can provide 24/7 monitoring of the functionality of buildings or facilities and send alerts for faster response by the maintenance team. For example, the lift telemonitoring system at HDB blocks allows our lift technicians to respond within 25 minutes to rescue trapped passengers in lifts.",29,583,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00583
2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),Many Town Councils have also installed LED lightings with sensors to control lighting and save energy. I would urge the HDB to play a more proactive role in introducing more smart city applications in HDB towns.,30,584,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00584
2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"Fourth, building future vertical cities. Madam, 25 years ago, I visited a building research centre of a Japanese construction firm in Japan. I was indeed very impressed by the innovations and futuristic thinking of the Japanese researchers. They were already exploring construction techniques and materials to build vertical cities then.",31,585,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00585
2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"These vertical cities consist of skyscrapers towering 1,000 metres or 300 storeys. They house residential, commercial, office and recreational facilities within the same building, enabling users to live, work and play with convenience.",32,586,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00586
2016-01-27-T-012,Teo Ho Pin,Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang),"With limited land for development in Singapore, we should start to consider building a vertical city which will allow Singaporeans to live their lives with greatest enjoyment. Together, we can build a great future for Singapore and Singaporeans.",33,587,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00587
2016-01-27-T-012,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Bukit Batok),"Mdm Speaker, the President calls on us to write the next chapter of the Singapore story together. I fully support this call. As we are all aware, all grand narratives may include elements of hyperbole, and parts may require further interpretation. In the telling, we allow ourselves some artistic licence.

2016-01-27-T-012,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Bukit Batok),"Even as we do so, we need to be careful of the myths that have been perpetuated as part of our national narrative.

2016-01-27-T-012,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Bukit Batok),"One ""stupid policy"" he cited was the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which held the provision allowing states to deny higher benefits to recent migrants to their state. This was based on the idea that welfare recipients migrate to the state simply to seek higher benefits. In Minnesota, which is a high-benefit state, officials have claimed that ""busloads of individuals in Chicago would travel monthly to their state, which is about 800 kilometres away, to collect their welfare checks, only to return for the duration of the month.""",5,592,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00592
2016-01-27-T-012,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Bukit Batok),"This picture appears probable. But the reality, however, is quite different. Research found that few recipients moved between states, and when they did do so, it was not a result of benefit levels. Poor people move, of course, but it is largely for the same reasons as rich people. They move for job opportunities, family reasons, or a fresh start in life.",6,593,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00593
2016-01-27-T-012,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Bukit Batok),"The writer said  ""Much of the myth of welfare migration is premised upon several questionable assumptions. First, it assumes that the poor are rational calculators who make cost/benefit lifestyle decisions. Second, it assumes they have knowledge about different welfare benefit levels. Third, the benefit differences are enough to outweigh the costs of travel."" He lists other assumptions which are questionable. Overall, the reality of migration is that it is the more affluent who move and who are mobile.",7,594,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00594

2016-01-27-T-012,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Bukit Batok),"These may be the same assumptions that may lead a policy of differential benefits for single mothers. For example, we could assume that single mothers are rational calculators who will compute the cost and benefits of a divorce. Calculations that, say, just because they are eligible for the Jubilee Marriage and Parenthood Package, these women will stay married. Second, some may assume that the single mothers have knowledge about these differences in welfare levels. And third, some may assume that the benefit differentials are enough to outweigh their desire to separate from their abusive husbands, husbands 	to-be, or to reconcile irreconcilable differences.",9,596,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00596
2016-01-27-T-012,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Bukit Batok),"If we treat single mothers differently from divorced, widowed or married mothers, such a policy might be premised on the basis that the above assumptions were true.

2016-01-27-T-012,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Bukit Batok),"If our assumptions are false, I call on the Minister to consider making available to all mothers the same benefit across the board. Unwed mothers have half the maternity leave entitlements, do not get perks such as the Baby Bonus cash gift and the Parenthood Tax Rebates. They cannot have access to BTO flats or the ASSIST housing scheme and must also wait until they are 35 years old to buy a flat under the singles scheme. They are currently marginalised under our schemes, and more could be done to assist them in their time of need, especially if there are little or no grounds to differentiate them from other mothers.",11,598,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00598

2016-01-27-T-012,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Bukit Batok),"This assumption ignores the fact that these are young men who are willing to spend many hours a day training in their sports, enduring injuries and pain, and with that special talent, the necessary financial and mental resources to enable them to do this throughout their growing up years.",16,603,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00603
2016-01-27-T-012,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Bukit Batok),"Madam, when I first raised a Parliamentary Question on this issue of deferment of National Service (NS) for male athletes in 2013, the Minister for Defence replied that deferment may be granted in exceptional circumstance to sportsmen who are assessed to be potential medal winners and bring national pride for our country. Minister Tan Chuan-Jin, the SNOC's President, has said he would wish to ""push the boundaries"" with MINDEF to see how they can collectively take a step towards including more promising athletes into the band for consideration.",17,604,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00604
2016-01-27-T-012,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Bukit Batok),"How can we help spur more promising and deserving athletes to reach their full potential, to be considered?

Can we have an NS Scheme for our elite sportsmen that allows these elite athletes in their prime to bring glory to Singapore on the world stage and serve their NS obligations later?",19,606,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00606
2016-01-27-T-012,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Bukit Batok),"Mdm Speaker, thus far, I have spoken about exceptions. Whether you are termed as a single unwed mother or an Olympian athlete, you are exceptional to the policymaker because you do not fit policy rules.",20,607,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00607

Since I have been a Member, I have had a resident who has come to see me every week during my Meet-the-People Session. She is in her 40s and divorced.

Madam, I will speak more about this during the Budget debate, but for now, I would like to focus on what the President has said of ""fostering a caring society that is sustainable over the long term."" Welfare spending will have to be judicious; it cannot be a blank cheque, nor a dishonoured one.

A society where we extend our concern for immediate families and friends to the broader community. A society consisting of generous hearts that treat one another with warmth and dignity.""

2016-01-27-T-012,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Bukit Batok),"First, the mental health stigma remains strong in Singapore. We need to address this with more mental health awareness and understanding to build an emotionally resilient and supportive society. There is a need for increased resource allocation to continue the development of services and infrastructure to ensure that we have sufficient capacity and capability to cater to the increasing mental health needs in Singapore. This would also include better understanding the mental health needs of vulnerable populations as well, for those with disabilities, persons from disadvantaged backgrounds, and catering adequately for their unique needs.",26,613,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00613
2016-01-27-T-012,David Ong,Mr David Ong (Bukit Batok),"Last, in terms of human resource, there needs to be a commitment to ensure there are sufficient psychiatrists, psychologists and other mental health professionals who cater to persons with mental health problems.",27,614,2016-01-27-T-012-S-00614

2016-01-27-T-016,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,"asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether measures can be taken to prohibit trailers for horror or violent movies with ratings of PG13 and above, like ""Pay the Ghost"", ""The Activity"" and ""Crimson Peak"", from being displayed in public places which are frequented by young children such as MRT stations.",1,637,2016-01-27-T-016-S-00637
2016-01-27-T-016,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Similar to films, trailers of films meant for exhibition must be submitted to the Media Development Authority (MDA) for classification.

2016-01-27-T-016,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"The rating for a trailer may differ from rating for the film itself because a trailer comprises snippets of the film, which collectively may have a different overall impact on viewers. Where a trailer may not be suitable for children, a higher rating is imposed so that children are not exposed to them. MDA disallows trailers classified PG13 or higher, such as the trailer for ""Pay the Ghost"", to be shown prior to the screening of films rated G or PG, or in public places such as video walls. MDA is investigating the matter and will take action if there has been a violation.",2,639,2016-01-27-T-016-S-00639
2016-01-27-T-017,Leon Perera,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for National Development (a) how much of the Agriculture Productivity Fund has been disbursed in each year since 2009; (b) what categories of projects have attracted the largest funding amounts; (c) what are the criteria for determining the size of the grants received; and (d) how does the Ministry ensure that these recipients perform as expected.,1,640,2016-01-27-T-017-S-00640
2016-01-27-T-017,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Agriculture Productivity Fund (APF) was launched in end-2014 to help our farmers boost their yields and raise productivity.

2016-01-27-T-017,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"About $0.69 million was disbursed from APF in 2015. As the scheme is still new, we can expect higher take-up and greater disbursement of funds over the coming years. Before the introduction of the APF, there was a Food Fund scheme, which served a similar purpose, and which had disbursed about $18 million from 2009 to 2014.",2,642,2016-01-27-T-017-S-00642
2016-01-27-T-017,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Thus far, the projects receiving the highest APF funding have been those that involve the purchase of advanced, high-technology production systems. The size of the grants depends on the nature and scale of the project. Generally, farms can receive up to 50% co-funding for basic capability upgrading, up to 70% co-funding for productivity enhancements, and up to 90% co-funding for R&D projects, with varying quantums for the different farm types.",3,643,2016-01-27-T-017-S-00643

2016-01-27-T-018,Christopher de Souza,Mr Christopher de Souza,asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) whether the Ministry will consider utilising portable airconditioners and air purifiers in school classrooms whenever the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) reading reaches the Unhealthy range and beyond (PSI readings of > 100).,1,645,2016-01-27-T-018-S-00645

Schools will be provided guidelines on the use of the air purifiers.",2,647,2016-01-27-T-018-S-00647
2016-01-27-T-018,Ng Chee Meng,Mr Ng Chee Meng,This enhancement to our haze management measures takes into account the unusually prolonged haze season of 2015 as a possible forerunner of future haze seasons and is introduced in consultation with the National Environment Agency (NEA) and Ministry of Health (MOH).,3,648,2016-01-27-T-018-S-00648
