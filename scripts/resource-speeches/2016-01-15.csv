You championed passionately for the disadvantaged in Singapore. You pushed for fair treatment of workers and fought on behalf of those in need. You sought to ensure that Singapore is a country where all Singaporeans have fair access to opportunities and can enjoy the fruits of our progress. As the Minister of State for the then Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports and, subsequently, Ministry of Social and Family Development, you worked tirelessly to extend needed help to women, families and children.",2,115,2016-01-15-T-003-S-00115

To provide Singaporeans with quality living, our infrastructure and landscape must be refreshed, our economy must continue to be dynamic and our social safety nets must be strengthened. We must build good homes for people to live in, provide an efficient transport system for commuters, continue economic restructuring to create good jobs for our workers and educate our students to be ready to take on those good jobs.

When you first became the Speaker of Parliament, it was a proud moment for many, including the Malay/Muslim community, women and also your friends in the Labour Movement. As a female Speaker of Parliament, you inspire all the women out there to pursue their ambition and dreams. In some of my trips to other countries, I have learnt that the reality of having enough female representation in parliament is still a distant dream for some countries.

The Twelfth Parliament saw heated debates every now and then and words crossed like swords; you needed to step in at an appropriate time to make a decision to make sure the debate and other matters could carry on.

2016-01-15-T-004,Tony Tan Keng Yam,The President (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam),"First and foremost, we can remain sovereign only if we are able to determine our own fate. Our geopolitical realities remain unchanged from 50 years ago. We must continue to invest in our security and expand our international space through diplomacy. We must resist the impulse to divert attention and resources from security as domestic needs burgeon.

2016-01-15-T-004,Tony Tan Keng Yam,The President (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam),"For our programmes to succeed, we need good politics. Good policies and good politics go together. Good policies ensure that all citizens benefit from Singapore's success, fostering a society that encourages everyone to come together in building a nation. Good politics ensures that we elect governments that develop and deliver on sound policies, strengthen the country and bring people together. This was how, for 50 years, we conceived and implemented sound policies to improve the lives of the people. We had good politics because our policies benefited everyone; and we had good policies because our politics expanded our common spaces.",39,191,2016-01-15-T-004-S-00191

We instituted Non-Constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) to ensure that those who voted against the governing party will always have their views represented in Parliament. We created Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs) to offer non-partisan views from various sectors of society. We formed Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) to guarantee at least a minimum representation of Malay, Indian and other minority race Members of Parliament.",45,197,2016-01-15-T-004-S-00197

The shifts in global power and competition for influence among the major powers, particularly in the Asia Pacific, will impact the global and regional order, bringing both unprecedented risks and opportunities for us as a nation. The rise of nationalism, protectionism and the polarisation of society in many regional countries have further exacerbated the challenges faced by Singapore. The geopolitical challenges in the Middle East, particularly the threat of the Islamic State, and the disputes in the East and South China Sea, will remain intractable.

The recent attacks in Paris and elsewhere demonstrate that the global threat of violent extremism is real and present. In our region, the situation has become more serious. ISIS has attracted many foreign fighters to join its fight in Syria and Iraq. Regional authorities estimate that as many as 1,000 Southeast Asians have travelled to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS. When these people return, they will have the capacity to do harm, given their combat experience and networks.

There are attempts by some countries to decriminalise drug consumption and possession, as well as to adopt practices, such as drug-substitution therapies and needle-exchange programmes for intravenous drug-users. For countries where drug consumption rates are high and out of control, they believe that such approaches will reduce the collateral harm of drug abuse. On the domestic front, Singapore's population will age and become more diverse. Traveller and cargo volumes at our checkpoints will increase due to upcoming developments, such as Changi Airport Terminal 4.

We will adopt a data-driven, tiered and differentiated frontline response model to serve the public better. For example, emergency ambulance calls are increasing at a rate of 5% a year. It will not be realistic for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) to continually expand its ambulance fleet and personnel at the same rate. SCDF will review how it can better tier its emergency ambulance response – in terms of speed of response and manpower deployed – based on the severity of the cases.

To combat terrorism, we will share intelligence, as well as support international initiatives, to counter radicalisation and address the root causes of extremism. To combat the scourge of drugs, we will work with like-minded countries to affirm a zero-tolerance stance to prevent harm from drug abuse and stand firm against pressures to decriminalise and legitimise drug consumption. To address emerging threats more effectively, we are actively exploring new partnerships. For example, we will tap the expertise of organisations, such as INTERPOL, to develop our horizon-scanning capabilities.
