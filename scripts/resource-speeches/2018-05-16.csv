2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] The President said in her speech that Singapore has entered the next phase of development. In the past, we can learn from other countries and catch up with them. We are now facing many complex challenges. There are no clear solutions. Other countries are also exploring.",2,6,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00006
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"I believe that, when faced with these challenges, the Government and the people must work together to find solutions.",3,7,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00007
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Take the transformation of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for example. It is said that ""it is difficult to start a business, but to stay in business is even more difficult."" We can add one more sentence  ""Transformation is the most difficult."" How SMEs transform will be a major challenge.",4,8,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00008
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"The new Enterprise Singapore, after helping SMEs to transform, must pay close attention to their development. SMEs must also proactively seek to change. The mindset of the whole country must change as well. The Government, large enterprises and individuals should take our SMEs into consideration when making purchases.",5,9,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00009
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"In the area of education, many countries are still exploring how to teach according to the students’ aptitude, while upholding education standards and fairness. In Singapore, we have tried many different methods. Our education system has been evolving constantly from our generation, our children’s generation to our grandchildren’s generation. Parents should not just focus on academic performances. They should also encourage their children to participate in co-curricular activities (CCAs) which interest them. Perhaps that particular CCA may well be the key to their future success. I hope parents and the schools can work together to find a more suitable education method for each child.",6,10,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00010
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Another issue is old infrastructure. When are they going to be revamped? When are the designs going to be upgraded? For example, can we include the Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats built after 1986 into the Home Improvement Programme (HIP)?",7,11,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00011
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),The population in Yishun is increasing and there are more and more young families. Can we rebuild the older gymnasium and the swimming pool into a sports complex with swimming facilities for children to have fun in?,8,12,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00012
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Tampines has Our Tampines Hub; Bedok has the Bedok Integrated Complex; Woodlands has Kampong Admiralty. After talking about it for so many years, I wonder when Yishun residents can have the pleasure of having a Nee Soon Hub or Nee Soon Integrated Complex or Kampong Nee Soon. I hope the relevant authorities can heed Minister Ng Chee Meng’s call yesterday, ""We hear you, we are with you, together we will make it real."" We look forward to the day when we ""make it real"".",9,13,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00013
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"As Members of Parliament, we often need to deal with cleaning or neighbourhood dispute issues. More often than not, these issues cannot be solved by the relevant authorities alone. Whoever started the trouble should end it. It takes the parties involved to make compromises and shoulder part of the responsibilities. In this area, we need to work harder. There are no standard answers for the above questions. Members of Parliament, public servants or the Government must continue to listen to the views of Singaporeans and work out workable solutions together.",10,14,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00014
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"(In English)  Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to put my vote of thanks to the President for delivering a speech that not only inspires but points us to the direction that we must collectively work towards in the coming years. Our next generation of Ministers are all lined up and ready to run the next lap. And we are fortunate to have a system where there is an orderly handover of the torch, so that the flame continues to burn.",11,15,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00015
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),May I take this opportunity to congratulate the 4G team on their appointments and we would like to thank all those Ministers who have retired.,12,16,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00016
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Mr Speaker, I am confident that together we can build Singapore as a good example of a democratic and multiracial society. As I look back the past weeks, the milestone events from the Select Committee hearings to the appointment of new office-bearers would doubtless show our resolve to continue with the way we have been running our country, in the best interest of our people – that is the Singapore way, whatever the naysayers may be hooting. Unlike them, we are proud to be Singaporeans. Unlike them, we do not set sail in the same boat with the likes of Sinbad the Sailor. We do not believe in “whatever will be will be”. We believe in charting the right course after taking all the relevant readings on the compass.",13,17,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00017
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Let me turn to a hot topic when parents get together – education. Regardless of which school your children go to, as long as they are happy, they learn, they make good friends, they are in good schools. All schools have the same core syllabus and the teachers and principals are rotated around. Not every school can be like Raffles Institution (RI) or Raffles Girls’ School (RGS). I agreed with hon Member Miss Cheryl Chan that what is more important is character building, good moral values and whether the children can be contributing positively to the family, society and country.",14,18,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00018
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),I am indeed very pleased that our Education Minister had assured in the Addendum that his Ministry would continue to strengthen its focus on Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) and enhance Values-in-Action programmes. We have been very bold in the past few years in tweaking our education system to put less stress on our students and introduce experiential learning.,15,19,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00019
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Many of the new ideas introduced are commendable. Students do not just go to school to gain knowledge. They are also exposed to community service, there is a lot more outdoor learning, and even at the ITEs, polytechnics and universities, they are put on internships. These would greatly help to build up a talent pool of thinking and adaptable people as they stream into the job market. All these efforts in producing a new generation of young people. I think our country may not have seen the full impact of this new learning because many of the students are still studying, and the numbers that have gotten into the job market is still small. But I have seen many who come to help me in my Meet-the-People sessions and I must say they are impressive.",16,20,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00020
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"As we take steps to move away from the very staid and rigid old system of education, we as parents must also give encouragement to our children and assure them that the school that they are in is a good school.",17,21,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00021
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Next, I want to ask that we as a community would have to move forward with confidence. We need to discard the “kiasu” mentality. So, we do not have to go around “chope-ing” seats, rushing into trains, or pretending not to notice that you are taking up the seats meant for the elderly and pregnant women in the train. We need to learn to be more gracious. Yes, graciousness is something that we all can adopt. It is within our means to achieve.",18,22,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00022
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Let me share with you my encounters. We have a children playground in a private estate in Nee Soon South and it is very popular among children, especially in the evenings. Recently, a man brought his dog to the playground and used the children's playground equipment to train his dog. Many parents were very unhappy; some emailed me. They said, ""This is not correct! A children's playground should be for kids! It is very unhygienic."" On the other hand, the man with the dog said, ""Why not?"" Which NPark Act says that he cannot use the playground equipment to train his dog?",19,23,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00023
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Another example is that of a man who smokes in his home. The smoke drifted to the unit upstairs. The man living in the unit upstairs was not happy. So, they had some friction. The man who smokes said, ""I have all the right to smoke in my own home"". The man living upstairs said, ""I have all the right to have clean air and to protect my health and my family members' health.""",20,24,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00024
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"So, if everyone argues like the two examples above, where do we go from here? Can we be more considerate and show compassion for others? Are we too quick to point fingers at others? Have we ever paused to think if we are doing enough for our community, our environment and our nation? Can we make the bold change in behaviour, attitudes and so on for the next lap so that we can together have a stake in building up the gracious Singapore?",21,25,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00025
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Help the less privileged and those with special needs so that they too can participate. So, when introducing new policies please ask how this will help to bring down the barriers and let people mix together, irrespective of economic class, race or religion.",22,26,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00026
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"We must review what we have done and look at where we must improve, for example, our SMEs. Are we not able to do more for SMEs? Can we help them to build their track records and bring them overseas? We have a few strong Singaporean companies such as the banks – DBS, UOB, OCBC – and we have airlines like Singapore Airlines (SIA), Scoot, SilkAir, and others such as Keppel Corp, CapitaLand and so forth. But we need to grow more of such ""Singapore Inc."" to boost our economic growth. We need to stay relevant to the world.",23,27,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00027
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Leadership is never so challenged as it is in today’s world. The need for us to adjust to meet the changed social environment has been a long time coming. We will build on the foundations laid down by our pioneers who have set the ground. We need to continue to work hard which is our virtue, perhaps harder than our founding generation as the world is changing at very fast pace. In doing so, we must exercise good judgement and not discard what is working just for the sake of being bold. We must get some basics right such as getting our society to be more gracious and more considerate.",24,28,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00028
2018-05-16-T-001,Lee Bee Wah,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"To accept that we live in a closely-knit community, this initiative and effort must begin with us. We see very conflicting demands from different people, each with different ideas and each claiming they have their rights to this and that. If we do not start to address this ""your right and my right"" issue, the narrative will separate people. It will metastasise like cancer cells. It will wreck our society. We must act now if we do not want to be known as ""a one divided country with divided hearts"".",25,29,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00029

2018-05-16-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"To heed the President's call for us to forge a cohesive, caring and inclusive society, particularly for our seniors, I would like to take this opportunity to raise three ideas about how we can smoothen some of the bumps and ripples in our healthcare landscape and to remove some of the friction where it is not needed, so as to promote more equal access to medical services. As my following comments do concern some adjustments of a fiscal nature, I would like to declare my interest currently as a medical practitioner in a public healthcare institution.",2,32,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00032
2018-05-16-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"First, let me talk about MediSave. I would like to propose that we think once again and hard about further liberalising the use of MediSave in a bolder and more decisive manner. Over the years, I and many others within this House have called for the liberalisation of MediSave use, in particular for outpatient treatments. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has certainly done very much in this regard, by introducing and expanding many schemes such as the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP) and, more recently, the Flexi-MediSave Programme. They have also allowed greater use of MediSave for medical scans, and so on. These measures are effective but can be complex and, at times, may be too restrictive. The concern, of course, and it is something we all appreciate, is that too loose a policy on MediSave withdrawals could lead to an earlier depletion of our accounts, leaving nothing for us to rely on in later years when medical needs and expenses could be greater.",3,33,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00033
2018-05-16-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"However, I am not sure that this worry is always necessarily well founded. If you look at the statistics over the past few years, the mean MediSave account balances among Singaporeans have been increasing steadily, and a significant number do pass on with remaining balances of fairly appreciable amount in their accounts.",4,34,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00034
2018-05-16-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"For some Singaporeans with multiple chronic diseases or whose illnesses cannot be adequately controlled by medicines on the Standard Medication list, the out-of-pocket cash outlay for medical treatment, even at polyclinics and with Pioneer Generation (PG) benefits, can still remain quite high due to the current utilisation limits on MediSave. I would like to propose that Singaporeans who are above the retirement age be allowed to pay for a greater amount of their subsidised outpatient treatment costs at Government clinics using their MediSave. Perhaps, as a start, up to 80% of the expenses, and this can be adjusted as needs arise. This should be subject to a doctor's certification.",5,35,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00035
2018-05-16-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Such a move would not change matters for the majority of elderly patients, for whom the current chronic disease withdrawal limit of $400 and the Flexi MediSave limit of $200 would already more than adequately covered 80% of their annual outpatient treatment costs. But it could make a meaningful difference to the elderly with multiple or less common conditions requiring more specialised and expensive medications, or who require more medical investigations to better manage their conditions.",6,36,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00036
2018-05-16-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Presently, for a patient who has exceeded his MediSave claims limits and who finds it challenging to pay the remainder in cash, he or she has a few options. One, he can appeal to the Ministry to withdraw more from his MediSave. Two, he can apply to the Medication Assistance Fund and other welfare schemes. Or three, he or she could just simply choose to forego treatment or to forgo some of the treatment in excess of what he is willing to pay for in cash. Allowing for greater MediSave withdrawal in these cases can help a patient avoid trying the welfare route, which ultimately adds to public expenditures, and also encourage compliance with treatment.",7,37,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00037
2018-05-16-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"If the patient follows on with treatment, then the future consequences of his condition, if left improperly managed or sub-optimally managed, would be less and the eventual costs to both the patient and society would ultimately be lower.",8,38,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00038
2018-05-16-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),I am of the opinion that further loosening of the MediSave purse strings would not lead to over-servicing or over-consumption. I would like to remark that we are talking about patients here who are adhering to treatment protocols that a public service doctor has deemed to be necessary and who has to certify that it is necessary without a cheaper alternative.,9,39,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00039
2018-05-16-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"There also remains an element of co-payment. Our treatment management schemes have been strengthened over the past few years. For example, agencies such as the Agency for Care Effectiveness (ACE) are now putting in place guidelines about what constitutes effective treatment and what is not. The introduction of the PG package, for instance, a few years ago, with very generous benefits, has also not led to worrying levels of over-consumption or over-servicing within the public healthcare system thus far.",10,40,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00040
2018-05-16-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Second, I think it is just and right that the Government has been absorbing the GST charged to subsidised medical services in public healthcare institutions for many years now, at considerable cost to the Ministry. We are also trying, of course, to shift our model of care beyond the hospital and back to the community by strengthening our primary healthcare networks.",11,41,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00041
2018-05-16-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"While the majority of hospital care is now provided for by public hospitals, the majority of Singaporeans still choose to visit their family doctors or general practitioners (GPs), rather than polyclinics, for their primary care needs. The CHAS and PG schemes have helped to deliver Government subsidies to our family doctors and have strengthened general practice through the reduction of market distortions due to larger subsidies received by polyclinic patients. I believe we can do even more in this field, or in this regard, and I would like to consider or for us to think about potentially exempting primary healthcare services from the Goods and Services Tax (GST).",12,42,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00042
2018-05-16-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"This would be a major deviation from our GST framework, which favours a flat system with later reliefs or Government transfers. Philosophically, I realise this is a slippery slope, but in practical terms it would be very much in keeping with the intent of current policy that already absorbs GST from subsidised healthcare services. Removing this consumption tax from all primary healthcare services could nudge more patients back to family doctors or GPs for care, and encourage compliance with treatment and follow-up, by reducing costs. I wish to emphasise that this suggestion refers only to primary care services and not for hospital or other types of medical care. I also appreciate that, at present, most solo practices, for instance, are not GST-registered. But with the emergence of more group practices and with the increasing cost of healthcare, the number of healthcare providers that need to pay GST may increase in the future.",13,43,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00043
2018-05-16-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"What constitutes a provider of primary healthcare services can be defined and licensed, and this is also an issue that can perhaps be addressed when we debate the Healthcare Services Act later this year. I appreciate that there will be issues with the implementation of such a scheme, but I certainly believe that it merits consideration.",14,44,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00044
2018-05-16-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Lastly, a little bit about insurance coverage. The introduction of MediShield Life, which provides universal health insurance or coverage for Singaporeans, marked a proud day for Singapore’s healthcare system, exemplifying the caring and inclusive society that President Mdm Halimah Yacob spoke of.",15,45,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00045
2018-05-16-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Although a hallmark of MediShield Life is that no one is excluded, including those with pre-existing conditions, like virtually all medical insurance systems, there remain some gaps. For instance, I would like to draw your attention to two areas. First, with regard to pregnancy-related complications; and, second, about conditions related to mental health. These are still not covered under MediShield Life when hospitalisation is required. I believe that we should consider expanding coverage to these conditions as well. We have been strongly encouraging parenthood and it would serve as greater assurance to would-be parents that the mother’s medical care can be covered in the uncommon instances of complications related to the pregnancy.",16,46,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00046
2018-05-16-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"We have also been slowly but significantly expanding our support for mental health, even as the disease burden inches up within our community. I hope that when MediShield Life is reviewed, consideration can be given to expand coverage to some, if not all, mental health-related hospitalisations.",17,47,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00047
2018-05-16-T-001,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"We have come a long way; we have passed 50 years successfully as an Independent nation, and we are now moving on to 200 years after the founding of Singapore. We now have a new generation of Singaporeans and Singaporean leaders that will steer us towards SG100. It is my hope that our healthcare system remains future-ready, and also friction-free where it counts. I support the Motion.",18,48,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00048

2018-05-16-T-001,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"I was moved when the President reminded us that we are an exceptional country. Sometimes, some of us take our existence, rights and privileges for granted because we compare ourselves with other developed nations of the world. But as we all know, we do not have what they have – no hinterland, no natural resources, not even enough natural sources of water. Due to these insufficiencies, despite our stability, prosperity and progress, anxiety and insecurities about our future surface from time to time.",2,51,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00051
2018-05-16-T-001,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"On quite a number of occasions, people I met asked me whether Singapore would be able to continue to survive and if a bright future would remain for our children. One person I met recently asked if Singapore would continue to do well in 20 years’ time. I think citizens all over the world ask themselves similar questions about their nations’ economic and political future, but not questions about their countries’ existence and survival. I do not think any of our ASEAN neighbours have any doubt that their countries will still be around for their future generations, regardless of political turmoil or economic crises.",3,52,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00052
2018-05-16-T-001,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"My answer to the question about our existence is another question. What is our raison d'etre? There are many answers to this question, including our roles as a global transportation, commerce and financial hub. It all boils down to our usefulness and relevance to the world. Therefore, as long as we have value, our survival is guaranteed; and when we add value, we thrive. Every generation has to find its own raison d’etre.",4,53,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00053

In all the best teams, leaders and team members are constantly communicating and updating one another to facilitate the necessary adjustments and corrections. We must keep channels of feedback open and continuously address the issues affecting our people. People have to be able to trust our leadership and Government which must remain honest, have integrity and be free from corruption.",5,54,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00054
2018-05-16-T-001,Gan Thiam Poh,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"Our leaders must exercise fiscal prudence and grow our Reserves, which is absolutely vital for our long-term survival and stability.

Perhaps it would be good to reach out to every household in the low- and lower-middle income with guidance and assistance in addition to the GST vouchers. We have Pioneer Generation offices (PGOs) that did the good job to support those in the PGs. A similar approach could be considered to ensure that such households are assured of attention and assistance by the Government. The Government also needs to keep in tune with the younger generations and ensure that the polices are up to date that could be tailored to meet their aspirations as they are vital to our nation building.,11,60,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00060

The lower income groups are not only affected financially but emotionally and psychologically as well, as they perceive escalating prices pushing items beyond their reach. We have to put in more effort to monitor the challenges faced by our lower-income and middle-income groups closely and policies are updated to ensure that their aspirations are within reach. Perhaps a new scheme or a Household Transformation Map – since we have the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs), I think we can consider the Household Transformation Maps (HTMs) – in totality of all relevant programmes can be looked at by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) to reach out to all these families to assist and guide them to achieve their aspirations.

HDB should or could challenge its present parameters and further expand the provision of flat types and facilities to meet the higher expectations of Singaporeans while retaining affordability and reach.

2018-05-16-T-001,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Sir, for a long while already, parents who can afford it will not depend solely on the national school system to prep their children for education, the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) or the Gifted Education Programme (GEP). They will send their children to expensive tuition and enrichment classes and there is no shortage of firm believers in such classes to deliver the high T-score and distinction for their children. This will perpetuate the message that if you have the money, your child will stand a better chance of getting good grades. The lack of diversity in our schools will only grow.",11,110,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00110
2018-05-16-T-001,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"As for the proposed initiative to promote interaction amongst students of all backgrounds, I must say those interactions are rather fleeting in nature and are confined to small groups of students each time. Such interactions, I am afraid, are rather piecemeal in nature and they will not even put a dent on the class divide issue.",12,111,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00111
2018-05-16-T-001,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),Does MOE know how many students in GEP have undergone test preparation even though MOE has stated in its website that parents should not enrol their children for such activities? MOE says such GEP preparation activities could inflate pupils' scores and not reflect their actual potential. Such acknowledgment by MOE offers simple proof or ample proof that parents can give their children a headstart if they can afford it. What will the profile of GEP and Special Assistance Plan (SAP) students tell us about race and income then? Does MOE know whether students from elite schools are spending more time on tuition and enrichment then their counterparts from the neighbourhood schools? Does MOE know whether the tuition culture here had a hand in helping our students achieve the impressive test results in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015 chart that was presented in this Chamber yesterday?,13,112,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00112
2018-05-16-T-001,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"I am sure MOE would agree and knowing this number is important. Any measure formulated to address social inequality or lack of diversity in our schools must take into consideration the entire education ecosystem. Without this information, any formulated measure would be, as in the words of the President, ""tweaking things at the margin"".",14,113,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00113
2018-05-16-T-001,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Two years ago, in the Committee of Supply (COS) debate in 2016, I said that all schools are created not equal because the funding per school is different to begin with. Based on per capita funding per student, popular schools with a large student enrolment will always have more funds by default, whilst shrinking neighbourhood schools will always struggle to find money to run extra enrichment programmes. It is also a known fact that popular schools will have less problems raising additional funds from their well-connected alumni, while neighbourhood schools will struggle in this area. Does the Minister not agree that it makes a world of difference when smaller neighbourhood schools are resourced with the same amount of funding as the popular schools? Is the Minister willing to do something bold in the area of equitable funding for all schools?",15,114,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00114
2018-05-16-T-001,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"In the same COS debate, I also proposed a fundamental change to the Secondary 1 posting exercise to address the lack of diversity in our popular schools. I shall not repeat the details here, but in a nutshell, I propose that students finishing in the top tier of their primary schools based on PSLE results be given direct admission to a secondary school of their choice. This move will ensure a good mix and spread of students from all spectrum of primary schools going into the popular secondary schools. This will definitely introduce diversity into the so-called elite schools. This will also prevent elitism from entrenching itself in any of the popular schools.",16,115,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00115

2018-05-16-T-001,Png Eng Huat,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Some may question that this is not meritocratic. I beg to differ, because these students, even if their T-scores are lower than the cut-off points for the popular secondary schools are high achievers in their own rights. They have certainly earned their place with direct admission into a school of their choice by finishing top in their respective primary schools. The proposal is still based on meritocracy but at the local level.",18,117,2018-05-16-T-001-S-00117

Globalisation, which has delivered growth and stability for many countries, including Singapore, has come under pressure. Countries, particularly in the West, are questioning the benefits of openness and free trade, and of the free movement of people. The US has been, thus far, the champion and sponsor of the post-war international system. They promoted free trade. They opened their own doors to immigrants. They were generous to others, sharing technology and know-how. They spent blood and treasure to maintain global peace. They believed that all these was in their own ""enlightened self-interest"".",9,142,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00142

The trade tensions between US and China hurt business, but more broadly, their unilateral and tit-for-tat actions undermine the multilateral trading system. In other words, it is not just the two participants who are affected or the amount of, whether it is steel or aluminium or soya beans or cars which is not exported and which cannot be traded, but the whole multilateral system, the system of rules which ensures that countries big and small, have played on a level-playing field have their place in the sun and can contribute to and benefit from this international network of cooperation.

Today, our per capita income is higher than Japan's. We can see it in all our lives. Now that we have become more developed, our growth forecast is moderated to 2% to 4%.

Japan is growing even slower. Second, 2%-4% is just an estimate, based on our current stage of economic development. It is not the limit to our efforts or to our ambitions. Individual companies and individual industries can certainly do better, especially if they come up with a more innovative product or if they expand into new markets, till virgin ground. We are pushing ahead with our economic upgrade. We can see the opportunities. The only question is whether we can seize them. Take, for example, the digital economy. A lot is happening around us. In Indonesia, in Jakarta, the tech scene is vibrant, buzzing with energy and talent. And Indonesia has produced four unicorns. Unicorns are not animals.

2018-05-16-T-003,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"Singapore is still a young country of 50 years and notions of class and hierarchy have not yet calcified.

2018-05-16-T-003,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"Social cues are important because they can become ways to pigeonhole or to exclude others, knowingly or unknowingly. In Britain, your accent and the way you speak, can define your status in society. Do you have a posh private school accent? Do you speak like a professional who has been to Oxbridge? Do you speak as a working-class person, with a local accent, regional accent? Do you speak with a Cockney twang? Then, you know you come from a certain part of London, and you are a certain class of person, not very high up the totem pole.",33,166,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00166
2018-05-16-T-003,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"George Bernard Shaw wrote, “An Englishman’s way of speaking absolutely classifies him"". It is a pun. It pigeonholes him into his social class, you listen to him, you know, do you respect him, do you look down on him, do you give him orders or do you say ""Yes, Sir?"" And he went on to say ""absolutely classifies him. The moment he talks, he makes some other Englishman despise him”.",34,167,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00167
2018-05-16-T-003,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"And it is true, if you do not have an upper-class accent, you are marked down straightaway. And that is why Singapore schools put emphasis on teaching students to speak good English. Otherwise, those children whose parents already speak good English at home will be fine, but others will grow up at a permanent disadvantage. And without everyone being proficient, speaking standard English, Singlish will become a class marker. In other words, if you cannot speak proper English, well, you are down there. If you can speak proper English, the doors open for you. And I think this would close the doors on many from less privileged families. And that is why the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) continues to have campaigns to teach people to speak proper English.",35,168,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00168
2018-05-16-T-003,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),There are other social markers that can signal and entrench class differences. Members may recall the recent fuss over an unauthorised secondary school Social Studies guidebook. It contained a table that had sweeping generalisations about people in Singapore from high and low socioeconomic status (SES).,36,169,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00169
2018-05-16-T-003,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"For instance, those from supposedly low SES speak Singlish, play soccer or basketball and eat at hawker centres, while those from high SES speak formal English, play golf or tennis, and only eat at fine restaurants. The story went viral. Many Singaporeans were appalled, and rightly so. Luckily, it was not a guidebook approved by MOE.",37,170,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00170
2018-05-16-T-003,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"Lifestyle choices can indeed become separators in society, distinguishing marks. What you eat, how you dress, where you go for holidays, what games you play, what clubs you belong to. In every society, people have ways to show who is in and who is out. You take one look at a person, or you listen to him just for a moment and you can already place him. There are distinctions in Singapore society too.",38,171,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00171
2018-05-16-T-003,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"But the general tone in Singapore is one of restraint. If you wear a chunky gold watch and dress flashily, instead of being impressed, people may think you are a loan shark! And that is as it should be. We must discourage people from flaunting their social advantages. We should frown upon those who go for ostentatious displays of wealth and status, or worse, look down on others less well-off or privileged. We should emphasise our commonalities, not accentuate our differences. And so, you see, if you look around the Chamber, everybody informally dressed, discussing serious matters of state. In any other Parliamentary chamber, in this part of the world or anywhere in the world, we will be togged up in our Sunday best, just to show that we are somebody in society. But that is not the Singapore way.",39,172,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00172
2018-05-16-T-003,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"There is a further obstacle to social mobility – elite groups who become closed circles, preventing outsiders from getting in. Every society has its elite. They occupy the key leadership positions in society – in government, in academia, in business, in professions, in politics. Members of the elite share similar backgrounds, interests, and social spaces. They may be alumni of the same schools, they may have done business with one another, or they may have worked in the same professions. They know one another and have interacted with one another in different roles over long periods through their lives.",40,173,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00173
2018-05-16-T-003,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"Such networks are natural structures in society. They are useful for people to know one another, to get things done informally, to share an implicit understanding of the interests of their society, and to feel a collective sense of responsibility for the society. Such networks are an important part of our social capital. But social networks must always remain open and permeable. They must not close up, they must not form glass ceilings. It must not be difficult or impossible for others with talent or ability, but lacking the right backgrounds and connections, to be welcomed into the elite group, to rise to the top, to take their rightful place and make their full contribution.",41,174,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00174
2018-05-16-T-003,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"If this happened, not only would social mobility be frustrated, but soon, the elite group would start to only look after its own interests and fail in their duty to lead and care for the rest of society.

2018-05-16-T-003,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"Raffles Institution (RI) is one of our most popular schools. I did not go to RI, but I can tell you it is a good school. It has a strong tradition of accepting students from diverse backgrounds, so long as they make the cut. But over the years, RI has become less diverse. The new RI principal has been putting in effort, speaking to parents of potential students in primary schools across Singapore, to encourage them to apply to RI. To his surprise, some of the parents told him they did not want to send their child there. Why? Not because they thought their child could not keep up with the academic demands, but because they feared he would not be able to fit in with other more well-off students.",43,176,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00176
2018-05-16-T-003,Lee Hsien Loong,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"Actually, I think this fear is unfounded. Because, in reality, RI students do come from varied backgrounds. And just over half the students live in public housing, 53%. And all the students get along confidently and comfortably. And bursaries and scholarships are readily available. So, no parent needs to worry that he cannot afford to send his child to RI or that his child will feel out of place.",44,177,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00177

We give everyone a good education, and now we are investing heavily in preschool, to give all Singaporean kids and in fact, almost babies as well, a good start in life. We have a strong social safety net, with targeted assistance schemes, so that those with difficulties are not left behind and forgotten. And we intervene with extra help – whether in education, housing, healthcare or jobs training – for those who need it, to enable them to take full advantage of the opportunities.

I chatted with Nicholas Conceicao, who is the Executive Director of OBS. And I told him that when I went to OBS 50 years ago as a 15-year-old, they only took in two students per secondary school. So, in a group of 130-odd, there were people from 50 to 60 different schools, different language streams and very different social backgrounds. And we all had to get together because they had us mixed up properly. We went through the course together, we became good friends, and came away understanding the diversity of our society better, and how we could all work together. Because for 17 days, at that impressionable age, it is an intense experience. You are put through physical stress, you are emotionally put to your limits, you have to work with others, there is very little that you can do alone. And if you do not make friends, you are miserable. And you have to make friends across boundaries.",48,181,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00181

And nowadays, the students all speak English, but still, he finds clear differences in the cultures and interests of the students from the different schools and even in the way they use language. So, it is all speaking English, but different interests, different vocabulary, really different world perspectives, almost.",49,182,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00182

How long a political party continues in government – or in opposition for that matter, because parties come and go in the opposition too – depends on whether it can renew itself, continue to serve the people, continue to bring progress to the nation. If the PAP can keep on successfully doing that, we can stay in government. But if we ever fail, we deserve to lose.

And if Ministers are not prepared to govern, then give it up. Because that is your duty; that is what you are here for. And governing means that from time to time you have to do difficult things when they become necessary. Leadership means you have to explain, persuade, and convince people that you know what you are doing, and that you are doing it for a good reason, and it is a right thing to do.

Then, the government must convince the population that it is raising taxes for a good reason, for the right reason. And whether the voters accept that will depend not just on the arguments, but also crucially on whether they trust the government. Because with arguments, for every right argument, we can produce five doubtful ones which look quite plausible.

He said  ""I feel like a conductor at a concert bowing to applause, but unable to turn around and invite the accomplished musicians in his orchestra to rise and receive the ovation for the music they have played.

As we have all been made aware, a rise in taxes in the near future to support an ageing population may be expected. But while Singaporeans have so far accepted tax increments to help fund subsidies for vulnerable groups, including the elderly, unhappiness may arise among other groups if this were to continue in the long run.

The aim was to create the first autism-focused school in Singapore that offered Singapore's mainstream academic curriculum together with life readiness skills and to cater primarily to students with autism and related disorders. These students are cognitively able to access mainstream academic curriculum but require additional support, such as smaller class sizes, special accommodations and teaching staff trained in autism.",9,330,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00330

2018-05-16-T-003,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"I sincerely hope that MOE will continue to do good work in this area, but I feel that these programmes are still insufficient to cater to increasingly complex learning needs of our children. Furthermore, unless the Allied Educators-to-students ratio is lowered, it is also very hard for these Allied Educators to cater to the needs of working with such a large group of students in mainstream schools. The class sizes, environments and curricula of the mainstream schools are also not ideal for neurodivergent students who have differentiated learning needs.",15,336,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00336
2018-05-16-T-003,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),I would thus like ask MOE to consider facilitating the setting up of autonomous specialised primary schools to cater to these neurodivergent students so that these students are able to study in a specially designed and planned environment that caters to their unique learning needs.,16,337,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00337
2018-05-16-T-003,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"Aside from the environment and learning spaces, such schools could be given the freedom to design their own curriculum, determine their own class sizes, hire their own staff with the specialised skill sets and even set their own fees.

2018-05-16-T-003,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"I believe that there would be VWOs and NGOs like AWWA or the Dyslexia Association of Singapore who would have the expertise and know-how to set up these autonomous specialised schools.

2018-05-16-T-003,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"The key difference is that these schools would have the freedom and autonomy to prepare their students for the PSLE in the way that they deem would be best to cater to these students’ diverse learning needs. I am sure that there are potential concerns that fees of these autonomous schools, if they are privately funded for example, would price themselves out of the reach of students who need them the most.",22,343,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00343
2018-05-16-T-003,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"One of the ways that MOE could mitigate this concern is by mandating a tiered-schools fee structure where families who have financial means will pay the full school fees of such schools, while families who are less well-off could pay a subsidised rate, or they could qualify for bursaries from the school itself. It could also be mandatory for these schools to include a certain percentage of these students at subsidised fees.",23,344,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00344
2018-05-16-T-003,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"This, Mr Deputy Speaker, in effect, helps to ensure a more equal distribution of resources from the community as those who have the means to afford such education would be, in effect helping those who do not. And such guidelines would also ensure that these autonomous specialised schools could actually have a more diverse and varied student demographic than some primary schools from certain residential regions in Singapore today. So, one can set up such schools and ensure that they remain accessible. Now, this I believe is an idea worth piloting.",24,345,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00345
2018-05-16-T-003,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, in the early-2000s, MOE set out bold plans to transform the post-primary education sector. In less than 10 years, institutions such as the Singapore Sports School, School of The Arts, School of Science and Technology, NUS High, Integrated Programme (IP) institutions, International Baccalaureate (IB) schools and privately funded international schools were all set up. These schools and their programmes have allowed students to explore many more tracks and pathways that cater to their learning needs, capabilities and aspirations.",25,346,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00346
2018-05-16-T-003,Darryl David,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"In recent times, MOE has also made an impact in the pre-primary early childhood education sector by setting up MOE kindergartens and mega pre-schools to ensure a base-line quality for early childhood education, while still allowing private early childhood education options to exist. This has ensured variety and choice for parents who might want different types of education for their young children based on their preferences and whatever their children's needs might be.",26,347,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00347

2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Motion of Thanks to the President. I share the aspirations and concerns the President had expressed in her speech and I would like to take this opportunity to speak on some of them, namely the three ""M""s  minimising the negative impact of inequality; mustering the courage to implement bold changes; and mastering technological advances.",1,390,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00390
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I am heartened that our Government is committed to minimising the negative impact of inequality. Singapore is a capitalist economy and a meritocracy. In this environment, those who are talented, able and hardworking will be rewarded. But in nature, talents and abilities are not equally distributed. So, what about those who are not as talented or skilled? Hard work alone will only take you so far. We should also not forget that health or personal conditions and circumstances may limit some people's performance at work.",2,391,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00391
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Whilst we should continue to encourage reward systems based on output and performance as this is accepted to be fair and justifiable, let us not overlook the problems of the imperfect market. Distorted remunerations of varying magnitudes exist, either paying too much or too little for contributions and work done.",3,392,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00392
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"To mitigate the impact of consequent inequality, we must provide more assistance to those in need, especially for basic necessities, public housing, healthcare and education. Funds for the needy have to be sourced mainly from our tax revenues, with additional aid from voluntary donations. Hence, we need the endorsement and support from Singaporeans for a tax system which facilitates more transfers from those who are prosperous to those who are less fortunate. This way, even the poor in our community can afford a reasonable standard of living.",4,393,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00393
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"We also face stratification and slowing social mobility. Our population is now more stratified across age groups and income and wealth. Historically, Singapore has been fairly successful in promoting social mobility. The story of our very own President is a good example and we all personally know similar cases like hers, where within one or two generations, families' circumstances are improved substantially. But as our society advances, social mobility slows and the gaps between different income groups gradually widen as accumulated advantages and wealth gets passed on from one generation to the next.",5,394,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00394
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"As a community, we should start a candid discussion about the strategies to overcome this problem before it becomes too entrenched and difficult to resolve. We may need to modify our policies or social institutions. We should never accept the lack of social mobility as inevitable.",6,395,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00395
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Education plays an important role in enabling social mobility. We need to ensure that access to education is not just on a superficial level. We have the KidSTART programme to ensure that children aged six and below from vulnerable families have a ""good start"" in life through access to health, learning and developmental support. To further ensure that children who have been identified and benefited from the KidSTART programme continue to progress well, there should be similar support for those who need it to do well in primary and secondary school as well.",7,396,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00396
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Though MOE is committed to make every school a good school, each would still have different access to resources and therefore, indirectly limit the academic and non-academic options available to their students. How do we discover a talented tennis player from a school that does not have a tennis court or offer the sport as a CCA? Are we able to nurture that child who could potentially be a chess grandmaster if he or she is in a school that does not have a Chess Club? There are those who can afford to send their children for private lessons outside of the school. But for those who cannot, how do we level the playing field in both academic and non-academic areas?",8,397,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00397
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Aside from education, policies and Government schemes will have different impacts on every individual and family as each face a unique set of challenges. In other words, there would always be groups that fall through the cracks, and we need to look out for them.",9,398,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00398
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Hence, I am glad that the Government acknowledges such differences and accept appeals, taking into account mitigating circumstances and changes in family situations. It is important that all our Ministries and agencies be prepared to make exceptions, but I must stress – within limits – to assist those caught at the edges. Exercising compassion in the implementation of our policies is helpful in reducing the impact of income inequality in our society.",10,399,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00399
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Though the issue of income inequality is not unique to Singapore, there is no one-size-fits-all solution that we can copy from others. The Government needs to continue to pay close attention to the ground, as the price to pay as a result is not restricted to economic consequences but more importantly, could create a tear in our social fabric.",11,400,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00400
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),Another notable point the President made was about mustering the courage to implement bold changes and not limiting ourselves to taking incremental steps.,12,401,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00401
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"We are not advocating recklessness but calculated moves into unchartered territories. If we do not take calculated risks, we risk becoming irrelevant anyway, with dire consequences. What is most important is that we must be prepared for trade-offs and failures and have the courage and tenacity to pick ourselves up and try again.",13,402,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00402
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Some changes would be unpopular, and our leaders must be able to carry them. Hence, firstly, they have to win the hearts and minds of the people so that Singaporeans would be willing to take a leap of faith together with them.",14,403,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00403
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Geopolitics have changed much and so have technologies. Have we made the necessary changes fast enough? Take the field of education. We need to constantly review the relevance of what we teach and how we assess our young. Perhaps we need to revamp our ""O"" and ""A"" levels and the subjects taught. Basic and general knowledge in all subjects lay a useful foundation but do we need so many students studying calculus or chemical interactions in such depth? With the pivot to Asia, should our students not be exposed to great Asian classics, such as the ""Dream of the Red Chamber"", ""the Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" and ""Ramayana"", in addition to works from Shakespeare?",15,404,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00404
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"When we implement changes, especially bold ones, we must ensure that both top-down and bottom-up approaches work hand in hand. This is because while focusing on visions in top-down policies, there may be gaps in the schemes, while bottom-up initiatives may miss the big picture even as gaps are filled. I hope our relevant departments will bear this in mind for our Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs).",16,405,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00405
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"In addition, bold changes require process re-engineering. To get rid of the old ways of doing things, we have to reduce unnecessary processes to free up time and space for thinking, creativity and problem-solving. Increased efficiency and higher productivity are mutually reinforcing.",17,406,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00406
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"We have witnessed how technology has disrupted how some commercial activities are organised and executed. A good example would be how quickly e-commerce has changed the dynamics of traditional retail. Similarly, it is timely to rethink how our administrative services can be organised in bold new ways, instead of just trying to incrementally improve how the existing Ministries operate. This will help us to be ahead of the curve to implement change rather than to deal with change.",18,407,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00407
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"My final point is about technological advances, which are radically changing the way we live, work and interact with one another. We must master these technologies and harness their power to seize the economic opportunities they present.",19,408,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00408
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),Some residents have expressed their concerns over our drive to become a Smart Nation. They are worried about new complexities and being left behind. They feel that our Government may be pushing this initiative too quickly.,20,409,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00409
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I empathise with them but I really do not think we can afford to slow down. We must help them to adapt and catch up through schemes, such as SkillsFuture, but we must get on the tech train. We have an ageing population, but our seniors are better educated than their predecessors. I believe that where there is a will, there is a way. We must understand that we do not really have a choice as we would rather be ahead of the race and not just be in the race along the technology runway.",21,410,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00410
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently creating a lot of buzz and a lot of worries too. AI systems lead to gains in productivity but threaten jobs in low-paid and low-skilled production industries and jobs that are administrative, clerical and procedural in nature.",22,411,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00411
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Most of the productivity gains resulting from the use of AI, robotics and IT will accrue to those who own the patents, the machines and the capital. Hence, whilst we have to nurture more entrepreneurs and technology creators and innovators to reap the benefits and rewards of this technological development, we also need to find ways to more equitably distribute these benefits and rewards so as not to further widen the income gap.",23,412,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00412
2018-05-16-T-003,Chong Kee Hiong,Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Whilst we nurture our own talents and build our capabilities, we also need to be a player in the global transfer of expertise and technical know-how to boost local competencies which in turn strengthen the Singaporean Core. We want to continue to draw investments which create good jobs for Singaporeans, including high tech companies, such as those in the field of AI, cloud computing and robotics. However, we are also experiencing an environment of increasing trade protectionism among nations. How can Singapore deal with this current reality and find a path to thrive?",24,413,2018-05-16-T-003-S-00413
