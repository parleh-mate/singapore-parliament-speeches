The percentage of our Primary 1 cohort admitted to post-Secondary institutions has increased from under 80% to about 90% in the last 10 years, a good reflection of the hard work put in by parents and students, as well as the support provided by Government and the community. Recipients of the MENDAKI Awards, which celebrate excellence in both academic and non-academic disciplines, have increased steadily, with 683 receiving awards in 2014, up from 507 in 2012.

I am happy to share that over 14,200 students benefited from the Tertiary Tuition Fee Subsidy (TTFS) scheme in 2014, up from about 12,000 in 2013. This is largely due to two factors. First, we obtained the Government's approval to revise the eligibility criteria in 2012. As a result, more students now qualify. Second, in the past two years, with the Government's permission, we have extended TTFS to students pursuing studies at LASALLE College of the Arts, NAFA, Yale-NUS College, NTU Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine and SIM University.

To ensure effectiveness, MENDAKI conducts regular reviews and feedback sessions, all of which have led to improvements in areas like student-teacher ratio, tutor training and student motivation. For instance, the latest review last year saw the student-teacher ratio reduced for students in Primary 6, Secondary 4 and 5, from 1 16 to 1 8, and even lower to 1 4 during their critical national examination periods. Following students' feedback, MENDAKI also organised a ""Study Skills"" workshop for Secondary 3, 4 and 5 students, to share tips on effective study habits.",7,47,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00047

Given its reach to the community, SENSE will work closely with WDA to facilitate the community's adoption of WDA's upcoming Individual Learning Portfolio, which can help plan one's training and learning needs. With greater support through the SkillsFuture initiative, I am confident that we can better equip ourselves to compete in the dynamic economic environment.

Starting this year, couples with children under 14 years are required to discuss, and subsequently submit, a post-divorce co-parenting and care arrangement plan. This requirement will be extended to couples with children up to 18 years from 2017 onwards. Going forward, SYC will be collaborating with various agencies to provide more social support services and resources for our couples.

MUIS' commitment to support our madrasahs has been unwavering – for example, MUIS disbursed $194,000 to the six madrasahs from Wakaf Ilmu in 2014, and provided $2.3 million in grants to needy madrasah students through PROMAS between 2010 and 2014. MUIS also supports the madrasahs so that its students can benefit from the Edusave disbursements. The Minister for Education had recently announced that MOE will waive fees for national examinations for Singapore Citizen students in Government-funded schools starting this year, and that the specific respective agencies will consider the treatment for other schools, where necessary.

2015-03-12-T-003,Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Madam, as I have mentioned in my reply, we have been working with the Malay/Muslim Organisations to ensure that these funds which are meant for them, they can utilise it effectively. So, therefore, last year, we re-allocate a lot more to the Capability and Development Fund to help the Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMOs) in the areas of governance. As I reported in my reply, several Malay/Muslim Organisations have stepped forward to take advantage of the fund. More importantly, I felt we should be encouraged that two of them have come up with their own programmes to strengthen themselves. The point is that we need to continue to incentivise the Malay/Muslim Organisations and, where possible, as I mentioned before, MENDAKI stands ready to assist them in ensuring that they can put up good projects that will benefit our community. We will continue to make sure, because the money is there for them to use.",1,115,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00115

Such re-imagination should allow for creativity, new energy, co-creation and ownership with residents. Designs should be created in consultation with residents. Old buildings or infrastructure can be re-purposed with a creative twist. Common infrastructure, such as overhead bridges, can be reimagined for new look and use, without having to tear down and be rebuilt. Arts and culture programmes can also be introduced. We could have art installations co-created with the community or organise regular performances, perhaps even have speakers installed along Park Connectors, ABC waterways, to play music to lift the overall feel of the environment. Take for example, those who have walked along the bridge connecting Harbourfront to Sentosa at night can observe and feel the difference. On a normal day, having a place like this provides a temporary escape from the daily grind of working and living in a highly dense and highly urbanised environment. Over weekends, the stretch can be conducive for buskers or live music performances by local talents for youths to gather and enjoy.",4,145,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00145

They held mass consultation exercises and design workshops with residents and came up with many interesting and functional designs for existing structures or new ones. Residents were engaged and excited, and were forthcoming with their feedback and suggestions. The works were then compiled into a book titled ""MacPherson  21st Century Estate"", published in 2011, and many of the works were also put up as mock-ups in a community exhibition. This allowed residents to appreciate the product of their hard work as well as appreciate new possibilities.

It is not that the majority of our hawker food tastes terrible. It is that it tastes so average. Most hawkers have already gone down the road of generic pre-made factory food in the name of cost efficiency and productivity. It is an economically understandable but culturally unsatisfying answer to our rising cost and manpower issues. The difference you taste between a hand-crafted curry puff from a hawker stall and a generic one bought in the mall is not just sentiment. It is the difference between mastery and mediocrity. Preserve our hawker heritage and you preserve a cultural touchstone of all our pioneering values – a shared reminder that we are all capable of creating greatness even through simple things and simple circumstances.",1,151,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00151
2015-03-12-T-003,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"I want to focus on three practical things we could do to help protect our hawker heritage. First, provide appropriate representation at state level that specifically looks at protecting heritage and documenting hawker craft. Historically, the main reason why hawker centres fall under the NEA and HDB is because they were just a solution to health and environmental issues or street hawking. But these agencies, by default, will prioritise issues of food safety, environmental health and affordability rather than cultural preservation. Safeguarding our hawker heritage requires cultural, historical and aesthetic distinctions. Would this task fall more appropriately under an agency that already oversees culture and heritage, like the National Heritage Board?",2,152,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00152
2015-03-12-T-003,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"Second, do not make affordability the most significant KPI of hawker centres. Authenticity and excellence of offering have to count, too. If we focus on just serving up $2 options, we will inspire more race-to-the-bottom market tactics that you already see happening now  inferior techniques, inferior ingredients and the prevailing use of pre-mixes. We must not lose the plot of what our hawker centres could be – a showcase to the world and to ourselves of our culture at its very best. It is unrealistic to request hawkers to depress their prices to serve customers who can range from low-income to upper-middle class. Those of us who can and already happily paying $6 for sub-standard western seafood pasta in a mall, must learn not to begrudge paying $5 for handmade fishball noodles. Allowing our hawkers to charge realistic prices for their food gives them due honour for their craft and better mitigate rising cost. Affordability of food for the poor may be better solved through a system of food vouchers.",3,153,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00153
2015-03-12-T-003,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"Third, let us accord our master heritage hawkers with national level recognition, tied to both rewards and responsibilities that help solve existing continuity issues. What if we rewarded our selected master hawkers with a kind of Culinary Cultural Medallion? Perhaps, they could have access to a Culinary Cultural Medallion Fund that gives practical support for their continuation of culinary pursuits and compensates them time taken to pass on distinctions of their craft to younger chefs and hawkers. This compliments SkillsFuture's focus on encouraging mastery and mentorship.",4,154,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00154
2015-03-12-T-003,Kuik Shiao-Yin,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"How we honour our food artisans matters. The reason why the world reveres Japan's sushi masters as master craftsmen is because Japan respects them so. Japan submitted their food culture for UNESCO's 2013 Intangible Cultural Heritage List. That same year, Turkey did the same for its own Turkish coffeehouse culture. Who is to say our kopi and kopitiams do not stand an equal chance? Submitting our Botanic Gardens for UNESCO to recognise as a World Heritage Centre demonstrates our belief that we have local cultural heritage worthy of international protection.

Japan also honours masters of traditional art forms such as paper-making and pottery, and a select few are named Living National Treasures. Their mandate is to pass on their craft to the next generation.

We have the small spaces like The Substation Theatre, Arts House Play Den, SOTA Studio Theatre, Esplanade Recital Studio and Drama Centre Blackbox with about 100-200 seats. Next, Raffles Hotel Jubilee Hall, most theatres in the educational institutes like University Cultural Centre, LaSalle, NAFA and SOTA all have about 300-400 seats each. After that, it is the 600-seaters of Drama Centre Theatre and Victoria Theatre. Beyond that, there is a big jump to the 1,600 at RWS Theatre, which is a commercial and producing, not receiving, theatre; and then to the 2,000 seats at the Esplanade Theatre and MBS Theatre.

Energetic youths and adults show off their vigour at the street soccer courts and the various hard courts in the estates. Their demonstration of sportsmanship is good inspiration for children and other youths. However, as the population at Yishun grows, the demand for sports facilities has been on the rise. Yishun is a large estate to begin with. Already, applicants are finding it difficult to have access to their favourite venues and sports on a regular basis.

Finding venues for rehearsals is a challenge for many performing groups. Besides community centres, which are already so well-utilised, where else can arts groups go to? Theatre, dance, and musical groups have to compete for limited venues to practise and hone their crafts. As a supplement to arts housing, I urge the Ministry to consider this request to support our fledging amateur arts community. In return, the arts groups and artists can give back to the school by involving the students in their art making and creation process or provide a sneak preview into their art works and productions.",5,238,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00238

City Hall Chambers witnessed the World War II surrender of the Japanese and it is also where the first Singapore Cabinet was sworn into office in 1959. The Gallery team has been carefully restoring the buildings and all the items found in the buildings.,4,285,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00285
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"One company that worked on this is a family business run by one of our pioneer craftsmen, Mr Cheng. He started as an apprentice in his line of work at the age of 13 years. In 1963, as a young man of only about 22 years old, he opened his own furniture factory specialising in the repair and restoration of antiques. For this project, Mr Cheng and his workers had to dismantle the buildings' furniture into smaller parts, transport them out, and then carefully work on the furniture with traditional tools. They worked on many interesting pieces, including a table that was specially designed in the 1920s for the former Supreme Court building, which has been used by seven Chief Justices throughout Singapore's history.",5,286,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00286

2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Gallery's artworks are not yet ready, but we will have special sneak previews in April and May. And this will allow Singaporeans to appreciate the Gallery's architectural and historical significance. And when the Gallery opens in November this year, we will all get a chance to see some of the best visual art works from Singaporean and Southeast Asian masters.",7,288,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00288
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We are not just building new cultural institutions in the Civic District, but also updating existing ones. Ms Irene Ng asked for an update on the Esplanade's refurbishment which is on track for 2015. The Esplanade will be upgrading its Forecourt, which will re-open in August this year. It will be a garden landscaped with shaded areas and seating for families and friends to gather and to enjoy performances throughout the year. And it will provide better connections to the Esplanade MRT Station, Esplanade Park and the new Jubilee Bridge. Beyond 2015, we are exploring the possibility of developing mid-sized theatres at the Esplanade to better support the needs of our arts scene, and we will consult the public on these plans in due course.",8,289,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00289

We have medium-term plans to enhance the Singapore Art Museum so that it is properly conserved and, at the same time, a fitting showcase for contemporary art in Singapore and Southeast Asia, and this will complement the National Gallery which focuses on 19th century to modern art.",9,290,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00290
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"More immediately, by September, we will complete the updates to the National Museum of Singapore. And this is the first major revamp of the Museum since it re-opened in 2006. The Museum will be transformed by multimedia experiences, public art and interactive spaces. And the slide shows you a glimpse – a sneak preview – of what you can expect in the National Museum when it re-opens in its full glory in August this year. The displays will be refreshed to include artefacts spanning 700-odd years of history and, especially, from our post-1965 years.",10,291,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00291
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The refreshed displays will also celebrate our ""everyday"" heritage. For example, you see on screen the iconic Setron TV, which was the first TV set to be locally assembled. We also have what you see on the right of the screen the National Service (NS) uniform which is the earliest version of the SAF uniform. This was donated by Mr William Oh, who was among the first cohort of Singaporeans enlisted into NS. In fact, he was so proud of his uniform that he tells us that he made sure he washed and ironed it himself. And he did it with a charcoal iron, old iron, not the electric iron.",11,292,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00292
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Oh was motivated by his passion to serve the nation, and he learned this from his father, who would take turns with his fellow villagers to patrol the kampung during the days of Konfrontasi. This instilled in Mr Oh a deep desire to defend Singapore.",12,293,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00293
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,His uniform will now join other artefacts to tell the Singapore Story in a more personal way. We hope that this will help to keep our National Museum appealing and accessible to all Singaporeans.

2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"By the end of the year, we will have a vibrant network of cultural icons within and around the Civic District. Winding through these nodes will be a new eight-kilometre commemorative trail called the Jubilee Walk. It is something which we will launch in November this year. There will be clear markers to mark out the historic points along the trail, and I hope this can be one of the lasting physical legacies of our Jubilee Year.",14,295,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00295
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"All of these are significant investments. Including the National Gallery, we are putting a total of $740 million into our cultural institutions and SG50 landmarks in the Civic District alone. It is an important investment in our heritage, in our history, to remind us of the common history that unites us as a nation.",15,296,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00296
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,Our heritage extends across other parts of Singapore as well. NHB has been working closely with the community to uncover these rich pockets of history.,16,297,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00297
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We created quite a buzz last year when we uncovered a forgotten reservoir in Mount Faber. We are also supporting an ongoing archaeological dig at Empress Place, which has yielded some interesting artefacts. All these need to be done more systematically to build up a rigorous assessment of Singapore's heritage across the entire island. And that is why we have, indeed, steadily been investing into heritage research and assessment. Prof Tan Tai Yong and Mr Chen Show Mao spoke about this, and I would like to assure them and Members that we have been stepping up our investments in heritage research and assessments and we plan to do more.",17,298,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00298
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"If you look at what is done for the environment today, we have a systematic process to consider environmental impact in the planning and implementation of new infrastructure projects. We believe that a similar approach can and should be applied to heritage. So we will be initiating a nation-wide survey of our heritage. The aim is to get a more complete understanding of historical sites and their heritage value across the island.",18,299,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00299
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We will consider factors like the age of the buildings; the places where significant historical events took place; architectural merits; and the social and cultural value of certain landmarks to the community.

We will work closely with the community and stakeholders to pool our collective knowledge and expertise, and put up key findings and share them with the public.",19,300,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00300
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In addition, we will set up a Heritage Research Grant which will fund research from institutes of higher learning and NGOs. This research will complement the national survey and it will be incorporated into the overall survey. With these findings, NHB will work with URA to enhance heritage considerations at each stage of the planning process, be it in the 10-year Concept Plan or the five-year Master plan.",20,301,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00301
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We will also find creative ways to remember our heritage. Ms Tin Pei Ling talked about allowing old neighbourhoods to re-imagine themselves while preserving their defining heritage. There are already upgrading programmes by MND that deal with the infrastructure. And we can certainly look at how these can be enhanced. What we would like to focus on in MCCY is to enhance the software – to bring arts and heritage programmes to more estates, including old estates.",21,302,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00302

2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"While the work is on-going, there are certain gems of national heritage that we already know about.

2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,We have set up the National Monuments Fund to provide funding support to non-profit monument owners for restoration and repair. This Fund has been well received. We will more than double our existing support to about $12 million over the next five years. This includes a new maintenance grant for non-profit monument owners that will alleviate some costs of upkeep and prevent deterioration to the monuments.,25,306,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00306
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Among our monuments and cherished historic sites – and one of the most important – is the Singapore Botanic Gardens, which we have nominated for inscription as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is not easy to qualify for the UNESCO mark. Nominated sites must prove themselves to be of ""outstanding universal value"", which means they must occupy a unique position not only in the history of the local communities, but of the entire world.",26,307,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00307
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We believe that the Gardens have a solid case. They were instrumental in transforming Southeast Asian history. The most significant example is how research and experimentation conducted at the Gardens introduced rubber to the region, where none had been grown before. And, in so doing, transformed the entire region and, indeed, the world.",27,308,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00308
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"More importantly, our nomination signals our commitment to heritage conservation. We are making a collective stand, as a nation, to preserve this green oasis in the heart of our city. This will forever be a special place for all Singaporeans and, indeed, for all of humanity. The process for the UNESCO bid is on its way. We will not know the outcome till June or early July. And I will be going to Bonn where the World Heritage Committee meeting will be held and the decision will be made at the Committee. I hope to return after that meeting with Jubilee presents for Singapore and for all Singaporeans.",28,309,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00309
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Besides celebrating our heritage, our Jubilee Year is also a year to celebrate our culture, our distinctly Singaporean culture. As a young multi-cultural nation, this idea of a distinctive Singaporean culture is still relatively new and it is still evolving. Theatre pioneer, Kuo Pao Kun, once said that Singaporeans have the mentality of ""cultural orphans"" – we have a sense of anxiety in the search for self. But he said that many years ago. Over the years, I believe we have strengthened our Singaporean identity. We have forged bonds that bring us together.",29,310,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00310
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Baey Yam Keng and Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin spoke about this. They also spoke about food as an example. We all have fond memories of home-cooked meals and eating out at hawker centres with friends and family. When we go overseas, we miss the food at home. It is an integral part of our identity. I agree with Members that it is important to preserve our food and hawker heritage and we are doing this in various ways.",30,311,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00311
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We are giving more spotlight and recognition to our master hawkers. For many of them, cooking is second nature. They might not have written it down. But it is in their head and they have the skill and craft to cook some of the best food. Take the example of Hainanese chicken rice. If you look at the recipe online or wherever you find it, you will often find the recipe saying  cook the chicken, then soak it in ice water to get the meat tender. That is the common recipe. But, in fact, the real Hainanese do not soak chicken in ice water. The real Hainanese do not soak the chicken in cold water. It is more difficult to cook that way. It takes more skill. It takes more experience to ensure that you cook it without soaking the chicken in ice water and to ensure that the meat is tender and good to eat.",31,312,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00312
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"How do I know this? Because I am a Hainanese, number one. Number two, my grandfather came from Hainan Island many years ago, and he worked as a chef and a steward in a British club. And he was reputedly one of the best cooks there. Unfortunately, the recipe did not get passed down to my father who relied mostly on my mum to cook and he certainly did not pass it down to me; which is why we must continue to do more to preserve our food heritage.",32,313,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00313

2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Besides food, we are also seeing clearer expressions of what Singapore culture and identity are all about, through the different artforms. For example, when the Singapore Chinese Orchestra performs, they sound very different from a China-based orchestra. You can immediately hear the difference. They have a unique sound, blending traditional Chinese music with Southeast Asian influences.",35,316,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00316
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Likewise in visual art, we have the pioneers of the Nanyang Style and a younger generation of contemporary artists who are experimenting with different mediums and traditions to bring distinctively Singaporean characteristics to their art. That is why it is so meaningful to celebrate the arts in our Jubilee Year. It is about providing meaningful outlets for self-expression and discovery. It is about discovering who we are, and who we want to be.",36,317,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00317

It will celebrate the rich tapestry of Singapore music, from Pop Yeh Yeh in the 1960s to the xinyao movement in the 1980s. We will hear from veterans like Vernon Cornelius from The Quests. Incidentally, they were the only Singapore band that topped the Charts such that they kicked out the Beatles. They were on the billboards and ranked higher than the Beatles in the 1960s. You will hear veterans like Ramli Sarip, Dick Lee and, hopefully, we will be able to find Anita Sarawak, whom the organisers have been trying to locate and have her join in the concert, too.",38,319,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00319

2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mdm Chair, the Government is committed to supporting our artists. We will continue to invest in them and the cultural sector. I should say that this is something we should not take for granted. Resources will always be limited and, from time to time, difficult trade-offs will have to be made. You see these in the most advanced economies where budgets for the arts and culture have been cut back sharply in order to meet more pressing demands. We are in a different position fortunately. Our public finances allow us to invest in the art and culture. I am glad that, in this House, there is strong support for such investments. I am also glad to say that this support is shared by many Singaporeans.",42,323,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00323

2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Beyond funding, we will continue to support our arts practitioners in other ways. One way suggested by Mr Baey Yam Keng is through the provision of centralised services. And as he noted, NAC already provides some of these services, like shared publicity and marketing. There are also outreach programmes that bring together tenants at our art centres, in Aliwal Art Centre and Goodman Arts Centre.",44,325,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00325

Then he read about SportCares, CareRunners, he put Zul under the SportCares programme and, soon, Zul was training with CareRunners under the guidance of national coach, Elangovan.",20,399,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00399
2015-03-12-T-003,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Elangovan immediately recognised Zul's running potential and began developing Zul in sprints and middle distances.

The story does not end there. Zul is now a volunteer at the 28th SEA Games. Just last Saturday, Zul and his sister helped out at our 90-day countdown to the Sea Games. It is really wonderful how Zul is giving back to society because he has experienced first-hand how SportCares has made a difference in his life over the course of one year.",22,401,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00401
2015-03-12-T-003,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Besides NVPC and SportCares, the Community Development Councils (CDCs), are also actively promoting a culture of giving back. Earlier, Mr Patrick Tay had asked about the role of the CDCs.",23,402,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00402

They also manage the logistics of these activities with the managerial skills that they have gained from running their provision shop.

2015-03-12-T-003,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"To find out how to better encourage and support our seniors in their interest to volunteer, we have sought the feedback and views of over 100 senior volunteers. The key motivating factors, we realised, of volunteering, were related to  (a) a desire to learn new skills; (b) their desire to set a positive example for the younger generation; and (c) to escape from boredom at home.",29,408,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00408
2015-03-12-T-003,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Some of the challenges that they face were getting a good match between the skills that they have and the volunteer host organisations' needs. Family and personal commitments, as well as health and the ease of accessibility to the locations where their help was needed were also factors that influence their volunteering decisions. We can well understand that.",30,409,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00409
2015-03-12-T-003,Low Yen Ling,Ms Low Yen Ling,The feedback helped MCCY and Southwest CDC to pilot the design of a pipeline of initiatives to engage senior volunteers in Southwest District.

He was a cash register technician for 40 years before retiring in 1987. As a youth during World War II, he was an air observer volunteer. His job back then was to patrol the streets at night and look out for bombers. Whenever he saw any bombers, his job was to run and warn everyone else to shut off the lights to avoid detection. A very important job.",32,411,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00411

Two or three times a week, Mr Wee lends a listening ear to seniors at the Presbyterian Community Services. As Members can see, giving back is really part of Mr Wee's DNA. We asked him and he said that, ""I find it satisfying to be able to help others in need, and to see other people happy. If I do not do this work, I would be bored.""",33,412,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00412

Giving will become our way of life. If we continue to nurture a culture of giving from the young to the old at every stage of our lives with every opportunity, we can certainly make giving part of Singapore's DNA. On this note, we hope everyone in the House will join us all in realising this vision of Singapore as a Giving Nation.",34,413,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00413

We have worked hard to increase accessibility and opportunities for Singaporeans to participate in sports. This is because there is nothing like sports that can excite people and bring us together.

Our athletes now have world-class facilities to train and compete in. Singaporeans, too, benefit from these facilities. Every day, the indoor halls at the Sports Hub would be packed with people playing badminton, basketball, netball, volleyball and table tennis. Some community groups have also become a regular sight at the Sports Hub, such as the Shin Zhong Taiji Quan Association, which organises its weekly Taiji sessions at the Sports Hub.",2,417,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00417

We are looking at close to 700 athletes for the SEA Games and 100 para athletes for the ASEAN Para Games. Our athletes are not new to major competitions but, this year, the competition will be something special for all of them, because they are competing in front of the home crowd and they are bringing glory to Singapore, right here in Singapore.",5,420,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00420
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"This is why they are going all out, making tremendous sacrifices, and putting extra effort into their training. Amongst them is 28-year-old cyclist, Dinah Chan. She participated in the last SEA Games in Myanmar and, three months before her race, her plans were thrown into disarray because of a car accident. But Dinah bounced back into training within four days of the accident and eventually won Singapore's first cycling SEA Games Gold Medal in over 16 years. Till today, whenever she hears the National Anthem being played out during her school's assembly session, because she is a teacher, she said that she would always remember what it was like to be able to stand on the podium in Myanmar and she hopes to do so again in Singapore.",6,421,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00421
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The same can be said of our para athletes, whose stories truly reflect the triumph of the human spirit. Some of you may be familiar with para sailor Jovin Tan, who is a three-time paralympian. Born with cerebral palsy, he picked up sailing at the age of 15. Even though he cannot swim, he picked up sailing. He used to require assistance to get in and out of his boat. But during the training session, with the help of his coach, he learnt how to crawl from his wheelchair onto his boat all by himself, so that he can be fully independent and he would not need to rely on volunteers. It may seem like a very small thing. This is not about the race; it is really about getting from the wheelchair to the boat. But it shows the tremendous resilience and spirit that our athletes have, and wanting to be able to excel at what they do. That is why Jovin is also training very hard for the upcoming ASEAN Para Games in December.",7,422,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00422

It has far exceeded our targets. We now have about 17,000 volunteers for the SEA Games and 6,000 performers for the Opening Ceremony of the Games.

In fact, he is one of the rare volunteers who has been involved in all the editions of the Games hosted in Singapore – 1973, 1983, 1993 and, now, this year. He was a first-aider at the 1973 and 1983 Games. He helped to coordinate the work of the Red Cross in 1993. This year, instead of donning his Red Cross uniform, he has decided to take on the role of a media relations officer, putting the skills he has honed in over 30 years with the Civil Service to good use. And I can attest to the skills that he has because, in fact, I met him when I was a very young officer working in MOF. He was my colleague and I think he will certainly make a lot of contributions to the Games. With the dedication and passion of volunteers like him, I am confident that we can ensure a positive experience for all Singaporeans and for our friends from the region.",22,437,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00437

These holiday sessions expose students to a variety of new sports, like archery, floorball, futsal, inline skating and ultimate frisbee. When we first piloted this programme, we were not sure about the response, especially for sessions in the September holidays when it was close to the year-end examinations. But we were pleasantly surprised because many of these programmes ended up being over-subscribed, not just by children, but also by their parents, who participated alongside their kids. We will build on this, and also the strong interest among the schools that are partnering us for the SEA Games, to roll out even more programmes in the coming year.",31,446,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00446
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"ActiveSG also works closely with some schools to broaden the opportunities for their students to participate in sports. You hear feedback from time to time that students do not get a chance to play sports in school unless they make it to the school team. I should say that this is not new because, even when I was in Primary school in the late 1970s and early 1980s, I remember I wanted to play football, but I was not good enough to make it to the school team. So, I could not join the CCA, or what they called then they called ""ECA"" then.",32,447,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00447

For example, we recently partnered the Basketball Association of Singapore (BAS) to organise a developmental league. This was for the teams that did not qualify for the National Round of the B Division Inter-School Basketball Championships. Each team could also field more players than usual. They can field up to 15 instead of 12. So, again, those who do not make it to the school team now get a chance to play and they can compete with one another at about the same skill level.",35,450,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00450

2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"That is why we formed the Committee for Disability Sports, which is chaired by Minister of State Sam Tan, which will tackle the longer term issues needed to raise participation in disability sports and for more people to get involved. We want sports to be inclusive, so that all Singaporeans can experience the benefits of an active and healthy lifestyle.",40,455,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00455
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Another legacy for the Games is to have a robust High Performance Sports (HPS) system to support the aspirations of our sporting talents, and several Members spoke about this as well. We are doing a lot to prepare our athletes for this year's Games. But, again, it should not be once-off, and it is not just because we are the host this year. Our investments in HPS also will be sustained – they are part of a broader plan to systematically build up and strengthen our sporting system.",41,456,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00456

2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Fencer Lim Wei Wen is one such athlete who is now benefiting from the scheme. He had difficult family circumstances and was raised by his grandparents. He took to fencing in ITE, but almost had to give it up when he needed to find a job to support the family. When the Singapore Fencing Association heard about the new scholarship scheme, they put his name up, and he qualified and received the award in 2013. Since then, he has gone on to win Singapore's first ever fencing medal at the recent Incheon Asian Games. This is not just Southeast Asia. It is at the Asian level he has medalled and he is aiming even higher.",43,458,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00458
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"We now have 70 top athletes who are focusing on full-time training, with support under the spexScholarship.

2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Our HPS system will also support male athletes with National Service obligations. We will help them secure time-off to train and represent Singapore at major games. We will support and track those with exceptional talent. And if they meet the performance benchmarks, which means having the potential to medal at top-level international sports competitions like the Olympic Games, we will support them in their application for deferment from full-time National Service.",45,460,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00460
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Besides supporting our top performing athletes, we are also engaging our various stakeholders, including the National Sports Associations (NSAs), employers and schools. We have moved our NSAs to a baseline block funding approach, so that they can have more certainty to plan for multi-years. This fiscal year, almost all NSAs will get a higher baseline funding. NSAs can tap on flexible programme funding to develop new initiatives and focus areas. These could include training and competitions locally and abroad with sporting clubs. Overall, funding for NSAs will increase by close to 10% in Fiscal Year 2015, compared to the previous year.",46,461,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00461
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The Football Association of Singapore (FAS) is one such NSA that would benefit from all the investments that we are putting in. I think Mr Faisal Manap asked about this. There is a task force that is looking at setting out the goals and the strategic directions for Singapore football in the coming years. They are hard at work and I would say that their initial thinking is very much in line with what some of the suggestions that were raised by the Member, which is to focus on youth development. They will be sharing the task force's recommendations very soon in the coming months.",47,462,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00462

2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Under this scheme, we have 21 partner companies. They are committed to emplacing athletes on internships, apprenticeships, part-time or full-time employment, and that is because they see the value of employing an athlete. They feel that an athlete embodies the winning spirit, embodies the right values of teamwork and resilience, and they want to employ and recruit athletes.",49,464,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00464
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For example, part-time Judo coach and athlete Ang Xuan Yi is one who has benefited because, through the matching and through this new scheme, we have helped her to land a full-time position with Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Group (MSIG). And this insurance company has agreed to hold the place for her so that she can train for the SEA Games, and even offered an opportunity for her to head to their Japan head office's Judo Training Centre for an exchange programme. These are companies we have in our network, and we will grow the network so that we can offer more such opportunities for our athletes.",50,465,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00465
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, the Government alone cannot ensure the viability of a career in sports. This remains a personal decision and commitment that an individual has to make.

2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"To further strengthen this ecosystem, we have also set up a committee to review the Singapore Sports School. The Committee has been seeking inputs from various groups and studying the approaches and models in other countries. One area that they are studying is how to extend the development pathway for student athletes, so that they can continue to benefit from a supportive environment that would enable them to study, train and develop as an athlete, beyond their Secondary school years. These post-Secondary years are particularly crucial because athlete development often spans late adolescence and early adulthood.",52,467,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00467
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"One idea is for the Sports School to offer predominantly six-plus years through-train programmes within the school, and also with stronger linkages with Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), including local and overseas universities, so that there will be a wider range of athlete-friendly post-Secondary pathways. The Committee will be finalising its report after further consultation and the full report will be released later this year.",53,468,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00468
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mdm Chair, in conclusion, there are few things in life that rally our emotions and fire up the Singapore spirit like sports. And there has never been a better opportunity for Singaporeans to come together. As I have said, it is the first time in 22 years that we are hosting the SEA Games, but this is the only time that you will have the SEA Games together with the 50th Birthday of Singapore. This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.",54,469,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00469
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The last time we hosted the SEA Games in 1993, we saw sporting heroes like Joscelin Yeo and Fandi Ahmad in action. We saw bowler Grace Young who, some of you may remember, was the one who lit the cauldron during the Games. Grace also won a gold medal in the women's bowling doubles event, and we met her recently and she said, ""That medal – that gold medal – was not just for me, my team or my federation. That medal was also for the retired uncle who bowled just a few lanes away when I was training; it was for the cleaning lady who stood behind smiling every time I looked up from my routine; it was for the taxi driver who asked me for tips on what wrist guard was best for him. That medal was for every Singaporean.""",55,470,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00470
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"When the SEA Games comes in June and the ASEAN Para Games in December, the spotlight is not just on our athletes; it will be on all of us coming together as One Team Singapore.

2015-03-12-T-003,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,I would like to ask the Minister of State what the Government is doing specifically to support local traditional arts.,3,475,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00475
2015-03-12-T-003,Baey Yam Keng,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"The Minister of State also mentioned that the Stamford Arts Centre will become a traditional arts centre.

2015-03-12-T-003,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Firstly, we recognise that the traditional arts groups need space for their performances, practices and administration purpose. So, we will support them in terms of hardware. Besides providing grants to the arts groups to defray rental cost, we also help them to relocate to Goodman Arts Centre and Aliwal Arts Centre. We will explore ways to develop the Stamford Arts Centre into a centre with a focus on the traditional arts.",3,479,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00479
2015-03-12-T-003,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong,"The Member asked about the fate of groups currently located at the Stamford Arts Centre.

2015-03-12-T-003,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Thirdly, we will continue to provide funding for these traditional arts groups to promote traditional arts through different platforms.

2015-03-12-T-003,Sam Tan Chin Siong,Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong,"Lastly, in order to better develop our traditional arts scene, we will focus on training and preserving traditional art forms.

2015-03-12-T-003,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"Thank you, Madam. I have three questions. The first two are on cycling. At last year's COS, I proposed building a velodrome for cycling. In fact, in the Minister's speech just now, he mentioned our national cyclist, Dinah Chan, who was involved in a road accident while training for the SEA Games. We need to protect them and make sure they have a safe environment for training. Can I ask the Minister what is the outcome of the study because the last time he said that he would study the proposal of building a velodrome seriously?",1,486,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00486
2015-03-12-T-003,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"Second, in Parliament several times, I have asked for a replacement site for the world-class BMX track with the demolishing of the Tampines Bike Park. Last year, the Minister said that the replacement site will be provided by the end of last year. That timeline has passed. Can I ask the Minister when will he be ready to announce the venue of the replacement site and the plans for it?",2,487,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00487
2015-03-12-T-003,Irene Ng Phek Hoong,Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong,"And, finally, it is about traditional arts. I mentioned in my speech Japan's tradition of honouring national treasures and also individuals who have mastered their craft and calling them ""living national treasures"". Several countries have adopted that scheme – the United States, South Korea, France and Australia. I would urge the Minister to explore whether Singapore should also adopt a similar scheme to make sure that the best of our local traditions are preserved and passed on to the next generation.",3,488,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00488
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, on cycling and the velodrome, we are, indeed, studying it very seriously. It is not a trivial matter because the land taken is going to be quite significant and there will be trade-offs to manage because once you put something like that in a particular location, it means a certain opportunity cost for other sports facilities as well.",1,489,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00489
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As I have mentioned in my reply to the Member previously, in the meantime, we have been supporting our athletes to train in different locations, not just in Singapore but also overseas, and we are studying seriously this issue of the possibility of a velodrome within Singapore. We are not ready yet but the study is still underway and we are looking at possible locations and the feasibility of it.",2,490,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00490
2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the BMX track, that is something that is certainly more immediate on our horizon.

2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On traditional arts, I agree that we should, indeed, find ways to remember and to hold up our ""living national treasures"", as the Member mentioned. These are our master craftsmen, our master artists, people who help us to celebrate our intangible heritage and culture. We already have many schemes that do that in Singapore today through the NAC schemes where we honour our master craftsmen and our master artists, and we will see what more we can do to enhance the recognition of such individuals.",4,492,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00492

We are involved in the overall discussion, and they are looking at what to do with the place, what more can be done, and they are consulting various stakeholders. I would say that this example also highlights the need for us in many of these things, when we talk about heritage, to take an overall approach. It, indeed, cuts across many agencies, as Prof Tan Tai Yong mentioned just now. He talked about all the different agencies that are involved in heritage. And that is to be expected because no single agency can own heritage. It is part of all of us. The National Heritage Board will be the champion for heritage and they will promote heritage in all the different aspects, including in Haw Par Villa, but there may be different lead agencies in charge of some of these projects because they fall under different ambits and there are different agencies pushing them.",1,494,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00494

2015-03-12-T-003,Lawrence Wong,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Madam, we are, indeed, hoping to progress on this particular matter with MOE. We have been in discussion with them. There are some considerations, of course, in terms of thinking about the quality of the programmes. It is not just about sports from the MOE's point of view. There is a certain pedagogy that is involved that is important. Teaching of values is important. This is an important consideration which we recognise. It is part of the whole education system.",1,497,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00497

What we would like to do, certainly, is to go beyond just complementing what they are doing to even potentially offering programmes under ActiveSG which may, indeed, earn CCA points, as the Member has suggested. This is something we are talking to MOE and schools about. It may take time to evolve. As I have said, it is much more complex and there are different stakeholders involved. It becomes more than just sports participation. It is education, and the values to impart through that programme become relevant and, therefore, that conversation is happening with MOE now.",2,498,2015-03-12-T-003-S-00498

Or it can be earmarked from one's Medisave account, or perhaps even take the form of a tax credit. Singaporeans can make use of their HealthFuture credit to participate in healthy lifestyle programmes, such as smoking cessation or weight loss programmes, exercise classes perhaps in collaboration with ActiveSG, or use it for tailored health screening tests or health monitoring.

More and more patients will need long-term assistance with daily living, and I hope that the Minister can comment on our plans to address the challenges in providing these services in a sustainable way, given our tight labour market and infrastructure constraints.

As their Medisave accounts get depleted, such policyholders will naturally downgrade to MediShield Life, leaving the IP providers to cream off all the premiums already paid off over the years when the policyholders were younger. How does the Ministry intend to address or look at this problem?",4,571,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00571
2015-03-12-T-004,Chia Shi-Lu,Dr Chia Shi-Lu,"Finally, I would like to ask if the plan to launch MediShield Life by the end of this year or earlier next year is on track, as many Singaporeans are looking forward to the implementation of this landmark universal health insurance programme.",5,572,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00572
2015-03-12-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Mdm Chair, almost all Singaporeans that I know of are looking forward to the implementation of the MediShield Life and they want it earlier. At this point of time, MOH has not shed much light about the implementation details. For example, many Singaporeans with minor pre-existing conditions are anxious to know if they have to pay the 30% extra premiums. Is there an avenue for appeal if they have reasons to believe that their pre-existing conditions are minor and should not be paying the additional premiums? How would MOH carry out the means testing to determine the premiums subsidy level? How to apply for the additional premium subsidy? All these questions are not answered yet.",1,573,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00573
2015-03-12-T-004,Ang Wei Neng,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"In addition, a good 60% of Singaporeans currently bought private integrated plan on top of their basic MediShield plan. They are eagerly waiting for MOH to announce the details of the Standardised Integrated Plan that provides B1 class wards coverage. Companies are also waiting for the information so that they could streamline the medical benefits for their employees under the new regime. I hope MOH could share the details as soon as possible.",2,574,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00574
2015-03-12-T-004,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How (Whampoa),"Mdm Chair, some 10 years ago, the Labour Movement advocated the concept of Portable Medical Benefits (PMBS) for workers. The rationale behind that was that with continuous economic and company restructuring, workers are likely to work with several organisations in the course of their working lives. Without the stability and security of a medical benefit insurance that covers them throughout their working lives, they may be caught out badly if they should fall seriously ill while being in between jobs, or when working for a company with little or no medical insurance coverage.",1,575,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00575
2015-03-12-T-004,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How (Whampoa),"At that time, the national MediShield system was already in place. However, it did not fully serve as the de facto portable medical benefits system for workers and companies. This was because of its relatively low payouts, caps and limits, and also because workers are expected to claim against their company insurance policies before claiming against MediShield.",2,576,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00576
2015-03-12-T-004,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How (Whampoa),"At the company level, it was also difficult to make PMBS work, because of exclusions for pre-existing conditions and how workers should be incentivised to move from first-dollar-coverage company group health insurance coverage to portable arrangements where deductibles and co-payments apply. The tax incentives given to companies to move to PMBS were also not considered attractive by some companies, given the complexities involved. As a result of all these, that effort toward the PMBS did not succeed.",3,577,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00577
2015-03-12-T-004,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How (Whampoa),"The coming of MediShield Life by the end of this year offers a fresh chance to push this important concept to better protect workers. Unlike the original MediShield, MediShield Life helps overcome several critical problems. It does not exclude pre-existing conditions and it has no lifetime claim limit. All citizens are automatically included and there is no opting out, so coverage is lifelong. With substantial Government subsidies, the premiums will also be kept affordable on an on-going basis and offer good value for money.",4,578,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00578
2015-03-12-T-004,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How (Whampoa),"There are still important hurdles to be overcome. For example, the MediShield Life offers B2/C inpatient treatment coverage, whereas more than one in three workers are covered in the company group health insurance policies at ward classes above B2/C. There are also no details on the MediShield Life B1 product, such as its premium structure and whether it would exclude the pre-existing conditions. The questions of how to move from first-dollar-coverage company group health insurance coverage to portable arrangements where deductibles and co-payments apply must still be tackled. It is not that easy.",5,579,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00579
2015-03-12-T-004,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How (Whampoa),"Nonetheless, I feel that, this time, the gap has at least been narrowed and there is a fighting chance for PMBS at B2/C level to become a basic company level insurance coverage economy wide, with employers incentivising workers to defray their premiums for MediShield Life and anticipated deductibles and co-payment riders, and the Government perhaps incentivising employers to move decisively in that direction.",6,580,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00580
2015-03-12-T-004,Heng Chee How,Mr Heng Chee How (Whampoa),"I wish to ask when will the B1 ward coverage details be made available, so that companies are in a better position also to gauge how they can potentially transit their workers, whether into the B2/C standard coverage or perhaps even the possibility of considering beyond that and what particular arrangements. I also wish to find out if the Government would consider enhancing the tax incentives for companies to move to PMBS, with particular emphasis on building company level coverage upon the MediShield Life scheme.",7,581,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00581

2015-03-12-T-004,Lee Li Lian,Ms Lee Li Lian,"Currently, ElderShield 400 provides a payout of $400 per month for up to 72 months. The last reform done for ElderShield was in September 2007.

2015-03-12-T-004,Lee Li Lian,Ms Lee Li Lian,"In the case of IDAPE, the monthly subsidies of $150 and $250 are too low. This only marginally covers the cost of supporting an elderly person who is severely disabled and needs constant and specialised care. The payout period of six years is also too short considering life expectancy has gone up and the elderly person may live for many years with his or her disability, with an unlikely chance of additional income or means.

I hear Dr Chia's call to fine-tune and simplify our Medisave rules, and so we will do that.",22,629,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00629
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Today, let me just explain. There are two limits on the Medisave account. One is the Medisave Minimum Sum (MMS). This is the minimum amount you need to have in your Medisave before you can withdraw your other CPF monies from age 55. The other is the Medisave Contribution Ceiling (MCC). This is the upper limit on your Medisave savings. Any additional Medisave contributions beyond this amount will flow to your Retirement or Special Accounts. Dr Chia has asked if we can consider adjustment to these limits and we will do so.",23,630,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00630
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"To simplify the rules, we will remove the Medisave Minimum Sum (MMS). This means that you will no longer be required to use your CPF monies to first top up your Medisave account to the MMS when you apply to withdraw your CPF monies from the other accounts at the age of 55. You only need to follow the withdrawal rules as explained by the Minister for Manpower earlier.",24,631,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00631
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Second, from January 2016, the Medisave Contribution Ceiling (MCC) will be renamed as the Basic Healthcare Sum. This is in line with CPF terminology and reflects more accurately that the sum is estimated based on what is needed for basic subsidised healthcare needs in our old age. So, MMS will be removed; MCC will be renamed Basic Healthcare Sum.",25,632,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00632
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Any additional Medisave contributions beyond the Basic Healthcare Sum will continue to be channelled to your Retirement and Special Accounts, and, eventually, will help to increase your CPF LIFE payouts.",26,633,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00633
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The new Basic Healthcare Sum will be set at $49,800 on 1 January 2016. This is a 2.7% increase over the current MCC of $48,500 set last year. Beyond 2016, we will need to adjust the Basic Healthcare Sum annually to keep pace with the growth in Medisave use by the elderly. This is necessary given rising life expectancy and healthcare expenditure, and given the expanding use of Medisave.",27,634,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00634
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Currently, the annual MMS adjustments are applied to all cohorts, including older Singaporeans who are well into retirement. From 2016, we will fix the Basic Healthcare Sum for each cohort when they turn 65 years, with no subsequent changes in their lifetime, so that members can have more certainty on the amount of Medisave that they should keep for their retirement healthcare needs.",28,635,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00635
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,This cohort-based approach for the Basic Healthcare Sum is also similar to the approach that has been taken for the Retirement Sum. We hope that this will make it easier for members to understand and to plan their retirement.,29,636,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00636
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,Mr Ang Wei Neng asked for an update on the implementation details of MediShield Life. I thank Members for their unanimous support of the MediShield Life Scheme Bill which was passed in Parliament in January.,30,637,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00637
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"There is much for MOH and CPF Board to do before MediShield Life coverage kicks in at the end of 2015. Singaporeans need not apply to join MediShield Life. You will automatically be included. You will be notified of the new premiums and the subsidies you will receive as and when your existing MediShield policy is due for renewal during the one-year period starting end of 2015, when MediShield Life coverage starts. Let me just clarify  the coverage for MediShield Life will start by the end of this year for all Singaporeans, but premium payments will only be due when your existing policy is due over the course of next year.",31,638,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00638
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,I want to assure Singaporeans once again that MediShield Life premiums will be affordable. Singaporeans will be able to pay for the premiums using their Medisave. The Government will also help through various forms of subsidies.,32,639,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00639
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Pioneer Package and the Transitional Subsidies will be given independent of income and wealth. For Premium Subsidies targeted at the lower- and middle-income, there is also no need for individuals to apply. Government will use information available in our records to identify those who are eligible and the amount that you are eligible for. But you can help by doing a simple check to ensure that your household information is up-to-date and accurate. In a few months' time, MOH will be sending out a letter with more details on what Singaporeans need to do. We will guide you along step-by-step so there is no need to worry.",33,640,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00640
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,Mr Ang and Dr Chia also asked about the progress of the development of the Standard Integrated Shield Plan or Standard IP.,34,641,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00641
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Let me first talk about Integrated Shield Plans or IPs. IPs comprise two parts. The first part is a basic MediShield portion run by the CPF Board. This portion is the same for those without IPs and for those with IPs. They are the same. When MediShield Life is implemented at the end of this year, it will automatically replace the MediShield component.",35,642,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00642
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The second portion is the additional private insurance coverage run by private insurers, typically to cover Classes A and B1 in public hospitals, or private hospitals. In other words, all IP policyholders are already covered by MediShield today and they will be covered by MediShield Life in time to come. Similarly, IP premiums also include MediShield premiums. There is, therefore, no double coverage and no double premium.",36,643,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00643
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Many Singaporeans also shared that it was difficult to compare IPs and wanted a standardised option with enhanced coverage beyond Class B2 and C. MOH has been working with the Integrated Plan insurers to develop a Standard IP, based on coverage at Class B1 wards. Benefits will be aligned across all insurers, so that the plan can be easily understood. Those looking for enhanced coverage that is more affordable than Class A or private hospital plans can consider this plan, Standard IP. We aim to introduce the new Standard IP in the first half of 2016, soon after the roll-out of the MediShield Life this year. This will give time for Singaporeans to focus on MediShield Life, and better understand and adjust to the changes resulting from MediShield Life before the changes to the IPs are made.",37,644,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00644
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"To help policyholders to make informed decisions about buying IPs, MOH is working with Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to ensure that insurers present their products more transparently and more accurately. This will also address Dr Chia's concern on IPs.",38,645,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00645
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Most Singaporeans use Medisave to pay for MediShield and IPs. Since every IP policy comprises two parts, it is also timely to consider restructuring the Medisave Withdrawal Limits, or MWLs, for health insurance premiums also into two components. Today, the Medisave Withdrawal Limits, or MWLs, apply to the total IP premium, combining premiums for MediShield and the additional private insurance coverage.",39,646,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00646
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Singaporeans are not aware of how much Medisave is being used for MediShield and how much is directed towards the additional private insurance component. With MediShield Life, we will give Singaporeans more certainty, by ensuring that Medisave will always be allowed to cover the net MediShield Life premiums including additional premiums, if any, and after subsidies. There is therefore really no need to set a withdrawal limit for this component that applies to the MediShield Life premium. But beyond this, there will be an Additional Withdrawal Limit, or AWL, that will apply to the premium for additional private insurance coverage only.",40,647,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00647
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Today, the withdrawal limit applies to the entire premium of the IP, which comprises two components – the MediShield and the additional private insurance coverage. Going forward, we will restructure this withdrawal limit. Medisave will cover the entire premium that is applicable for MediShield Life for everyone. Therefore, there is no need to set a limit for the withdrawal to pay for MediShield Life premiums. But we do need to set a limit for the private insurance coverage component, and that limit will be called the Additional Withdrawal Limit. The details of that limit will be shared with Singaporeans later.",41,648,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00648
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In setting the new Additional Withdrawal Limits, we will have to balance between helping Singaporeans pay for their IP premiums using Medisave and ensuring that they have enough Medisave for their other healthcare needs.",42,649,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00649
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Mr Heng Chee How suggested that the introduction of MediShield Life might offer a fresh chance to revisit the concept of portable medical benefits to better protect our workers. I shared last year that a tripartite work group has been formed to look into this. Tripartite partners will be engaging employers to discuss how adoption of portable medical benefits can be further encouraged and I will be very happy to support the work group, if necessary, to ensure that we make progress on this portable medical benefit front.",43,650,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00650
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We also need to help patients navigate their healthcare journey and make more informed decisions. Since 1 September last year, we have expanded our regular hospital bill publications to include ""Total Operation Fees"" for the public sector.",44,651,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00651
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Mr Pritam Singh asked if MOH can look into publishing drug prices. In the public hospitals, charges and subsidies that patients receive for their drugs are reflected in the patient's pharmacy bills in an itemised manner. Treatment and drugs used for different patients will vary, even for the same condition, and drugs constitute only one aspect of the overall treatment. This is further complicated by the subsidies for different groups. Private GPs also adopt different pricing structures for drugs and consultation. Hence, it is more useful to reflect the total bill, as a comparison to help patients make decisions.",45,652,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00652
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Let me now come to the issue of ageing as raised by Dr Chia and Ms Ellen Lee. As noted by Ms Lee, our future seniors will have different aspirations from the current generation. Last year, the Ministerial Committee on Ageing (MCA) announced plans to develop an Action Plan for Successful Ageing.",46,653,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00653
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Since then, we have gone on to engage more than 1,300 Singaporeans through many focus group discussions. Many participants shared with us what successful ageing meant to them, at the individual, community and the city level. At the individual level, many seniors told us that they aspire to have opportunities for learning and employment so as to remain active. Seniors are also keen to volunteer their time and expertise and in doing so, find new meaning and fulfilment in their lives.",47,654,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00654
2015-03-12-T-004,Gan Kim Yong,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"At the community level, seniors also enjoy social activities with their families and friends and suggested having more spaces and programmes in the community to support these interactions. At the city level, seniors also provided useful feedback on how our built environment can be enhanced to make it easier and safer for seniors to move around and stay active, creating a city for all ages.",48,655,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00655

These benefits will be available to seniors for a time-limited period in 2015, to recognise their contribution to Singapore and to celebrate SG50 with them. Some of the benefits in the SG50 Seniors' package include  (a) dining discounts at more than 50 F&B establishments island-wide; (b) discounted or free entry to places of attraction as well as discounts off hotels and travel packages; and (c) complimentary courses offered by Council for Third Age's senior learning providers.",52,659,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00659

Hence, could MOH share what is the current ratio of applicants for home care and community care to the vacancies available? Could MOH also share how it plans to increase the capacity at these settings?",1,669,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00669

These are components in every smartphone which retail for significantly less. The engineering has to be of a high quality for it to be adequately miniaturised. But the two main reasons for the high cost are the market oligopoly – there are about six companies worldwide, three are active in Singapore – and the regulatory framework for these devices. The second factor, the regulatory framework, imposes a high cost on the development and testing processes of a new model and further constrains the process by which can be made available in the market only through licensed practitioners.",6,681,2015-03-12-T-004-S-00681

Another trend that we can see is also smoking rates amongst young adults aged 18 to 29 years are lower than among all adults – 12.7% and 13.3%.

After we announced it some time ago, we went to get feedback, consulted and engaged the GPs on how to roll this out, especially CHAS GPs. We have also got feedback from polyclinics and SOCs as well, who will be involved. The feedback generally is very positive. Patients like it because it gives them more flexibility. But, of course, they hope not just $200 but more. That is to be expected. We need to tread very carefully.

As the Member had mentioned before, it is due to the continuous effort that we do at workplaces and the community. Even for myself as a Member of Parliament, I have often encouraged on the ground my residents to go for such screening. And I am very, very touched in the sense that people care for one and another, amongst the aunties, makciks together, they talk to each other and see how they can facilitate this.

As I have said in my speech, we are ramping up capacity very rapidly. Over the last four years, we have increased the number of day-care places by 1,000 and we are on track to increase the number of day-care places to 6,200 by 2020. Whilst they are waiting for day-care places, the hospitals could assist in terms of referring them for interim caregiver service or transitional care service.

And also in terms of capacity, we are expanding capacity both in home palliative care as well as inpatient palliative care beds. In terms of affordability, we further expanded the use of Medisave for palliative care to reduce the patients' cash payment upfront. So, withdrawal limits have been increased and lifetime limits for terminal cancer or end-stage organ failure have been removed for home palliative care.

What other financial assistance can be extended to the VWOs in order that we might be able to attract and retain talent competitively. More importantly, and also for the long term, how can we equip the social service VWOs to be able to nurture and manage their human resources to retain and to develop them for the sector?",4,955,2015-03-12-T-005-S-00955
2015-03-12-T-005,Chia Yong Yong,Ms Chia Yong Yong (Nominated Member),"Secondly, the change of mindsets. We need to change the mindset that VWOs should only always be run like charities. There is actually nothing wrong with running programmes that generate revenue as long as we do not lose focus of our mission, we do not neglect the needy and as long as we remain beneficiary-centric. Profit, of course, cannot be the overriding factor in our service but we cannot say profit is not important either. Can the Government assure us that when we undertake programmes and explore ways to generate revenue, the VWOs would be able to still retain their charity status and their IPC status? In this respect also, can the Government help to equip the sector to generate our own revenue?",5,956,2015-03-12-T-005-S-00956

The Government also provided assurance that salary increases would continue periodically as the Ministry conducts regular benchmarking of social service sector pay to the similar jobs in the market. I would like to seek an update from the Minister on the current salary scheme of social service professionals, in particular, one, since 2012 how many Government-funded VWOs have raised staff wages by an average of 8%? Two, how many social workers have seen the 15% wage increase since 2012? Thirdly, would the Ministry provide details on the benchmarking exercise that has been conducted since 2012, in particular, which jobs have the Ministry used as benchmarks and why? What is the wage differential between social work and these other jobs? Has the wage differential narrowed over the past three years; and if so, by how much?",2,959,2015-03-12-T-005-S-00959

Better salaries and more incentives are certainly the way to go but there is more to it than money.

Would the Ministry consider requiring such operators to provide an itemised breakdown of their fee increases? This would be akin to the requirement that CASE made to Shell last month when they did not accept the oil company's vague reasons for raising petrol prices because of the petrol tax rise announced at this year's Budget. CASE noted that the explanation was not acceptable and that Shell did not provide CASE with a breakdown of the cost increases beyond the rise in petrol tax.,2,991,2015-03-12-T-005-S-00991

I hope the Minister can give this a favourable review and I certainly hope it would not require me to raise this for six consecutive years to make it a reality.",6,1029,2015-03-12-T-005-S-01029
2015-03-12-T-005,Lee Li Lian,Ms Lee Li Lian (Punggol East),"Sir, I have repeatedly brought this up in the Committee of Supply (COS) since 2013. Currently, single parents below the age of 35 and their child do not qualify as a family nucleus when applying for a new HDB flat or rental flat. They are also not eligible for any housing subsidies. Single parents are not entitled to certain tax reliefs. Single parents are not entitled to Baby Bonus and CDS support. Single mothers are only entitled to eight weeks of paid maternity leave. Single fathers are not entitled to paternity leave at all.",1,1030,2015-03-12-T-005-S-01030
2015-03-12-T-005,Lee Li Lian,Ms Lee Li Lian (Punggol East),"I am bringing this up again because I think the state should recognise them as parents, regardless of their marital status. Their parental responsibilities and their children's needs are the same.",2,1031,2015-03-12-T-005-S-01031
2015-03-12-T-005,Lee Li Lian,Ms Lee Li Lian (Punggol East),"As a parent, I am grateful for the much needed support I get from my spouse and parents. I cannot imagine how difficult it is for single parents who may not have any support and cannot even take the same amount of leave as other parents, to take care of their children. This is not about encouraging more single parents but ensuring better and fair support for the children who have been born to them.",3,1032,2015-03-12-T-005-S-01032
2015-03-12-T-005,Lee Li Lian,Ms Lee Li Lian (Punggol East),"Sir, I find it ridiculous that we are even discussing this. Today, we are penalising children by denying their single parents the ability to support and care for them. Once again, I want to urge the Ministry to consider equalising these entitlements.",4,1033,2015-03-12-T-005-S-01033

2015-03-12-T-005,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech on Pg xx.] I would like to ask the Minister what is being done to reach out to young families that are facing difficulties to encourage them to leverage on the available schemes.,2,1035,2015-03-12-T-005-S-01035
2015-03-12-T-005,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"During my Meet-the-People Sessions (MPSs), I occasionally come across young Malay families facing financial pressure and they receive little support from their immediate family members. I am concerned that their young children are affected as they are denied early childhood education.",3,1036,2015-03-12-T-005-S-01036
2015-03-12-T-005,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Unless help and support is given, their problem will worsen and become complicated, and may lead to further strains on family ties and eventually may lead to divorce.",4,1037,2015-03-12-T-005-S-01037
2015-03-12-T-005,Zainal Sapari,Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I would like to know if the Minister would, firstly, tighten and enhance social support schemes targeted at young families that are facing difficulties, especially those who are specifically designed to help their young children in early childhood education. Secondly, what are the efforts to ensure that the support from such schemes reach those young families?",5,1038,2015-03-12-T-005-S-01038
2015-03-12-T-005,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"Mr Chairman, when the Small Families Improvement Scheme was enhanced in 2004 and renamed as the Home Ownership Plus Education Scheme, I applauded and welcomed the scheme as one which was comprehensive and would serve to provide a way for families to break out of the poverty cycle.",1,1039,2015-03-12-T-005-S-01039
2015-03-12-T-005,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"Yet, today I speak with a somewhat heavy heart. I believe that a good policy is one that has moral weight but not one that places a difficult moral burden on those that it seeks to help. The scheme is generous  $60,000 in Housing Grant paid out over 20 years; $1,000 in utilities; $6,000 in training incentives; $10,000 for employment incentives and $3,000 annual bursaries for children. Yet, in two recent encounters, the scheme has come with a moral burden. The scheme requires families to have no more than two children. Let me share just one case to illustrate this point.",2,1040,2015-03-12-T-005-S-01040
2015-03-12-T-005,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"I met Mdm A at my MPS, she had just moved into my town and needed some financial help as her husband had just lost his job. She needed a childcare place for her daughter as well. I thought, ""Okay, a straightforward case"". We have many available interim schemes to help them. But then, she added that she believed that she was three to four months' pregnant, but had not seen a gynaecologist. She was afraid of the cost and was considering aborting the child. She had lost two previous children and went into depression.",3,1041,2015-03-12-T-005-S-01041
2015-03-12-T-005,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"Over the next two weeks, my team and I made numerous phone calls and a gynaecologist, a paediatrician and even a private hospital stepped forward, volunteered to care for her and her child free-of-charge. We kept up contact with Mdm A but she waivered, somewhat hesitant. Then, in the phone call she said the reason is because ""I am afraid to lose hope"". I was confused slightly by the statement, until I realised that it was not so much the cost of raising the child she was afraid of, but the cost of losing the HOPE scheme.",4,1042,2015-03-12-T-005-S-01042
2015-03-12-T-005,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"Never did I imagine that those words would be so impactful – ""afraid to lose HOPE"". Tried as we did, she quietly went for an abortion. Yes, we could say that the family could have practised better family planning. But what if families do have another child? This was the child that she shared she really, really wanted. How many children have we potentially lost? How can we better improve the scheme that was set up to provide hope – not take it away?",5,1043,2015-03-12-T-005-S-01043
2015-03-12-T-005,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"The scheme has certainly made improvements to the majority of families who have come on board, compared to before they joined the scheme. But I am certain that we do not track some of the hidden costs for providing HOPE.",6,1044,2015-03-12-T-005-S-01044
2015-03-12-T-005,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"The sample size is not large. The last update that the Minister gave to this House was that an average of 300 families have joined the HOPE scheme in the last five years, on average, and about 3,000 families have benefited since 2004. This is but a small portion of needy families. Is there more that can be done to expand the scheme and remove the painful moral burden that it places on families already saddled by many challenges?",7,1045,2015-03-12-T-005-S-01045
2015-03-12-T-005,Alex Yam,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),The HOPE scheme was designed to give hope. I hope we will not allow it to take hope away instead.,8,1046,2015-03-12-T-005-S-01046

2015-03-12-T-005,Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,I would like to again highlight my proposal in the debate on the President's speech delivered in Parliament on 26 May 2014 that the Government should consider publishing an annual state of social protection report to give an account of the status of vulnerable groups to track the progress made and to account for the performance of schemes of its assistance programmes.,2,1048,2015-03-12-T-005-S-01048
